there's assembly and then oh yeah we

116
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:25,500
there's assembly and then oh yeah we
 

117
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,949
there's assembly and then oh yeah we
don't talk about these really low levels

118
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:27,959
don't talk about these really low levels
 

119
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,589
don't talk about these really low levels
because those just confuse people I mean

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,830
I was talking yesterday about how when
you have a Chinese person and they speak

you have a Chinese person and they speak
 

131
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,729
you have a Chinese person and they speak
English uh this is a bit of a stereotype

132
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:46,739
English uh this is a bit of a stereotype
 

133
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,430

this with linguists

this with linguists
uh that it probably has to do with the

uh that it probably has to do with the
 

145
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,430
uh that it probably has to do with the
fact that in Chinese there is not really

fact that in Chinese there is not really
 

147
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,009
fact that in Chinese there is not really
a difference and it could be that there

00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:07,019
a difference and it could be that there

well for lawyers ambiguity certainly is

234
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
well for lawyers ambiguity certainly is
 

235
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,850
well for lawyers ambiguity certainly is
a feature

236
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:58,860
a feature
 

237
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,629
a feature
uh for plenty of other cases uh the

238
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
uh for plenty of other cases uh the
 

239
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,050
uh for plenty of other cases uh the
ambiguity is is not much of a feature

ambiguity is is not much of a feature
 

241
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,450
ambiguity is is not much of a feature
but we work around it of course well

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,460
but we work around it of course well

what's more important is context
 

245
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,490
what's more important is context
so with context the Precision of the

246
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:13,500
so with context the Precision of the
 

247
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,950

context is already different different
 

275
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,270

in that case yes fair enough so that's

276
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,280
in that case yes fair enough so that's
 

277
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,330
in that case yes fair enough so that's
that's a programming language is uh

feel like read like and the big idea

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,300
feel like read like and the big idea
 

291
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,390
feel like read like and the big idea
there is that code readability counts

there is that code readability counts
 

293
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,730
there is that code readability counts
what does that mean to you and how do we

294
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:16,740
what does that mean to you and how do we
 

295
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,590
what does that mean to you and how do we
achieve it so this recipe should be

296
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:18,600
achieve it so this recipe should be
 

297
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,210
achieve it so this recipe should be
readable that's a thing between

00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,790
is that software is a very social
activity a software developer is not a

326
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
activity a software developer is not a
 

327
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,070

mad scientist who sits alone in his lab

328
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
mad scientist who sits alone in his lab
 

329
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,689
mad scientist who sits alone in his lab
writing brilliant code

330
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:04,699

 

331
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,330

software is developed by teams of people

332
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,340
software is developed by teams of people
 

333
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,790
software is developed by teams of people
uh even the Mad scientists sitting alone

334
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
uh even the Mad scientists sitting alone
 

335
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,189
uh even the Mad scientists sitting alone
in his lap can type fast enough to

336
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
in his lap can type fast enough to
 

337
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,950
in his lap can type fast enough to
produce enough code so that by the time

338
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:15,960
produce enough code so that by the time
 

339
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,290
produce enough code so that by the time
he's done with his coding he still

340
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,300
he's done with his coding he still
 

341
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,050
he's done with his coding he still
remembers what the first few lines he

342
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,060
remembers what the first few lines he
 

343
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,430
remembers what the first few lines he
wrote mean so even the mad scientist

344
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:24,440
wrote mean so even the mad scientist
 

345
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,469
wrote mean so even the mad scientist
coding alone in his lab would would be

346
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
coding alone in his lab would would be
 

347
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,529
coding alone in his lab would would be
sort of wise to

00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:29,539
sort of wise to
 

349
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:34,490
sort of wise to

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,150
you have two audiences at once
it needs to

it needs to
 

389
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,290
it needs to
tell the computer what to do

390
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:32,300
tell the computer what to do
 

391
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,670
tell the computer what to do
but it also is useful if that program is

392
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
but it also is useful if that program is
 

393
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,949
but it also is useful if that program is

once
 

405
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,889
once
you end up with the activity of

you end up with the activity of
 

407
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,290
you end up with the activity of
debugging and you end up with the

trying to figure out why your code

trying to figure out why your code
doesn't run the way you thought it

doesn't run the way you thought it
 

415
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,910
doesn't run the way you thought it
should run that means brother could be

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
should run that means brother could be
 

417
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,030
should run that means brother could be
stupid little errors or it could be big

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,040
stupid little errors or it could be big
 

419
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,769
stupid little errors or it could be big
logical errors it could be anything

420
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:12,779
logical errors it could be anything
 

421
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,949
logical errors it could be anything
spiritual yeah it could be anything from

422
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:15,959
spiritual yeah it could be anything from
 

423
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,730
spiritual yeah it could be anything from
a typo to uh a wrong choice of algorithm

424
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:19,740
a typo to uh a wrong choice of algorithm
 

425
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,690
a typo to uh a wrong choice of algorithm
to

426
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:20,700
to
 

427
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,750
to
building something that does what you

428
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
building something that does what you
 

429
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,389
building something that does what you
tell it to do but that's not useful

430
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
tell it to do but that's not useful
 

431
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,930
tell it to do but that's not useful
yeah it seems to work really well 99 of

432
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:29,940
yeah it seems to work really well 99 of
 

433
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,810
yeah it seems to work really well 99 of
the time but does weird things one

434
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
the time but does weird things one
 

435
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,670
the time but does weird things one
percent of the time on some edge cases

437
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,490

that's pretty much all software nowadays

438
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,500
that's pretty much all software nowadays
 

439
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,889
that's pretty much all software nowadays
all good software right well yeah for

440
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:39,899
all good software right well yeah for
 

441
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,430
all good software right well yeah for
for bad software that that 99 goes down

442
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
for bad software that that 99 goes down
 

443
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,470
for bad software that that 99 goes down
a lot so but it's not just about the

444
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
a lot so but it's not just about the
 

445
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,509
a lot so but it's not just about the
complexity of the program it's like you

446
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
complexity of the program it's like you
 

447
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,509
complexity of the program it's like you
said it is a social endeavor

448
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:50,519
said it is a social endeavor
 

449
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,509
said it is a social endeavor
in that you're constantly improving that

00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
in that you're constantly improving that
 

451
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,090
in that you're constantly improving that
recipe for the cherry pie but you're

00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,100
recipe for the cherry pie but you're
 

453
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,449
recipe for the cherry pie but you're
sort of you're in a group of people

00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:58,459
sort of you're in a group of people
 

455
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,550
sort of you're in a group of people
improving that recipe or the mad

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
improving that recipe or the mad
 

457
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,610
improving that recipe or the mad
scientist is improving the recipe that

458
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:04,620
scientist is improving the recipe that
 

459
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,430
scientist is improving the recipe that
he created a year ago and making it

460
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
he created a year ago and making it
 

461
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,509
he created a year ago and making it
better

462
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:08,519
better
 

463
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,930

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:17,820
some decoration on his pie or icing or

some decoration on his pie or icing or
so there's broad philosophical things

470
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
so there's broad philosophical things
 

471
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,970
so there's broad philosophical things
and there's specific advice on style so

472
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:22,980
and there's specific advice on style so
 

473
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,470
and there's specific advice on style so
first of all the thing that people first

experience when they look up python
 

477
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,990

there is a it is very readable
 

479
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,449
there is a it is very readable
but there's also like a spatial

480
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:32,459
but there's also like a spatial
 

481
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,070
but there's also like a spatial
structure to it

482
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,080
structure to it
 

483
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,710
structure to it
can you explain the indentation style of

484
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
can you explain the indentation style of
 

485
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,650
can you explain the indentation style of
python and what is the magic to it space

486
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
python and what is the magic to it space

bases are important for readability of

488
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
bases are important for readability of
 

489
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,269
bases are important for readability of
any kind of text

490
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:44,279
any kind of text
 

491
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,509
any kind of text
if you take a cookbook recipe

492
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
if you take a cookbook recipe
 

493
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,889
if you take a cookbook recipe
and you remove all the sort of

494
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:51,899
and you remove all the sort of
 

495
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,610
and you remove all the sort of
all the bullets and other markup

496
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:55,620
all the bullets and other markup
 

497
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,470
all the bullets and other markup
and you just crunch all the text

498
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:57,480
and you just crunch all the text
 

499
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,210
and you just crunch all the text
together maybe you leave the spaces

500
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,220
together maybe you leave the spaces
 

501
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,769
together maybe you leave the spaces
between the words but that's all you

502
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:00,779
between the words but that's all you
 

503
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,930
between the words but that's all you
leave

504

figure out oh what are the ingredients
 

509
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,350
figure out oh what are the ingredients

510
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
and what are the steps
 

511
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,509
and what are the steps
and where does this step end and the

and where does this step end and the
 

513
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,670

next step begin you're going to have a
 

515
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,710
next step begin you're going to have a

uh there's a standard notation the

532
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
uh there's a standard notation the
 

533
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,550
uh there's a standard notation the
there's there's shortcuts so that you

534
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
there's there's shortcuts so that you
 

535
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,790
there's there's shortcuts so that you
don't have to sort of write two

536
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
don't have to sort of write two
 

537
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,949
don't have to sort of write two
sentences on how you have to cut the

538
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
sentences on how you have to cut the
 

539
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,750
sentences on how you have to cut the
onion because there are only three ways

540
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
onion because there are only three ways

like that
 

547
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,930
like that
right none of my examples make any sense

548
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:53,940
right none of my examples make any sense
 

549
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,370
right none of my examples make any sense
to real Cooks of course but yeah

550
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,380
to real Cooks of course but yeah

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:01,800
metaphor of cooking I love it
 

555
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,069
metaphor of cooking I love it
um but there is a strictness to the

556
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
um but there is a strictness to the
 

557
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,889
um but there is a strictness to the
spacing that python defines so there's

558
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:06,899
spacing that python defines so there's
 

559
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,150
spacing that python defines so there's
some

560
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
some
 

561
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,370
some
a looser thing some stricter things but

562
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,380
a looser thing some stricter things but
 

563
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,530
a looser thing some stricter things but
the four spaces for the

564
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,540
the four spaces for the
 

565
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,329
the four spaces for the
for the indentation is really

566
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:14,339
for the indentation is really
 

567
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,430
for the indentation is really
interesting it it really

568
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,440
interesting it it really
 

569
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,350
interesting it it really
um it really defines what the language

570
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,360
um it really defines what the language
 

571
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,170
um it really defines what the language
looks and feels like because indentation

572
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:21,180
looks and feels like because indentation
 

573
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,410
looks and feels like because indentation
sort of taking a block of text and then

574
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,420
sort of taking a block of text and then
 

575
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,230
sort of taking a block of text and then
having inside that block of text

576
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,240
having inside that block of text
 

577
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,990
having inside that block of text
a smaller block of text that is indented

578
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
a smaller block of text that is indented
 

579
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,110
a smaller block of text that is indented
further as sort of a group it's it's

580
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
further as sort of a group it's it's
 

581
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,190
further as sort of a group it's it's
it's like you have a a bulleted list

582
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
it's like you have a a bulleted list
 

583
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,130
it's like you have a a bulleted list
in a complex business document and

584
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,140
in a complex business document and
 

585
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,290
in a complex business document and
inside some of the bullets are other

586
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:42,300
inside some of the bullets are other
 

587
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,610
inside some of the bullets are other
bulleted lists you will indent those too

588
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:45,620
bulleted lists you will indent those too
 

589
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,710
bulleted lists you will indent those too
if each bulleted list is indented

590
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
if each bulleted list is indented
 

591
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,650
if each bulleted list is indented
several inches then at two levels deep

592
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:51,660
several inches then at two levels deep
 

593
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,530
several inches then at two levels deep
there's no no space left on the page to

594
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,540
there's no no space left on the page to
 

595
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,810
there's no no space left on the page to
put any of the words of the text so you

596
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:56,820
put any of the words of the text so you
 

597
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,910
put any of the words of the text so you
can't indent too far on the other hand

598
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:58,920
can't indent too far on the other hand
 

599
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,449
can't indent too far on the other hand
if you don't indent at all you can tell

600
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:02,459
if you don't indent at all you can tell
 

601
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,550
if you don't indent at all you can tell
whether something is a top level bullet

602
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
whether something is a top level bullet
 

603
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,290
whether something is a top level bullet
or a second level bullet or a third

604
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,300
or a second level bullet or a third
 

605
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,690
or a second level bullet or a third
level bullet so you have to have

606
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:08,700
level bullet so you have to have
 

607
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,970
level bullet so you have to have
some compromise and uh based on Ancient

608
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:13,980
some compromise and uh based on Ancient
 

609
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,430
some compromise and uh based on Ancient
conventions

610
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
conventions
 

611
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,470
conventions
and the sort of the typical width of a

612
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
and the sort of the typical width of a
 

613
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,870
and the sort of the typical width of a
computer screen in the 80s

614
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
computer screen in the 80s
 

615
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,730
computer screen in the 80s
uh and all sorts of things sort of

616
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:25,740

 

617
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,730

we we came up with sort of four spaces

618
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:28,740
we we came up with sort of four spaces
 

619
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,670
we we came up with sort of four spaces
as a compromise I mean there there are

620
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
as a compromise I mean there there are
 

621
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,250
as a compromise I mean there there are
groups there are large groups of people

622
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,260
groups there are large groups of people
 

623
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,910
groups there are large groups of people
who code with uh two spaces per indent

624
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
who code with uh two spaces per indent
 

625
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,970
who code with uh two spaces per indent
level for example the Google style guide

626
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:40,980
level for example the Google style guide
 

627
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,730
level for example the Google style guide
uh all the Google python code and I

628
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:43,740
uh all the Google python code and I
 

629
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,170
uh all the Google python code and I
think also all the Google C plus plus

630
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,180
think also all the Google C plus plus
 

631
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,509
think also all the Google C plus plus
code is indented with only two spaces

632
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
code is indented with only two spaces
 

633
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,870
code is indented with only two spaces
per block if you're not used to that

634
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:49,880
per block if you're not used to that
 

635
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,990
per block if you're not used to that
it's harder to at a glance

636
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
it's harder to at a glance
 

637
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,810
it's harder to at a glance
understand the code because the the sort

638
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:56,820
understand the code because the the sort
 

639
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,150
understand the code because the the sort
of the the high level structure is

640
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,160
of the the high level structure is
 

641
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,550
of the the high level structure is
determined by the indentation on the

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,560
determined by the indentation on the
 

643
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,050
determined by the indentation on the

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:12,179

827
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,669
versus fewer or more
and we sort of came up with

828
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
and we sort of came up with
 

829
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,669
and we sort of came up with
a recommended standard and sort of

a recommended standard and sort of

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,250
it didn't quite fit into my
understanding of why this is good for a

976
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,260
understanding of why this is good for a
 

977
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,470
understanding of why this is good for a
programming language I'm not sure if you

978
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:39,480
programming language I'm not sure if you
 

979
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,510
programming language I'm not sure if you
ever thought about that one

980
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
ever thought about that one
 

981
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,529
ever thought about that one
that is a historical thing there is a

982
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:45,539
that is a historical thing there is a
 

983
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,710
that is a historical thing there is a
whole lineage of programming languages

984
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:47,720
whole lineage of programming languages
 

985
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,190
whole lineage of programming languages
PHP is one Pearl was one

986
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200
PHP is one Pearl was one
 

987
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,230
PHP is one Pearl was one
on the union shell

988
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
on the union shell
 

989
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,590
on the union shell
uh is one of the oldest or or all the

990
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
uh is one of the oldest or or all the
 

991
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,330
uh is one of the oldest or or all the
different shells

992
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,340
different shells
 

993
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,289
different shells
the dollar was invented for that purpose

994
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:03,299
the dollar was invented for that purpose
 

995
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,710
the dollar was invented for that purpose
because a very earliest shells had a

996
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
because a very earliest shells had a
 

997
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,510
because a very earliest shells had a
notion of scripting but they did not

998
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:08,520
notion of scripting but they did not
 

999
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,789
notion of scripting but they did not
have a notion of parameterizing the

1000
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
have a notion of parameterizing the
 

1001
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,690
have a notion of parameterizing the
scripting

1002
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:11,700
scripting
 

1003
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,990
scripting
right and so a script is just a few

1004
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,000
right and so a script is just a few
 

1005
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,850
right and so a script is just a few
lines of text

1006
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:16,860
lines of text
 

1007
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,310
lines of text
where each line of text is a command

1008
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,320
where each line of text is a command
 

1009
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,909
where each line of text is a command
that is read by a very primitive command

1010
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
that is read by a very primitive command
 

1011
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,970
that is read by a very primitive command
processor that then sort of takes the

1012
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:25,980
processor that then sort of takes the
 

1013
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,010
processor that then sort of takes the
first word on the line as the name of a

1014
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,020
first word on the line as the name of a
 

1015
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,310
first word on the line as the name of a
program and passes all the all the rest

1016
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:31,320
program and passes all the all the rest
 

1017
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,330
program and passes all the all the rest
of the line as text into the program for

1018
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:35,340
of the line as text into the program for
 

1019
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,070
of the line as text into the program for
the program to figure out what to do

1020
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,080
the program to figure out what to do
 

1021
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,470
the program to figure out what to do
with as arguments

1022
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:39,480
with as arguments
 

1023
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,710
with as arguments
and so by the time scripting was

1024
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
and so by the time scripting was
 

1025
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,289
and so by the time scripting was
slightly more mature than the very first

1026
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:45,299
slightly more mature than the very first
 

1027
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,370
slightly more mature than the very first
script

1028
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,380
script
 

1029
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,490
script
there was a convention that just like

1030
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:49,500
there was a convention that just like
 

1031
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,230
there was a convention that just like
the first word of line is uh the name of

1032
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
the first word of line is uh the name of
 

1033
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,049
the first word of line is uh the name of
the program the following words

1034
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:57,059
the program the following words
 

1035
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,730
the program the following words
uh could be names of files

1036
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:00,740
uh could be names of files
 

1037
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,890
uh could be names of files
input.text

1038
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:02,900
input.text
 

1039
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,990
input.text
output.html things like that

1040
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
output.html things like that
 

1041
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,649
output.html things like that
the next thing that happens is oh it

1042
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:09,659
the next thing that happens is oh it
 

1043
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,630
the next thing that happens is oh it
would actually be really nice if we

1044
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:11,640
would actually be really nice if we
 

1045
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,789
would actually be really nice if we
could have variables and especially

1046
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:13,799
could have variables and especially
 

1047
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,370
could have variables and especially
parameters for scripts parameters are

1048
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:16,380
parameters for scripts parameters are
 

1049
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,730
parameters for scripts parameters are
usually what starts this process

1050
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:19,740
usually what starts this process
 

1051
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,250
usually what starts this process
but now you have a problem because you

1052
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:22,260
but now you have a problem because you
 

1053
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,510
but now you have a problem because you
can't just

1054
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
can't just
 

1055
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,350
can't just
say the parameters are x y and z

1056
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
say the parameters are x y and z
 

1057
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,070
say the parameters are x y and z
and so now we we call say let's say x is

1058
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,080
and so now we we call say let's say x is
 

1059
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,470
and so now we we call say let's say x is
the input file and Y is the output file

1060
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,480
the input file and Y is the output file
 

1061
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,169
the input file and Y is the output file
and let's forget about Z for now I have

1062
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:36,179
and let's forget about Z for now I have
 

1063
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,490
and let's forget about Z for now I have
my program

1064
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:37,500
my program
 

1065
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,310
my program
and I write program X Y well that

1066
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
and I write program X Y well that
 

1067
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,870
and I write program X Y well that
already has a meaning because that

1068
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:41,880
already has a meaning because that
 

1069
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,669
already has a meaning because that
presumably means

1070
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
presumably means
 

1071
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,210
presumably means
X itself is the file

1072
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,220
X itself is the file
 

1073
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,669
X itself is the file
it's a file name it's not a variable

1074
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
it's a file name it's not a variable
 

1075
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,590
it's a file name it's not a variable
name

1076
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
name
 

1077
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,990
name
uh and so

1078
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
uh and so
 

1079
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,750
uh and so
the inventors of of things like the

1080
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:56,760
the inventors of of things like the
 

1081
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,850
the inventors of of things like the
unique shell and I'm sure job command

1082
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:58,860
unique shell and I'm sure job command
 

1083
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,390
unique shell and I'm sure job command
language in at IBM before that

1084
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
language in at IBM before that
 

1085
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,950
language in at IBM before that
uh

1086
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:03,960
uh
 

1087
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,870
uh
had to use

1088
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
had to use
 

1089
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,630
had to use
something that made it clear to the

1090
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
something that made it clear to the
 

1091
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,789
something that made it clear to the
script processor

1092
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
script processor
 

1093
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,850
script processor
here is an X that is not actually the

1094
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:13,860
here is an X that is not actually the
 

1095
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,649
here is an X that is not actually the
name of a file which you just pass

1096
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:15,659
name of a file which you just pass
 

1097
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,830
name of a file which you just pass
through to the to the program you're

1098
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:18,840
through to the to the program you're
 

1099
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,710
through to the to the program you're
running here is an X that is the name of

1100
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:21,720
running here is an X that is the name of
 

1101
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,110
running here is an X that is the name of
a variable yeah and

1102
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,120
a variable yeah and
 

1103
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,010
a variable yeah and
when you're writing a script processor

1104
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,020
when you're writing a script processor
 

1105
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,710
when you're writing a script processor
you try to keep it as simple as possible

1106
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
you try to keep it as simple as possible
 

1107
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,770
you try to keep it as simple as possible
because at as certainly in the 50s and

1108
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:33,780
because at as certainly in the 50s and
 

1109
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,110
because at as certainly in the 50s and
60s

1110
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
60s
 

1111
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,970
60s
uh the thing that interprets the script

1112
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:37,980
uh the thing that interprets the script
 

1113
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,549
uh the thing that interprets the script
was itself a very had to be a very small

1114
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
was itself a very had to be a very small
 

1115
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,710
was itself a very had to be a very small
program because it had to fit in a very

1116
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
program because it had to fit in a very
 

1117
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,490
program because it had to fit in a very
small part of memory and so saying oh

1118
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:46,500
small part of memory and so saying oh
 

1119
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,370
small part of memory and so saying oh
just look at each character and if you

1120
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:49,380
just look at each character and if you
 

1121
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,010
just look at each character and if you
see a dollar sign you jump to another

1122
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,020
see a dollar sign you jump to another
 

1123
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,169
see a dollar sign you jump to another
section of the code and then you gobble

1124
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:54,179
section of the code and then you gobble
 

1125
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,149
section of the code and then you gobble
up characters or say until the next

1126
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
up characters or say until the next
 

1127
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,669
up characters or say until the next
space or something and you say that's

1128
00:24:58,669 --> 00:24:58,679
space or something and you say that's
 

1129
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,350
space or something and you say that's
the variable name

1130
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,360
the variable name
 

1131
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,610
the variable name
and so it was was sort of

1132
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:03,620
and so it was was sort of
 

1133
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,529
and so it was was sort of
invented as

1134
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:06,539
invented as
 

1135
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,649
invented as
a clever way to make parsing of things

1136
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:09,659
a clever way to make parsing of things
 

1137
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,110
a clever way to make parsing of things
that contain but contain both variable

1138
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,120
that contain but contain both variable
 

1139
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,909
that contain but contain both variable
and fixed parts

1140
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
and fixed parts
 

1141
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,909
and fixed parts
very easy in a very simple script

1142
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:16,919
very easy in a very simple script
 

1143
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,390
very easy in a very simple script
processor it also helps even then it

1144
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
processor it also helps even then it
 

1145
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,310
processor it also helps even then it
also helps the human

1146
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
also helps the human
 

1147
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,730
also helps the human
author and the human reader of the

1148
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:25,740
author and the human reader of the
 

1149
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,769
author and the human reader of the
the script

1150
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:27,779
the script
 

1151
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,169
the script
to quickly see oh

1152
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:30,179
to quickly see oh
 

1153
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,750
to quickly see oh
20 lines down in the script I see a

1154
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:32,760
20 lines down in the script I see a
 

1155
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,269
20 lines down in the script I see a
reference to x y z Oh it has a dollar in

1156
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
reference to x y z Oh it has a dollar in
 

1157
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,430
reference to x y z Oh it has a dollar in
front of it so now we know that x y z

1158
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
front of it so now we know that x y z
 

1159
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,289
front of it so now we know that x y z
must be one of the parameters of the

1160
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:39,299
must be one of the parameters of the
 

1161
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,510
must be one of the parameters of the
script well this is fascinating several

1162
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
script well this is fascinating several
 

1163
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,490
script well this is fascinating several
things to say which is

1164
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:43,500
things to say which is
 

1165
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,010
things to say which is
the leftovers from the simple script

1166
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,020
the leftovers from the simple script
 

1167
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,830
the leftovers from the simple script
processor languages are now in code

1168
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:48,840
processor languages are now in code
 

1169
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,710
processor languages are now in code
bases like behind Facebook or behind

1170
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:51,720
bases like behind Facebook or behind
 

1171
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,630
bases like behind Facebook or behind
most of the back end I think php's

1172
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:53,640
most of the back end I think php's
 

1173
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,250
most of the back end I think php's
probably still runs most of the back end

1174
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,260
probably still runs most of the back end
 

1175
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,289
probably still runs most of the back end
of the internet oh yeah yeah I think

1176
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:57,299
of the internet oh yeah yeah I think
 

1177
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,330
of the internet oh yeah yeah I think
there's a lot of it in Wikipedia too for

1178
00:25:59,330 --> 00:25:59,340
there's a lot of it in Wikipedia too for
 

1179
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,549
there's a lot of it in Wikipedia too for
example yeah it's funny that those

1180
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:01,559
example yeah it's funny that those
 

1181
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,350
example yeah it's funny that those
decisions are not funny it's fascinating

1182
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
decisions are not funny it's fascinating
 

1183
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,870
decisions are not funny it's fascinating
that those decisions permeate Through

1184
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:05,880
that those decisions permeate Through
 

1185
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,890
that those decisions permeate Through
Time

1186
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:06,900
Time
 

1187
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,950
Time
just like biological systems right

1188
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:09,960
just like biological systems right
 

1189
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,590
just like biological systems right
I mean that the sort of the inner

1190
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,600
I mean that the sort of the inner
 

1191
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,750
I mean that the sort of the inner
workings of DNA

1192
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:14,760
workings of DNA
 

1193
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,970
workings of DNA
have been stable for well I don't know

1194
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:16,980
have been stable for well I don't know
 

1195
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,850
have been stable for well I don't know
how long it was like 300 million years

1196
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:19,860
how long it was like 300 million years
 

1197
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,850
how long it was like 300 million years
half a billion years yeah and there

1198
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:22,860
half a billion years yeah and there
 

1199
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,950
half a billion years yeah and there
there are all sorts of weird quirks

1200
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
there are all sorts of weird quirks
 

1201
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,970
there are all sorts of weird quirks
there

1202
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:25,980
there
 

1203
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,890
there
that don't make a lot of sense if you

1204
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:27,900
that don't make a lot of sense if you
 

1205
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,269
that don't make a lot of sense if you
were to design

1206
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
were to design
 

1207
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,970
were to design
a system like self-replicating molecules

1208
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:31,980
a system like self-replicating molecules
 

1209
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,909
a system like self-replicating molecules
from scratch but that system has a lot

1210
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:34,919
from scratch but that system has a lot
 

1211
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,549
from scratch but that system has a lot
of interesting resilience it has

1212
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:37,559
of interesting resilience it has
 

1213
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,630
of interesting resilience it has
redundancy that results like it messes

1214
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:41,640
redundancy that results like it messes
 

1215
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,909
redundancy that results like it messes
up in interesting ways that still is

1216
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
up in interesting ways that still is
 

1217
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,649
up in interesting ways that still is
resilient when you look at the system

1218
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:45,659
resilient when you look at the system
 

1219
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,169
resilient when you look at the system
level of the organism code doesn't

1220
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:48,179
level of the organism code doesn't
 

1221
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,990
level of the organism code doesn't
necessarily have that a program a

1222
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,000
necessarily have that a program a
 

1223
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,570
necessarily have that a program a
computer programming code you'd be

1224
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,580
computer programming code you'd be
 

1225
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,130
computer programming code you'd be
surprised

1226
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,140
surprised
 

1227
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,730
surprised
how much resilience modern code has

1228
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:58,740
how much resilience modern code has
 

1229
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,070
how much resilience modern code has
I mean if you if you look at the number

1230
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,080
I mean if you if you look at the number
 

1231
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,710
I mean if you if you look at the number
of bugs per line of code

1232
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:03,720
of bugs per line of code
 

1233
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,669
of bugs per line of code
even in in very well tested

1234
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
even in in very well tested
 

1235
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,990
even in in very well tested
code that in practice works just fine

1236
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,000
code that in practice works just fine
 

1237
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,210
code that in practice works just fine
there are actually lots of things that

1238
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,220
there are actually lots of things that
 

1239
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,950
there are actually lots of things that
don't work fine

1240
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:15,960
don't work fine
 

1241
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,950
don't work fine
and there are error correcting or

1242
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
and there are error correcting or
 

1243
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,529
and there are error correcting or
self-correcting mechanisms at many

1244
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:21,539
self-correcting mechanisms at many
 

1245
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,169
self-correcting mechanisms at many
levels including probably the user of

1246
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:24,179
levels including probably the user of
 

1247
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,230
levels including probably the user of
the code well in the end the user who

1248
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,240
the code well in the end the user who
 

1249
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,870
the code well in the end the user who
sort of is told well you got to reboot

1250
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:29,880
sort of is told well you got to reboot
 

1251
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,310
sort of is told well you got to reboot
your your PC is part of that system and

1252
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
your your PC is part of that system and
 

1253
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,390
your your PC is part of that system and
a slightly uh less drastic thing is

1254
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400
a slightly uh less drastic thing is
 

1255
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,570
a slightly uh less drastic thing is
reload the page which we all know how to

1256
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:41,580
reload the page which we all know how to
 

1257
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,090
reload the page which we all know how to
do without thinking about it when

1258
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,100
do without thinking about it when
 

1259
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,430
do without thinking about it when
something weird happens you you try to

1260
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:46,440
something weird happens you you try to
 

1261
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,529
something weird happens you you try to
reload a few times before you say oh

1262
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:48,539
reload a few times before you say oh
 

1263
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,630
reload a few times before you say oh
there's something really weird okay or

1264
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
there's something really weird okay or
 

1265
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,370
there's something really weird okay or
try to click the button again if the

1266
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,380
try to click the button again if the
 

1267
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,130
try to click the button again if the
first time didn't work

1268
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,140
first time didn't work
 

1269
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,750
first time didn't work
well yeah that we should all have

1270
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:56,760
well yeah that we should all have
 

1271
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,789
well yeah that we should all have
learned not to do that because that's

1272
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
learned not to do that because that's
 

1273
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,710
learned not to do that because that's
probably just gonna turn the light back

1274
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
probably just gonna turn the light back
 

1275
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,230
probably just gonna turn the light back
off yeah true so do it three times

1276
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,240
off yeah true so do it three times
 

1277
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,070
off yeah true so do it three times
that's the that's the right lesson so uh

1278
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,080
that's the that's the right lesson so uh
 

1279
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,370
that's the that's the right lesson so uh
and I wonder how many people actually

1280
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:09,380
and I wonder how many people actually
 

1281
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,950
and I wonder how many people actually
like the dollar sign like you said it is

1282
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
like the dollar sign like you said it is
 

1283
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,090
like the dollar sign like you said it is
documentation so to me it's whatever the

1284
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,100
documentation so to me it's whatever the
 

1285
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,490
documentation so to me it's whatever the
opposite of syntactic sugar is syntactic

1286
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,500
opposite of syntactic sugar is syntactic
 

1287
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,970
opposite of syntactic sugar is syntactic
poison to me it is such a pain in the

1288
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:22,980
poison to me it is such a pain in the
 

1289
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,710
poison to me it is such a pain in the
ass that I have to type in a dollar shot

1290
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
ass that I have to type in a dollar shot
 

1291
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,930
ass that I have to type in a dollar shot
also super error prone

1292
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:26,940
also super error prone
 

1293
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,230
also super error prone
so it's not self-documenting it's it's

1294
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
so it's not self-documenting it's it's
 

1295
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,690
so it's not self-documenting it's it's
like a bug generating thing it is a kind

1296
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:32,700
like a bug generating thing it is a kind
 

1297
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,610
like a bug generating thing it is a kind
of documentation that's the pro and the

1298
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:34,620
of documentation that's the pro and the
 

1299
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,890
of documentation that's the pro and the
con is it's a source of a lot of bugs

1300
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:36,900
con is it's a source of a lot of bugs
 

1301
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,590
con is it's a source of a lot of bugs
but actually I have to ask you um

1302
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
but actually I have to ask you um
 

1303
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,210
but actually I have to ask you um
this is a really interesting idea of

1304
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,220
this is a really interesting idea of
 

1305
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,669
this is a really interesting idea of
bugs per line of code

1306
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
bugs per line of code
 

1307
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,010
bugs per line of code
if you look at all the computer systems

1308
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,020
if you look at all the computer systems
 

1309
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,870
if you look at all the computer systems
out there from the code that runs

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:47,880
out there from the code that runs
 

1311
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,990
out there from the code that runs
nuclear weapons to the code that runs

1312
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,000
nuclear weapons to the code that runs
 

1313
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,909
nuclear weapons to the code that runs
all the amazing companies that you've

1314
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:52,919
all the amazing companies that you've
 

1315
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,970
all the amazing companies that you've
been involved with and not the code that

1316
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:55,980
been involved with and not the code that
 

1317
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,070
been involved with and not the code that
runs Twitter and Facebook and Dropbox

and we like laid out
 

1325
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,390

wouldn't that be a cool like table bugs

1326
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,400
wouldn't that be a cool like table bugs
 

1327
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,909
wouldn't that be a cool like table bugs
per line of code and what would that

1328
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:10,919
per line of code and what would that
 

1329
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,470

let's let's put like actual companies

let's let's put like actual companies
 

1331
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,350
let's let's put like actual companies
aside do you think we'd be surprised by

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
aside do you think we'd be surprised by
 

1333
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,909
aside do you think we'd be surprised by
the number we see there for all these

that depends on whether you've ever read
about research that's been done in this

about research that's been done in this

time I
 

1349
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,950
time I
I saw some research like that that was

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:33,960
I saw some research like that that was
 

1351
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,930
I saw some research like that that was
probably in the 90s and the research

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:35,940
probably in the 90s and the research
 

1353
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,010
probably in the 90s and the research
might have been done in the 80s but the

might have been done in the 80s but the
 

1355
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,210
might have been done in the 80s but the
the conclusion was across a wide range

the conclusion was across a wide range
 

1357
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,430
the conclusion was across a wide range

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
exchanges stack overflow on the exact
 

1451
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,909
exchanges stack overflow on the exact
same topic but when I open it up at the

1452
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
same topic but when I open it up at the
 

1453
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,310
same topic but when I open it up at the
moment the page says stack Overflow is

1454
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
moment the page says stack Overflow is
 

1455
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,710
moment the page says stack Overflow is
currently offline for maintenance oh

1456
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
currently offline for maintenance oh
 

1457
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,169
currently offline for maintenance oh
it's ironic yes uh by the way their

1458
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:57,179
it's ironic yes uh by the way their
 

1459
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,870
it's ironic yes uh by the way their
error page is awesome anyway

1460
00:31:59,870 --> 00:31:59,880
error page is awesome anyway
 

1461
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,330
error page is awesome anyway
I mean can you believe that number of

1462
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:02,340
I mean can you believe that number of
 

1463
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,330
I mean can you believe that number of
bugs oh absolutely isn't that scary that

1464
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,340
bugs oh absolutely isn't that scary that
 

1465
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,330
bugs oh absolutely isn't that scary that
70 bucks per 1000 lines of code so even

1466
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:08,340
70 bucks per 1000 lines of code so even
 

1467
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,190
70 bucks per 1000 lines of code so even
10 bucks per thousand lives well that's

1468
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,200
10 bucks per thousand lives well that's
 

1469
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,250
10 bucks per thousand lives well that's
about one bug after every 15 lines and

1470
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,260
about one bug after every 15 lines and
 

1471
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,889
about one bug after every 15 lines and
that's when you're first typing it in

1472
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:15,899
that's when you're first typing it in
 

1473
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,769
that's when you're first typing it in
yeah from a developer but like how many

1474
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:18,779
yeah from a developer but like how many
 

1475
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,870
yeah from a developer but like how many
bugs are going to be found

1476
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
bugs are going to be found
 

1477
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,909
bugs are going to be found
if you're if you're typing well the

1478
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:22,919
if you're if you're typing well the
 

1479
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,370
if you're if you're typing well the
development process is extremely

1480
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,380
development process is extremely
 

1481
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,490
development process is extremely
iterative yeah typically you don't make

1482
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:28,500
iterative yeah typically you don't make
 

1483
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,010
iterative yeah typically you don't make
a plan for what software you're going to

1484
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,020
a plan for what software you're going to
 

1485
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,789
a plan for what software you're going to
release a year from now yeah uh and work

1486
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
release a year from now yeah uh and work
 

1487
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,950
release a year from now yeah uh and work
out all the details because actually all

1488
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
out all the details because actually all
 

1489
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,430
out all the details because actually all
the details uh themselves consist

1490
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:40,440
the details uh themselves consist
 

1491
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,789
the details uh themselves consist
they're sort of compose a program

1492
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:43,799
they're sort of compose a program
 

1493
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,830
they're sort of compose a program
and that's that

1494
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
and that's that
 

1495
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,169
and that's that
being a program all your plans will have

1496
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:48,179
being a program all your plans will have
 

1497
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,830
being a program all your plans will have
bugs in them too and inaccuracies

1498
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
bugs in them too and inaccuracies
 

1499
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,630
bugs in them too and inaccuracies
uh but what what you actually do is

1500
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
uh but what what you actually do is
 

1501
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,669
uh but what what you actually do is
you do a bunch of typing and I'm I'm

1502
00:32:58,669 --> 00:32:58,679
you do a bunch of typing and I'm I'm
 

1503
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,750
you do a bunch of typing and I'm I'm
actually really I'm a really bad typist

1504
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:02,760
actually really I'm a really bad typist
 

1505
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,090
actually really I'm a really bad typist
that just I've never learned to type

1506
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,100
that just I've never learned to type
 

1507
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,769
that just I've never learned to type
with 10 fingers

1508
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:06,779
with 10 fingers
 

1509
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,750
with 10 fingers
how many do you use

1510
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:08,760
how many do you use
 

1511
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,210
how many do you use
well I could use all 10 of them but not

1512
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:11,220
well I could use all 10 of them but not
 

1513
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,409
well I could use all 10 of them but not
very well

1514
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:12,419
very well
 

1515
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,750
very well
but I I never I never took a talking

1516
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:14,760
but I I never I never took a talking
 

1517
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,029
but I I never I never took a talking
class and I never sort of corrected that

1518
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
class and I never sort of corrected that
 

1519
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,850
class and I never sort of corrected that
so the first time I I seriously learned

1520
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:19,860
so the first time I I seriously learned
 

1521
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,389
so the first time I I seriously learned
I had to learn the layout of a qwerty

1522
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:23,399
I had to learn the layout of a qwerty
 

1523
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,830
I had to learn the layout of a qwerty
keyboard

1524
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:24,840
keyboard
 

1525
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,169
keyboard
was actually in college in my first

1526
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:27,179
was actually in college in my first
 

1527
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,870
was actually in college in my first
programming classes where we used Punch

1528
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:29,880
programming classes where we used Punch
 

1529
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,149
programming classes where we used Punch
Cards

1530
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:31,159
Cards
 

1531
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,110
Cards
and so

1532
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
and so
 

1533
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,769
and so
with my two fingers I sort of pecked out

1534
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:36,779
with my two fingers I sort of pecked out
 

1535
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,750
with my two fingers I sort of pecked out
my code

1536
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:38,760
my code
 

1537
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,789
my code
watch anyone

1538
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
watch anyone
 

1539
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,730
watch anyone
give you a little coding demonstration

1540
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:43,740
give you a little coding demonstration
 

1541
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,730
give you a little coding demonstration
they'll have to produce like four lines

1542
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:46,740
they'll have to produce like four lines
 

1543
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,289
they'll have to produce like four lines
of code

1544
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:48,299
of code
 

1545
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:51,169
of code
and now see how many times they use the

1546
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:51,179
and now see how many times they use the
 

1547
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,049
and now see how many times they use the
backspace key yeah because they made a

1548
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:54,059
backspace key yeah because they made a
 

1549
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,850
backspace key yeah because they made a
mistake and and

1550
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:55,860
mistake and and
 

1551
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,430
mistake and and
and some people especially when when

1552
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,440
and some people especially when when
 

1553
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,610
and some people especially when when
someone else is looking

1554
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:01,620

 

1555
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,269

will will backspace over 20 30 40

1556
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
will will backspace over 20 30 40
 

1557
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,629
will will backspace over 20 30 40
characters to fix a typo earlier in a

1558
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
characters to fix a typo earlier in a
 

1559
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,490
characters to fix a typo earlier in a
line if you're

1560
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:10,500
line if you're
 

1561
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,649
line if you're
if you're slightly more experienced of

1562
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:12,659
if you're slightly more experienced of
 

1563
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,109
if you're slightly more experienced of
course you use your arrow buttons to go

1564
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
course you use your arrow buttons to go
 

1565
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,849
course you use your arrow buttons to go
or your mouse to but the mouse is

1566
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:16,859
or your mouse to but the mouse is
 

1567
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:20,089
or your mouse to but the mouse is
usually slower than uh than the arrows

1568
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:20,099
usually slower than uh than the arrows
 

1569
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,990
usually slower than uh than the arrows
but a lot of people when they type a 20

1570
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
but a lot of people when they type a 20
 

1571
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,349
but a lot of people when they type a 20
character word which is not unusual and

1572
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
character word which is not unusual and
 

1573
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,750
character word which is not unusual and
they realize they made us made a mistake

1574
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
they realize they made us made a mistake
 

1575
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,490
they realize they made us made a mistake
at the start of the word the backspace

1576
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:31,500
at the start of the word the backspace
 

1577
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,050
at the start of the word the backspace
over the whole thing

1578
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:33,060
over the whole thing
 

1579
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,389
over the whole thing
and then retype it and sometimes it

1580
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:35,399
and then retype it and sometimes it
 

1581
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,190
and then retype it and sometimes it
takes three four times to get it right

1582
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
takes three four times to get it right
 

1583
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,750
takes three four times to get it right
so

1584
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:38,760
so
 

1585
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,030
so
I don't know what your definition of bug

1586
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
I don't know what your definition of bug
 

1587
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,570
I don't know what your definition of bug
is arguably mistyping a word and then

1588
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:44,580
is arguably mistyping a word and then
 

1589
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,510
is arguably mistyping a word and then
correcting it immediately is not a bug

1590
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
correcting it immediately is not a bug
 

1591
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,570
correcting it immediately is not a bug
on the other hand you you already

1592
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:50,580
on the other hand you you already
 

1593
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,230
on the other hand you you already
do sort of lose time and every once in a

1594
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
do sort of lose time and every once in a
 

1595
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,510
do sort of lose time and every once in a
while there's sort of a typo that you

1596
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,520
while there's sort of a typo that you
 

1597
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,690
while there's sort of a typo that you
don't get in that process

1598
00:34:59,690 --> 00:34:59,700
don't get in that process
 

1599
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,970
don't get in that process
and now you've you've typed like 10

1600
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:01,980
and now you've you've typed like 10
 

1601
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,290
and now you've you've typed like 10
lines of code

1602
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,300
lines of code
 

1603
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,690
lines of code
uh and some were in the middle of it you

1604
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:05,700
uh and some were in the middle of it you
 

1605
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,230
uh and some were in the middle of it you
don't know where yet is a typo or maybe

1606
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,240
don't know where yet is a typo or maybe
 

1607
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,170
don't know where yet is a typo or maybe
a thinko where you you forgot that you

1608
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:12,180
a thinko where you you forgot that you
 

1609
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,849
a thinko where you you forgot that you
had to initialize a variable or

1610
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:13,859
had to initialize a variable or
 

1611
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,530
had to initialize a variable or
something but those are two different

1612
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,540
something but those are two different
 

1613
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,329
something but those are two different
things and I would say yes you have to

1614
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:17,339
things and I would say yes you have to
 

1615
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,190
things and I would say yes you have to
actually run the code to discover that

1616
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
actually run the code to discover that
 

1617
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,130
actually run the code to discover that
typo but forgetting to initialize a

1618
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,140
typo but forgetting to initialize a
 

1619
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,690
typo but forgetting to initialize a
variable is a fundamentally different

1620
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:23,700
variable is a fundamentally different
 

1621
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,510
variable is a fundamentally different
thing because that thing can go

1622
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:26,520
thing because that thing can go
 

1623
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,910
thing because that thing can go
undiscovered uh that depends on the

1624
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:28,920
undiscovered uh that depends on the
 

1625
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,190
undiscovered uh that depends on the
language in Python it will not right in

1626
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
language in Python it will not right in
 

1627
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,109
language in Python it will not right in
sort of modern compilers are usually

1628
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:33,119
sort of modern compilers are usually
 

1629
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,569
sort of modern compilers are usually
pretty good at catching that even

1630
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:35,579
pretty good at catching that even
 

1631
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,329
pretty good at catching that even
even foresee so for that specific thing

1632
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:38,339
even foresee so for that specific thing
 

1633
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,550
even foresee so for that specific thing
but actually deeper

1634
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
but actually deeper
 

1635
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,270
but actually deeper
it might there might be another variable

1636
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
it might there might be another variable
 

1637
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,950
it might there might be another variable
that has initialized but logically

1638
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:45,960
that has initialized but logically
 

1639
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,349
that has initialized but logically
speaking the one you meant related yep

1640
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:50,359
speaking the one you meant related yep
 

1641
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,609
speaking the one you meant related yep
it's like name the same but it's a

1642
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:52,619
it's like name the same but it's a
 

1643
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,870
it's like name the same but it's a
different thing and you forgot to

1644
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:53,880
different thing and you forgot to
 

1645
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,870
different thing and you forgot to
initialize uh whatever some counter or

1646
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
initialize uh whatever some counter or
 

1647
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,030
initialize uh whatever some counter or
some some basic variable they're using I

1648
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
some some basic variable they're using I
 

1649
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,270
some some basic variable they're using I
can tell that you've coded yes by the

1650
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,280
can tell that you've coded yes by the
 

1651
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,530
can tell that you've coded yes by the
way I should mention that I use the

1652
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:03,540
way I should mention that I use the
 

1653
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,089
way I should mention that I use the
Kinesis keyboard

1654
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:05,099
Kinesis keyboard
 

1655
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,430
Kinesis keyboard
which has the backspace under the thumb

1656
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
which has the backspace under the thumb
 

1657
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,030
which has the backspace under the thumb
and one of the biggest reasons I use

1658
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
and one of the biggest reasons I use
 

1659
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,089
and one of the biggest reasons I use
that keyboard is because you realize in

1660
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:14,099
that keyboard is because you realize in
 

1661
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,250
that keyboard is because you realize in
order to use the backspace on a usual

1662
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,260
order to use the backspace on a usual
 

1663
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,530
order to use the backspace on a usual
keyboard you have to stretch your pinky

1664
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,540
keyboard you have to stretch your pinky
 

1665
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,930
keyboard you have to stretch your pinky
out

1666
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:19,940
out
 

1667
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,569
out
and like the the for most normal

1668
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:23,579
and like the the for most normal
 

1669
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,270
and like the the for most normal
keyboards the Backspaces under the pinky

1670
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,280
keyboards the Backspaces under the pinky
 

1671
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,849
keyboards the Backspaces under the pinky
and so I don't know if people realize

1672
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:28,859
and so I don't know if people realize
 

1673
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,690
and so I don't know if people realize
the pain they go through in their life

1674
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:32,700
the pain they go through in their life
 

1675
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,790
the pain they go through in their life
because of the backspace keep being so

1676
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
because of the backspace keep being so
 

1677
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,410
because of the backspace keep being so
far away so with the Kinesis it's right

1678
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:36,420
far away so with the Kinesis it's right
 

1679
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,150
far away so with the Kinesis it's right
under the thumb so you don't have to

1680
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
under the thumb so you don't have to
 

1681
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,890
under the thumb so you don't have to
actually move your hands the backspace

1682
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:39,900
actually move your hands the backspace
 

1683
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,870
actually move your hands the backspace
and the delivery what do you do if

1684
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
and the delivery what do you do if
 

1685
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,050
and the delivery what do you do if
you're ever not with your own keyboard

1686
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:45,060
you're ever not with your own keyboard
 

1687
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,810
you're ever not with your own keyboard
and you have to use someone else's PC

1688
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:47,820
and you have to use someone else's PC
 

1689
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,750
and you have to use someone else's PC
keyboard that has a standard layout so

1690
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:50,760
keyboard that has a standard layout so
 

1691
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,030
keyboard that has a standard layout so
first of all it turns out that you can

1692
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
first of all it turns out that you can
 

1693
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,650
first of all it turns out that you can
actually go your whole life always

1694
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:54,660
actually go your whole life always
 

1695
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,150
actually go your whole life always
having the keyboard

1696
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
having the keyboard
 

1697
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,609
having the keyboard
with you so this well except for that

1698
00:36:58,609 --> 00:36:58,619
with you so this well except for that
 

1699
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,069
with you so this well except for that
that little tablet that you're using so

1700
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:01,079
that little tablet that you're using so
 

1701
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,990
that little tablet that you're using so
we're note taking right now right uh

1702
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,000
we're note taking right now right uh
 

1703
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,250
we're note taking right now right uh
yeah so it's very inefficient

1704
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,260
yeah so it's very inefficient
 

1705
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,170
yeah so it's very inefficient
note-taking but I'm not I'm just looking

1706
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:06,180
note-taking but I'm not I'm just looking
 

1707
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,530
note-taking but I'm not I'm just looking
stuff up but in most cases I would be

1708
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:09,540
stuff up but in most cases I would be
 

1709
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,290
stuff up but in most cases I would be
actually using the keyboard here right

1710
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,300
actually using the keyboard here right
 

1711
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,510
actually using the keyboard here right
now I just don't anticipate you have to

1712
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:14,520
now I just don't anticipate you have to
 

1713
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,430
now I just don't anticipate you have to
calculate how much typing do you

1714
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,440
calculate how much typing do you
 

1715
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,230
calculate how much typing do you
anticipate if I anticipate quite a bit

1716
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
anticipate if I anticipate quite a bit
 

1717
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,770
anticipate if I anticipate quite a bit
then I'll just I have a keyboard

1718
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:20,780
then I'll just I have a keyboard
 

1719
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,690
then I'll just I have a keyboard
and the same same with I mean

1720
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:23,700
and the same same with I mean
 

1721
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,670
and the same same with I mean
the embarrassing

1722
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
the embarrassing
 

1723
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,450
the embarrassing
of accepted being the weirdo that I am

1724
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:28,460
of accepted being the weirdo that I am
 

1725
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,670
of accepted being the weirdo that I am
but you know when I go on an airplane

1726
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
but you know when I go on an airplane
 

1727
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,250
but you know when I go on an airplane
and I anticipate to do programming or a

1728
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,260
and I anticipate to do programming or a
 

1729
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,310
and I anticipate to do programming or a
lot of typing I will have a laptop that

1730
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,320
lot of typing I will have a laptop that
 

1731
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,310
lot of typing I will have a laptop that
will put pull out a Kinesis keyboard in

1732
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
will put pull out a Kinesis keyboard in
 

1733
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,770
will put pull out a Kinesis keyboard in
addition to the laptop and it's just who

1734
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:42,780
addition to the laptop and it's just who
 

1735
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,690
addition to the laptop and it's just who
I am you have to you have to accept who

1736
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:44,700
I am you have to you have to accept who
 

1737
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,890
I am you have to you have to accept who
you are

1738
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:45,900
you are
 

1739
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,349
you are
um but also it's a you know for a lot of

1740
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:48,359
um but also it's a you know for a lot of
 

1741
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:49,250
um but also it's a you know for a lot of
people

1742
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:49,260
people
 

1743
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,530
people
for me certainly there's a comfort space

1744
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:51,540
for me certainly there's a comfort space
 

1745
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,530
for me certainly there's a comfort space
where there's a certain kind of setups

1746
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:54,540
where there's a certain kind of setups
 

1747
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,670
where there's a certain kind of setups
that are maximized productivity and

1748
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:58,680
that are maximized productivity and
 

1749
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,829
that are maximized productivity and
um it's like some people have a warm

1750
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:00,839
um it's like some people have a warm
 

1751
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,390
um it's like some people have a warm
blanket that they like

1752
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
blanket that they like
 

1753
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,849
blanket that they like
when they watch a movie I like the

1754
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:04,859
when they watch a movie I like the
 

1755
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,550
when they watch a movie I like the
Kinesis keyboard takes me to uh a place

1756
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,560
Kinesis keyboard takes me to uh a place
 

1757
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,089
Kinesis keyboard takes me to uh a place
of focus and I still mostly I I'm trying

1758
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:11,099
of focus and I still mostly I I'm trying
 

1759
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,609
of focus and I still mostly I I'm trying
to make sure I use the state-of-the-art

1760
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:13,619
to make sure I use the state-of-the-art
 

1761
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,849
to make sure I use the state-of-the-art

just like the Kinesis keyboard is still

1764
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:18,780
just like the Kinesis keyboard is still
 

1765
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,569

emacs

1766
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:20,579
emacs
 

1767
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,450
emacs
so

1768
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:22,460
so
 

1769
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,990
so
I still use I still I mean that's one of

1770
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,000
I still use I still I mean that's one of
 

1771
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,430
I still use I still I mean that's one of
some of the debates I have with myself

1772
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:28,440
some of the debates I have with myself
 

1773
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,890
some of the debates I have with myself
about everything from a technology

1774
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:30,900
about everything from a technology
 

1775
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,329
about everything from a technology
perspective

1776
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:32,339
perspective
 

1777
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,849
perspective
is how much to hold on to the tools

1778
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:34,859
is how much to hold on to the tools
 

1779
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,130
is how much to hold on to the tools
you're comfortable with versus how much

1780
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,140
you're comfortable with versus how much
 

1781
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,849
you're comfortable with versus how much
to invest in using modern tools and the

1782
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:40,859
to invest in using modern tools and the
 

1783
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,589
to invest in using modern tools and the

signal that the communities provide you
 

1785
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,589
signal that the communities provide you
with is the noisy one because a lot of

people year to year get excited about
 

1789
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,130
people year to year get excited about
new tools and you have to make a

1790
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,140
new tools and you have to make a
 

1791
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,609
new tools and you have to make a

new generation or something that will
 

1795
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,510
new generation or something that will
transform programming or is this just a

1796
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:56,520
transform programming or is this just a
 

1797
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,030
transform programming or is this just a
fad that will pass certainly with

1798
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
fad that will pass certainly with

1803
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,790
back end of the web there's a lot of
different styles that came and went I

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:07,800
different styles that came and went I
 

1805
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,609
different styles that came and went I
remember learning um what was it called

1806
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:10,619
remember learning um what was it called
 

1807
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,329
remember learning um what was it called
the action script I remember for flash

1808
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:14,339
the action script I remember for flash
 

1809
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,770
the action script I remember for flash
um you know learning how to program in

1810
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:15,780
um you know learning how to program in
 

1811
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,710
um you know learning how to program in
Flash uh learning how to design doing

1812
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
Flash uh learning how to design doing
 

1813
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,630
Flash uh learning how to design doing
graphic animation all that kind of stuff

1814
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
graphic animation all that kind of stuff
 

1815
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,849
graphic animation all that kind of stuff
in Flash same with Java applets I

1816
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:22,859
in Flash same with Java applets I
 

1817
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,589
in Flash same with Java applets I
remember creating quite a lot of java

1818
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:24,599
remember creating quite a lot of java
 

1819
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,630
remember creating quite a lot of java
applets thinking that this potentially

1820
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
applets thinking that this potentially
 

1821
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,089
applets thinking that this potentially
defines the future of the web and it did

00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:29,099
defines the future of the web and it did
 

1823
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,910
defines the future of the web and it did
not well you know in most cases like

1824
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
not well you know in most cases like
 

1825
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,050
not well you know in most cases like
that the particular technology

1826
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,060
that the particular technology
 

1827
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,910
that the particular technology
eventually gets replaced

1828
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
eventually gets replaced
 

1829
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,829
eventually gets replaced
but

1830
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
but
 

1831
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,329
but
many of the concepts that the technology

1832
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:43,339
many of the concepts that the technology
 

1833
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,990
many of the concepts that the technology
introduced or made accessible first

1834
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
introduced or made accessible first
 

1835
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,630
introduced or made accessible first
are preserved of course

1836
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
are preserved of course
 

1837
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,390
are preserved of course
because yeah we're not using Java

1838
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,400
because yeah we're not using Java
 

1839
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,550
because yeah we're not using Java
applets anymore but the notion of

1840
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:55,560
applets anymore but the notion of
 

1841
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,770
applets anymore but the notion of
reactive web pages

1842
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:57,780
reactive web pages
 

1843
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,970
reactive web pages
that sort of contain little bits of code

1844
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:00,980
that sort of contain little bits of code
 

1845
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,790
that sort of contain little bits of code
that respond directly to

1846
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:04,800
that respond directly to
 

1847
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,069
that respond directly to
something you do like pressing a button

1848
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:07,079
something you do like pressing a button
 

1849
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,250
something you do like pressing a button
or a link or hovering even

1850
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,260
or a link or hovering even
 

1851
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,410
or a link or hovering even
uh is has certainly not gone away

1852
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:12,420
uh is has certainly not gone away
 

1853
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,550
uh is has certainly not gone away
and that those animations that were made

1854
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
and that those animations that were made
 

1855
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,190
and that those animations that were made
painfully

1856
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,200
painfully
 

1857
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,750
painfully
complicated with flesh

1858
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:20,760
complicated with flesh
 

1859
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,870
complicated with flesh
I mean flash was an innovation when it

1860
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
I mean flash was an innovation when it
 

1861
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,250
I mean flash was an innovation when it
first came up

1862
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,260
first came up
 

1863
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,670
first came up
and when it was replaced by JavaScript

1864
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:28,680
and when it was replaced by JavaScript
 

1865
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,109
and when it was replaced by JavaScript
equivalence

1866
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:30,119
equivalence
 

1867
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,430

stuff

1868
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:31,440
stuff
 

1869
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,550
stuff
it was a somewhat better way to do

1870
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
it was a somewhat better way to do
 

1871
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,650
it was a somewhat better way to do
animations but those animations are

1872
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:36,660
animations but those animations are
 

1873
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,290
animations but those animations are
still there not all of them

1874
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:39,300
still there not all of them
 

1875
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,870
still there not all of them
but but sort of

1876
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:41,880
but but sort of
 

1877
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,109
but but sort of
again there is an evolution and often so

1878
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
again there is an evolution and often so
 

1879
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,270
again there is an evolution and often so
often with technology

1880
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
often with technology
 

1881
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,730
often with technology
the the sort of the technology that was

1882
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:49,740
the the sort of the technology that was
 

1883
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,790
the the sort of the technology that was
eventually thrown away or replaced

1884
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
eventually thrown away or replaced
 

1885
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,109
eventually thrown away or replaced
was still essential to to sort of

1886
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
was still essential to to sort of
 

1887
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,690
was still essential to to sort of
get started there wouldn't be jet planes

1888
00:40:59,690 --> 00:40:59,700
get started there wouldn't be jet planes
 

1889
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,730
get started there wouldn't be jet planes
without propeller planes

1890
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:01,740
without propeller planes
 

1891
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,510
without propeller planes
I bet you but from a user perspective

1892
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
I bet you but from a user perspective
 

1893
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,170
I bet you but from a user perspective
yes from the feature set yes but I from

1894
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,180
yes from the feature set yes but I from
 

1895
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,069
yes from the feature set yes but I from
a programmer perspective it feels like

1896
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:13,079
a programmer perspective it feels like
 

1897
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,890
a programmer perspective it feels like
all the time I've spent

1898
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:15,900
all the time I've spent
 

1899
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,589
all the time I've spent
with actionscript all the time I spent

1900
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:18,599
with actionscript all the time I spent
 

1901
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,109
with actionscript all the time I spent
with Java on the applet side for the GUI

1902
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
with Java on the applet side for the GUI
 

1903
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,210
with Java on the applet side for the GUI
development I well no Java I have to

1904
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,220
development I well no Java I have to
 

1905
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,849
development I well no Java I have to
push back that was useful that because

1906
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:25,859
push back that was useful that because
 

1907
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,950
push back that was useful that because
it transfers but the Flash doesn't

1908
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:27,960
it transfers but the Flash doesn't
 

1909
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,930
it transfers but the Flash doesn't
transfer so some things you learn and

1910
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:29,940
transfer so some things you learn and
 

1911
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,109
transfer so some things you learn and
invest time in what yeah what what you

1912
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
invest time in what yeah what what you
 

1913
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,690
invest time in what yeah what what you
learned this the skill you picked up

1914
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:35,700
learned this the skill you picked up
 

1915
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,390
learned this the skill you picked up
learning action script yeah

1916
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
learning action script yeah
 

1917
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,470
learning action script yeah
was sort of it was perhaps

1918
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
was sort of it was perhaps
 

1919
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,109
was sort of it was perhaps
a super valuable skill at the time you

1920
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
a super valuable skill at the time you
 

1921
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,470
a super valuable skill at the time you
picked it up if if you if you learned

1922
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
picked it up if if you if you learned
 

1923
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,510
picked it up if if you if you learned
action script early enough but

1924
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520

 

1925
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,390

that skill is no longer

1926
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
that skill is no longer
 

1927
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,430
that skill is no longer
in demand well that's the calculation

1928
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:58,440
in demand well that's the calculation
 

1929
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,990
in demand well that's the calculation
you have to make when you're learning

1930
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
you have to make when you're learning
 

1931
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,430
you have to make when you're learning
new things like today people start

1932
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
new things like today people start
 

1933
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,490
new things like today people start
learning programming today I'm trying to

1934
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:04,500
learning programming today I'm trying to
 

1935
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,430
learning programming today I'm trying to
to see what are the new languages to try

1936
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
to see what are the new languages to try
 

1937
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,770
to see what are the new languages to try
what are the new uh systems to try that

1938
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:09,780
what are the new uh systems to try that
 

1939
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,890
what are the new uh systems to try that
what are the new IDs to try to to keep

1940
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:12,900
what are the new IDs to try to to keep
 

1941
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,170
what are the new IDs to try to to keep
keep improving because that's why we

1942
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:15,180
keep improving because that's why we
 

1943
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,370
keep improving because that's why we
start when we're young right

1944
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:18,380
start when we're young right
 

1945
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,710
start when we're young right
but that seems very true to me that that

1946
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:21,720
but that seems very true to me that that
 

1947
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,270
but that seems very true to me that that
when you're young you have your whole

1948
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,280
when you're young you have your whole
 

1949
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,790
when you're young you have your whole
life ahead of you and your you're

1950
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:25,800
life ahead of you and your you're
 

1951
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,670
life ahead of you and your you're
allowed to make mistakes in fact you

1952
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:28,680
allowed to make mistakes in fact you
 

1953
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,829
allowed to make mistakes in fact you
should you should feel encouraged to to

1954
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:30,839
should you should feel encouraged to to
 

1955
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,190
should you should feel encouraged to to
do a bit of stupid stuff yeah try not to

1956
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,200
do a bit of stupid stuff yeah try not to
 

1957
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,770
do a bit of stupid stuff yeah try not to
get yourself killed or seriously maimed

1958
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:36,780
get yourself killed or seriously maimed
 

1959
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,770
get yourself killed or seriously maimed
but try stuff that

1960
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:39,780
but try stuff that
 

1961
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,710
but try stuff that
deviate from from what everybody else is

1962
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
deviate from from what everybody else is
 

1963
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,109
deviate from from what everybody else is
doing

1964
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:44,119
doing
 

1965
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,690
doing
and like nine out of ten times you'll

1966
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:47,700
and like nine out of ten times you'll
 

1967
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,790
and like nine out of ten times you'll
just learn why everybody else is not

1968
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:49,800
just learn why everybody else is not
 

1969
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,190
just learn why everybody else is not
doing that or why everybody else is

1970
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,200
doing that or why everybody else is
 

1971
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,890
doing that or why everybody else is
doing it some other way and one out of

1972
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:54,900
doing it some other way and one out of
 

1973
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,349
doing it some other way and one out of
ten times you sort of

1974
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359
ten times you sort of
 

1975
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,230
ten times you sort of
you discover something that's better or

1976
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
you discover something that's better or
 

1977
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,329
you discover something that's better or
that's that somehow works I mean there

1978
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:02,339
that's that somehow works I mean there
 

1979
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,190
that's that somehow works I mean there
are all sorts of crazy things that were

1980
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,200
are all sorts of crazy things that were
 

1981
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,750
are all sorts of crazy things that were
invented

1982
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
invented
 

1983
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,470
invented
uh by accident by people trying trying

1984
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,480
uh by accident by people trying trying
 

1985
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,970
uh by accident by people trying trying
stuff together

1986
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:10,980
stuff together
 

1987
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,490
stuff together
that's great advice to try random stuff

1988
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:13,500
that's great advice to try random stuff
 

1989

to uh be a little more risk-averse

1994
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,040
to uh be a little more risk-averse
 

1995
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,890
to uh be a little more risk-averse

if it's if it's bound to die it's going
to take a very long time well for me

2064
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
to take a very long time well for me
 

2065
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,670

personally
I had a very difficult in my own head

2068
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
I had a very difficult in my own head
 

2069
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,089
I had a very difficult in my own head
Brave leap that I had to take relevant

2070
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:08,099
Brave leap that I had to take relevant
 

2071
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,309
Brave leap that I had to take relevant
to our discussion which is most of my

2072
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
to our discussion which is most of my
 

2073
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,770
to our discussion which is most of my
life I programmed in C and C plus plus

2074
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:12,780
life I programmed in C and C plus plus
 

2075
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,030
life I programmed in C and C plus plus
and so uh having that hammer everything

2076
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,040
and so uh having that hammer everything
 

2077
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,530
and so uh having that hammer everything
looked like a nail

2078
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:18,540
looked like a nail
 

2079
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,510
looked like a nail
so I would literally even do scripting

2080
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:20,520
so I would literally even do scripting
 

2081
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,730
so I would literally even do scripting
in C plus plus like I would create

2082
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:22,740
in C plus plus like I would create
 

2083
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,670
in C plus plus like I would create
programs that do script like things and

2084
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
programs that do script like things and
 

2085
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,370
programs that do script like things and
uh when I first came to Google and and

2086
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,380
uh when I first came to Google and and
 

2087
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,130
uh when I first came to Google and and
before then it became already before

2088
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,140
before then it became already before
 

2089
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,109
before then it became already before
tensorflow before all of that there was

2090
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
tensorflow before all of that there was
 

2091
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,290
tensorflow before all of that there was
a growing realization that c plus is not

2092
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,300
a growing realization that c plus is not
 

2093

the right tool for machine learning we

2094
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:38,760
the right tool for machine learning we
 

2095
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,309
the right tool for machine learning we
could talk about why that is it's

2096
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
could talk about why that is it's
 

2097
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,710
could talk about why that is it's
unclear why that is a lot of things

2098
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720
unclear why that is a lot of things
 

2099
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,650
unclear why that is a lot of things
has to do with community and culture and

2100
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:45,660
has to do with community and culture and
 

2101
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,690
has to do with community and culture and
how it emerges and stuff like that but

2102
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:47,700
how it emerges and stuff like that but
 

2103
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,730
how it emerges and stuff like that but
for me they decided to take the leap to

2104
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:49,740
for me they decided to take the leap to
 

2105
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,550
for me they decided to take the leap to
python like all out basically switched

there were still uh

2112
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
there were still uh
 

2113
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,790
there were still uh
there's still a culture of C plus plus

2114
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:01,800
there's still a culture of C plus plus
 

2115
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,309
there's still a culture of C plus plus

2117
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,710

that was a big leap

2118
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
that was a big leap
 

2119
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,290
that was a big leap
like I had to you know like like people

2120
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:09,300
like I had to you know like like people
 

2121
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,230

2125
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,910

almost like walking away from uh from a

question to say well that might not be

out there but then you have to just
 

2183
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,309
out there but then you have to just
empirically look and step back and say

empirically look and step back and say

I still do a lot of back-end programming
in PHP uh

2236
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:26,579
in PHP uh
 

2237
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,790
in PHP uh
and the question is you know node.js

2238
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
and the question is you know node.js
 

2239
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,309
and the question is you know node.js
python do you switch to do you switch

2240
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:31,319
python do you switch to do you switch
 

2241
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,109
python do you switch to do you switch
back into any of those

2242
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
back into any of those
 

2243
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,450
back into any of those
programming there's the case for node.js

2244
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:35,460
programming there's the case for node.js
 

2245
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,630
programming there's the case for node.js
for me well more and more and more of

2246
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
for me well more and more and more of
 

2247
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,589
for me well more and more and more of
the front end it runs in JavaScript

2248
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:42,599

 

2249
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,450

um and fascinating cool stuff is known

2250
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:44,460
um and fascinating cool stuff is known
 

2251
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,309
um and fascinating cool stuff is known
as JavaScript maybe use the same

2252
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
as JavaScript maybe use the same
 

2253
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,930
as JavaScript maybe use the same
programming language for the back end as

2254
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:47,940
programming language for the back end as
 

2255
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,650
programming language for the back end as
well

2256
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:48,660
well
 

2257
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,109
well
uh the case for python for the back end

2258
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
uh the case for python for the back end
 

2259
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,170
uh the case for python for the back end
is well you're doing so much programming

2260
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:54,180
is well you're doing so much programming
 

2261
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,990
is well you're doing so much programming
outside of the web in Python so maybe

2262
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:57,000
outside of the web in Python so maybe
 

2263
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,630
outside of the web in Python so maybe
use Python for the back end and then the

2264
00:48:59,630 --> 00:48:59,640
use Python for the back end and then the
 

2265
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,390
use Python for the back end and then the
case for PHP well most of the web still

2266
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
case for PHP well most of the web still
 

2267
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,010
case for PHP well most of the web still
runs in PHP

2268
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:04,020
runs in PHP
 

2269
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,950
runs in PHP
you have a lot of experience with PHP

2270
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
you have a lot of experience with PHP
 

2271
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,530
you have a lot of experience with PHP
why uh fix something that's not broken

2272
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:09,540
why uh fix something that's not broken
 

2273
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,290
why uh fix something that's not broken
those are my own personal struggles but

2274
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:12,300
those are my own personal struggles but
 

2275
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,849
those are my own personal struggles but
I think they reflect the struggles of a

2276
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:13,859
I think they reflect the struggles of a
 

2277
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,290
I think they reflect the struggles of a
lot of people and with different

2278
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:15,300
lot of people and with different
 

2279
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,730
lot of people and with different
programming languages with different

2280
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:16,740
programming languages with different
 

2281
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,010
programming languages with different
problems they're trying to solve it's a

2282
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,020
problems they're trying to solve it's a
 

2283
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,349
problems they're trying to solve it's a
weird one and there there's not a single

2284
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,359
weird one and there there's not a single
 

2285
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,589
weird one and there there's not a single
answer right because depending on how

2286
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:24,599
answer right because depending on how
 

2287
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,109
answer right because depending on how
much time you have to learn new stuff

2288
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
much time you have to learn new stuff
 

2289
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,230
much time you have to learn new stuff
where you are in your life what what

2290
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
where you are in your life what what
 

2291
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,150
where you are in your life what what
you're currently working on who you want

2292
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
you're currently working on who you want
 

2293
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,430
you're currently working on who you want
to work with what communities you like

2294
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:34,440
to work with what communities you like
 

2295
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,670
to work with what communities you like
yeah there's not one right choice

2296
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
yeah there's not one right choice
 

2297
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,430
yeah there's not one right choice
maybe if you if you sort of

2298
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:40,440
maybe if you if you sort of
 

2299
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,950
maybe if you if you sort of
if you can look back 20 years you can

2300
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
if you can look back 20 years you can
 

2301
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,109
if you can look back 20 years you can
say well that whole detour through

2302
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:45,119
say well that whole detour through
 

2303
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,690
say well that whole detour through
action script was a waste of time

2304
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:47,700
action script was a waste of time
 

2305
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,309
action script was a waste of time
but

2306
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:49,319
but
 

2307
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,650
but
nobody could know that

2308
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
nobody could know that
 

2309
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,349
nobody could know that
so you can you can beat yourself up over

2310
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:54,359
so you can you can beat yourself up over
 

2311
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,870
so you can you can beat yourself up over
that

2312
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:55,880
that
 

2313
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,790
that
uh you just need to accept that not

2314
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
uh you just need to accept that not
 

2315
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,650
uh you just need to accept that not
every choice you make

2316
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:00,660
every choice you make
 

2317
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,130
every choice you make
is going to be perfect maybe sort of

2318
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,140
is going to be perfect maybe sort of
 

2319
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,050
is going to be perfect maybe sort of
keep Plan B in the back of your mind

2320
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,060
keep Plan B in the back of your mind
 

2321
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:12,109
keep Plan B in the back of your mind
uh but don't don't overthink it don't

2322
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:12,119
uh but don't don't overthink it don't
 

2323
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,470
uh but don't don't overthink it don't
don't try to sort of don't don't create

2324
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:15,480
don't try to sort of don't don't create
 

2325
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,950
don't try to sort of don't don't create
a spreadsheet with like where you're

2326
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:18,960
a spreadsheet with like where you're
 

2327
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,190
a spreadsheet with like where you're
trying to estimate well if I learn this

2328
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,200
trying to estimate well if I learn this
 

2329
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,010
trying to estimate well if I learn this
language I expect to make x million

2330
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:25,020
language I expect to make x million
 

2331
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,809
language I expect to make x million
dollars in a lifetime and if I learn

2332
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:26,819
dollars in a lifetime and if I learn
 

2333
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,930
dollars in a lifetime and if I learn
that language I expect to make why a

2334
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:29,940
that language I expect to make why a
 

2335
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,809
that language I expect to make why a
million dollars in a lifetime and which

2336
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:32,819
million dollars in a lifetime and which
 

2337
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,450
million dollars in a lifetime and which
Which is higher and what which has more

2338
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:35,460
Which is higher and what which has more
 

2339
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,849
Which is higher and what which has more
risk and where's the chance that it's

2340
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:37,859
risk and where's the chance that it's
 

2341
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:42,010
risk and where's the chance that it's
like picking picking a stock

2342
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:42,020

 

2343
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,250

kind of kind of but uh

2344
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:46,260
kind of kind of but uh
 

2345
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,970
kind of kind of but uh
I think with stocks you can do

2346
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:48,980
I think with stocks you can do
 

2347
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,530
I think with stocks you can do
diversifying your investment as good

2348
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:51,540
diversifying your investment as good
 

2349
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,109
diversifying your investment as good
with productivity in life

2350
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:54,119
with productivity in life
 

2351
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,170
with productivity in life
boy that spreadsheet is possible to

2352
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:57,180
boy that spreadsheet is possible to
 

2353
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,910

there really is better and worse choices

2362
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
there really is better and worse choices
 

2363
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,089
there really is better and worse choices
for a programming language that are not

for a programming language that are not
 

2365
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,010
for a programming language that are not
just about the syntax but about the

just about the syntax but about the
 

2367
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,290
just about the syntax but about the

2374
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:21,900
that but can you create that spreadsheet
 

2375
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,410
that but can you create that spreadsheet
because that sort of you're mentioning a

2376
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:24,420
because that sort of you're mentioning a
 

2377
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,690
because that sort of you're mentioning a
whole bunch of inputs that go into that

00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:26,700
whole bunch of inputs that go into that
 

2379
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,609
whole bunch of inputs that go into that
spreadsheet where you have to estimate

2380
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:28,619
spreadsheet where you have to estimate
 

2381
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,250
spreadsheet where you have to estimate
things that are very hard to measure and

2382
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:31,260
things that are very hard to measure and
 

2383
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,829
things that are very hard to measure and
even harder I mean they're they're hard

2384
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
even harder I mean they're they're hard
 

2385
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,230
even harder I mean they're they're hard
to measure

2386
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:35,240
to measure
 

2387
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,549
to measure
retroactively and they're even harder to

2388
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:37,559
retroactively and they're even harder to
 

2389
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,829
retroactively and they're even harder to
predict like what is the better

2390
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
predict like what is the better
 

2391
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,030

community
 

2393
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,270
community

like you said C plus plus and python are

2452
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,520
like you said C plus plus and python are
 

2453
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,849
like you said C plus plus and python are
super active in terms of the development

but do you think that you can make

2458
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:57,559
but do you think that you can make
 

2459
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:00,530
but do you think that you can make
objective choices there no no but

objective choices there no no but
 

2461
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,290
objective choices there no no but
there's a gut you build up like don't

2462
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:03,300
there's a gut you build up like don't
 

2463
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,970
there's a gut you build up like don't
you don't you believe in that gut

2464
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:04,980
you don't you believe in that gut
 

2465
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,069
you don't you believe in that gut
feeling everything is very subjective

feeling everything is very subjective
 

2467
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,410
feeling everything is very subjective
and yes you most certainly can have a

and yes you most certainly can have a
 

2469
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,270
and yes you most certainly can have a

wrong that's why there are billions of

wrong that's why there are billions of
 

2473
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,430
wrong that's why there are billions of
people because they're not all right I

00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:16,440
people because they're not all right I
 

2475
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,410
people because they're not all right I
mean clearly there are more people

2476
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,420
mean clearly there are more people
 

2477
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,410

sort of create a Google sized company
 

2481
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,630
sort of create a Google sized company
then there's room in the world for

then there's room in the world for
 

2483
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,450
then there's room in the world for
Google sized companies and they're gonna

2484
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:29,460
Google sized companies and they're gonna
 

2485
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,270
Google sized companies and they're gonna
have to Duke it out in the market the

2486
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:32,280
have to Duke it out in the market the
 

2487
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,450
have to Duke it out in the market the
space and there's many more choices than

2488
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:35,460
space and there's many more choices than
 

2489
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,730

of which let's go back to the boat with

2492
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:40,440
of which let's go back to the boat with
 

2493
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,930
of which let's go back to the boat with

long ago I talked to the programmer

2496
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
long ago I talked to the programmer
 

2497
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,910
long ago I talked to the programmer
let's jump around and go back to see

2498
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:46,920
let's jump around and go back to see
 

2499
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,069
let's jump around and go back to see
python that we tried to Define as the

2500
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:49,079
python that we tried to Define as the
 

2501
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,170
python that we tried to Define as the
reference implementation and one of the

2502
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:51,180
reference implementation and one of the
 

2503
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,750
reference implementation and one of the
big things that's coming out in 3.11

2504
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
big things that's coming out in 3.11
 

2505
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,150
big things that's coming out in 3.11
what's the right way we tend to say 3.11

2506
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
what's the right way we tend to say 3.11
 

2507
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,390
what's the right way we tend to say 3.11
because it really was like we went 3.8

2508
00:53:59,390 --> 00:53:59,400
because it really was like we went 3.8
 

2509
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,049
because it really was like we went 3.8
3.9 3.10 3.11 and we're planning to go

2510
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:03,059
3.9 3.10 3.11 and we're planning to go
 

2511
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:07,130
3.9 3.10 3.11 and we're planning to go
up to 3.99 99 what happens after 99

2512
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,140
up to 3.99 99 what happens after 99
 

2513
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,370
up to 3.99 99 what happens after 99
probably just 3.100 what if I make it

2514
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:10,380
probably just 3.100 what if I make it
 

2515
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,690
probably just 3.100 what if I make it
there okay

2516
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:11,700
there okay
 

2517
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,910
there okay
and go all the way to 420. I got it

2518
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
and go all the way to 420. I got it
 

2519
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,250
and go all the way to 420. I got it
forever python V3 we'll talk about four

2520
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:16,260
forever python V3 we'll talk about four
 

2521
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,150
forever python V3 we'll talk about four
but more for fun

2522
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160

 

2523
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,030

so 3.11 is coming out one of the big

2524
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
so 3.11 is coming out one of the big
 

2525
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,010
so 3.11 is coming out one of the big
sexy things in it is it'll be much

2526
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:25,020
sexy things in it is it'll be much
 

2527
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,270
sexy things in it is it'll be much
faster so how did you beyond hiring a

2528
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
faster so how did you beyond hiring a
 

2529
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,190
faster so how did you beyond hiring a
great team or working with a great team

2530
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
great team or working with a great team
 

2531
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,069
great team or working with a great team
make it faster what are some ideas

2532
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
make it faster what are some ideas
 

2533
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,010
make it faster what are some ideas
uh that may makes it faster

2534
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,020
uh that may makes it faster
 

2535
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,849
uh that may makes it faster
it has to do with Simplicity of software

2536
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:40,859
it has to do with Simplicity of software
 

2537
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,770
it has to do with Simplicity of software
versus performance

2538
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:42,780
versus performance
 

2539
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,430
versus performance
and so even though C is known to be a

2540
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:46,440
and so even though C is known to be a
 

2541
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,650
and so even though C is known to be a
low-level language which is

2542
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:48,660
low-level language which is
 

2543
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,530
low-level language which is
great for writing sort of

2544
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:51,540
great for writing sort of
 

2545
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,010
great for writing sort of
a high performance language interpreter

2546
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:55,020
a high performance language interpreter
 

2547
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,970
a high performance language interpreter
when I originally started python or C

2548
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:58,980
when I originally started python or C
 

2549
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,049
when I originally started python or C
python

2550
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
python
 

2551
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,370
python
I

2552
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,380
I
 

2553
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,329
I
didn't expect there would be

2554
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:04,339
didn't expect there would be
 

2555
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:08,950
didn't expect there would be
great success and fame in my future

2556
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
great success and fame in my future
 

2557
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,569
great success and fame in my future
uh so I

2558
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:11,579
uh so I
 

2559
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:15,109
uh so I
I try to get something working

2560
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:15,119
I try to get something working
 

2561
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,870
I try to get something working
and useful

2562
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:17,880
and useful
 

2563
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,870
and useful
uh in about three months

2564
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
uh in about three months
 

2565
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,490
uh in about three months
and so I I sort of I cut corners

2566
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:25,500
and so I I sort of I cut corners
 

2567
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,030
and so I I sort of I cut corners
I borrowed ideas left and right when it

2568
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
I borrowed ideas left and right when it
 

2569
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,010
I borrowed ideas left and right when it
comes to language design as well as

2570
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,020
comes to language design as well as
 

2571
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,809
comes to language design as well as
implementation

2572
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:32,819
implementation
 

2573
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:36,530
implementation
uh I also wrote much of the code as

2574
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:36,540
uh I also wrote much of the code as
 

2575
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,510
uh I also wrote much of the code as
simple as it could be

2576
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:38,520
simple as it could be
 

2577
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,490
simple as it could be
and

2578
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:40,500
and
 

2579
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,530
and
they're they're like

2580
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:42,540
they're they're like
 

2581
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,309
they're they're like
there are many things that you can code

2582
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:45,319
there are many things that you can code
 

2583
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:49,790
there are many things that you can code
more efficiently by adding more code

2584
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:49,800
more efficiently by adding more code
 

2585
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,089
more efficiently by adding more code
it's a bit of a sort of a time space

2586
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:53,099
it's a bit of a sort of a time space
 

2587
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,190
it's a bit of a sort of a time space
trade-off

2588
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200
trade-off
 

2589
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,910
trade-off
where you can compute a certain thing

2590
00:55:58,910 --> 00:55:58,920
where you can compute a certain thing
 

2591
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,970
where you can compute a certain thing
from a small number of inputs

2592
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:01,980
from a small number of inputs
 

2593
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,970
from a small number of inputs
uh and every time you get presented with

2594
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:04,980
uh and every time you get presented with
 

2595
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,349
uh and every time you get presented with
new input

2596
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:06,359
new input
 

2597
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,930
new input
uh you do the whole computation from the

2598
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:08,940
uh you do the whole computation from the
 

2599
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,790
uh you do the whole computation from the
top

2600
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:09,800
top
 

2601
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,710
top
that can be simple looking code it's

2602
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
that can be simple looking code it's
 

2603
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,930
that can be simple looking code it's
easy to understand it's easy to reason

2604
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:14,940
easy to understand it's easy to reason
 

2605
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,390
easy to understand it's easy to reason
about that you can you can tell quickly

2606
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:17,400
about that you can you can tell quickly
 

2607
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,849
about that you can you can tell quickly
that it's correct in at least in the

2608
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:19,859
that it's correct in at least in the
 

2609
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:24,069
that it's correct in at least in the
sort of mathematical sense of correct

2610
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:24,079
sort of mathematical sense of correct
 

2611
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,049
sort of mathematical sense of correct
uh because it's implemented in C maybe

2612
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:27,059
uh because it's implemented in C maybe
 

2613
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:30,530
uh because it's implemented in C maybe
it performs relatively well

2614
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:30,540
it performs relatively well
 

2615
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,849
it performs relatively well
but over time as sort of

2616
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:34,859
but over time as sort of
 

2617
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,910
but over time as sort of
as the requirements for that code and

2618
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:37,920
as the requirements for that code and
 

2619
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,370
as the requirements for that code and
the need for performance

2620
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:40,380
the need for performance
 

2621
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,930
the need for performance
go up

2622
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:41,940
go up
 

2623
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,569
go up
you might be able to rewrite that same

2624
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:44,579
you might be able to rewrite that same
 

2625
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:45,950
you might be able to rewrite that same
algorithm

2626
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:45,960
algorithm
 

2627
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,910
algorithm
using more memory maybe remember

2628
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
using more memory maybe remember
 

2629
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,950
using more memory maybe remember
previous results

2630
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:51,960
previous results
 

2631
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,750
previous results
so you don't have to recompute

2632
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:53,760
so you don't have to recompute
 

2633
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,150
so you don't have to recompute
everything from scratch like the the

2634
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
everything from scratch like the the
 

2635
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,250
everything from scratch like the the
classic example is Computing prime

2636
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:58,260
classic example is Computing prime
 

2637
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,270
classic example is Computing prime
numbers

2638
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
numbers
 

2639
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,710
numbers
like

2640
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
like
 

2641
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,230
like
is 10 a prime number

2642
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:03,240
is 10 a prime number
 

2643
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,230
is 10 a prime number
well you sort of is it divisible by two

2644
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
well you sort of is it divisible by two
 

2645
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,450
well you sort of is it divisible by two
is it divisible by three is it divisible

2646
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:08,460
is it divisible by three is it divisible
 

2647
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,569
is it divisible by three is it divisible
by four and we go all the way to is it

2648
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:11,579
by four and we go all the way to is it
 

2649
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,750
by four and we go all the way to is it
divisible by 9. and it is not well

2650
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:14,760
divisible by 9. and it is not well
 

2651
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,510
divisible by 9. and it is not well
actually 10 is divisible by two so there

2652
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
actually 10 is divisible by two so there
 

2653
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,150
actually 10 is divisible by two so there
we stop but say 11. it's divisible by

2654
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
we stop but say 11. it's divisible by
 

2655
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,970
we stop but say 11. it's divisible by
ten the answer is nine is no ten times

2656
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:22,980
ten the answer is nine is no ten times
 

2657
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,250
ten the answer is nine is no ten times
in a row so now we know 11 is a prime

2658
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:25,260
in a row so now we know 11 is a prime
 

2659
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,690
in a row so now we know 11 is a prime
number

2660
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:26,700
number
 

2661
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,910
number
on the other hand if we already know

2662
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:28,920
on the other hand if we already know
 

2663
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,630
on the other hand if we already know
that 2 3 5 and 7 are prime numbers and

2664
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
that 2 3 5 and 7 are prime numbers and
 

2665
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,950
that 2 3 5 and 7 are prime numbers and
you know a little bit about the

2666
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:33,960
you know a little bit about the
 

2667
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,829
you know a little bit about the
mathematics of how prime numbers work

2668
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:36,839
mathematics of how prime numbers work
 

2669
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,410
mathematics of how prime numbers work
you know that if you have a rough

2670
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:39,420
you know that if you have a rough
 

2671
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,650
you know that if you have a rough
estimate for the square root of 11 you

2672
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:42,660
estimate for the square root of 11 you
 

2673
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,630
estimate for the square root of 11 you
don't actually have to check is it

2674
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
don't actually have to check is it
 

2675
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,390
don't actually have to check is it
divisible by four or is it divisible by

2676
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:47,400
divisible by four or is it divisible by
 

2677
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,430
divisible by four or is it divisible by
five you all you have to check in the

2678
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
five you all you have to check in the
 

2679
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,770
five you all you have to check in the
case of 11 is is it divisible by 2 is it

2680
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:51,780
case of 11 is is it divisible by 2 is it
 

2681
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,569
case of 11 is is it divisible by 2 is it
divisible by three

2682
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:53,579
divisible by three
 

2683
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,849
divisible by three
because take 12.

2684
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:55,859
because take 12.
 

2685
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:59,150
because take 12.
if it's divisible by 4 well 12 divided

2686
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,160
if it's divisible by 4 well 12 divided
 

2687
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,970
if it's divisible by 4 well 12 divided
by 4 is 3 so you you should have come

2688
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:01,980
by 4 is 3 so you you should have come
 

2689
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,190
by 4 is 3 so you you should have come
across the question is it divisible by 3

2690
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:04,200
across the question is it divisible by 3
 

2691
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,690
across the question is it divisible by 3
first

2692
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:05,700
first
 

2693
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,150
first
so if you know basically nothing about

2694
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,160
so if you know basically nothing about
 

2695
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,069
so if you know basically nothing about
prime numbers except the definition

2696
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
prime numbers except the definition
 

2697
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,210
prime numbers except the definition
maybe you go for X from 2

2698
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,220
maybe you go for X from 2
 

2699
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,190
maybe you go for X from 2
through n minus 1 is n divisible by X

2700
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,200
through n minus 1 is n divisible by X
 

2701
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,390
through n minus 1 is n divisible by X
and then at the end if you got uh all

2702
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:23,400
and then at the end if you got uh all
 

2703
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,210
and then at the end if you got uh all
no's uh for every single one of those

2704
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:26,220
no's uh for every single one of those
 

2705
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,270
no's uh for every single one of those
questions you know oh it must be a prime

2706
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:29,280
questions you know oh it must be a prime
 

2707
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,250
questions you know oh it must be a prime
number well the first thing is you can

2708
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:31,260
number well the first thing is you can
 

2709
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,829
number well the first thing is you can
stop iterating when you find a yes

2710
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
stop iterating when you find a yes
 

2711
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:34,910
stop iterating when you find a yes
answer

2712
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:34,920
answer
 

2713
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,130
answer
and the second is you can also stop

2714
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,140
and the second is you can also stop
 

2715
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,950
and the second is you can also stop
iterating when you have have reached

2716
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:39,960
iterating when you have have reached
 

2717
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,670
iterating when you have have reached
the square root of n because you know

2718
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
the square root of n because you know
 

2719
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,250
the square root of n because you know
that if it has a divisor larger than

2720
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:46,260
that if it has a divisor larger than
 

2721
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,589
that if it has a divisor larger than
than the square root did not also have a

2722
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:48,599
than the square root did not also have a
 

2723
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,069
than the square root did not also have a
divisor smaller than the square root

2724
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:51,079
divisor smaller than the square root
 

2725
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:54,650
divisor smaller than the square root
then you say oh except for two we don't

2726
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:54,660
then you say oh except for two we don't
 

2727
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,450
then you say oh except for two we don't
need to bother with checking for even

2728
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:56,460
need to bother with checking for even
 

2729
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,430
need to bother with checking for even
numbers because all even numbers are

2730
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:58,440
numbers because all even numbers are
 

2731
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,950
numbers because all even numbers are
divisible by two so if it's divisible by

2732
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
divisible by two so if it's divisible by
 

2733
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,150
divisible by two so if it's divisible by
four

2734
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
four
 

2735
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,430
four
we would already have come across the

2736
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:04,440
we would already have come across the
 

2737
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,470
we would already have come across the
question is it divisible by two and so

2738
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
question is it divisible by two and so
 

2739
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,930
question is it divisible by two and so
now you go special case check is a

2740
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:08,940
now you go special case check is a
 

2741
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,030
now you go special case check is a
divisible by two and then you just check

2742
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,040
divisible by two and then you just check
 

2743
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,329
divisible by two and then you just check
three five seven eleven

2744
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:13,339
three five seven eleven
 

2745
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:15,950
three five seven eleven
uh and so now you've you've sort of

2746
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:15,960
uh and so now you've you've sort of
 

2747
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,069
uh and so now you've you've sort of
reduced your search Pace by 50 Again by

2748
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:19,079
reduced your search Pace by 50 Again by
 

2749
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,349
reduced your search Pace by 50 Again by
by skipping all the even numbers I kept

2750
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
by skipping all the even numbers I kept
 

2751
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,430
by skipping all the even numbers I kept
for two

2752
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:22,440
for two
 

2753
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,370
for two
if you think a bit more about it or you

2754
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,380
if you think a bit more about it or you
 

2755
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,210
if you think a bit more about it or you
just

2756
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:26,220
just
 

2757
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,370
just
read in your book about the history of

2758
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:28,380
read in your book about the history of
 

2759
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,010
read in your book about the history of
math one of the first algorithms ever

2760
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,020
math one of the first algorithms ever
 

2761
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,809
math one of the first algorithms ever
written down

2763
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,329
written down
all you have to do is check is it

2764
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:35,339
all you have to do is check is it
 

2765
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,609
all you have to do is check is it
divisible by any of the previous prime

2766
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:37,619
divisible by any of the previous prime
 

2767
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:40,010
divisible by any of the previous prime
numbers that are smaller than the square

2768
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,020
numbers that are smaller than the square
 

2769
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:40,910
numbers that are smaller than the square
root

2770
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:40,920
root
 

2771
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,630
root
and before you get to a better algorithm

2772
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
and before you get to a better algorithm
 

2773
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,390
and before you get to a better algorithm
than that

2774
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
than that
 

2775
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,289
than that
you have to have several phds in in

2776
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:51,299
you have to have several phds in in
 

2777
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,870
you have to have several phds in in
discrete math so that's as much as I

2778
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:53,880
discrete math so that's as much as I
 

2779
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,150
discrete math so that's as much as I
know so of course that same story

2780
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
know so of course that same story
 

2781
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,950
know so of course that same story
applies to a lot of other algorithms

2782
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:57,960
applies to a lot of other algorithms
 

2783
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,990
applies to a lot of other algorithms
string matching is a good example

2784
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
string matching is a good example
 

2785
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,750
string matching is a good example
of uh how to come up with an efficient

2786
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:02,760
of uh how to come up with an efficient
 

2787
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,150
of uh how to come up with an efficient
algorithm and sometimes yeah the more

01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:05,160
algorithm and sometimes yeah the more
 

2789
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,770

efficient algorithm is not so much more

2790
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:06,780
efficient algorithm is not so much more
 

2791
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,109
efficient algorithm is not so much more
complex than the inefficient one but

2792
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
complex than the inefficient one but
 

2793
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,109
complex than the inefficient one but
that's an art and it's not always the

2794
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:12,119
that's an art and it's not always the
 

2795
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,930
that's an art and it's not always the

01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:14,940
case in the general cases the more
 

2797
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,450

01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:17,460
performant the algorithm the more
 

2799
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,250
performant the algorithm the more

there's a kind of trade-off the simpler

2802
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:21,660
there's a kind of trade-off the simpler
 

2803
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,589
there's a kind of trade-off the simpler
algorithms are also the ones that people

2804
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:24,599
algorithms are also the ones that people
 

2805
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,630
algorithms are also the ones that people
invent first

2806
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:26,640
invent first
 

2807
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,490
invent first
because when you're looking for a

2808
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:28,500
because when you're looking for a
 

2809
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,630
because when you're looking for a
solution

2810
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:29,640
solution
 

2811
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,849
solution
you look at the simplest way to get

2812
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:31,859
you look at the simplest way to get
 

2813
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:33,230
you look at the simplest way to get
there first

2814
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:33,240
there first
 

2815
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,490
there first
and so if there is a simple solution

2816
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:36,500
and so if there is a simple solution
 

2817
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,589
and so if there is a simple solution
even if it's not the best solution not

2818
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:39,599
even if it's not the best solution not
 

2819
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,049
even if it's not the best solution not
the fastest or the memory most memory

fairly subjective but mathematicians
 

2827
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,690
fairly subjective but mathematicians
have also thought about sort of what is

01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:53,700
have also thought about sort of what is
 

2829
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,670
have also thought about sort of what is
a good definition for simple in the case

2830
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
a good definition for simple in the case
 

2831
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,589
a good definition for simple in the case
of algorithms

2832
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
of algorithms
 

2833
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,730
of algorithms
uh but the simpler the simpler Solutions

2834
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:00,740
uh but the simpler the simpler Solutions
 

2835
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,870
uh but the simpler the simpler Solutions
tend to be

01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
tend to be
 

2837
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,170
tend to be
easier to follow for other programmers

01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:06,180
easier to follow for other programmers
 

2839
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,990
easier to follow for other programmers
who haven't made a study of a particular

who haven't made a study of a particular
 

2841
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,030
who haven't made a study of a particular
field and when I when I started with

2842
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
field and when I when I started with
 

2843
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,210
field and when I when I started with
python I I was a good programmer in

2844
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:14,220
python I I was a good programmer in
 

2845
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,190
python I I was a good programmer in
general I knew sort of basic data

2846
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:16,200
general I knew sort of basic data
 

2847
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,049
general I knew sort of basic data
structures I knew the C language pretty

2848
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:18,059
structures I knew the C language pretty
 

2849
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:19,130
structures I knew the C language pretty
well

2850
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,140
well
 

2851
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,930
well
but there were many areas where I was

2852
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:23,940
but there were many areas where I was
 

2853
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,130
but there were many areas where I was
only somewhat familiar with the state of

2854
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,140
only somewhat familiar with the state of

the art
 

2857
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,930
the art
and so I I picked

01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:32,940
and so I I picked
 

2859
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,690
and so I I picked
in many cases the simplest way I could

01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:35,700
in many cases the simplest way I could
 

2861
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,789
in many cases the simplest way I could
solve a particular sub problem because

01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:42,299
implementing a language you have to like
 

2867
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,390
implementing a language you have to like
you've many hundreds of little problems

2868
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400
you've many hundreds of little problems
 

2869
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,770
you've many hundreds of little problems
to solve

2870
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:45,780
to solve
 

2871
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,890
to solve
and you have to have solutions for every

2872
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:48,900
and you have to have solutions for every
 

2873
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,190
and you have to have solutions for every
one of them before you can can sort of

2874
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:52,200
one of them before you can can sort of
 

2875
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,089
one of them before you can can sort of
say I've invented a programming language

2876
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:56,099
say I've invented a programming language
 

2877
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:59,510
say I've invented a programming language
first of all so see python what kind of

2878
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
first of all so see python what kind of
 

2879
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,990
first of all so see python what kind of
things does it do it's an interpreter it

2880
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:03,000
things does it do it's an interpreter it
 

2881
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,210
things does it do it's an interpreter it
takes in this readable language that we

2882
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:05,220
takes in this readable language that we
 

2883
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,609
takes in this readable language that we
talked about that is python what is it

2884
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:07,619
talked about that is python what is it
 

2885
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:09,770
talked about that is python what is it
supposed to do The Interpreter basically

2886
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:09,780
supposed to do The Interpreter basically
 

2887
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,690
supposed to do The Interpreter basically
it's it's sort of a recipe for

2888
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:13,700
it's it's sort of a recipe for
 

2889
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,789
it's it's sort of a recipe for
understanding recipes

2890
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
understanding recipes
 

2891
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,690
understanding recipes
so instead of a recipe that says bake me

2892
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:20,700
so instead of a recipe that says bake me
 

2893
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,329
so instead of a recipe that says bake me
a cake we have a recipe for

2894
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:23,339
a cake we have a recipe for
 

2895
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,250
a cake we have a recipe for
well given

2896
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:25,260
well given
 

2897
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,789
well given
the text of a program

2898
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:28,799
the text of a program
 

2899
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,849
the text of a program
how do we run that program and and that

2900
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:31,859
how do we run that program and and that
 

2901
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:33,710
how do we run that program and and that
is sort of the recipe for building a

2902
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:33,720
is sort of the recipe for building a
 

2903
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,990
is sort of the recipe for building a
computer the recipe for the Baker and

2904
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,000
computer the recipe for the Baker and
 

2905
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,829
computer the recipe for the Baker and
the chef yeah what are the

2906
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:38,839
the chef yeah what are the
 

2907
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,990
the chef yeah what are the
algorithmically tricky things that

2908
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
algorithmically tricky things that
 

2909
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,750
algorithmically tricky things that
happen to be low-hanging fruit that

2910
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:44,760
happen to be low-hanging fruit that
 

2911
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,549
happen to be low-hanging fruit that
could be improved on maybe throughout

2912
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:46,559
could be improved on maybe throughout
 

2913
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,250
could be improved on maybe throughout
the history of python but also now how

2914
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:49,260
the history of python but also now how
 

2915
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,309
the history of python but also now how
is it possible that 3.11 in year 2022

2916
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
is it possible that 3.11 in year 2022
 

2917
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,230
is it possible that 3.11 in year 2022
it's possible to get such a big

2918
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
it's possible to get such a big
 

2919
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,809
it's possible to get such a big
performance Improvement

we focused

2922
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839

 

2923
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:05,210

on a few areas where we we still felt

2924
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:05,220
on a few areas where we we still felt
 

2925
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,609
on a few areas where we we still felt
there was low hanging fruit

2926
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:07,619
there was low hanging fruit
 

2927
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,710
there was low hanging fruit
the biggest one is actually The

01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:09,720
the biggest one is actually The
 

2929
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,510
the biggest one is actually The

and this has to do with details of Pi

2932
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:14,579
and this has to do with details of Pi

how python is defined so I didn't know

2934
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:17,700
how python is defined so I didn't know

01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:20,339
if the fisherman is going to follow this
 

2937
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,250

stupid python is actually even though

2942
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:28,859
stupid python is actually even though
 

2943
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:30,829
stupid python is actually even though
it's always called an interpreted

2944
01:03:30,829 --> 01:03:30,839
it's always called an interpreted
 

2945
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:33,770
it's always called an interpreted
language it's there's also a compiler in

2946
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:33,780
language it's there's also a compiler in
 

2947
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,630
language it's there's also a compiler in
there it just doesn't compile to machine

2948
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:35,640
there it just doesn't compile to machine
 

2949
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,010
there it just doesn't compile to machine
code it compiles to bytecode which is

2950
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,020
code it compiles to bytecode which is
 

2951
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,089
code it compiles to bytecode which is
sort of code for an imaginary computer

2952
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:43,099
sort of code for an imaginary computer
 

2953
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,890
sort of code for an imaginary computer
that is called the python interpreter so

2954
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:45,900
that is called the python interpreter so
 

2955
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,589
that is called the python interpreter so
it's compiling code that is more easily

2956
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:48,599
it's compiling code that is more easily
 

2957
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,510
it's compiling code that is more easily
digestible by The Interpreter or is

2958
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:50,520
digestible by The Interpreter or is
 

2959
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,730
digestible by The Interpreter or is
digestible at all it is the code that is

2960
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:52,740
digestible at all it is the code that is
 

2961
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,829
digestible at all it is the code that is
digested by The Interpreter that's the

2962
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:54,839
digested by The Interpreter that's the
 

2963
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,349
digested by The Interpreter that's the
compiler we tweaked very minor bits of

2964
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
compiler we tweaked very minor bits of
 

2965
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,569
compiler we tweaked very minor bits of
the compiler almost all the work was

2966
01:03:59,569 --> 01:03:59,579
the compiler almost all the work was
 

2967
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:01,670
the compiler almost all the work was
done in The Interpreter

2968
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
done in The Interpreter
 

2969
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,470
done in The Interpreter
because

2970
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:03,480
because
 

2971
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,530
because
when you have a program you compile it

2972
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:06,540
when you have a program you compile it
 

2973
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,809
when you have a program you compile it
once and then you run the code a whole

2974
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:08,819
once and then you run the code a whole
 

2975
01:04:08,819 --> 01:04:10,250
once and then you run the code a whole
bunch of times

2976
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:10,260
bunch of times
 

2977
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,890
bunch of times
or maybe there's one function in the in

2978
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:12,900
or maybe there's one function in the in
 

2979
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,789
or maybe there's one function in the in
the code that gets run many times

2980
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
the code that gets run many times
 

2981
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,970
the code that gets run many times
now I know that that sort of people who

2982
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:19,980
now I know that that sort of people who
 

2983
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,970
now I know that that sort of people who
who know this field are expecting me to

2984
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:22,980
who know this field are expecting me to
 

2985
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,609
who know this field are expecting me to
at some point say we built adjusting

2986
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:25,619
at some point say we built adjusting
 

2987
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:28,309
at some point say we built adjusting
time compiler actually we didn't we just

2988
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:28,319
time compiler actually we didn't we just
 

2989
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,950
time compiler actually we didn't we just
made The Interpreter uh a little more

2990
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
made The Interpreter uh a little more
 

2991
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,309
made The Interpreter uh a little more
efficient what's adjust in time compiler

2992
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
efficient what's adjust in time compiler
 

2993
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,190
efficient what's adjust in time compiler
that is a thing from the Java World

2994
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
that is a thing from the Java World
 

2995
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,309
that is a thing from the Java World
although it's now applied to almost all

2996
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
although it's now applied to almost all
 

2997
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,010
although it's now applied to almost all
uh programming languages especially

2998
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:43,020
uh programming languages especially
 

2999
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,010
uh programming languages especially
interpreted ones so you see the compile

3000
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:46,020
interpreted ones so you see the compile
 

3001
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,190
interpreted ones so you see the compile
inside python not like a just-in-time

3002
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,200
inside python not like a just-in-time
 

3003
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,750
inside python not like a just-in-time
compiler but is it compiler that creates

01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:50,760
compiler but is it compiler that creates
 

3005
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,549
compiler but is it compiler that creates
by code that is then

by code that is then
 

3007
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,569
by code that is then
fed to The Interpreter and the compiler

3008
01:04:56,569 --> 01:04:56,579
fed to The Interpreter and the compiler
 

3009
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:58,010
fed to The Interpreter and the compiler
was there something interesting to say

3010
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:58,020
was there something interesting to say
 

3011
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,510
was there something interesting to say
about the compiler it's interesting that

3012
01:04:59,510 --> 01:04:59,520
about the compiler it's interesting that
 

3013
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,829
about the compiler it's interesting that
you haven't changed that tweak that at

3014
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:00,839
you haven't changed that tweak that at
 

3015
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,670
you haven't changed that tweak that at
all or much we changed some parts of the

3016
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
all or much we changed some parts of the
 

3017
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,930
all or much we changed some parts of the
byte code

3018
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:05,940
byte code
 

3019
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,829
byte code
but not very much and so we only had to

3020
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:09,839
but not very much and so we only had to
 

3021
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,809
but not very much and so we only had to
change the parts of the compiler where

3022
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:11,819
change the parts of the compiler where
 

3023
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,450
change the parts of the compiler where
we decided that the the breakdown of a

3024
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:14,460
we decided that the the breakdown of a
 

3025
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,670
we decided that the the breakdown of a
Python program in bytecode instructions

3026
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:16,680
Python program in bytecode instructions
 

3027
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,130
Python program in bytecode instructions
had to be slightly different

3028
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:19,140
had to be slightly different
 

3029
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,770
had to be slightly different
but

3030
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:21,780
but
 

3031
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:25,490
but
that did that didn't gain us the

3032
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:25,500
that did that didn't gain us the
 

3033
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,549
that did that didn't gain us the
performance uh improvements that

3034
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
performance uh improvements that
 

3035
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,190
performance uh improvements that
performance improvements were like

3036
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
performance improvements were like
 

3037
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,849
performance improvements were like
making The Interpreter faster in part by

3038
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:34,859
making The Interpreter faster in part by
 

3039
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,789
making The Interpreter faster in part by
sort of

3040
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
sort of
 

3041
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,130
sort of
removing the fat from some internal data

3042
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:40,140
removing the fat from some internal data
 

3043
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,089
removing the fat from some internal data
structures used by The Interpreter but

3044
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:43,099
structures used by The Interpreter but
 

3045
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:47,170
structures used by The Interpreter but
uh the the key idea is an Adaptive

3046
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:47,180
uh the the key idea is an Adaptive
 

3047
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,670
uh the the key idea is an Adaptive
specializing interpreter

3048
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
specializing interpreter
 

3049
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,549
specializing interpreter
let's go what is adaptive about it what

3050
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
let's go what is adaptive about it what
 

3051
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,770
let's go what is adaptive about it what
is specialized about it well let me

3052
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:54,780
is specialized about it well let me
 

3053
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,750
is specialized about it well let me
first talk about the specializing part

3054
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
first talk about the specializing part
 

3055
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,230
first talk about the specializing part
because the Adaptive part is the sort of

3056
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
because the Adaptive part is the sort of
 

3057
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,450
because the Adaptive part is the sort of
the second order effect but they're both

3058
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:02,460
the second order effect but they're both
 

3059
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,270
the second order effect but they're both
important so bytecode

3060
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,280
important so bytecode
 

3061
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,750
important so bytecode
is a bunch of machine instructions but

3062
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:08,760
is a bunch of machine instructions but
 

3063
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,270
is a bunch of machine instructions but
it's an imaginary machine but the

3064
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
it's an imaginary machine but the
 

3065
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,849
it's an imaginary machine but the
machine can do things like call a

3066
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:13,859
machine can do things like call a
 

3067
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:14,809
machine can do things like call a
function

3068
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:14,819
function
 

3069
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:16,849
function
add two numbers

3070
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:16,859
add two numbers
 

3071
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:18,770
add two numbers
print value

3072
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:18,780
print value
 

3073
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,870
print value
those are sort of typical instructions

3074
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
those are sort of typical instructions
 

3075
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,450
those are sort of typical instructions
in Python

3076
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:22,460
in Python
 

3077
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:27,289
in Python
uh and if we take the example of adding

3078
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:27,299
uh and if we take the example of adding
 

3079
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:28,730
uh and if we take the example of adding
two numbers

3080
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:28,740
two numbers
 

3081
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,849
two numbers
actually in Python the language there's

3082
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:31,859
actually in Python the language there's
 

3083
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,890
actually in Python the language there's
no such thing as adding two numbers

3084
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:33,900
no such thing as adding two numbers
 

3085
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,329
no such thing as adding two numbers
there's just an the the compiler

3086
01:06:37,329 --> 01:06:37,339
there's just an the the compiler
 

3087
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:39,529
there's just an the the compiler
doesn't know that you're adding two

3088
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:39,539
doesn't know that you're adding two
 

3089
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:41,569
doesn't know that you're adding two
numbers you might as well be adding two

3090
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:41,579
numbers you might as well be adding two
 

3091
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:43,809
numbers you might as well be adding two
strings or two lists

3092
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:43,819
strings or two lists
 

3093
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:47,690
strings or two lists
uh or two instances of some user-defined

3094
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:47,700
uh or two instances of some user-defined
 

3095
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,029
uh or two instances of some user-defined
class that happen to implement this

3096
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:50,039
class that happen to implement this
 

3097
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,250
class that happen to implement this
operator called add

3098
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:52,260
operator called add
 

3099
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:55,370
operator called add
that's a very interesting and and fairly

3100
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:55,380
that's a very interesting and and fairly
 

3101
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,130
that's a very interesting and and fairly
powerful mathematical concept it's

3102
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,140
powerful mathematical concept it's
 

3103
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,529
powerful mathematical concept it's
mostly a user interface trick because it

3104
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:00,539
mostly a user interface trick because it
 

3105
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,569
mostly a user interface trick because it
means that

3106
01:07:02,569 --> 01:07:02,579
means that
 

3107
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:05,450
means that
a certain category of functions

3108
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:05,460
a certain category of functions
 

3109
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,450
a certain category of functions
can be written using a symbols single

3110
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:08,460
can be written using a symbols single
 

3111
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,210
can be written using a symbols single
symbol the plus sign

3112
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:10,220
symbol the plus sign
 

3113
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:13,010
symbol the plus sign
and sort of a bunch of other functions

3114
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:13,020
and sort of a bunch of other functions
 

3115
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,750
and sort of a bunch of other functions
can be written using another single

3116
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:14,760
can be written using another single
 

3117
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,569
can be written using another single
symbol the multiply sign

3118
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:17,579
symbol the multiply sign
 

3119
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,309
symbol the multiply sign
uh so if we take addition the way

3120
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:21,319
uh so if we take addition the way
 

3121
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:24,589
uh so if we take addition the way
traditionally in Python the ad byte code

3122
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:24,599
traditionally in Python the ad byte code
 

3123
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,430
traditionally in Python the ad byte code
was executed is

3124
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:28,440

 

3125
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,970

pointers pointers and more pointers so

3126
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:31,980
pointers pointers and more pointers so
 

3127
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,210
pointers pointers and more pointers so
first we we have two objects an object

3128
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:35,220
first we we have two objects an object
 

3129
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,490
first we we have two objects an object
is basically a pointer to a bunch of

3130
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:37,500
is basically a pointer to a bunch of
 

3131
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,230
is basically a pointer to a bunch of
memory that contains more pointers

3132
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:39,240
memory that contains more pointers
 

3133
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,510
memory that contains more pointers
pointers all the way down

3134
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
pointers all the way down
 

3135
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,549
pointers all the way down
not quite but there there are a lot of

3136
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:43,559
not quite but there there are a lot of
 

3137
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,930
not quite but there there are a lot of
them so to simplify a bit uh we look up

3138
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:47,940
them so to simplify a bit uh we look up
 

3139
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,230
them so to simplify a bit uh we look up
in one of the objects

3140
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:51,240
in one of the objects
 

3141
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,109
in one of the objects
what is the type of that object and does

3142
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:54,119
what is the type of that object and does
 

3143
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,609
what is the type of that object and does
that object type Define an add operation

3144
01:07:58,609 --> 01:07:58,619
that object type Define an add operation
 

3145
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:02,270
that object type Define an add operation
and so you can imagine that there is a

3146
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:02,280
and so you can imagine that there is a
 

3147
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,089
and so you can imagine that there is a
sort of a type integer that knows how to

3148
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:05,099
sort of a type integer that knows how to
 

3149
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:08,029
sort of a type integer that knows how to
add itself to another integer and there

3150
01:08:08,029 --> 01:08:08,039
add itself to another integer and there
 

3151
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:09,890
add itself to another integer and there
is a type floating Point number that

3152
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:09,900
is a type floating Point number that
 

3153
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,750
is a type floating Point number that
knows how to add itself

3154
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
knows how to add itself
 

3155
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,029
knows how to add itself
to another floating Point number

3156
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,039
to another floating Point number
 

3157
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,209
to another floating Point number
and the integers and floating Point

3158
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:17,219
and the integers and floating Point
 

3159
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:20,749
and the integers and floating Point
numbers are sort of important I think

3160
01:08:20,749 --> 01:08:20,759
numbers are sort of important I think
 

3161
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,030
numbers are sort of important I think
mostly historically because in the first

3162
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
mostly historically because in the first
 

3163
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,910
mostly historically because in the first
computers

3164
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:24,920
computers
 

3165
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,669
computers
uh you use the sort of the same bit

3166
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:28,679
uh you use the sort of the same bit
 

3167
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:30,890
uh you use the sort of the same bit
pattern when interpreted as a floating

3168
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:30,900
pattern when interpreted as a floating
 

3169
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,809
pattern when interpreted as a floating
Point number had a very different value

3170
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:32,819
Point number had a very different value
 

3171
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:35,450
Point number had a very different value
than we interpret it as an integer can I

3172
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:35,460
than we interpret it as an integer can I
 

3173
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,370
than we interpret it as an integer can I
ask a dumb question here please do given

01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:37,380
ask a dumb question here please do given
 

3175

01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
carries the knowledge of how to add two
 

3179
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,490

01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:53,630
the type float what about the operator
is the operator

3186
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:53,640
is the operator
 

3187
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,169
is the operator
just exists as a platonic form possessed

3188
01:08:57,169 --> 01:08:57,179
just exists as a platonic form possessed
 

3189
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:04,430
just exists as a platonic form possessed
by uh the operator is more like

3190
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:04,440
by uh the operator is more like
 

3191
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,510
by uh the operator is more like
it's an index in a list of functions

3192
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:08,520
it's an index in a list of functions
 

3193
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,809
it's an index in a list of functions
that the integer type defines

3194
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:11,819
that the integer type defines
 

3195
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:15,169
that the integer type defines
and so the integer type

3196
01:09:15,169 --> 01:09:15,179
and so the integer type
 

3197
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,769
and so the integer type
is really a collection of functions and

3198
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:18,779
is really a collection of functions and
 

3199
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,749
is really a collection of functions and
there is an add function and there's a

3200
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:20,759
there is an add function and there's a
 

3201
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,090
there is an add function and there's a
multiply function and there are like 30

3202
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:23,100
multiply function and there are like 30
 

3203
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,070
multiply function and there are like 30
other functions for other operations

3204
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:25,080
other functions for other operations
 

3205
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,829
other functions for other operations
there's a power function for example

3206
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
there's a power function for example
 

3207
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,209
there's a power function for example
and

3208
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:29,219
and
 

3209
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,490
and
you can imagine that

3210
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:31,500
you can imagine that
 

3211
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,390
you can imagine that
in in memory there is a distinct slot

3212
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:35,400
in in memory there is a distinct slot
 

3213
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,269
in in memory there is a distinct slot
for the add operations let's say the add

3214
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:38,279
for the add operations let's say the add
 

3215
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,669
for the add operations let's say the add
operation is the first operation of a

3216
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:40,679
operation is the first operation of a
 

3217
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,349
operation is the first operation of a
type and the multiply is the second

3218
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:42,359
type and the multiply is the second
 

3219
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,150
type and the multiply is the second
operation of a type

3220
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:44,160
operation of a type
 

3221
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,490
operation of a type
so now we take the integer type and we

3222
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:46,500
so now we take the integer type and we
 

3223
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,329
so now we take the integer type and we
take the floating Point type

3224
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:49,339
take the floating Point type
 

3225
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:53,570
take the floating Point type
in both cases the add operation is the

3226
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:53,580
in both cases the add operation is the
 

3227
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,490
in both cases the add operation is the
first slot and multiplies the second

3228
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:55,500
first slot and multiplies the second
 

3229
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,830
first slot and multiplies the second
slot but

3230
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:57,840
slot but
 

3231
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,590
slot but
each slot contains a function and the

3232
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:00,600
each slot contains a function and the
 

3233
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,130
each slot contains a function and the
functions are different because the the

3234
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,140
functions are different because the the
 

3235
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,790
functions are different because the the
add to integers function interprets the

3236
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:07,800
add to integers function interprets the
 

3237
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,550
add to integers function interprets the
bit patterns as integers that add to

3238
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
bit patterns as integers that add to
 

3239
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,110
bit patterns as integers that add to
float

3240
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,120
float
 

3241
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,229
float
function interprets the the same bit

3242
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:15,239
function interprets the the same bit
 

3243
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,630
function interprets the the same bit
pattern as

3244
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:17,640
pattern as
 

3245
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,729
pattern as
as a floating Point number and then

3246
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:19,739
as a floating Point number and then
 

3247
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,169
as a floating Point number and then
there is the string

3248
01:10:21,169 --> 01:10:21,179
there is the string
 

3249
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:25,430
there is the string
data type which again interprets the the

3250
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,440
data type which again interprets the the
 

3251
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,430
data type which again interprets the the
bit pattern as a

3252
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:28,440
bit pattern as a
 

3253
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,149
bit pattern as a
the address of a sequence of characters

3254
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:31,159
the address of a sequence of characters
 

3255
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,890
the address of a sequence of characters
there are lots of lies in that story but

3256
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:33,900
there are lots of lies in that story but
 

3257
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,729
there are lots of lies in that story but
that's

3258
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:34,739
that's
 

3259
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:38,510
that's
that's sort of a basic idea I can tell I

3260
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:38,520
that's sort of a basic idea I can tell I
 

3261
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,950
that's sort of a basic idea I can tell I
could tell the fact the fake news and

3262
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:39,960
could tell the fact the fake news and
 

3263
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,570
could tell the fact the fake news and
the fabrication going on here at the

3264
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:41,580
the fabrication going on here at the
 

3265
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,630
the fabrication going on here at the
table but uh where's the optimization is

3266
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
table but uh where's the optimization is
 

3267
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,970
table but uh where's the optimization is
it on the operator is it a different so

3268
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:46,980
it on the operator is it a different so
 

3269
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,270
it on the operator is it a different so
inside the integer optimization is the

3270
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:50,280
inside the integer optimization is the
 

3271
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,209
inside the integer optimization is the
observation that

3272
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:53,219
observation that
 

3273
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:57,169
observation that
in a particular line of code

3274
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:57,179
in a particular line of code
 

3275
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:00,050
in a particular line of code
so now you you write your little Python

3276
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:00,060
so now you you write your little Python
 

3277
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,110
so now you you write your little Python
program and you write a function and

3278
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
program and you write a function and
 

3279
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,090
program and you write a function and
that function sort of takes a bunch of

3280
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:05,100
that function sort of takes a bunch of
 

3281
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,030
that function sort of takes a bunch of
inputs and at some point it adds two of

3282
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:08,040
inputs and at some point it adds two of
 

3283
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,370
inputs and at some point it adds two of
the inputs together

3284
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:10,380
the inputs together
 

3285
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,649
the inputs together
now I bet you even if you call your

3286
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:12,659
now I bet you even if you call your
 

3287
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,810
now I bet you even if you call your
function a thousand times

3288
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:14,820
function a thousand times
 

3289
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:18,950
function a thousand times
that all those calls are likely all

3290
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
that all those calls are likely all
 

3291
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,770
that all those calls are likely all
going to be about integers because maybe

3292
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:21,780
going to be about integers because maybe
 

3293
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,770
going to be about integers because maybe
your program is all about integers or

3294
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:24,780
your program is all about integers or
 

3295
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,270
your program is all about integers or
maybe

3296
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:26,280
maybe
 

3297
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,910
maybe
on that particular line of code where

3298
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:28,920
on that particular line of code where
 

3299
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,910
on that particular line of code where
there's that plus operator

3300
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
there's that plus operator
 

3301
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,149
there's that plus operator
every time the program hits that line

3302
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:35,159
every time the program hits that line
 

3303
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:37,729
every time the program hits that line
the variables A and B that b are being

3304
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,739
the variables A and B that b are being
 

3305
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:40,850
the variables A and B that b are being
added together happen to be strings

3306
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:40,860
added together happen to be strings
 

3307
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,149
added together happen to be strings
and so what we do is instead of having

3308
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
and so what we do is instead of having
 

3309
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,209
and so what we do is instead of having
this single byte code that says here's

3310
01:11:47,209 --> 01:11:47,219
this single byte code that says here's
 

3311
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,250
this single byte code that says here's
an ad operation and the implementation

3312
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:49,260
an ad operation and the implementation
 

3313
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,890
an ad operation and the implementation
of add is fully generic it looks at the

3314
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:51,900
of add is fully generic it looks at the
 

3315
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,110
of add is fully generic it looks at the
object from the object it looks at the

3316
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,120
object from the object it looks at the
 

3317
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,750
object from the object it looks at the
type then it takes the type and it looks

3318
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:56,760
type then it takes the type and it looks
 

3319
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,450
type then it takes the type and it looks
at looks of the function pointer then it

3320
01:11:59,450 --> 01:11:59,460
at looks of the function pointer then it
 

3321
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,850
at looks of the function pointer then it
calls the function now the function has

3322
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:01,860
calls the function now the function has
 

3323
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,070
calls the function now the function has
to be has to look at the other argument

3324
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
to be has to look at the other argument
 

3325
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,570
to be has to look at the other argument
and it has to double check that the

3326
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:05,580
and it has to double check that the
 

3327
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,729
and it has to double check that the
other argument has the right type

3328
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:07,739
other argument has the right type
 

3329
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,890
other argument has the right type
and then there's a bunch of error

3330
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,900
and then there's a bunch of error
 

3331
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,050
and then there's a bunch of error
checking before it can actually

3332
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:12,060
checking before it can actually
 

3333
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,810
checking before it can actually
just go ahead and add the two bit

3334
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:14,820
just go ahead and add the two bit
 

3335
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,729
just go ahead and add the two bit
patterns in the right way

3336
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:16,739
patterns in the right way
 

3337
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,550
patterns in the right way
what we do is

3338
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:19,560
what we do is
 

3339
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,850
what we do is
every time we execute an ad instruction

3340
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:22,860
every time we execute an ad instruction
 

3341
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,950
every time we execute an ad instruction
like that

3342
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
like that
 

3343
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,750
like that
we we keep a little note of

3344
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
we we keep a little note of
 

3345
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,790
we we keep a little note of
in the end after

3346
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:31,800
in the end after
 

3347
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,610
in the end after
we hit the code that that did the

3348
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:34,620
we hit the code that that did the
 

3349
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,689
we hit the code that that did the
addition

3350
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:35,699
addition
 

3351
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:39,950
addition
for a particular type what type was it

3352
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:39,960
for a particular type what type was it
 

3353
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,970
for a particular type what type was it
and then after a few times through that

3354
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:43,980
and then after a few times through that
 

3355
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,850
and then after a few times through that
code if it's this if it's the same type

3356
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:46,860
code if it's this if it's the same type
 

3357
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,130
code if it's this if it's the same type
all the time

3358
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:49,140
all the time
 

3359
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:54,770
all the time
uh we say oh so this add operation even

3360
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:54,780
uh we say oh so this add operation even
 

3361
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,890
uh we say oh so this add operation even
though it's the generic ad operation it

3362
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:57,900
though it's the generic ad operation it
 

3363
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,810
though it's the generic ad operation it
might as well be the add integer

3364
01:12:59,810 --> 01:12:59,820
might as well be the add integer
 

3365
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:03,649
might as well be the add integer
operation and add integer operation is

3366
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:03,659
operation and add integer operation is
 

3367
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:06,050
operation and add integer operation is
uh much more efficient because it just

3368
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:06,060
uh much more efficient because it just
 

3369
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,149
uh much more efficient because it just
says

3370
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:07,159
says
 

3371
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:10,970
says
assume that A and B are integers do the

3372
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:10,980
assume that A and B are integers do the
 

3373
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,770
assume that A and B are integers do the
addition operation do it right there

3374
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:12,780
addition operation do it right there
 

3375
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:17,590
addition operation do it right there
inline and produce the result

3376
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
inline and produce the result
 

3377
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,350
inline and produce the result
and the big lie here is that in Python

3378
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
and the big lie here is that in Python
 

3379
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,950
and the big lie here is that in Python
even if you have great evidence that in

3380
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:24,960
even if you have great evidence that in
 

3381
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,050
even if you have great evidence that in
the past it was always too integers that

3382
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:27,060
the past it was always too integers that
 

3383
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,570
the past it was always too integers that
you were adding at some point in the

3384
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:29,580
you were adding at some point in the
 

3385
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,310
you were adding at some point in the
future that same line of code could

3386
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:31,320
future that same line of code could
 

3387
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,229
future that same line of code could
still be hit with two floating points or

3388
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:33,239
still be hit with two floating points or
 

3389
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:35,149
still be hit with two floating points or
two strings or maybe a string and an

3390
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:35,159
two strings or maybe a string and an
 

3391
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,610
two strings or maybe a string and an
integer it's not a great lie that's just

3392
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:37,620
integer it's not a great lie that's just
 

3393
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,169
integer it's not a great lie that's just
the fact of life

3394
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:39,179
the fact of life
 

3395
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:41,990
the fact of life
I didn't account for what what should

3396
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
I didn't account for what what should
 

3397
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,410
I didn't account for what what should
happen in that case in in the way I told

3398
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:45,420
happen in that case in in the way I told
 

3399
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,290
happen in that case in in the way I told
the story there is some accounting and

3400
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:48,300
the story there is some accounting and
 

3401
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,890
the story there is some accounting and
and so what we actually have to do is

3402
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:51,900
and so what we actually have to do is
 

3403
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,550
and so what we actually have to do is
when we have the add integer operation

3404
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:55,560
when we have the add integer operation
 

3405
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,010
when we have the add integer operation
we still have to check

3406
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:58,020
we still have to check
 

3407
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,870
we still have to check
are the two arguments in fact integers

3408
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:01,880
are the two arguments in fact integers
 

3409
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,610
are the two arguments in fact integers
we applied some tricks to make those

3410
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:04,620
we applied some tricks to make those
 

3411
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,050
we applied some tricks to make those
checks efficient

3412
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:06,060
checks efficient
 

3413
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,290
checks efficient
and we know statistically that the

3414
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:09,300
and we know statistically that the
 

3415
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,470
and we know statistically that the
outcome is almost always yes they were

3416
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
outcome is almost always yes they were
 

3417
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,750
outcome is almost always yes they were
they are both integers

3418
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:14,760
they are both integers
 

3419
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,810
they are both integers
uh and so we quickly make that check and

3420
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:17,820
uh and so we quickly make that check and
 

3421
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,330
uh and so we quickly make that check and
then we proceed with the the sort of add

3422
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:20,340
then we proceed with the the sort of add
 

3423
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,490
then we proceed with the the sort of add
integer operation and then there is a

3424
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:22,500
integer operation and then there is a
 

3425
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,010
integer operation and then there is a
fallback mechanism where we say

3426
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:25,020
fallback mechanism where we say
 

3427
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,709
fallback mechanism where we say
oops one of them wasn't an integer

3428
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:27,719
oops one of them wasn't an integer
 

3429
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:29,570
oops one of them wasn't an integer
now we're going to pretend that there

3430
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:29,580
now we're going to pretend that there
 

3431
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,030
now we're going to pretend that there
was just the fully generic ad operation

3432
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:32,040
was just the fully generic ad operation
 

3433
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,110
was just the fully generic ad operation
we wasted a few Cycles believing it was

3434
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,120
we wasted a few Cycles believing it was
 

3435
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,229
we wasted a few Cycles believing it was
what was going to be two integers and

3436
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:39,239
what was going to be two integers and
 

3437
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:41,450
what was going to be two integers and
then we had to back up but we didn't

3438
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:41,460
then we had to back up but we didn't
 

3439
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,930
then we had to back up but we didn't
waste that much time and statistically

3440
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:43,940
waste that much time and statistically
 

3441
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,970
waste that much time and statistically
uh most of the time

3442
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:46,980
uh most of the time
 

3443
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,790
uh most of the time
basically we were sort of

3444
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
basically we were sort of
 

3445
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,890
basically we were sort of
hoping that most of the time we guess

3446
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:51,900
hoping that most of the time we guess
 

3447
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,709
hoping that most of the time we guess
right because if we if it turns out that

3448
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
right because if we if it turns out that
 

3449
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,649
right because if we if it turns out that
we guessed wrong too often

3450
01:14:57,649 --> 01:14:57,659
we guessed wrong too often
 

3451
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,189
we guessed wrong too often
uh or we didn't have a good guess at all

3452
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:00,199
uh or we didn't have a good guess at all
 

3453
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:03,169
uh or we didn't have a good guess at all
uh things might actually end up running

3454
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:03,179
uh things might actually end up running
 

3455
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:04,910
uh things might actually end up running
a little slower

3456
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:04,920
a little slower
 

3457
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,490
a little slower
so someone with armed with this

3458
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:07,500
so someone with armed with this
 

3459
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,630
so someone with armed with this
knowledge

3460
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
knowledge
 

3461
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,090
knowledge
and a copy of the implementation someone

3462
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:11,100
and a copy of the implementation someone
 

3463
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,790
and a copy of the implementation someone
could easily construct a counter example

3464
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:13,800
could easily construct a counter example
 

3465
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,430
could easily construct a counter example
where they say oh I have a program and

3466
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:16,440
where they say oh I have a program and
 

3467
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,709
where they say oh I have a program and
then now it runs five times as slow in

3468
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
then now it runs five times as slow in
 

3469
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,130
then now it runs five times as slow in
Python 311 than it did in Python 310.

3470
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:22,140
Python 311 than it did in Python 310.
 

3471
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,229
Python 311 than it did in Python 310.
but that's a very unrealistic program

3472
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
but that's a very unrealistic program
 

3473
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:29,030
but that's a very unrealistic program
that's that's just like an extreme fluke

3474
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
that's that's just like an extreme fluke
 

3475
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,070
that's that's just like an extreme fluke
it's a fun reverse engineering task

3476
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:31,080
it's a fun reverse engineering task
 

3477
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,390
it's a fun reverse engineering task
though oh yeah so there's uh

3478
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
though oh yeah so there's uh
 

3479
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,530
though oh yeah so there's uh
well people like fun yes so there's some

3480
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:39,540
well people like fun yes so there's some
 

3481
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,930
well people like fun yes so there's some
presumably heuristic

3482
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:41,940
presumably heuristic
 

3483
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:44,450
presumably heuristic
of what defines a momentum

3484
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,460
of what defines a momentum
 

3485
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,270
of what defines a momentum
of uh saying you know you seem to be

3486
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,280
of uh saying you know you seem to be
 

3487
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,310
of uh saying you know you seem to be
working adding two integers not two

3488
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:49,320
working adding two integers not two
 

3489
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,610
working adding two integers not two
generic types uh so how do you figure

3490
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:52,620
generic types uh so how do you figure
 

3491
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,310
generic types uh so how do you figure
out that heuristic I think that the

3492
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:55,320
out that heuristic I think that the
 

3493
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,550
out that heuristic I think that the
heuristic is actually we assume that the

3494
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
heuristic is actually we assume that the
 

3495
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,110
heuristic is actually we assume that the
weather tomorrow is going to be the same

3496
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:00,120
weather tomorrow is going to be the same
 

3497
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,030
weather tomorrow is going to be the same
as the weather today so you don't need

3498
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,040
as the weather today so you don't need
 

3499
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,790
as the weather today so you don't need
two days of the weather no

3500
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:04,800
two days of the weather no
 

3501
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,530
two days of the weather no
that is already so much better than than

3502
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:08,540
that is already so much better than than

01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,390
that is already so much better than than
guessing randomly that so how do you

3504
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:11,400
guessing randomly that so how do you
 

3505
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,790
guessing randomly that so how do you
find this idea

3506
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:13,800
find this idea
 

3507
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,790
find this idea
hey I wonder if instead of adding to

3508
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
hey I wonder if instead of adding to
 

3509
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,649
hey I wonder if instead of adding to
generic types we uh we start assuming

3510
01:16:21,649 --> 01:16:21,659
generic types we uh we start assuming
 

3511
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:22,970
generic types we uh we start assuming
that the weather tomorrow is the same as

3512
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:22,980
that the weather tomorrow is the same as
 

3513
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,350
that the weather tomorrow is the same as
the weather today

3514
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,360
the weather today
 

3515
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,750
the weather today
where do you find the idea for that

3516
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:26,760
where do you find the idea for that
 

3517
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,270
where do you find the idea for that
because that ultimately

3518
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
because that ultimately
 

3519
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,370
because that ultimately
for you to do that you have to kind of

3520
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:31,380
for you to do that you have to kind of
 

3521
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,590
for you to do that you have to kind of
understand how people are using the

language right python is not the first

3524
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
language right python is not the first
 

3525
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,810
language right python is not the first
language to do a thing like this this is

3526
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:38,820
language to do a thing like this this is
 

3527
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,850
language to do a thing like this this is
a fairly well-known trick especially

3528
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:40,860
a fairly well-known trick especially
 

3529
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,110
a fairly well-known trick especially
from

3530
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,120
from
 

3531
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,630
from
other interpreted languages that had

3532
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:44,640
other interpreted languages that had
 

3533
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,990
other interpreted languages that had
reason to be sped up we occasionally

3534
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
reason to be sped up we occasionally
 

3535
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,930
reason to be sped up we occasionally
look at papers about hhvm which is for

3536
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:50,940
look at papers about hhvm which is for
 

3537
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,990
look at papers about hhvm which is for
Facebook's uh

3538
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
Facebook's uh
 

3539
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,010
Facebook's uh
efficient compiler for uh PHP there are

3540
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:58,020
efficient compiler for uh PHP there are
 

3541
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:01,430
efficient compiler for uh PHP there are
tricks known from the jvm and

3542
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:01,440
tricks known from the jvm and
 

3543
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,770
tricks known from the jvm and
sometimes it just comes from Academia

3544
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:03,780
sometimes it just comes from Academia
 

3545
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,810
sometimes it just comes from Academia
and so the trick here is that the type

3546
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:05,820
and so the trick here is that the type
 

3547
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,090
and so the trick here is that the type
itself doesn't the variable doesn't know

3548
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:08,100
itself doesn't the variable doesn't know
 

3549
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,070
itself doesn't the variable doesn't know
what type it is

3550
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
what type it is
 

3551
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,050
what type it is
so this is not a statically typed

3552
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:12,060
so this is not a statically typed
 

3553
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:17,410
so this is not a statically typed
language where you can

3554
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:17,420

 

3555
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,910

this is a trick that is especially

3556
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
this is a trick that is especially
 

3557
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,970
this is a trick that is especially
important for uh for interpreted

3558
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:22,980
important for uh for interpreted
 

3559
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,030
important for uh for interpreted
languages with Dynamic typing because

3560
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,040
languages with Dynamic typing because
 

3561
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,410
languages with Dynamic typing because

3562
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:27,420

3563
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,010

3567
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,110

Hardware machine instruction that exists

3572
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:42,540
Hardware machine instruction that exists

01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,030
Hardware machine instruction that exists
on every CPU and ditto for floats

01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,040
on every CPU and ditto for floats
 

3575
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,290
on every CPU and ditto for floats
uh but because in Python you don't

3576
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:50,300
uh but because in Python you don't
 

3577
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,209
uh but because in Python you don't
generally declare your the types of your

3578
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:53,219
generally declare your the types of your
 

3579
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,910
generally declare your the types of your
variables you you don't even declare the

3580
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
variables you you don't even declare the
 

3581
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,649
variables you you don't even declare the
existence of your variables they just

3582
01:17:57,649 --> 01:17:57,659
existence of your variables they just
 

3583
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,630
existence of your variables they just
spring into existence when you first

3584
01:17:59,630 --> 01:17:59,640
spring into existence when you first
 

3585
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,090
spring into existence when you first
assign them which

3586
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:02,100
assign them which
 

3587
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,370
assign them which
is really cool and and sort of helps

3588
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:04,380
is really cool and and sort of helps
 

3589
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,169
is really cool and and sort of helps
those beginners because there's less

3590
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:06,179
those beginners because there's less
 

3591
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,990
those beginners because there's less
bookkeeping they have to learn how to do

3592
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,000
bookkeeping they have to learn how to do
 

3593
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,149
bookkeeping they have to learn how to do
before they can start playing around

3594
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:11,159
before they can start playing around
 

3595
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:14,390
before they can start playing around
with code but it makes the the in

3596
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
with code but it makes the the in
 

3597
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,030
with code but it makes the the in
interpretation of the code less

3598
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,040
interpretation of the code less
 

3599
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,330
interpretation of the code less
efficient and so we're we're sort of

3600
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:20,340
efficient and so we're we're sort of
 

3601
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,310
efficient and so we're we're sort of
trying to

3602
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
trying to
 

3603
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,250
trying to
to make the interpretation more

3604
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:25,260
to make the interpretation more
 

3605
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,130
to make the interpretation more
efficient without losing the the super

3606
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,140
efficient without losing the the super

type hints

3612
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:36,540
type hints
 

3613
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:41,330
type hints
what is Type hinting and is it used by

3614
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:41,340
what is Type hinting and is it used by
 

3615
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,550
what is Type hinting and is it used by
The Interpreter the hints or is it just

3616
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:43,560
The Interpreter the hints or is it just
 

3617
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,850
The Interpreter the hints or is it just
syntactic sugar so the type hints is an

3618
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:46,860
syntactic sugar so the type hints is an
 

3619
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,450
syntactic sugar so the type hints is an
optional mechanism that people can use

3620
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:50,460
optional mechanism that people can use
 

3621
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,770
optional mechanism that people can use
and it's especially popular with sort of

3622
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:53,780
and it's especially popular with sort of
 

3623
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,630
and it's especially popular with sort of
larger companies that have very large

3624
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
larger companies that have very large
 

3625
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,149
larger companies that have very large
code bases written in Python do you

3626
01:18:59,149 --> 01:18:59,159
code bases written in Python do you
 

3627
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:00,649
code bases written in Python do you
think of it as almost like documentation

3628
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:00,659
think of it as almost like documentation
 

3629
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:02,750
think of it as almost like documentation
saying these two variables are this type

3630
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:02,760
saying these two variables are this type
 

3631
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,550
saying these two variables are this type
more than documentation I mean so it

3632
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:07,560

 

3633
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,310

it is a sub language of python where

3634
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
it is a sub language of python where
 

3635
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,010
it is a sub language of python where
where you can express the types of

3636
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,020
where you can express the types of
 

3637
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,110
where you can express the types of
variables so here's a variable and it's

3638
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
variables so here's a variable and it's
 

3639
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,510
variables so here's a variable and it's
an integer and here's an argument to

3640
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
an integer and here's an argument to
 

3641
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,669
an integer and here's an argument to
this function and it's a string and here

3642
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
this function and it's a string and here
 

3643
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,070
this function and it's a string and here
is a function that returns a list of

3644
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080
is a function that returns a list of
 

3645
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,930
is a function that returns a list of
strings but that's not checked when you

3646
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:23,940
strings but that's not checked when you
 

3647
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,330
strings but that's not checked when you
run the code but

3648
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:25,340
run the code but
 

3649
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,490
run the code but
exactly there there is a separate piece

3650
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:28,500
exactly there there is a separate piece
 

3651
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,770
exactly there there is a separate piece

that code might be doing
 

3663
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,050
that code might be doing
and double checks if that makes sense if

3664
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:48,060
and double checks if that makes sense if
 

3665
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,930
and double checks if that makes sense if
you take the types as annotated into

3666
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:50,940
you take the types as annotated into
 

3667
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,669
you take the types as annotated into
account so this is something you're

3668
01:19:52,669 --> 01:19:52,679
account so this is something you're
 

3669
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,709
account so this is something you're
supposed to run as you develop it's like

3670
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
supposed to run as you develop it's like
 

3671
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,590
supposed to run as you develop it's like
a linter yeah that's definitely a

3672
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
a linter yeah that's definitely a
 

3673
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,510
a linter yeah that's definitely a
development tool but the type

3674
01:19:59,510 --> 01:19:59,520
development tool but the type
 

3675
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,010
development tool but the type
annotations currently are not used for

3676
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:03,020
annotations currently are not used for
 

3677
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:06,950
annotations currently are not used for
uh speeding up The Interpreter and there

3678
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
uh speeding up The Interpreter and there
 

3679
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,010
uh speeding up The Interpreter and there
are a number of reasons uh many people

3680
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:10,020
are a number of reasons uh many people
 

3681
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,630
are a number of reasons uh many people
don't use them

3682
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:11,640
don't use them
 

3683
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,709
don't use them
even when they do use them uh they

3684
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:15,719
even when they do use them uh they
 

3685
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:19,010
even when they do use them uh they
sometimes contain lies where the static

3686
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:19,020
sometimes contain lies where the static

I cannot prove that this integer is ever
not an integer but at runtime somehow

3692
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:28,199
not an integer but at runtime somehow
 

3693
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,610
not an integer but at runtime somehow
someone manages to violate that

3694
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:31,620
someone manages to violate that
 

3695
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,870
someone manages to violate that
assumption

3696
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880

and The Interpreter

3698
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:35,159
and The Interpreter
 

3699
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:38,330
and The Interpreter
ends up doing just fine if we started

3700
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:38,340
ends up doing just fine if we started
 

3701
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,330
ends up doing just fine if we started
enforcing type annotations in Python

3702
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:41,340
enforcing type annotations in Python
 

3703
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,910
enforcing type annotations in Python
many python programs would no longer

3704
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:43,920
many python programs would no longer
 

3705
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,709
many python programs would no longer
work

3706
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
work
 

3707
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,330
work
and some python programs wouldn't even

3708
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:47,340
and some python programs wouldn't even
 

3709
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,030
and some python programs wouldn't even
be possible because they're too dynamic

3710
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,040
be possible because they're too dynamic
 

3711
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,689
be possible because they're too dynamic
and so we made we made a choice of not

3712
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:52,699
and so we made we made a choice of not
 

3713
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:55,669
and so we made we made a choice of not
using the annotations there there is a

3714
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
using the annotations there there is a
 

3715
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,850
using the annotations there there is a
possible future where eventually

3716
01:20:58,850 --> 01:20:58,860
possible future where eventually
 

3717
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:03,050

three four five releases in the future

3718
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:03,060
three four five releases in the future
 

3719
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,450
three four five releases in the future
we could start using those annotations

3720
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:05,460
we could start using those annotations
 

3721
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,729
we could start using those annotations
to sort of

3722
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:07,739
to sort of
 

3723
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,850
to sort of
provide hints because we can we can

3724
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:10,860
provide hints because we can we can
 

3725
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:15,229
provide hints because we can we can
still say well the source code leads us

3726
01:21:15,229 --> 01:21:15,239
still say well the source code leads us
 

3727
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:17,750
still say well the source code leads us

01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
to believe that these X and Y are both
 

3729
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,209
to believe that these X and Y are both
integers and so we can generate an add

3730
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:20,219
integers and so we can generate an add
 

3731
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:23,149
integers and so we can generate an add
an add integer instruction

3732
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:23,159
an add integer instruction
 

3733
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:25,910
an add integer instruction
but we can still have a fallback that

3734
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:25,920
but we can still have a fallback that
 

3735
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,050
but we can still have a fallback that
says oh if the if somehow the code code

01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:30,060
says oh if the if somehow the code code
 

3737
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:33,290
says oh if the if somehow the code code
at runtime provided something else maybe

3738
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:33,300
at runtime provided something else maybe
 

3739
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,870
at runtime provided something else maybe
it provided two decimal numbers

3740
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:35,880
it provided two decimal numbers
 

3741
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,390
it provided two decimal numbers
we can still use that generic ad

3742
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,400
we can still use that generic ad
 

3743
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,270
we can still use that generic ad
operation as a fallback but we're not

operation as a fallback but we're not
 

3745
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,270
operation as a fallback but we're not
there is there currently a mechanism or

3746
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:44,280
there is there currently a mechanism or
 

3747
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,850
there is there currently a mechanism or
do you see something like that where you

3748
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:46,860
do you see something like that where you
 

3749
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,490
do you see something like that where you
can almost add like an assert

3750
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:49,500
can almost add like an assert
 

3751
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,790
can almost add like an assert
inside a function that says please check

3752
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
inside a function that says please check
 

3753
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,030
inside a function that says please check
that my type hints are actually mapping

3754
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,040
that my type hints are actually mapping
 

3755
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,510
that my type hints are actually mapping
to reality sort of like insert manual

3756
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
to reality sort of like insert manual
 

3757
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,850
to reality sort of like insert manual
static typing there are third-party

3758
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:01,860
static typing there are third-party
 

3759
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,090
static typing there are third-party
libraries that uh are in that business

3760
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:05,100
libraries that uh are in that business
 

3761
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,830
libraries that uh are in that business
so it's possible to do that kind of

3762
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:06,840
so it's possible to do that kind of
 

3763
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,870
so it's possible to do that kind of
thing it's possible to for a third party

3764
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
thing it's possible to for a third party
 

3765
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,149
thing it's possible to for a third party
library to take a hint

3766
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:11,159
library to take a hint
 

3767
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,729
library to take a hint
and enforce it it seems like a tricky

3768
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:13,739
and enforce it it seems like a tricky
 

3769
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:15,770
and enforce it it seems like a tricky
thing what what well what we actually do

3770
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:15,780
thing what what well what we actually do
 

3771
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,050
thing what what well what we actually do
is and this I think this is a fairly

3772
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,060
is and this I think this is a fairly
 

3773
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,770
is and this I think this is a fairly
unique feature in Python the type hints

3774
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:21,780
unique feature in Python the type hints
 

3775
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:25,669
unique feature in Python the type hints
can be introspected at runtime so while

3776
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:25,679
can be introspected at runtime so while
 

3777
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,669
can be introspected at runtime so while
the program is running

3778
01:22:28,669 --> 01:22:28,679
the program is running
 

3779
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:30,350
the program is running
they mean python is a very

3780
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:30,360
they mean python is a very
 

3781
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,169
they mean python is a very
introspectable language you can look at

3782
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:33,179
introspectable language you can look at
 

3783
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:35,209
introspectable language you can look at
a variable and ask yourself what did

3784
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:35,219
a variable and ask yourself what did
 

3785
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:37,610
a variable and ask yourself what did
what is the type of this this variable

3786
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:37,620
what is the type of this this variable
 

3787
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,950
what is the type of this this variable
and if that baby that variable happens

3788
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:39,960
and if that baby that variable happens
 

3789
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,610
and if that baby that variable happens
to refer to a function you can ask what

3790
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:43,620
to refer to a function you can ask what
 

3791
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,669
to refer to a function you can ask what
are the arguments to the function

3792
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:45,679
are the arguments to the function
 

3793
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,890
are the arguments to the function
and nowadays you can also ask what are

3794
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:48,900
and nowadays you can also ask what are
 

3795
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,169
and nowadays you can also ask what are
the type annotations for the function so

3796
01:22:51,169 --> 01:22:51,179
the type annotations for the function so
 

3797
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,090
the type annotations for the function so
the type annotations are there inside

3798
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:53,100
the type annotations are there inside
 

3799
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,090
the type annotations are there inside
the variable as it's at runtime they're

3800
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:56,100
the variable as it's at runtime they're
 

3801
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,130
the variable as it's at runtime they're
mostly associated with the function

3802
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:58,140
mostly associated with the function
 

3803
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,350
mostly associated with the function
object not with each individual variable

3804
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:00,360
object not with each individual variable
 

3805
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,709
object not with each individual variable
but uh right you can sort of map from

3806
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:03,719
but uh right you can sort of map from
 

3807
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,290
but uh right you can sort of map from
from the arguments to the variables and

3808
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:06,300
from the arguments to the variables and
 

3809
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,850
from the arguments to the variables and
that's what a third-party Library can

3810
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:07,860
that's what a third-party Library can
 

3811
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,950
that's what a third-party Library can
have exactly and the problem with that

3812
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:09,960
have exactly and the problem with that
 

3813
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,410
have exactly and the problem with that
is that all that extra runtime type

3814
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:12,420
is that all that extra runtime type
 

3815
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,570
is that all that extra runtime type
checking

3816
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:13,580
checking
 

3817
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:16,310
checking
uh is going to slow your code down

3818
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
uh is going to slow your code down
 

3819
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,070
uh is going to slow your code down
instead of speed it up I think uh to

3820
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:19,080

01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,510
my pie is the original static type

were sort of developed

3880
01:24:39,169 --> 01:24:39,179
were sort of developed
 

3881
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:42,530
were sort of developed
together with the the static type

3882
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:42,540
together with the the static type
 

3883
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,350
together with the the static type
Checker and in fact Yuka had first

3884
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:45,360
Checker and in fact Yuka had first
 

3885
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,930
Checker and in fact Yuka had first
invented a different syntax that wasn't

3886
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:47,940
invented a different syntax that wasn't
 

3887
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:50,450
invented a different syntax that wasn't
quite compatible with python

01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:50,460
quite compatible with python
 

3889
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,470
quite compatible with python
and uh yukai and I sort of met at the

3890
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
and uh yukai and I sort of met at the
 

3891
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,990
and uh yukai and I sort of met at the
python conference in I think in 2013

3892
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,000
python conference in I think in 2013
 

3893
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,229
python conference in I think in 2013
and we we sort of came up with a

3894
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:03,239
and we we sort of came up with a
 

3895
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:05,590
and we we sort of came up with a
compromise syntax

3896
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:05,600
compromise syntax
 

3897
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,630
compromise syntax
that would not require any changes to

3898
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:08,640
that would not require any changes to
 

3899
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,770
that would not require any changes to
python

3900
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:09,780
python
 

3901
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:13,490
python
and that would let my pie sort of be an

3902
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:13,500
and that would let my pie sort of be an
 

3903
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,830
and that would let my pie sort of be an
add-on static type checker for python

01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,630
add-on static type checker for python
just out of curiosity was it like double

3906
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:17,640
just out of curiosity was it like double
 

3907
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,790
just out of curiosity was it like double
colon or something what was he proposing

3908
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,800
colon or something what was he proposing
 

3909
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,189
colon or something what was he proposing
that would break python I think he was

3910
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:22,199
that would break python I think he was
 

3911
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:25,729
that would break python I think he was
using angular brackets for uh types like

3912
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:25,739
using angular brackets for uh types like
 

3913
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,209
using angular brackets for uh types like
in C plus plus or uh Java generics yeah

3914
01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:29,219
in C plus plus or uh Java generics yeah
 

3915
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:31,790
in C plus plus or uh Java generics yeah
you can't use angular brackets in Python

3916
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:31,800
you can't use angular brackets in Python
 

3917
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,709
you can't use angular brackets in Python
it would be too tricky

3918
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:33,719
it would be too tricky
 

3919
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:36,709
it would be too tricky
for attempt well we the the key thing is

3920
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:36,719
for attempt well we the the key thing is
 

3921
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,669
for attempt well we the the key thing is
that we already had uh you know a Syntax

3922
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:40,679
that we already had uh you know a Syntax
 

3923
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,189
that we already had uh you know a Syntax
for annotations we just didn't know what

3924
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:43,199
for annotations we just didn't know what
 

3925
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:45,229
for annotations we just didn't know what
to use them for yet

3926
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:45,239
to use them for yet
 

3927
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:47,990
to use them for yet
so type annotations were just the sort

3928
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,000
so type annotations were just the sort
 

3929
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,350
so type annotations were just the sort
of most logical thing to to use that

3930
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
of most logical thing to to use that
 

3931
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,169
of most logical thing to to use that

he had a parser that translated my pie
 

3945
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,070
he had a parser that translated my pie
into python by like doing the type

that's funny I mean that could have been

that's funny I mean that could have been

01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
is it like a split in the community over
 

3971
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,790
is it like a split in the community over

01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,430
now it's not necessarily a split there
are certainly plenty of people who don't

are certainly plenty of people who don't
 

3977
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,729
are certainly plenty of people who don't
use typescript but

3978
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:00,739
use typescript but
 

3979
01:27:00,739 --> 01:27:03,490
use typescript but

01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:26,450

eventually if you wanted to you could

01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:26,460
eventually if you wanted to you could
 

4049
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,430
eventually if you wanted to you could
take typescript

4050
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:28,440
take typescript
 

4051
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,729
take typescript
uh and you could shove it directly into

4052
01:28:31,729 --> 01:28:31,739
uh and you could shove it directly into
 

4053
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,010
uh and you could shove it directly into

the interesting thing in the JavaScript

4058
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:38,100
the interesting thing in the JavaScript
 

4059
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,430
the interesting thing in the JavaScript
world at least the web browser world

4060
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:40,440
world at least the web browser world
 

4061
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,010
world at least the web browser world
the web browsers have changed how they

4062
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:43,020
the web browsers have changed how they
 

4063
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,850
the web browsers have changed how they
deploy and uh they they sort of update

4064
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:46,860
deploy and uh they they sort of update
 

4065
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,010

their JavaScript engines

4066
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:49,020
their JavaScript engines
 

4067
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,010
their JavaScript engines
much more quickly than they used to in

01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:52,020

4069
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,410
much more quickly than they used to in
the the early days and so there's much

4070
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:54,420
the the early days and so there's much
 

4071
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,530
the the early days and so there's much
less of a need for

01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:56,540
less of a need for
 

4073
01:28:56,540 --> 01:29:00,169
less of a need for
translation in JavaScript itself because

01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:00,179
translation in JavaScript itself because
 

4075
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:03,410
translation in JavaScript itself because

would you recommend typescript or

01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:12,840
would you recommend typescript or
 

4085
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,149
would you recommend typescript or

JavaScript
 

4087
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,270

I would recommend a typescript just

4088
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
I would recommend a typescript just
 

4089
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,030
I would recommend a typescript just
because of the strictness of the typing

4090
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:19,040
because of the strictness of the typing
 

4091
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,390
because of the strictness of the typing
it's an enormously helpful extra tool

it's an enormously helpful extra tool
 

4093
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,930
it's an enormously helpful extra tool
that helps you sort of

keep your head straight about

what your code is actually doing

01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,610
fascinating to see JavaScript evolve the
way it does well maybe we should

4142
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:25,620
way it does well maybe we should
 

4143
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,770
way it does well maybe we should
consider that biological systems are

4144
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:27,780
consider that biological systems are
 

4145
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:30,050
consider that biological systems are
just the Engineering Systems too right

4146
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,060
just the Engineering Systems too right
 

4147
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,750
just the Engineering Systems too right
yes but very advanced

4148
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:32,760
yes but very advanced
 

4149
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,149
yes but very advanced
with more history

4150
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:35,159
with more history
 

4151
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:38,209
with more history
but it's almost like the most visceral

4152
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:38,219
but it's almost like the most visceral
 

4153
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:41,209
but it's almost like the most visceral
in the JavaScript world because there's

4154
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:41,219
in the JavaScript world because there's
 

4155
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:44,570
in the JavaScript world because there's
just so much code written in JavaScript

4156
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:44,580
just so much code written in JavaScript
 

4157
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,709
just so much code written in JavaScript
that for its history was messy if you

4158
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:48,719
that for its history was messy if you
 

4159
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,870
that for its history was messy if you
talk about bugs per line of code I just

4160
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:50,880
talk about bugs per line of code I just
 

4161
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,790
talk about bugs per line of code I just
feel like JavaScript

4162
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
feel like JavaScript
 

4163
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,350
feel like JavaScript
eats the cake or whatever the

4164
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:54,360
eats the cake or whatever the
 

4165
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,870
eats the cake or whatever the
terminology is it beats python by a lot

4166
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:56,880
terminology is it beats python by a lot
 

4167
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,090
terminology is it beats python by a lot
in terms of number of bugs meaning like

4168
01:30:59,090 --> 01:30:59,100
in terms of number of bugs meaning like
 

4169
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,030
in terms of number of bugs meaning like
way more bugs in JavaScript and then and

4170
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,040
way more bugs in JavaScript and then and
 

4171
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,330
way more bugs in JavaScript and then and
then the obviously the browsers the

4172
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:05,340
then the obviously the browsers the
 

4173
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,649
then the obviously the browsers the
develop I mean just there's so much

4174
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:06,659
develop I mean just there's so much
 

4175
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:08,570
develop I mean just there's so much
active development it feels a lot more

4176
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:08,580
active development it feels a lot more
 

4177
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:11,270
active development it feels a lot more
like Evolution where a bunch of stuff is

4178
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,280
like Evolution where a bunch of stuff is
 

4179
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,770
like Evolution where a bunch of stuff is
born and dies and there's

4180
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:12,780
born and dies and there's
 

4181
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,410
born and dies and there's
experimentation and debates versus

01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:15,420
experimentation and debates versus
 

4183
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,110
experimentation and debates versus
python is more

01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:18,120
python is more
 

4185
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,270
python is more
um all that stuff is happening but

4186
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:20,280
um all that stuff is happening but
 

4187
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,550
um all that stuff is happening but
there's just a longer history of stable

4188
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,560
there's just a longer history of stable
 

4189
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,250
there's just a longer history of stable
working giant software systems written

working giant software systems written
 

4191
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,189
working giant software systems written
in python versus JavaScript is just a

01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:28,199
in python versus JavaScript is just a

01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:31,430
in python versus JavaScript is just a
giant beautiful I would say mess of code

4194
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
giant beautiful I would say mess of code
 

4195
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,430

it's very different culture and

4196
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:34,440
it's very different culture and
 

4197
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,890
it's very different culture and
to some extent differences in culture

4198
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:36,900
to some extent differences in culture
 

4199
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,530
to some extent differences in culture
are random but to some extent they the

4200
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:39,540
are random but to some extent they the
 

4201
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,090
are random but to some extent they the
differences have to do with the

01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:41,100
differences have to do with the
 

4203
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,169
differences have to do with the

01:31:45,169 --> 01:31:45,179
environment yeah uh and the fact that
 

4205
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:48,470

01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:26,940
so what okay you you met you talked
 

4237
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,390
so what okay you you met you talked
about a syntax that could work

01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:29,400
about a syntax that could work

about a syntax that could work
where does it currently stand

01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:31,500
where does it currently stand

01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,410
where does it currently stand
what's the future of static typing in

4242
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:33,420
what's the future of static typing in
 

4243
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:34,850
what's the future of static typing in
Python

4244
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:34,860
Python
 

4245
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:38,270
Python
it is still controversial but it is much

4246
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:38,280
it is still controversial but it is much
 

4247
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,790
it is still controversial but it is much
more accepted than when my pi and pep

4248
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
more accepted than when my pi and pep
 

4249
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,189
more accepted than when my pi and pep
484 were were young

4250
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
484 were were young
 

4251
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,010
484 were were young
what's the connection between uh pep 484

4252
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:46,020
what's the connection between uh pep 484
 

4253
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:50,090
what's the connection between uh pep 484
type hints and my pie my pie

4254
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:50,100
type hints and my pie my pie
 

4255
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,510
type hints and my pie my pie
was the original static type Checker so

4256
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
was the original static type Checker so
 

4257
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,930
was the original static type Checker so
it might buy quickly evolved from yuka's

4258
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:56,940
it might buy quickly evolved from yuka's
 

4259
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:01,189
it might buy quickly evolved from yuka's
own variant of python to a static type

4260
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
own variant of python to a static type
 

4261
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,250
own variant of python to a static type
checker for Python and uh sort of Pep

4262
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:04,260
checker for Python and uh sort of Pep
 

4263
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:07,610
checker for Python and uh sort of Pep
484 that that was it like

4264
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:07,620
484 that that was it like
 

4265
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:11,270
484 that that was it like
a very productive year where like many

4266
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,280
a very productive year where like many
 

4267
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,370
a very productive year where like many
hundreds of messages were exchanged

4268
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:13,380
hundreds of messages were exchanged
 

4269
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,590
hundreds of messages were exchanged
debating that merits

4270
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:15,600
debating that merits
 

4271
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,189
debating that merits
of every aspect of of that pep

4272
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
of every aspect of of that pep
 

4273
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:22,790
of every aspect of of that pep
and so my pie is a static type checker

4274
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
and so my pie is a static type checker
 

4275
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,729
and so my pie is a static type checker
for python it is itself written in

uh we're also prototyped through my pie

4288
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:40,820
uh we're also prototyped through my pie
 

4289
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:44,689

a very small number of maintainers
 

4293
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,450
a very small number of maintainers
it was successful enough that people

4294
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:50,460
it was successful enough that people
 

4295
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:52,610
it was successful enough that people
said the aesthetic type checking stuff

4296

01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:55,020
for python is actually worth an
 

4299
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,050
for python is actually worth an

4321
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,709

interesting yeah I have a lot of
 

4345
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,629

questions about how to write a static
 

4347
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:07,850
questions about how to write a static

01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,490
heard they have one gigantic mono repo
so all the code is checked into a single

approach so Facebook developed pyre

4372
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,060
approach so Facebook developed pyre

4379
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,610

and Google developed something they

4380
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:49,620
and Google developed something they
 

4381
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:52,189
and Google developed something they
called Pi type which was actually itself

4382
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:52,199

wasn't one giant got it so the just to
 

4395
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:13,070
wasn't one giant got it so the just to

where by looking at the combination of
 

4463
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:42,410
where by looking at the combination of
how your code is laid out maybe how it's

01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:42,420
how your code is laid out maybe how it's
 

4465
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:45,550
how your code is laid out maybe how it's
indented maybe the comment structure

4466
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:45,560
indented maybe the comment structure
 

4467
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,669
indented maybe the comment structure
uh but also just

01:37:48,669 --> 01:37:48,679
uh but also just
 

4469
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:52,250
uh but also just
things like definition of names use of

01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:52,260
things like definition of names use of

it'll tell you likely things that are

it'll tell you likely things that are

it'll tell you likely things that are
wrong and in some cases linters are are

01:37:59,450 --> 01:37:59,460
wrong and in some cases linters are are
 

4477
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,310
wrong and in some cases linters are are
really style checkers

4478
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:01,320
really style checkers
 

4479
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,290
really style checkers
uh for python there are a number of

4480
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:03,300
uh for python there are a number of
 

4481
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,930
uh for python there are a number of
linters that check things like

4482
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:05,940
linters that check things like
 

4483
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:09,010
linters that check things like
do you use the the pep 8

4484
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:09,020
do you use the the pep 8
 

4485
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,750
do you use the the pep 8
recommended naming scheme for your

4486
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:11,760
recommended naming scheme for your
 

4487
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,850
recommended naming scheme for your
functions and classes and variables

4488
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:13,860
functions and classes and variables
 

4489
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,129
functions and classes and variables
because like classes start with an

4490
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:16,139
because like classes start with an
 

4491
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:17,810
because like classes start with an
uppercase and the rest starts with a

4492
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:17,820
uppercase and the rest starts with a
 

4493
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,490
uppercase and the rest starts with a
lowercase and

4494
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:19,500
lowercase and
 

4495
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,890
lowercase and
there's like differences there and so

4496
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:21,900
there's like differences there and so
 

4497
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,870
there's like differences there and so
the linter can tell you hey you have a

4498
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:23,880
the linter can tell you hey you have a
 

4499
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,830
the linter can tell you hey you have a
class that uh whose first letter is not

4500
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
class that uh whose first letter is not
 

4501
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,590
class that uh whose first letter is not
an uppercase letter and that's just I

4502
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:30,600
an uppercase letter and that's just I
 

4503
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,510
an uppercase letter and that's just I
just find it annoying if I wanted that

4504
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:32,520
just find it annoying if I wanted that
 

4505
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,970
just find it annoying if I wanted that
to be an uppercase letter I I would have

4506
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:34,980
to be an uppercase letter I I would have
 

4507
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,250
to be an uppercase letter I I would have
typed an uppercase letter but other

4508
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:37,260
typed an uppercase letter but other
 

4509
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,649
typed an uppercase letter but other
people find it very comforting that if

4510
01:38:39,649 --> 01:38:39,659
people find it very comforting that if
 

4511
01:38:39,659 --> 01:38:42,229
people find it very comforting that if
the linter is no longer complaining

4512
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
the linter is no longer complaining
 

4513
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,510
the linter is no longer complaining
about their code that they have followed

01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:44,520
about their code that they have followed

all the style rules maybe it's a fast

01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,370
there's definitely that but the best use
of linter is probably

the situation isn't

all the static type checkers

4630
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:13,400
all the static type checkers
 

4631
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,990
all the static type checkers
uh still evolve at a much higher speed

4632
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
uh still evolve at a much higher speed
 

4633
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,530
uh still evolve at a much higher speed
than Python and its annotation syntax

4634
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:21,540
than Python and its annotation syntax
 

4635
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:25,070
than Python and its annotation syntax
evolve you get a new release of python

4636
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:25,080
evolve you get a new release of python
 

4637
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,770
evolve you get a new release of python
once a year those are the only times

4638
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:27,780
once a year those are the only times
 

4639
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,770
once a year those are the only times
that you can introduce new annotation

4640
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:30,780
that you can introduce new annotation
 

4641
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,290
that you can introduce new annotation
syntax and there's there are always

4642
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,300
syntax and there's there are always
 

4643
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,990
syntax and there's there are always
people who invent new new annotation

4644
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
people who invent new new annotation
 

4645
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,570
people who invent new new annotation
syntax that they're trying to push

syntax that they're trying to push
 

4647
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:41,629
syntax that they're trying to push
uh and worse

4648
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:41,639
uh and worse
 

4649
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:44,209
uh and worse
once we've all agreed that we are going

once we've all agreed that we are going
 

4651
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:47,030
once we've all agreed that we are going
to put some new syntax in we can never

4652
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
to put some new syntax in we can never
 

4653
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,530
to put some new syntax in we can never
take it back

4654
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:48,540
take it back
 

4655
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,050

because you have to assume that people

4660
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:55,380
because you have to assume that people

01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:57,530
because you have to assume that people
started using it as soon as we announced

4662
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:57,540
started using it as soon as we announced
 

4663
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:58,550
started using it as soon as we announced
it

4664
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
it
 

4665
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,649
it
and then you can't take it away from

4666
01:42:00,649 --> 01:42:00,659
and then you can't take it away from
 

4667
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:02,570
and then you can't take it away from
them right away you have to start

4668
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:02,580
them right away you have to start
 

4669
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,450
them right away you have to start
telling them well this will go away but

4670
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:05,460
telling them well this will go away but
 

4671
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,209
telling them well this will go away but
we're not gonna commit tell you that

4672
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:08,219
we're not gonna commit tell you that
 

4673
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:10,370
we're not gonna commit tell you that
it's an error yet and then later it's

4674
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:10,380
it's an error yet and then later it's
 

4675
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,750
it's an error yet and then later it's
going to be a warning and then

4676
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
going to be a warning and then
 

4677
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,729
going to be a warning and then
eventually three releases in the future

4678
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:13,739
eventually three releases in the future
 

4679
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:16,250
eventually three releases in the future
maybe we remove it

4680
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:16,260
maybe we remove it
 

4681
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,830
maybe we remove it
on the other hand the typical static

01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:20,820
type checker
 

4685
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:24,950
type checker
still has a release like

4686
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960

 

4687
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,310

every month every two months certainly

4688
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:28,320
every month every two months certainly
 

4689
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,109
every month every two months certainly
many times a year

4690
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:30,119
many times a year
 

4691
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:34,010
many times a year
uh some type Checkers also include a

4692
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,020
uh some type Checkers also include a
 

4693
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:35,350
uh some type Checkers also include a
bunch of

4694
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
bunch of
 

4695
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,450
bunch of
experimental ideas that aren't official

4696
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:38,460
experimental ideas that aren't official
 

4697
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:42,830
experimental ideas that aren't official
standard python syntax yet yeah uh the

4698
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:42,840
standard python syntax yet yeah uh the
 

4699
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,350
standard python syntax yet yeah uh the
static type Checkers also just get

4700
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,360
static type Checkers also just get
 

4701
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,450
static type Checkers also just get
better at discovering

4702
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:47,460
better at discovering
 

4703
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:50,870
better at discovering
things that that sort of are unspecified

4704
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
things that that sort of are unspecified
 

4705
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,270
things that that sort of are unspecified
by the language but that sort of could

4706
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,280
by the language but that sort of could
 

4707
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,669
by the language but that sort of could
make sense and so each static type

4708
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:55,679
make sense and so each static type
 

4709
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:58,609
make sense and so each static type
Checker actually has its sort of strong

4710
01:42:58,609 --> 01:42:58,619
Checker actually has its sort of strong
 

4711
01:42:58,619 --> 01:43:01,129
Checker actually has its sort of strong
and weak points so it's cool it's like a

4712
01:43:01,129 --> 01:43:01,139
and weak points so it's cool it's like a
 

4713
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:03,350
and weak points so it's cool it's like a

Google and all and you get to see and

4716
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:05,340
Google and all and you get to see and
 

4717
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,890
Google and all and you get to see and
you see that everywhere right because

4718
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:06,900
you see that everywhere right because
 

4719
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:10,490
you see that everywhere right because
there's not one single uh JavaScript in

01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:10,500
there's not one single uh JavaScript in
 

4721
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,890
there's not one single uh JavaScript in

but that said you said there's not

4728
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,020
but that said you said there's not
 

4729
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:21,169

interest I think there is a lot of

4730
01:43:21,169 --> 01:43:21,179
interest I think there is a lot of
 

4731
01:43:21,179 --> 01:43:23,390
interest I think there is a lot of
interest in type hinting right

4732
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:23,400
interest in type hinting right
 

4733
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:27,169
interest in type hinting right
um in the pep 484. actually like how

4734
01:43:27,169 --> 01:43:27,179
um in the pep 484. actually like how
 

4735
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:28,790
um in the pep 484. actually like how
many people use that do you have a sense

4736
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,800
many people use that do you have a sense
 

4737
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,010
many people use that do you have a sense
how many people use because it's

4738
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,020
how many people use because it's
 

4739
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:34,550
how many people use because it's
optional it's the sugar I can't put a

4740
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:34,560
optional it's the sugar I can't put a
 

4741
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,649
optional it's the sugar I can't put a
number on it but

4742
01:43:36,649 --> 01:43:36,659
number on it but
 

4743
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:39,229
number on it but
from the number of packages that do

4744
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:39,239
from the number of packages that do

01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,510
from the number of packages that do
interesting things with it at runtime

4746
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:41,520
interesting things with it at runtime
 

4747
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,570
interesting things with it at runtime
and the fact that there are like

4748
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:44,580
and the fact that there are like
 

4749
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:47,330
and the fact that there are like
now three or four very mature type

4750
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:47,340
now three or four very mature type
 

4751

4753
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,709

that each have their their segment of

that each have their their segment of
 

4755
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:53,930
that each have their their segment of
the market and oh and then there is a

4756
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:53,940
the market and oh and then there is a
 

4757
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,030
the market and oh and then there is a

pie charm which has a sort of more
heuristic based type Checker that also

4760
01:43:58,189 --> 01:43:58,199
heuristic based type Checker that also
 

4761
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,350
heuristic based type Checker that also
supports the same syntax

4762
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:00,360
supports the same syntax
 

4763
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,169
supports the same syntax
my assumption is that

4764
01:44:03,169 --> 01:44:03,179
my assumption is that
 

4765
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:06,350
my assumption is that
many many people developing python

4783
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,910
testing routine that that happens for
basically every every commit

4784
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:30,920
basically every every commit
 

4785
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,850
basically every every commit
uh is run a static type checker and in

4786
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:34,860
uh is run a static type checker and in
 

4787
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:39,590
uh is run a static type checker and in
most in most cases that will be my pie

4788
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600

 

4789
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,709

so I think it's pretty popular topic

4790
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
so I think it's pretty popular topic
 

4791
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,470
so I think it's pretty popular topic
according to this webpage

01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:45,480
according to this webpage
 

4793
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:49,070
according to this webpage
20 to 30 percent of Python 3 code bases

4794
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,080
20 to 30 percent of Python 3 code bases
 

4795
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,109
20 to 30 percent of Python 3 code bases
are using type hints

4796
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
are using type hints
 

4797
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,390
are using type hints
wow I wonder how they measured that did

4798
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:53,400
wow I wonder how they measured that did
 

4799
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,430
wow I wonder how they measured that did
they just scan all of GitHub

4800
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:55,440
they just scan all of GitHub
 

4801
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,830
they just scan all of GitHub
yeah that's what it looks like yeah they

4802
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
yeah that's what it looks like yeah they
 

4803
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,530
yeah that's what it looks like yeah they
did a quick sentence all of but like a

4804
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:00,540
did a quick sentence all of but like a
 

4805
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,870
did a quick sentence all of but like a
random sampling

4806
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:02,880
random sampling
 

4807
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,570
random sampling
so you mentioned pie charm let me ask

4808
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:05,580
so you mentioned pie charm let me ask
 

4809
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:09,290
so you mentioned pie charm let me ask
you the uh the big subjective question

4810
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:09,300
you the uh the big subjective question
 

4811
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:13,609
you the uh the big subjective question
what's the best IDE for Python and

4812
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:13,619
what's the best IDE for Python and
 

4813
01:45:13,619 --> 01:45:15,350
what's the best IDE for Python and
you're extremely biased now that you're

4814
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
you're extremely biased now that you're
 

4815
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,390
you're extremely biased now that you're
with Microsoft

4816

um is it pie charm vs code Vim or emex

4818
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:21,260
um is it pie charm vs code Vim or emex
 

4819
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:25,010
um is it pie charm vs code Vim or emex
historically I actually uh started out

4820
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:25,020
historically I actually uh started out
 

4821
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,530
historically I actually uh started out
with using Vim but when it was still

4822
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:27,540
with using Vim but when it was still
 

4823
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,229
with using Vim but when it was still
called VI

4824
01:45:29,229 --> 01:45:29,239
called VI
 

4825
01:45:29,239 --> 01:45:33,410
called VI
uh for a very long time I think from the

4826
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:33,420
uh for a very long time I think from the
 

4827
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:36,590
uh for a very long time I think from the
early 80s to uh

4828
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:36,600
early 80s to uh
 

4829
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,830
early 80s to uh
I'd say two years ago

4830
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
I'd say two years ago
 

4831
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,590
I'd say two years ago
I was emacs user nice between I'd say

4832
01:45:44,590 --> 01:45:44,600
I was emacs user nice between I'd say
 

4833
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:48,590
I was emacs user nice between I'd say
2013 and 2018

4834

2013 and 2018
 

4835
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:52,090
2013 and 2018
I dabbled with pie charm

4836
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:52,100
I dabbled with pie charm
 

4837
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,370
I dabbled with pie charm
uh mostly because it had

4838
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:55,380
uh mostly because it had
 

4839
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:57,950
uh mostly because it had
had a couple of features I mean

4840
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:57,960
had a couple of features I mean
 

4841
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,870
had a couple of features I mean
pie charm

4842
01:45:59,870 --> 01:45:59,880
pie charm
 

4843
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:03,470
pie charm
is like deriving an 18-wheeler truck

4844
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:03,480
is like deriving an 18-wheeler truck
 

4845
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,870
is like deriving an 18-wheeler truck
whereas emacs is more

driving uh your comfortable Toyota car
 

4851
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,629
driving uh your comfortable Toyota car
that's that's that that you've had for a

that's that's that that you've had for a
 

4853
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,490
that's that's that that you've had for a
hundred thousand miles and you know what

hundred thousand miles and you know what
 

4855
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,129

every little rattle of the car means

4856
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:19,139
every little rattle of the car means
 

4857
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:22,010
every little rattle of the car means
I was very comfortable in emacs uh but

4858
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:22,020
I was very comfortable in emacs uh but
 

4859
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:23,510
I was very comfortable in emacs uh but
there were certain things it couldn't do

4860
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
there were certain things it couldn't do
 

4861
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,689
there were certain things it couldn't do
it wasn't very good at at sort of at

4862
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:26,699
it wasn't very good at at sort of at
 

4863
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:30,709
it wasn't very good at at sort of at
least the way I had configured it

4864
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:30,719
least the way I had configured it
 

4865
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,470
least the way I had configured it
I didn't have very good Tooling in emacs

4866
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:33,480
I didn't have very good Tooling in emacs
 

4867
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,189
I didn't have very good Tooling in emacs
for finding a definition of a function

4868
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:36,199
for finding a definition of a function
 

4869
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:39,550
for finding a definition of a function
got it when I was at Dropbox

4870
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:39,560
got it when I was at Dropbox
 

4871
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,129
got it when I was at Dropbox
exploring a 5 million line python code

4872
01:46:43,129 --> 01:46:43,139
exploring a 5 million line python code
 

4873

exploring a 5 million line python code
base

4874
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
base
 

4875
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:48,169
base
uh just grabbing all that code for where

4876
01:46:48,169 --> 01:46:48,179
uh just grabbing all that code for where
 

4877
01:46:48,179 --> 01:46:50,149
uh just grabbing all that code for where
they're where is there a class Fubar

4878
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:50,159
they're where is there a class Fubar
 

4879
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,850
they're where is there a class Fubar
Well turns out that if you grab all five

4880
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:52,860
Well turns out that if you grab all five
 

4881
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:55,129
Well turns out that if you grab all five
million lines of code there are many

4882
01:46:55,129 --> 01:46:55,139
million lines of code there are many
 

4883
01:46:55,139 --> 01:46:57,950
million lines of code there are many
classes with the same name

4884
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:57,960
classes with the same name
 

4885
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,669
classes with the same name
and so pycharm sort of once once you've

4886
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:01,679
and so pycharm sort of once once you've
 

4887
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,669
and so pycharm sort of once once you've
fired it up and once it's indexed your

4888
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:04,679
fired it up and once it's indexed your
 

4889
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:08,689
fired it up and once it's indexed your
repository uh was very helpful but as

4890
01:47:08,689 --> 01:47:08,699
repository uh was very helpful but as
 

4891
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:11,870
repository uh was very helpful but as
soon as I had to edit code I would jump

4892
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:11,880
soon as I had to edit code I would jump
 

4893
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,030
soon as I had to edit code I would jump
back to emex and do all my editing there

4894
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:14,040
back to emex and do all my editing there
 

4895
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,250
back to emex and do all my editing there
because I could type much faster and

4896
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:16,260
because I could type much faster and
 

4897
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,430
because I could type much faster and
switch between files when I was when I

4898
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
switch between files when I was when I
 

4899
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,350
switch between files when I was when I
knew which file I wanted much much

4900
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:21,360
knew which file I wanted much much
 

4901
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,450
knew which file I wanted much much
quicker and I never really got used to

4902
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:23,460
quicker and I never really got used to
 

4903
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,290
quicker and I never really got used to
the the whole pie charm user interface

4904
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:26,300
the the whole pie charm user interface
 

4905
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:29,090
the the whole pie charm user interface
yeah I feel torn in that same kind of

4906
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:29,100
yeah I feel torn in that same kind of
 

4907
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,370
yeah I feel torn in that same kind of
way because I've used pycharm off and on

4908
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:31,380
way because I've used pycharm off and on
 

4909
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,470
way because I've used pycharm off and on
exactly in that same way

4910
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:33,480
exactly in that same way
 

4911
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:36,290
exactly in that same way
and I feel like I'm just being an old

4912
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:36,300
and I feel like I'm just being an old
 

4913
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,609
and I feel like I'm just being an old
grumpy man

4914
01:47:37,609 --> 01:47:37,619
grumpy man
 

4915
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:39,709
grumpy man
for not learning how to quickly switch

4916
01:47:39,709 --> 01:47:39,719
for not learning how to quickly switch
 

4917
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,149

between files and all that kind of stuff

4918
01:47:41,149 --> 01:47:41,159
between files and all that kind of stuff
 

4919
01:47:41,159 --> 01:47:42,169
between files and all that kind of stuff
I feel like that has to do with

4920
01:47:42,169 --> 01:47:42,179
I feel like that has to do with
 

4921
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:44,510
I feel like that has to do with
shortcuts that has to do with um I mean

4922
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:44,520
shortcuts that has to do with um I mean
 

4923
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,770
shortcuts that has to do with um I mean
you just have to get accustomed just

4924
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:45,780
you just have to get accustomed just
 

4925
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:47,570
you just have to get accustomed just
like with touch typing yeah you have to

4926
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:47,580
like with touch typing yeah you have to
 

4927
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:49,790
like with touch typing yeah you have to
just want to to learn that I mean if you

4928
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:49,800
just want to to learn that I mean if you
 

4929
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,010
just want to to learn that I mean if you
don't need it much you don't need touch

4930
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:52,020
don't need it much you don't need touch
 

4931
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,290
don't need it much you don't need touch
typing either you can type with two

4932
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:54,300
typing either you can type with two
 

4933
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,450
typing either you can type with two
fingers just fine in the short term but

4934
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:56,460
fingers just fine in the short term but
 

4935
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,790
fingers just fine in the short term but
in the long term your life will become

5035
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,970
isn't I'm not even asking questions
but I'm sure a lot of people are not

I I think that that sort of everybody

5040
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,020
I I think that that sort of everybody
 

5041
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:09,770
I I think that that sort of everybody
has to decide for themselves which one

5042
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:09,780
has to decide for themselves which one

they want to to invest more time in
I actually

5046
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:15,540
I actually
 

5047
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:19,010
I actually
ended up giving vs code a very tentative

5048
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:19,020
ended up giving vs code a very tentative
 

5049
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,669
ended up giving vs code a very tentative
try when I started out at Microsoft and

5050
01:50:22,669 --> 01:50:22,679
try when I started out at Microsoft and
 

5051
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:24,250
try when I started out at Microsoft and
really liking it

5052
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:24,260
really liking it
 

5053
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:28,189
really liking it
and it sort of it took me a while before

5054
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:28,199
and it sort of it took me a while before
 

5055
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:30,709
and it sort of it took me a while before
I realized why that was

5056
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
I realized why that was
 

5057
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,590
I realized why that was
but and and I think that actually the

5058
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:33,600
but and and I think that actually the
 

5059
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,990
but and and I think that actually the
founders of vs code may not necessarily

5060
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:36,000
founders of vs code may not necessarily
 

5061
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,510
founders of vs code may not necessarily
agree with me on this

5062
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:38,520
agree with me on this
 

5063
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:42,770
agree with me on this
but to me vs code is in a sense the

5064
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:42,780
but to me vs code is in a sense the
 

5065
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:46,550
but to me vs code is in a sense the
spiritual successor of emacs

spiritual successor of emacs
 

5067
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,410
spiritual successor of emacs
because

5068
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:48,420
because
 

5069
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,990
because
as you probably know as an old emacs

01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:51,000
as you probably know as an old emacs
 

5071

hack
 

5073
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:55,430
hack
the the key part of emacs is that it

5074
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:55,440
the the key part of emacs is that it
 

5075
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,330
the the key part of emacs is that it
it's mostly written in in lisp

5076
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:58,340
it's mostly written in in lisp

it's mostly written in in lisp
and that that sort of new features of of

and that that sort of new features of of
 

5079
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:05,149
and that that sort of new features of of
emacs usually update all the list

5080
01:51:05,149 --> 01:51:05,159
emacs usually update all the list
 

5081
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:09,229
emacs usually update all the list
packages and add new list packages and

5082
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:09,239
packages and add new list packages and
 

5083
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:11,270
packages and add new list packages and
oh yeah there's also

5084
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,280
oh yeah there's also
 

5085
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,450
oh yeah there's also
some very obscure thing improved in the

5086
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:14,460
some very obscure thing improved in the
 

5087
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:16,310
some very obscure thing improved in the
part that's not in lisp

5088

part that's not in lisp
 

5089
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,830
part that's not in lisp
but that's usually not why I would

01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:18,840
but that's usually not why I would
 

5091
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,810
but that's usually not why I would
upgrade to a new version of emacs

there's a core implementation

that that sort of
 

5097
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,149
that that sort of
can read a file and it can put bits on

5098
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:29,159
can read a file and it can put bits on
 

5099
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,910
can read a file and it can put bits on
the screen and it can sort of manage

5100
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:31,920
the screen and it can sort of manage
 

5101
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,910
the screen and it can sort of manage
memory and buffers and then what makes

5102
01:51:34,910 --> 01:51:34,920
memory and buffers and then what makes
 

5103
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,510
memory and buffers and then what makes
it an editor full of features is all the

5104
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:38,520
it an editor full of features is all the
 

5105
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,030
it an editor full of features is all the
list packages and of course the design

5106
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,040
list packages and of course the design
 

5107
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,970
list packages and of course the design
of how the list packages interact with

5108
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:43,980
of how the list packages interact with
 

5109
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:46,550
of how the list packages interact with
each other and with that that sort of

5110
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
each other and with that that sort of
 

5111
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,510
each other and with that that sort of
that base layer of of the the core

5112
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:50,520
that base layer of of the the core
 

5113
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,310
that base layer of of the the core
immutable engine without almost

5114
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
immutable engine without almost
 

5115
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,250
immutable engine without almost
everything in that core engine in emacs

5116
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:55,260
everything in that core engine in emacs
 

5117
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:59,209
everything in that core engine in emacs
case can still be overridden or replaced

5118
01:51:59,209 --> 01:51:59,219
case can still be overridden or replaced
 

5119
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:02,750
case can still be overridden or replaced
and so

5120
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:02,760

 

5121
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,229

vs code has a similar architecture where

5122
01:52:06,229 --> 01:52:06,239
vs code has a similar architecture where
 

5123
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:09,109
vs code has a similar architecture where
there is like

5124
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
there is like
 

5125
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:12,950
there is like
a base engine that you have no control

5126
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:12,960
a base engine that you have no control
 

5127
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,090
a base engine that you have no control
over

5128
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:14,100
over
 

5129
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,689

01:52:16,689 --> 01:52:16,699
I mean it's open source but nobody
 

5131
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:21,470
I mean it's open source but nobody
except the people who work on that part

5132
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:21,480
except the people who work on that part
 

5133
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,270
except the people who work on that part
changes it much

5134
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
changes it much
 

5135
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,870
changes it much
uh and it has a sort of a package

5136
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
uh and it has a sort of a package
 

5137
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,070
uh and it has a sort of a package
manager

5138
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,080

5139
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,609

people who don't then read the thing you
should you should but it was uh

one table and you show up one at a time
and you're prepared and I actually

and you're prepared and I actually
 

5287
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,229
and you're prepared and I actually
looked it up and there is restaurants

5288
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:45,239
looked it up and there is restaurants
 

5289
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:48,050
looked it up and there is restaurants
like this throughout the world and it

there are proper places that probably
more or less work like that but I've

more or less work like that but I've

01:56:25,850 --> 01:56:25,860
I'll just open with a crazy example to
 

5323
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:27,770
I'll just open with a crazy example to
catch your attention and the rest is

5324
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:27,780
catch your attention and the rest is
 

5325
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,890
catch your attention and the rest is
very dry stuff about uh locks and

5326
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:30,900
very dry stuff about uh locks and
 

5327
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:33,350
very dry stuff about uh locks and
semaphores and how uh semaphore is a

5328
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
semaphores and how uh semaphore is a
 

5329
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,750
semaphores and how uh semaphore is a
generalization of a lock well it was

5330
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:35,760
generalization of a lock well it was
 

5331
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,790
generalization of a lock well it was
very poetic and well delivered and it

5332
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:37,800
very poetic and well delivered and it
 

5333
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,350
very poetic and well delivered and it
actually made me wonder if it's real or

5334
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:39,360
actually made me wonder if it's real or
 

5335
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,970
actually made me wonder if it's real or
not because you don't make that explicit

5336
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:40,980
not because you don't make that explicit
 

5337
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:43,910
not because you don't make that explicit
and it feels like it could be true and

5338
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:43,920
and it feels like it could be true and
 

5339
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,290
and it feels like it could be true and
in fact I wouldn't be surprised if

5340
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:45,300
in fact I wouldn't be surprised if
 

5341
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,390
in fact I wouldn't be surprised if
somebody like listens to this and knows

somebody like listens to this and knows

Silicon Valley anyway can we step back

5346
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:51,480
Silicon Valley anyway can we step back
 

5347
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,470
Silicon Valley anyway can we step back
and can you just talk about parallelism

5348
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
and can you just talk about parallelism
 

5349
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,709
and can you just talk about parallelism
concurrency threading

5350

asynchronous all these different terms

what is it sort of a high philosophical

5354
01:57:01,790 --> 01:57:01,800
what is it sort of a high philosophical
 

5355
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,950
what is it sort of a high philosophical
level the the fisherman is back in the

5356
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:03,960
level the the fisherman is back in the
 

5357
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,830
level the the fisherman is back in the
boat well the idea is if the fisherman

5358
01:57:06,830 --> 01:57:06,840
boat well the idea is if the fisherman
 

5359
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:09,850
boat well the idea is if the fisherman
has uh two fishing rods

5360
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:09,860
has uh two fishing rods
 

5361
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:12,709
has uh two fishing rods
uh since fishing is mostly a matter of

5362
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:12,719
uh since fishing is mostly a matter of
 

5363
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:15,649
uh since fishing is mostly a matter of
waiting for a fish to nibble well it

5364
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:15,659
waiting for a fish to nibble well it
 

5365
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:17,450
waiting for a fish to nibble well it
depends on how you do it actually but if

5366
01:57:17,450 --> 01:57:17,460
depends on how you do it actually but if
 

5367
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,850
depends on how you do it actually but if
you had two if if you're doing the style

5368
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:19,860
you had two if if you're doing the style
 

5369
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:21,709
you had two if if you're doing the style
of fishing where you sort of you you

5370
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:21,719
of fishing where you sort of you you
 

5371
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:25,070
of fishing where you sort of you you
throw it out and then you let it sit for

5372
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:25,080
throw it out and then you let it sit for
 

5373
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,770
throw it out and then you let it sit for
a while until maybe you see a nibble one

5374
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:27,780
a while until maybe you see a nibble one
 

5375
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:30,649
a while until maybe you see a nibble one
fisherman can easily run two or three or

5376
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:30,659
fisherman can easily run two or three or
 

5377
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:31,550
fisherman can easily run two or three or
four

5378
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:31,560
four
 

5379
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,430
four
fishing rods and so as long as you can

5380
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:34,440
fishing rods and so as long as you can
 

5381
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,709
fishing rods and so as long as you can
afford the equipment you can catch four

5382
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:36,719
afford the equipment you can catch four
 

5383
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:38,689
afford the equipment you can catch four
times as many fish by

5384
01:57:38,689 --> 01:57:38,699
times as many fish by
 

5385
01:57:38,699 --> 01:57:41,750
times as many fish by
a small investment in four fishing rods

5386
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:41,760
a small investment in four fishing rods
 

5387
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,050
a small investment in four fishing rods
and so since your time you sort of say

5388
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:45,060
and so since your time you sort of say
 

5389
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:47,810
and so since your time you sort of say
you have all Saturday to go fishing if

5390
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:47,820
you have all Saturday to go fishing if
 

5391
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:50,450
you have all Saturday to go fishing if
you can catch four times as much fish

5392
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:50,460
you can catch four times as much fish
 

5393
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:53,149
you can catch four times as much fish
you have a much higher productivity and

5394
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:53,159
you have a much higher productivity and
 

5395
01:57:53,159 --> 01:57:54,709
you have a much higher productivity and
that's actually I think how deep sea

5396
01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
that's actually I think how deep sea
 

5397
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:56,390
that's actually I think how deep sea
fishing is done you could just have a

5398
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:56,400
fishing is done you could just have a
 

5399
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,830
fishing is done you could just have a
rod and you put in a hole so you could

5400
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
rod and you put in a hole so you could
 

5401
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,189
rod and you put in a hole so you could
have many rods uh what is there an

5402
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
have many rods uh what is there an
 

5403
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:02,350
have many rods uh what is there an
interesting difference between

5404
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:02,360
interesting difference between
 

5405
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,850
interesting difference between
parallelism and concurrency

5406
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:04,860
parallelism and concurrency
 

5407
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:08,510
parallelism and concurrency
and asynchronous is there one subset of

5408
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:08,520
and asynchronous is there one subset of
 

5409
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,070
and asynchronous is there one subset of
the other to you like how do you think

5410
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:10,080
the other to you like how do you think
 

5411
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,990
the other to you like how do you think
about these terms in the computer World

5412
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
about these terms in the computer World
 

5413
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,470
about these terms in the computer World
there is a big difference when people

5414
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:15,480
there is a big difference when people
 

5415
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,370
there is a big difference when people
are talking about parallelism uh like a

5416
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:19,380
are talking about parallelism uh like a
 

5417
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:21,649
are talking about parallelism uh like a
parallel computer

5418
01:58:21,649 --> 01:58:21,659
parallel computer
 

5419
01:58:21,659 --> 01:58:24,410
parallel computer
that's usually really

5420
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:24,420
that's usually really
 

5421
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:28,490
that's usually really
several complete CPUs that are sort of

5422
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:28,500
several complete CPUs that are sort of
 

5423
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,890
several complete CPUs that are sort of
tied together and and

5424
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:30,900
tied together and and
 

5425
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,609
tied together and and
share something like memory or an i o

5426
01:58:34,609 --> 01:58:34,619
share something like memory or an i o
 

5427
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:35,890
share something like memory or an i o

bus
 

5429
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:39,709

uh concurrency can be a much more

5430
01:58:39,709 --> 01:58:39,719
uh concurrency can be a much more
 

5431
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:41,689
uh concurrency can be a much more
abstract concept

5432
01:58:41,689 --> 01:58:41,699
abstract concept
 

5433
01:58:41,699 --> 01:58:43,490
abstract concept
where

5434
01:58:43,490 --> 01:58:43,500
where
 

5435
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:47,470
where
you have the illusion that things happen

5436
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:47,480
you have the illusion that things happen
 

5437
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:49,550
you have the illusion that things happen
simultaneously but what the computer

5438
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:49,560
simultaneously but what the computer
 

5439
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,770
simultaneously but what the computer
actually does is

5440
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:51,780
actually does is
 

5441
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:54,350
actually does is
it spends a little time running some

5442
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:54,360
it spends a little time running some
 

5443
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,450
it spends a little time running some
this program for a while and then it

5444
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:56,460
this program for a while and then it
 

5445
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:57,950
this program for a while and then it
spends some time running that program

01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:02,460
for the third program for a while
 

5451
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:05,990
for the third program for a while
the parallelism is the reality and

5452
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,000
the parallelism is the reality and
 

5453
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,149
the parallelism is the reality and
concurrency is part reality part

5454
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
concurrency is part reality part
 

5455
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,870
concurrency is part reality part
illusion yeah parallelism typically

5456
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
illusion yeah parallelism typically
 

5457
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,089
illusion yeah parallelism typically
implies that there is multiple copies of

5458
01:59:14,089 --> 01:59:14,099
implies that there is multiple copies of
 

5459
01:59:14,099 --> 01:59:15,589
implies that there is multiple copies of

the hardware
 

5461
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,330
the hardware
you write that implementing

5462
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:17,340
you write that implementing
 

5463
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:19,850
you write that implementing
synchronization Primitives is hard in

5464
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:19,860
synchronization Primitives is hard in
 

5465
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:22,189
synchronization Primitives is hard in
that blog post and you talk about locks

5466
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:22,199
that blog post and you talk about locks
 

5467
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:24,649
that blog post and you talk about locks
and semaphores why is it hard to

5468
01:59:24,649 --> 01:59:24,659
and semaphores why is it hard to
 

5469
01:59:24,659 --> 01:59:26,750
and semaphores why is it hard to
implement synchronization Primitives

5470
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:26,760
implement synchronization Primitives
 

5471
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,530
implement synchronization Primitives
because at the conscious level our

5472
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:30,540
because at the conscious level our
 

5473
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:34,729

and chew gum at the same time

5480
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:43,380
and chew gum at the same time
 

5481
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:46,669
and chew gum at the same time
because they're both activities that

01:59:46,669 --> 01:59:46,679
because they're both activities that
 

5483
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:49,310

and watching a murder mystery on TV yeah

5492
01:59:57,589 --> 01:59:57,599
and watching a murder mystery on TV yeah
 

5493
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,709
and watching a murder mystery on TV yeah
you'll mix up the digits or you'll miss

5494
02:00:00,709 --> 02:00:00,719
you'll mix up the digits or you'll miss
 

5495

you'll mix up the digits or you'll miss
an essential clue on in the TV show

02:00:03,649 --> 02:00:03,659
an essential clue on in the TV show
 

5497
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:04,970
an essential clue on in the TV show
so why does it matter that the

5498
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:04,980
so why does it matter that the
 

5499
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:07,129
so why does it matter that the
programmer the human

5500
02:00:07,129 --> 02:00:07,139
programmer the human
 

5501
02:00:07,139 --> 02:00:10,490
programmer the human
is uh is bad because the programmer is

5502
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:10,500
is uh is bad because the programmer is
 

5503
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,470
is uh is bad because the programmer is
at least with the current state of the

writing the code correctly and it's hard

5508
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:18,900
writing the code correctly and it's hard
 

5509
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,089
writing the code correctly and it's hard
enough

5510
02:00:20,089 --> 02:00:20,099
enough
 

5511
02:00:20,099 --> 02:00:22,129
enough
to keep track of

5512
02:00:22,129 --> 02:00:22,139
to keep track of
 

5513
02:00:22,139 --> 02:00:24,589
to keep track of
a recipe that you just

5514
02:00:24,589 --> 02:00:24,599
a recipe that you just
 

5515
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:27,830
a recipe that you just
execute one step at a time

02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:41,580
of code what what is going on okay we're
 

5525
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:45,770

we're loading the number of mermaids in

5526
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:45,780
we're loading the number of mermaids in
 

5527
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:48,290
we're loading the number of mermaids in
variable a and the number of mermen in

variable a and the number of mermen in
 

5529
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,990
variable a and the number of mermen in
variable B and now we take the average

metaphor to Metaphor I like it you have

5534
02:00:57,589 --> 02:00:57,599
metaphor to Metaphor I like it you have
 

5535
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,810
metaphor to Metaphor I like it you have
to keep in your head what is an a what

5536
02:00:59,810 --> 02:00:59,820
to keep in your head what is an a what
 

5537
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:03,050
to keep in your head what is an a what
is in B what is in C uh hopefully you

5538
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:03,060
is in B what is in C uh hopefully you
 

5539
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:04,850
is in B what is in C uh hopefully you
have better names

5540
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:04,860
have better names
 

5541
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:07,910
have better names
and that is challenging enough

5542
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:07,920
and that is challenging enough
 

5543
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,089
and that is challenging enough

02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:28,980
a is the number of fishermen and B is
 

5559
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:30,709
a is the number of fishermen and B is
the number of programmers

5560
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
the number of programmers
 

5561
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:33,470
the number of programmers
but in another part of the code a is the

5562
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:33,480
but in another part of the code a is the
 

5563
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,149
but in another part of the code a is the
number of mermaids and B is the number

5564
02:01:35,149 --> 02:01:35,159
number of mermaids and B is the number
 

5565
02:01:35,159 --> 02:01:36,649
number of mermaids and B is the number
of merman

5566

of merman
 

5567
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:40,430
of merman
and somehow that's the same variable if

5568
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,440
and somehow that's the same variable if
 

5569
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,530
and somehow that's the same variable if
you do it sequentially if first you do

5570
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:42,540
you do it sequentially if first you do
 

5571
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:45,290
you do it sequentially if first you do
your mermaid mer people computation and

5572
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:45,300
your mermaid mer people computation and
 

5573
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:47,030
your mermaid mer people computation and
then you do your people in the boat

5574
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:47,040
then you do your people in the boat
 

5575
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:50,149
then you do your people in the boat
computation it doesn't matter that the

5576
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:50,159
computation it doesn't matter that the
 

5577
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:52,250
computation it doesn't matter that the
variables are called A and B and that is

5578
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:52,260
variables are called A and B and that is
 

5579
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:54,290
variables are called A and B and that is
literally the same variable because you

5580
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:54,300
literally the same variable because you
 

5581
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,570
literally the same variable because you
you're done with one use of that

5582
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:56,580
you're done with one use of that
 

5583
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,850
you're done with one use of that
variable but when you mix them together

5584
02:01:58,850 --> 02:01:58,860
variable but when you mix them together
 

5585
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:01,129
variable but when you mix them together
suddenly

5586
02:02:01,129 --> 02:02:01,139
suddenly
 

5587
02:02:01,139 --> 02:02:03,589
suddenly
the number of more people replaces the

5588
02:02:03,589 --> 02:02:03,599
the number of more people replaces the
 

5589
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,570
the number of more people replaces the
number of fishermen and your computation

5590
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:05,580
number of fishermen and your computation
 

5591
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:09,050
number of fishermen and your computation
goes dramatically wrong and there's all

5592
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:09,060
goes dramatically wrong and there's all
 

5593
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,790
goes dramatically wrong and there's all
kinds of ordering

5594
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
kinds of ordering
 

5595
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,189
kinds of ordering
of operations that could result in the

5596
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
of operations that could result in the
 

5597
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:14,870
of operations that could result in the
assignment of those variables and so you

5598
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
assignment of those variables and so you
 

5599
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,310
assignment of those variables and so you
have to anticipate all possible

5600
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,320
have to anticipate all possible
 

5601
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:19,010
have to anticipate all possible
orderings and you think you're smart and

5602
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:19,020
orderings and you think you're smart and
 

5603
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:22,550
orderings and you think you're smart and
you'll put a lock around it and in

5604
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
you'll put a lock around it and in
 

5605
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,669
you'll put a lock around it and in
practice in terms of bugs per lineup per

5606
02:02:25,669 --> 02:02:25,679
practice in terms of bugs per lineup per
 

5607
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:28,010
practice in terms of bugs per lineup per
a thousand lines of code

5608
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:28,020
a thousand lines of code
 

5609
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:30,290
a thousand lines of code
this is an area where everything is

5610
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:30,300
this is an area where everything is
 

5611
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:34,669
this is an area where everything is
worse so a lock is a mechanism by which

5612
02:02:34,669 --> 02:02:34,679
worse so a lock is a mechanism by which
 

5613
02:02:34,679 --> 02:02:37,490
worse so a lock is a mechanism by which
you forbid only one

5614
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:37,500
you forbid only one
 

5615
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:41,089
you forbid only one
Chef can access the oven at a time

5616
02:02:41,089 --> 02:02:41,099
Chef can access the oven at a time
 

5617
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:43,790
Chef can access the oven at a time
something like that and then semaphores

5618
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:43,800
something like that and then semaphores
 

5619
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,070
something like that and then semaphores
allow you to do what multiple ovens

5620
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:46,080
allow you to do what multiple ovens
 

5621
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,410
allow you to do what multiple ovens
that's not the bad idea because if

5622
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:48,420
that's not the bad idea because if
 

5623
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:49,669
that's not the bad idea because if
you're sort of

5624
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
you're sort of
 

5625
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,530
you're sort of
if you're preparing if you're baking

5626
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:51,540
if you're preparing if you're baking
 

5627
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:54,050
if you're preparing if you're baking
cakes and you have multiple people all

5628
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:54,060
cakes and you have multiple people all
 

5629
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:56,089
cakes and you have multiple people all
baking cakes but there's only one oven

5630
02:02:56,089 --> 02:02:56,099
baking cakes but there's only one oven
 

5631
02:02:56,099 --> 02:02:58,609
baking cakes but there's only one oven
yeah then maybe you can tell that the

5632
02:02:58,609 --> 02:02:58,619
yeah then maybe you can tell that the
 

5633
02:02:58,619 --> 02:03:00,910
yeah then maybe you can tell that the
oven is in use but maybe it's preheating

5634
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:00,920
oven is in use but maybe it's preheating
 

5635
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:03,649
oven is in use but maybe it's preheating
uh and so you have to maybe maybe you

5636
02:03:03,649 --> 02:03:03,659
uh and so you have to maybe maybe you
 

5637
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:06,530
uh and so you have to maybe maybe you
make a sign that says oven and use

5638
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:06,540
make a sign that says oven and use
 

5639
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:09,229
make a sign that says oven and use
uh and you flip the sign over and it

5640
02:03:09,229 --> 02:03:09,239
uh and you flip the sign over and it
 

5641
02:03:09,239 --> 02:03:10,970
uh and you flip the sign over and it
says often is free when you're done

5642
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:10,980
says often is free when you're done
 

5643
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:12,709
says often is free when you're done
baking your cake

5644
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:12,719
baking your cake
 

5645
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,830
baking your cake
uh that's a lock that's sort of and and

5646
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:15,840
uh that's a lock that's sort of and and
 

5647
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,070
uh that's a lock that's sort of and and
what do you do when you have two ovens

5648
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:19,080
what do you do when you have two ovens
 

5649
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,649
what do you do when you have two ovens
or maybe you have ten ovens do you you

5650
02:03:21,649 --> 02:03:21,659
or maybe you have ten ovens do you you
 

5651
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:24,109
or maybe you have ten ovens do you you
can put a separate sign on each oven or

5652
02:03:24,109 --> 02:03:24,119
can put a separate sign on each oven or
 

5653
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:26,330
can put a separate sign on each oven or
maybe you can sort of someone who comes

5654
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:26,340
maybe you can sort of someone who comes
 

5655
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,910
maybe you can sort of someone who comes
in wants to see at a glance

5656
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:28,920
in wants to see at a glance
 

5657
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:31,010
in wants to see at a glance
and maybe there's an electronic sign

5658
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:31,020
and maybe there's an electronic sign
 

5659
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,950
and maybe there's an electronic sign
that says uh there are still five ovens

5660
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:33,960
that says uh there are still five ovens
 

5661
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:34,990
that says uh there are still five ovens
available

5662
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:35,000
available
 

5663
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,450
available
uh or maybe they're already

5664
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:38,460
uh or maybe they're already
 

5665
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:41,810
uh or maybe they're already
three people waiting for an oven so you

5666
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:41,820
three people waiting for an oven so you
 

5667
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:43,010
three people waiting for an oven so you
can

5668
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:43,020
can
 

5669
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,649
can
if you see an oven that's not in use

5670
02:03:45,649 --> 02:03:45,659
if you see an oven that's not in use
 

5671
02:03:45,659 --> 02:03:47,570
if you see an oven that's not in use
it's already reserved for someone else

5672
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:47,580
it's already reserved for someone else
 

5673
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:49,250
it's already reserved for someone else
who got in line first

5674
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:49,260
who got in line first
 

5675
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:51,109
who got in line first
and that's sort of what what what the

5676
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
and that's sort of what what what the
 

5677
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:52,609
and that's sort of what what what the
restaurant metaphor was trying to

5678
02:03:52,609 --> 02:03:52,619
restaurant metaphor was trying to
 

5679
02:03:52,619 --> 02:03:56,030
restaurant metaphor was trying to
explain yeah and so you're now tasks

5680
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:56,040
explain yeah and so you're now tasks
 

5681
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:58,550
explain yeah and so you're now tasks
you're sitting as a designer of python

5682
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:58,560
you're sitting as a designer of python
 

5683
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,250
you're sitting as a designer of python
with a team of brilliant core developers

5684
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:01,260
with a team of brilliant core developers
 

5685
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,530
with a team of brilliant core developers
and have to try to figure out to what

5686
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:03,540
and have to try to figure out to what
 

5687
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:05,089
and have to try to figure out to what
degree can any of these ideas be

5688
02:04:05,089 --> 02:04:05,099
degree can any of these ideas be
 

5689
02:04:05,099 --> 02:04:08,149
degree can any of these ideas be
integrated and not so maybe this is a

5690
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
integrated and not so maybe this is a
 

5691
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,030
integrated and not so maybe this is a
good time to ask what is async IO

5692
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,040
good time to ask what is async IO
 

5693
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:15,589
good time to ask what is async IO
and how has it evolved since Python 3.4

5694
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599
and how has it evolved since Python 3.4
 

5695
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:19,310
and how has it evolved since Python 3.4
wow yeah so we had this really old

5696
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:19,320
wow yeah so we had this really old
 

5697
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:23,470
wow yeah so we had this really old
library for for doing things

5698
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:23,480
library for for doing things
 

5699
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:26,149
library for for doing things
concurrently especially things that had

5700
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
concurrently especially things that had
 

5701
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:29,930
concurrently especially things that had
to do with IO and uh networking i o was

5702
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:29,940
to do with IO and uh networking i o was
 

5703
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:34,129
to do with IO and uh networking i o was
especially uh sort of a popular topic

5704
02:04:34,129 --> 02:04:34,139
especially uh sort of a popular topic
 

5705
02:04:34,139 --> 02:04:36,410
especially uh sort of a popular topic
and

5706
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:36,420
and
 

5707
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,510
and
in the python standard Library we had a

5708
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:40,520
in the python standard Library we had a
 

5709
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:43,850
in the python standard Library we had a
brief period where there was lots of

5710
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:43,860
brief period where there was lots of
 

5711
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:47,510
brief period where there was lots of
development and I think it was late 90s

5712
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:47,520
development and I think it was late 90s
 

5713
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,470
development and I think it was late 90s
maybe early 2000s and like

5714
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:51,480
maybe early 2000s and like
 

5715
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:53,930
maybe early 2000s and like
two little modules were added that were

5716
02:04:53,930 --> 02:04:53,940
two little modules were added that were
 

5717
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:55,450
two little modules were added that were
the state of the Art of Doing

5718
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:55,460
the state of the Art of Doing
 

5719
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:58,490
the state of the Art of Doing
asynchronous IO or sort of non-blocking

5720
02:04:58,490 --> 02:04:58,500
asynchronous IO or sort of non-blocking
 

5721
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:00,950
asynchronous IO or sort of non-blocking
AIO which means that you can keep

5722
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
AIO which means that you can keep
 

5723
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,530
AIO which means that you can keep
multiple network connections open and

5724
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:03,540
multiple network connections open and
 

5725
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,870
multiple network connections open and
sort of service them all in parallel

5726
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:05,880
sort of service them all in parallel
 

5727
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,870
sort of service them all in parallel
like a typical web server does so iOS

5728
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:08,880
like a typical web server does so iOS
 

5729
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,729
like a typical web server does so iOS
input and outputs you're writing either

reading and writing to a hard drive the

5734
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:16,380
reading and writing to a hard drive the
 

5735
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:20,149
reading and writing to a hard drive the
story also possible and you can do uh

5736
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:20,159
story also possible and you can do uh
 

5737
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,550
story also possible and you can do uh
the ideas you could do to multiple while

5738
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:22,560
the ideas you could do to multiple while
 

5739
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,709
the ideas you could do to multiple while
also doing computation

5740
02:05:24,709 --> 02:05:24,719
also doing computation
 

5741
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:26,930
also doing computation
process of running some code that does

5742
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:26,940
process of running some code that does
 

5743
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:29,209
process of running some code that does
some fancy stuff yeah like when you're

5744
02:05:29,209 --> 02:05:29,219
some fancy stuff yeah like when you're
 

5745
02:05:29,219 --> 02:05:32,149
some fancy stuff yeah like when you're
writing a web server when a request

5746
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:32,159
writing a web server when a request
 

5747
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:35,750
writing a web server when a request
comes in a user sort of needs to see a

5748
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:35,760
comes in a user sort of needs to see a
 

5749
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,430
comes in a user sort of needs to see a
particular web page

5750
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
particular web page
 

5751
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,649
particular web page
uh you have to find that page maybe in

5752
02:05:39,649 --> 02:05:39,659
uh you have to find that page maybe in
 

5753
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:42,470
uh you have to find that page maybe in
the database and format it properly and

5754
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:42,480
the database and format it properly and
 

5755
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,050
the database and format it properly and
send it back to the client and

5756
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:45,060
send it back to the client and
 

5757
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,209
send it back to the client and
there's a lot of waiting waiting for the

5758
02:05:47,209 --> 02:05:47,219
there's a lot of waiting waiting for the
 

5759
02:05:47,219 --> 02:05:49,310
there's a lot of waiting waiting for the
database waiting for the network and so

5760
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:49,320
database waiting for the network and so
 

5761
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,649
database waiting for the network and so
you can handle hundreds or thousands or

5762
02:05:51,649 --> 02:05:51,659
you can handle hundreds or thousands or
 

5763
02:05:51,659 --> 02:05:54,010
you can handle hundreds or thousands or
millions of requests

5764
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:54,020
millions of requests
 

5765
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:57,530
millions of requests
concurrently on one machine anyway waste

5766
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:57,540
concurrently on one machine anyway waste
 

5767
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:59,810
concurrently on one machine anyway waste
of doing that in Python were kind of

5768
02:05:59,810 --> 02:05:59,820
of doing that in Python were kind of
 

5769
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:02,270
of doing that in Python were kind of
stagnated and uh

5770
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:02,280
stagnated and uh
 

5771
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,810
stagnated and uh
I forget it might have been around

5772
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:04,820
I forget it might have been around
 

5773
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:07,870
I forget it might have been around

5775
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,089
2012 2014
uh when someone for the umpteenth time

5776
02:06:11,089 --> 02:06:11,099
uh when someone for the umpteenth time
 

5777
02:06:11,099 --> 02:06:15,709
uh when someone for the umpteenth time
actually said these async chat and async

5778
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:15,719
actually said these async chat and async
 

5779
02:06:15,719 --> 02:06:17,510
actually said these async chat and async
core modules that you have in the

5780
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,520
core modules that you have in the
 

5781
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:20,390
core modules that you have in the
standard Library are not quite enough to

5782
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
standard Library are not quite enough to
 

5783
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,669
standard Library are not quite enough to
solve my particular problem

5784
02:06:22,669 --> 02:06:22,679
solve my particular problem
 

5785
02:06:22,679 --> 02:06:26,030
solve my particular problem
can we add one tiny little feature and

5786
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:26,040
can we add one tiny little feature and
 

5787
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,970
can we add one tiny little feature and
everybody said no that stuff is not too

5788
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:28,980
everybody said no that stuff is not too
 

5789
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,890
everybody said no that stuff is not too
but you're not supposed to use that

5790
02:06:30,890 --> 02:06:30,900
but you're not supposed to use that
 

5791
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,050
but you're not supposed to use that
stuff write your own using uh

5792
02:06:33,050 --> 02:06:33,060
stuff write your own using uh
 

5793
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:34,790
stuff write your own using uh
third-party library and then everybody

5794
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:34,800
third-party library and then everybody
 

5795
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,950
third-party library and then everybody
started a debate about what the rights

5796
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:36,960
started a debate about what the rights
 

5797
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,870
started a debate about what the rights
third-party library was

5798
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:38,880
third-party library was
 

5799
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:43,669
third-party library was
and somehow I I felt that

5800
02:06:43,669 --> 02:06:43,679
and somehow I I felt that
 

5801
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:47,149
and somehow I I felt that
that was actually a cue for well maybe

5802
02:06:47,149 --> 02:06:47,159
that was actually a cue for well maybe
 

5803
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:51,050
that was actually a cue for well maybe
we need a better state of the art

5804
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:51,060
we need a better state of the art
 

5805
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:53,750
we need a better state of the art

sources you could say that it spiraled

5810
02:06:59,149 --> 02:06:59,159
sources you could say that it spiraled

02:06:59,159 --> 02:07:01,310
sources you could say that it spiraled
out of control a little bit it was at

02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:01,320
out of control a little bit it was at
 

5813
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,950
out of control a little bit it was at
the time it was the largest python

5814
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:03,960
the time it was the largest python

enhancement proposal that was ever

5816
02:07:05,629 --> 02:07:05,639

proposed
 

5819
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,810
proposed
and you were deeply involved with that

5820
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:08,820
and you were deeply involved with that
 

5821
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:11,450
and you were deeply involved with that
at the time I was very much involved

5822
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:11,460
at the time I was very much involved
 

5823
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:14,290
at the time I was very much involved
with that I was like the lead architect

5824
02:07:14,290 --> 02:07:14,300
with that I was like the lead architect
 

5825
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:17,030
with that I was like the lead architect
uh I ended up

5826
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
uh I ended up
 

5827
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,850
uh I ended up
talking to people who had already

5828
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:19,860
talking to people who had already
 

5829
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:23,030
talking to people who had already
developed Syria's third-party libraries

5830
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
developed Syria's third-party libraries
 

5831
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,310
developed Syria's third-party libraries
that did similar things and sort of

5832
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:25,320
that did similar things and sort of
 

5833
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:28,129
that did similar things and sort of
taking ideas from them and

5834
02:07:28,129 --> 02:07:28,139
taking ideas from them and
 

5835
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:31,310
taking ideas from them and
getting their feedback on my design and

5836
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:31,320
getting their feedback on my design and
 

5837
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,770
getting their feedback on my design and
eventually we put it in the standard

5838
02:07:33,770 --> 02:07:33,780
eventually we put it in the standard
 

5839
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:36,050
eventually we put it in the standard
library and after a few years I got

5840
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:36,060
library and after a few years I got
 

5841
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:37,850
library and after a few years I got
distracted I think the thing the big

5842
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:37,860
distracted I think the thing the big
 

5843
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,350
distracted I think the thing the big
thing that distracted me was actually

5844
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:39,360
thing that distracted me was actually
 

5845
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,229
thing that distracted me was actually
type annotations

5846
02:07:41,229 --> 02:07:41,239
type annotations
 

5847
02:07:41,239 --> 02:07:44,750
type annotations
but other people kept it alive and

5848
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
but other people kept it alive and
 

5849
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:47,089
but other people kept it alive and
kicking and it's been quite successful

5850
02:07:47,089 --> 02:07:47,099
kicking and it's been quite successful
 

5851
02:07:47,099 --> 02:07:48,830
kicking and it's been quite successful
actually yeah

5852
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:48,840
actually yeah
 

5853
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:51,649
actually yeah
in the world of python web clients so

5854
02:07:51,649 --> 02:07:51,659
in the world of python web clients so
 

5855
02:07:51,659 --> 02:07:53,930
in the world of python web clients so
initially what are some of the design

5856
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:53,940
initially what are some of the design
 

5857
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,910
initially what are some of the design
challenges there in that debate for the

5858
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:55,920
challenges there in that debate for the
 

5859
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,950
challenges there in that debate for the
pep and what are some things that got

5860
02:07:57,950 --> 02:07:57,960
pep and what are some things that got
 

5861
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,450
pep and what are some things that got
rejected what are some things that got

5862
02:07:59,450 --> 02:07:59,460

there are a couple of different ways you

5866
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:04,080
there are a couple of different ways you
 

5867
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:07,729
there are a couple of different ways you
can handle parallel i o and this happens

5868
02:08:07,729 --> 02:08:07,739
can handle parallel i o and this happens
 

5869
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:10,310
can handle parallel i o and this happens
sort of at an architectural level in

5870
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,320
sort of at an architectural level in
 

5871
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,649
sort of at an architectural level in
operating systems as well like Windows

5872
02:08:12,649 --> 02:08:12,659
operating systems as well like Windows
 

5873
02:08:12,659 --> 02:08:15,229

5877
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,129
prefers to do it the other way
you sort of

5878
02:08:19,129 --> 02:08:19,139
you sort of
 

5879
02:08:19,139 --> 02:08:21,649
you sort of
you have an object that represents a

5880
02:08:21,649 --> 02:08:21,659
you have an object that represents a
 

5881
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:25,070
you have an object that represents a
network endpoint say a connection with a

5882
02:08:25,070 --> 02:08:25,080
network endpoint say a connection with a
 

5883
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,410
network endpoint say a connection with a
web browser that your client

5884
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:27,420
web browser that your client
 

5885
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:30,470
web browser that your client
and say you're you're waiting for an

5886
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:30,480
and say you're you're waiting for an
 

5887
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,990
and say you're you're waiting for an
incoming request two fundamental

5888
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:33,000
incoming request two fundamental
 

5889
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,229
incoming request two fundamental
approaches are

5890
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239

 

5891
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:38,450

okay I'm waiting for an incoming request

5892
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:38,460
okay I'm waiting for an incoming request
 

5893
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,330
okay I'm waiting for an incoming request
I'm doing something else come wake me up

5894
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:41,340
I'm doing something else come wake me up
 

5895
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:43,310
I'm doing something else come wake me up
or of course sort of come tell me when

5896
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:43,320
or of course sort of come tell me when
 

5897
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:45,530
or of course sort of come tell me when
uh something interesting happened like a

5898
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:45,540
uh something interesting happened like a
 

5899
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:46,910
uh something interesting happened like a
packet came in on that network

5900
02:08:46,910 --> 02:08:46,920
packet came in on that network
 

5901
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,370
packet came in on that network
connection

5902
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:48,380
connection
 

5903
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:53,089
connection
and the other Paradigm is

5904
02:08:53,089 --> 02:08:53,099
and the other Paradigm is
 

5905
02:08:53,099 --> 02:08:55,669
and the other Paradigm is
we're on a team of a whole bunch of

5906
02:08:55,669 --> 02:08:55,679
we're on a team of a whole bunch of
 

5907
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,209
we're on a team of a whole bunch of
people with maybe a little mind and we

5908
02:08:59,209 --> 02:08:59,219
people with maybe a little mind and we
 

5909
02:08:59,219 --> 02:09:01,729
people with maybe a little mind and we
we can only manage one web connection at

5910
02:09:01,729 --> 02:09:01,739
we can only manage one web connection at
 

5911
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:04,010
we can only manage one web connection at
a time so

5912
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:04,020
a time so
 

5913
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:06,729
a time so
I'm just sitting

5914
02:09:06,729 --> 02:09:06,739
I'm just sitting
 

5915
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:10,250
I'm just sitting
looking at this this web connection and

5916
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:10,260
looking at this this web connection and
 

5917
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:13,550
looking at this this web connection and
I'm just blocked until something comes

5918
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:13,560
I'm just blocked until something comes
 

5919
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,910
I'm just blocked until something comes
in and then uh I'm already waiting for

5920
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:16,920
in and then uh I'm already waiting for
 

5921
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,530
in and then uh I'm already waiting for
it

5922
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:18,540
it
 

5923
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:21,470
it
uh I get I get the data I process the

5924
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:21,480
uh I get I get the data I process the
 

5925
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:23,510
uh I get I get the data I process the
data and then I go back to the top and

5926
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:23,520
data and then I go back to the top and
 

5927
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,330
data and then I go back to the top and
say no sort of I'm waiting for the next

5928
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:26,340
say no sort of I'm waiting for the next
 

5929
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:29,270
say no sort of I'm waiting for the next
packet those are about the two paradigms

5930
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,280
packet those are about the two paradigms
 

5931
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,649
packet those are about the two paradigms
one is

5932
02:09:30,649 --> 02:09:30,659
one is
 

5933
02:09:30,659 --> 02:09:33,410
one is
a paradigm where there is sort of

5934
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:33,420
a paradigm where there is sort of
 

5935
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:35,930
a paradigm where there is sort of
notionally a threat of control whether

5936
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:35,940
notionally a threat of control whether
 

5937
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:38,089
notionally a threat of control whether
it's an actual operating system thread

5938
02:09:38,089 --> 02:09:38,099
it's an actual operating system thread

02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:40,370
it's an actual operating system thread

02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040
and it has Logic for all the stages like
 

5949
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,729
and it has Logic for all the stages like
when it's a web request like

when it's a web request like
 

5951
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:58,189
when it's a web request like
first wait wait for the first line of

first wait wait for the first line of
 

5953
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:00,649
first wait wait for the first line of
the web request parse it because then

02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:00,659
the web request parse it because then
 

5955
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,470
the web request parse it because then
you know if it's a get or a post or a

5956
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:03,480
you know if it's a get or a post or a
 

5957
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:07,790
you know if it's a get or a post or a
put or whatever or an error uh then wait

5958
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:07,800
put or whatever or an error uh then wait
 

5959
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,770
put or whatever or an error uh then wait
until you have a bunch of lines until

5960
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:09,780
until you have a bunch of lines until
 

5961
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:12,050
until you have a bunch of lines until
there's a blank line then parse that as

5962
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:12,060
there's a blank line then parse that as
 

5963
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:15,169
there's a blank line then parse that as
headers and then interpret that and then

5964
02:10:15,169 --> 02:10:15,179
headers and then interpret that and then
 

5965
02:10:15,179 --> 02:10:18,470
headers and then interpret that and then
wait for the rest of the data to come in

5966
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:18,480
wait for the rest of the data to come in
 

5967
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,270
wait for the rest of the data to come in
if there is any more that you request

5968
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:20,280
if there is any more that you request

02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:23,890
if there is any more that you request
expect that sort of standard web stuff

02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:26,880
and the other thing is and there's
 

5973
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:28,669
and the other thing is and there's
always endless debate about which

5974
02:10:28,669 --> 02:10:28,679
always endless debate about which
 

5975
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:30,589
always endless debate about which
approach is more efficient and which

approach is more efficient and which
 

5977
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:32,990
approach is more efficient and which

where I just have a whole bunch of
 

5981
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:39,350
where I just have a whole bunch of
stacks in front of me and uh whenever

5982
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:39,360
stacks in front of me and uh whenever
 

5983
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:43,010
stacks in front of me and uh whenever
a packet comes in I sort of look at the

5984
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:43,020
a packet comes in I sort of look at the
 

5985
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:44,570
a packet comes in I sort of look at the
number of the pack that there's some

5986
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:44,580
number of the pack that there's some
 

5987
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:46,790
number of the pack that there's some
number on the packet and I say oh that

5988
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:46,800
number on the packet and I say oh that
 

5989
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,950
number on the packet and I say oh that
packet goes on this pile

5990
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:48,960
packet goes on this pile
 

5991
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,709
packet goes on this pile
and then I can do a little bit and then

5992
02:10:51,709 --> 02:10:51,719
and then I can do a little bit and then
 

5993
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:54,550
and then I can do a little bit and then
sort of that pile provides my context

5994
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:54,560
sort of that pile provides my context
 

5995
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,290
sort of that pile provides my context
and as soon as I'm done with with the

5996
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:57,300
and as soon as I'm done with with the
 

5997
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:59,089
and as soon as I'm done with with the
processing I sort of

5998
02:10:59,089 --> 02:10:59,099
processing I sort of
 

5999
02:10:59,099 --> 02:11:01,550

I can forget everything about what's

I can forget everything about what's

02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:03,530
I can forget everything about what's
going on because the next packet will

02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:03,540
going on because the next packet will
 

6003

02:11:29,089 --> 02:11:29,099
and that's that's the idea where you

have a bunch of different stacks of

have a bunch of different stacks of

have a bunch of different stacks of

someone gives you a piece gives you new

coding
 

6051
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:04,970
coding
uh it was very prevalent in JavaScript

6052
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:04,980
uh it was very prevalent in JavaScript
 

6053
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:07,370
uh it was very prevalent in JavaScript
at the time at least because it was like

6054
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:07,380
at the time at least because it was like
 

6055
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:10,850
at the time at least because it was like
how the JavaScript event Loop basically

6056
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:10,860
how the JavaScript event Loop basically
 

6057
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:14,510
how the JavaScript event Loop basically
works and so I thought well the

6058
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:14,520
works and so I thought well the
 

6059
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:18,050
works and so I thought well the
task-based model where each task has a

6060
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:18,060
task-based model where each task has a
 

6061
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:21,169
task-based model where each task has a
bunch of logic we had mechanisms in the

6062
02:12:21,169 --> 02:12:21,179
bunch of logic we had mechanisms in the
 

6063
02:12:21,179 --> 02:12:23,390
bunch of logic we had mechanisms in the
Python language that we could easily

6064
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:23,400
Python language that we could easily
 

6065
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:27,290
Python language that we could easily
reuse for for that and I thought I want

6066
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:27,300
reuse for for that and I thought I want
 

6067
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:29,570
reuse for for that and I thought I want
to build a whole library for

6068
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:29,580
to build a whole library for
 

6069
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:32,089
to build a whole library for

6070
02:12:32,089 --> 02:12:32,099
asynchronous networking i o
 

6071
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:34,490
asynchronous networking i o
uh and all the other things that may

6072
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:34,500
uh and all the other things that may
 

6073
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,430
uh and all the other things that may
need to be done asynchronously

6074
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,440
need to be done asynchronously
 

6075
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,850
need to be done asynchronously
uh based on that Paradigm and so I just

6076
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:40,860
uh based on that Paradigm and so I just
 

6077
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:44,330
uh based on that Paradigm and so I just
chose a paradigm and tried to see how

6078
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:44,340
chose a paradigm and tried to see how
 

6079
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:46,550
chose a paradigm and tried to see how
far I could get with that and it turns

6080
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:46,560
far I could get with that and it turns
 

6081
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:49,310
far I could get with that and it turns
out that it's pretty good paradigm so

6082
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:49,320
out that it's pretty good paradigm so
 

6083
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,169
out that it's pretty good paradigm so
people enjoy that kind of Paradigm

6084
02:12:51,169 --> 02:12:51,179
people enjoy that kind of Paradigm
 

6085
02:12:51,179 --> 02:12:55,010
people enjoy that kind of Paradigm

uh to Python and they were very literal
translation of the networking sockets

6214
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:47,040
translation of the networking sockets
 

6215
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,310
translation of the networking sockets
that were in the BSD operating system so

6216
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:49,320
that were in the BSD operating system so
 

6217
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,229
that were in the BSD operating system so
Unix BSD

6218
02:15:51,229 --> 02:15:51,239
Unix BSD
 

6219
02:15:51,239 --> 02:15:53,629
Unix BSD
but the nice thing was if you're using

6220
02:15:53,629 --> 02:15:53,639
but the nice thing was if you're using
 

6221
02:15:53,639 --> 02:15:56,689
but the nice thing was if you're using
sockets from python then all the things

6222
02:15:56,689 --> 02:15:56,699
sockets from python then all the things
 

6223
02:15:56,699 --> 02:15:59,450
sockets from python then all the things
you can do wrong with sockets in C would

6224
02:15:59,450 --> 02:15:59,460
you can do wrong with sockets in C would
 

6225
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,490
you can do wrong with sockets in C would
automatically give you a clear error

6226
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:01,500
automatically give you a clear error
 

6227
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,709
automatically give you a clear error
message instead of just ending up with a

6228
02:16:03,709 --> 02:16:03,719
message instead of just ending up with a
 

6229
02:16:03,719 --> 02:16:06,109
message instead of just ending up with a
malfunctioning hanging program

6230
02:16:06,109 --> 02:16:06,119
malfunctioning hanging program
 

6231
02:16:06,119 --> 02:16:08,330
malfunctioning hanging program
and so we thought well we'll do the same

6232
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:08,340
and so we thought well we'll do the same
 

6233
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:09,950
and so we thought well we'll do the same
thing with threading

6234
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:09,960
thing with threading
 

6235
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:14,270
thing with threading
but we didn't really want to rewrite The

6236
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:14,280
but we didn't really want to rewrite The
 

6237
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:15,589
but we didn't really want to rewrite The
Interpreter

6238
02:16:15,589 --> 02:16:15,599
Interpreter
 

6239
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,310
Interpreter
to be thread safe because that that was

6240
02:16:19,310 --> 02:16:19,320
to be thread safe because that that was
 

6241
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:21,050
to be thread safe because that that was
was like

6242
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:21,060
was like
 

6243
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,689
was like
that would be a very complex refactoring

6244
02:16:23,689 --> 02:16:23,699
that would be a very complex refactoring
 

6245
02:16:23,699 --> 02:16:26,149
that would be a very complex refactoring
of all The Interpreter code and all the

6246
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
of all The Interpreter code and all the
 

6247
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,790
of all The Interpreter code and all the
runtime code because all the objects

6248
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
runtime code because all the objects
 

6249
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,589
runtime code because all the objects
were written with the assumption that

6250
02:16:30,589 --> 02:16:30,599
were written with the assumption that
 

6251
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,349
were written with the assumption that
there is only one thread and so we said

6252
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
there is only one thread and so we said
 

6253
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:36,290
there is only one thread and so we said
okay well we'll take our losses we'll

6254
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:36,300
okay well we'll take our losses we'll
 

6255
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:38,509
okay well we'll take our losses we'll
provide something that looks like

6256
02:16:38,509 --> 02:16:38,519
provide something that looks like
 

6257
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:39,709
provide something that looks like
threads

6258
02:16:39,709 --> 02:16:39,719
threads
 

6259
02:16:39,719 --> 02:16:41,929
threads
and as long as you only have a single

6260
02:16:41,929 --> 02:16:41,939
and as long as you only have a single
 

6261
02:16:41,939 --> 02:16:43,969
and as long as you only have a single
CPU on your computer which most

6262
02:16:43,969 --> 02:16:43,979
CPU on your computer which most
 

6263
02:16:43,979 --> 02:16:45,969
CPU on your computer which most
computers at the time did

6264
02:16:45,969 --> 02:16:45,979
computers at the time did
 

6265
02:16:45,979 --> 02:16:50,629
computers at the time did
uh it feels just like threads because

6266
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:50,639
uh it feels just like threads because
 

6267
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:52,849
uh it feels just like threads because
the the whole idea of of multiple

6268
02:16:52,849 --> 02:16:52,859
the the whole idea of of multiple
 

6269
02:16:52,859 --> 02:16:55,370
the the whole idea of of multiple
threads in the OS was that even if your

6270
02:16:55,370 --> 02:16:55,380
threads in the OS was that even if your
 

6271
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:57,889
threads in the OS was that even if your
computer only had one CPU you could

6272
02:16:57,889 --> 02:16:57,899
computer only had one CPU you could
 

6273
02:16:57,899 --> 02:17:00,230
computer only had one CPU you could
still fire up at many threads as you

6274
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
still fire up at many threads as you
 

6275
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:03,169
still fire up at many threads as you
wanted well within reason maybe 10 or 12

6276
02:17:03,169 --> 02:17:03,179
wanted well within reason maybe 10 or 12
 

6277
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:05,690
wanted well within reason maybe 10 or 12
not 5000.

6278
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:05,700
not 5000.
 

6279
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:09,349
not 5000.
uh and so we thought we had conquered

6280
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:09,359
uh and so we thought we had conquered
 

6281
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:11,230
uh and so we thought we had conquered
the

6282
02:17:11,230 --> 02:17:11,240
the
 

6283
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:14,389
the
the abstraction of threads pretty well

6284
02:17:14,389 --> 02:17:14,399
the abstraction of threads pretty well
 

6285
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:18,950
the abstraction of threads pretty well
because multi core uh CPUs were were not

6286
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
because multi core uh CPUs were were not
 

6287
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:21,709
because multi core uh CPUs were were not
in in most python programmers hands

6288
02:17:21,709 --> 02:17:21,719
in in most python programmers hands
 

6289
02:17:21,719 --> 02:17:22,730
in in most python programmers hands
anyway

6290
02:17:22,730 --> 02:17:22,740
anyway
 

6291
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:25,429
anyway
and then of course a couple of more

6292
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:25,439
and then of course a couple of more
 

6293
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:28,549
and then of course a couple of more
iterations of Moore's Law and computers

6294
02:17:28,549 --> 02:17:28,559
iterations of Moore's Law and computers
 

6295
02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:31,509
iterations of Moore's Law and computers
getting faster and at some point

6296
02:17:31,509 --> 02:17:31,519
getting faster and at some point
 

6297
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:36,049
getting faster and at some point
uh the chip designers decided that they

6298
02:17:36,049 --> 02:17:36,059
uh the chip designers decided that they
 

6299
02:17:36,059 --> 02:17:38,750
uh the chip designers decided that they
couldn't make the CPUs faster but they

6300
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:38,760
couldn't make the CPUs faster but they
 

6301
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:40,490
couldn't make the CPUs faster but they
could still make them smaller and so

6302
02:17:40,490 --> 02:17:40,500
could still make them smaller and so
 

6303
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:43,209
could still make them smaller and so
they could put multiple CPUs on one chip

6304
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:43,219
they could put multiple CPUs on one chip
 

6305
02:17:43,219 --> 02:17:45,889
they could put multiple CPUs on one chip
and suddenly there was all this pressure

6306
02:17:45,889 --> 02:17:45,899
and suddenly there was all this pressure
 

6307
02:17:45,899 --> 02:17:47,570
and suddenly there was all this pressure
about

6308
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:47,580
about
 

6309
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,629
about
do things in parallel and that's where

6310
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:50,639
do things in parallel and that's where
 

6311
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:53,330
do things in parallel and that's where
the the solution we had in Python didn't

6312
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:53,340
the the solution we had in Python didn't
 

6313
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:55,190
the the solution we had in Python didn't
work

6314
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
work
 

6315
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,650
work
and that's that's sort of the moment

6316
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:57,660
and that's that's sort of the moment
 

6317
02:17:57,660 --> 02:17:59,750
and that's that's sort of the moment
that the Gill became

6318
02:17:59,750 --> 02:17:59,760
that the Gill became
 

6319
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,549
that the Gill became
became infamous

6320
02:18:01,549 --> 02:18:01,559
became infamous
 

6321
02:18:01,559 --> 02:18:03,230
became infamous
because the guilt the guilt was the

6322
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:03,240
because the guilt the guilt was the
 

6323
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:06,950
because the guilt the guilt was the
solution we used to sort of

6324
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:06,960
solution we used to sort of
 

6325
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:09,709
solution we used to sort of
take this single interpreter and share

6326
02:18:09,709 --> 02:18:09,719
take this single interpreter and share
 

6327
02:18:09,719 --> 02:18:11,990
take this single interpreter and share
it between all the different operating

6328
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,000
it between all the different operating
 

6329
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,230
it between all the different operating
system threats that you could create and

6330
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:15,240
system threats that you could create and
 

6331
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:17,450
system threats that you could create and
so as long as the the hardware

6332
02:18:17,450 --> 02:18:17,460
so as long as the the hardware
 

6333
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:20,389
so as long as the the hardware
physically only had one CPU that was all

6334
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:20,399
physically only had one CPU that was all
 

6335
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:21,410
physically only had one CPU that was all
fine

6336
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:21,420
fine
 

6337
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:24,830
fine
and then as Hardware vendors were

6338
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:24,840
and then as Hardware vendors were
 

6339
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,509
and then as Hardware vendors were
suddenly telling us all oh you got to

6340
02:18:26,509 --> 02:18:26,519
suddenly telling us all oh you got to
 

6341
02:18:26,519 --> 02:18:28,730
suddenly telling us all oh you got to
paralyze everything's got to be

6342
02:18:28,730 --> 02:18:28,740
paralyze everything's got to be
 

6343
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:29,929
paralyze everything's got to be
paralyzed

6344
02:18:29,929 --> 02:18:29,939
paralyzed
 

6345
02:18:29,939 --> 02:18:33,709
paralyzed
people started saying oh uh but we can

6346
02:18:33,709 --> 02:18:33,719
people started saying oh uh but we can
 

6347
02:18:33,719 --> 02:18:36,830
people started saying oh uh but we can
use multiple threads in Python and uh

6348
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:36,840
use multiple threads in Python and uh
 

6349
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,929
use multiple threads in Python and uh
then they discovered oh but actually all

6350
02:18:38,929 --> 02:18:38,939
then they discovered oh but actually all
 

6351
02:18:38,939 --> 02:18:42,049
then they discovered oh but actually all
threads run on a single single core yeah

6352
02:18:42,049 --> 02:18:42,059
threads run on a single single core yeah
 

6353
02:18:42,059 --> 02:18:45,230
threads run on a single single core yeah
I mean is there a way is there ideas for

6354
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:45,240
I mean is there a way is there ideas for
 

6355
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,330
I mean is there a way is there ideas for
in the future to remove

6356
02:18:47,330 --> 02:18:47,340
in the future to remove
 

6357
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,910
in the future to remove
the global interpreter log Gill like

6358
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
the global interpreter log Gill like
 

6359
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:52,669
the global interpreter log Gill like
maybe multiple sub interpreters some

6360
02:18:52,669 --> 02:18:52,679
maybe multiple sub interpreters some
 

6361
02:18:52,679 --> 02:18:54,669
maybe multiple sub interpreters some
tricky

6362
02:18:54,669 --> 02:18:54,679
tricky
 

6363
02:18:54,679 --> 02:18:57,230
tricky
interpreters on top of interpreters kind

6364
02:18:57,230 --> 02:18:57,240
interpreters on top of interpreters kind
 

6365
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,450
interpreters on top of interpreters kind
of thing yeah there there are a couple

6366
02:18:59,450 --> 02:18:59,460
of thing yeah there there are a couple
 

6367
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:03,830
of thing yeah there there are a couple
of possible uh Futures there the the

6368
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:03,840
of possible uh Futures there the the
 

6369
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:06,889
of possible uh Futures there the the
most likely future is that we'll get

6370
02:19:06,889 --> 02:19:06,899
most likely future is that we'll get
 

6371
02:19:06,899 --> 02:19:09,110
most likely future is that we'll get
multiple sub interpreters

6372
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:09,120
multiple sub interpreters
 

6373
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:12,469
multiple sub interpreters

Python program nice uh but they're

6376
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:15,840
Python program nice uh but they're
 

6377
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,070
Python program nice uh but they're
they're still some benefit of

6378
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,080
they're still some benefit of
 

6379
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:23,349
they're still some benefit of
of sort of faster communication between

6380
02:19:23,349 --> 02:19:23,359
of sort of faster communication between
 

6381
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:26,389
of sort of faster communication between
those programs but it's also managing

6382
02:19:26,389 --> 02:19:26,399
those programs but it's also managing
 

6383
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:29,389
those programs but it's also managing
for you this running a multiple python

6384
02:19:29,389 --> 02:19:29,399
for you this running a multiple python
 

6385
02:19:29,399 --> 02:19:32,330
for you this running a multiple python
programs yeah so it's hidden from you

6386
02:19:32,330 --> 02:19:32,340
programs yeah so it's hidden from you
 

6387
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:35,030
programs yeah so it's hidden from you
right the it's it's hidden from you but

6388
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,040
right the it's it's hidden from you but
 

6389
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,009
right the it's it's hidden from you but
you have to spend more time

6390
02:19:37,009 --> 02:19:37,019
you have to spend more time
 

6391
02:19:37,019 --> 02:19:39,230
you have to spend more time
communicating between those programs

6392
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:39,240
communicating between those programs
 

6393
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:40,910
communicating between those programs
because the sort of

6394
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:40,920
because the sort of
 

6395
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,830
because the sort of
the attractive

6396
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:42,840
the attractive
 

6397
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:45,950
the attractive
thing about the multi-threaded model is

6398
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:45,960
thing about the multi-threaded model is
 

6399
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:49,190
thing about the multi-threaded model is
that the threads can share objects at

6400
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:49,200
that the threads can share objects at
 

6401
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,349
that the threads can share objects at
the same time that's also the downfall

6402
02:19:51,349 --> 02:19:51,359
the same time that's also the downfall
 

6403
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:53,230
the same time that's also the downfall
of the multi-threaded programming model

6404
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:53,240
of the multi-threaded programming model
 

6405
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:57,290
of the multi-threaded programming model
because when you do share objects

6406
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:57,300
because when you do share objects
 

6407
02:19:57,300 --> 02:19:59,990
because when you do share objects
you were and you didn't necessarily

6408
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,000
you were and you didn't necessarily
 

6409
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,290
you were and you didn't necessarily
intend to share them or uh there were

6410
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:03,300
intend to share them or uh there were
 

6411
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:06,050
intend to share them or uh there were
aspects of those objects that

6412
02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:06,060
aspects of those objects that
 

6413
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:09,889
aspects of those objects that
that were not reusable you get all kinds

6414
02:20:09,889 --> 02:20:09,899
that were not reusable you get all kinds
 

6415
02:20:09,899 --> 02:20:13,550
that were not reusable you get all kinds
of concurrency bugs and so

6416
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:13,560
of concurrency bugs and so
 

6417
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:15,830
of concurrency bugs and so
the reason I wrote that little blog post

6418
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:15,840
the reason I wrote that little blog post
 

6419
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,770
the reason I wrote that little blog post
about semaphores was that concurrency

6420
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:18,780
about semaphores was that concurrency
 

6421
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:22,670
about semaphores was that concurrency
bugs are just harder it would be nice if

6422
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:22,680
bugs are just harder it would be nice if
 

6423
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:26,210
bugs are just harder it would be nice if
python had uh no Global interpreter lock

6424
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:26,220
python had uh no Global interpreter lock
 

6425
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:29,990
python had uh no Global interpreter lock
and it had the so-called free threading

6426
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:30,000
and it had the so-called free threading
 

6427
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,990
and it had the so-called free threading
but it would also cause a lot more

6428
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:33,000
but it would also cause a lot more
 

6429
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,150
but it would also cause a lot more
software bugs

6430
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:35,160
software bugs
 

6431
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:38,030
software bugs
uh the interesting thing is that there

6432
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:38,040
uh the interesting thing is that there
 

6433
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:41,090
uh the interesting thing is that there
is still a possible future where we are

6434
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:41,100
is still a possible future where we are
 

6435
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:43,309
is still a possible future where we are
actually going to or where we could

6436
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:43,319
actually going to or where we could
 

6437
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:46,130
actually going to or where we could
experiment at least with that

6438
02:20:46,130 --> 02:20:46,140
experiment at least with that
 

6439
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:50,150
experiment at least with that
because there is a guy working for

that he called the no-gill

6446
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
that he called the no-gill
 

6447
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,450
that he called the no-gill
interpreter where he removed the Gill

6448
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:01,460
interpreter where he removed the Gill
 

6449
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:04,670
interpreter where he removed the Gill
and made a whole bunch of optimizations

6450
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:04,680
and made a whole bunch of optimizations
 

6451
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:07,670
and made a whole bunch of optimizations
so that the the single threaded case

6452
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:07,680
so that the the single threaded case
 

6453
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,070
so that the the single threaded case
doesn't run too much slower

6454
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:10,080
doesn't run too much slower
 

6455
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:12,650
doesn't run too much slower
uh and multi-threaded case will actually

6456
02:21:12,650 --> 02:21:12,660
uh and multi-threaded case will actually
 

6457
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:17,450
uh and multi-threaded case will actually
uh use all the cores that you have

6458
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:17,460
uh use all the cores that you have
 

6459
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:21,110
uh use all the cores that you have
and so that that would be an interesting

6460
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,120
and so that that would be an interesting
 

6461
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,610
and so that that would be an interesting
possibility

6462
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:22,620
possibility

additional complexity of The Interpreter
 

6473
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,910
additional complexity of The Interpreter
and the additional sort of overhead for

02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
and the additional sort of overhead for
 

6475
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,309
and the additional sort of overhead for
the single threaded case and I'm

there are enough people

with their python programs

that it's worth to sort of

02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:07,370
that it's worth to sort of
take that performance hit and that

take that performance hit and that
 

6491
02:22:07,380 --> 02:22:09,050
take that performance hit and that
complexity hit

complexity hit
 

6493
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:12,230

and I I feel that the Gill actually is

6494
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
and I I feel that the Gill actually is
 

6495
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:13,750
and I I feel that the Gill actually is
pretty nice

yeah for python let me ask you perhaps a

02:22:38,570 --> 02:22:38,580
yeah for python let me ask you perhaps a

yeah for python let me ask you perhaps a
fun question but there's a philosophy

02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:45,120
dude to will there ever be a python 4.0
 

6519
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,410
dude to will there ever be a python 4.0
now before you say it's currently a joke

can you imagine possible features

can you imagine possible features
that python 4.0 might have that would

02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:09,410
that python 4.0 might have that would
necessitate the creation of the new 4.0

necessitate the creation of the new 4.0

02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,270
necessitate the creation of the new 4.0

02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,429
given the amount of
pain and joy

6534
02:23:13,429 --> 02:23:13,439
pain and joy
 

6535
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:16,190
pain and joy
suffering and Triumph that was involved

6536
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:16,200
suffering and Triumph that was involved
 

6537
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,590
suffering and Triumph that was involved
in the move between version 2 and

6538
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:18,600
in the move between version 2 and
 

6539
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:21,170
in the move between version 2 and
version three

6540
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:21,180

 

6541
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:25,010

yeah well we're we

6542
02:23:25,010 --> 02:23:25,020
yeah well we're we
 

6543
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:27,950
yeah well we're we
as a community and as a core development

6544
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:27,960
as a community and as a core development
 

6545
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:32,929
as a community and as a core development
team we have a large amount of painful

6546
02:23:32,929 --> 02:23:32,939
team we have a large amount of painful
 

6547
02:23:32,939 --> 02:23:38,030
team we have a large amount of painful
memories about the Python 3 transition

6548
02:23:38,030 --> 02:23:38,040
memories about the Python 3 transition
 

6549
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:41,750
memories about the Python 3 transition
uh which is one reason that sort of

6550
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:41,760
uh which is one reason that sort of
 

6551
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,630
uh which is one reason that sort of
everybody is happy that we've decided

6552
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:44,640
everybody is happy that we've decided
 

6553
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:48,410
everybody is happy that we've decided
there's not going to be a 4.0 at least

6554
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:48,420
there's not going to be a 4.0 at least
 

6555
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:51,349
there's not going to be a 4.0 at least
not anytime soon and if there is going

6556
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
not anytime soon and if there is going
 

6557
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:54,530
not anytime soon and if there is going
to be one it would will sort of plan the

6558
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:54,540
to be one it would will sort of plan the
 

6559
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:57,170
to be one it would will sort of plan the
transition very differently because

6560
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,180
transition very differently because
 

6561
02:23:57,180 --> 02:24:00,410
transition very differently because
clearly we underestimated the pain the

6562
02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:00,420
clearly we underestimated the pain the
 

6563
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,490
clearly we underestimated the pain the
transition

6564
02:24:01,490 --> 02:24:01,500
transition
 

6565
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:05,570

6567
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:07,730

and
 

6569
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:10,910
and
had we known we could have sort of

02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:10,920
had we known we could have sort of
 

6571
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:14,030
had we known we could have sort of
designed Python 3 somewhat differently

6572
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:14,040
designed Python 3 somewhat differently
 

6573
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,450
designed Python 3 somewhat differently
without making it any worse

6574
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:17,460
without making it any worse
 

6575
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:20,150
without making it any worse
we just thought that we had a good plan

6576
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:20,160
we just thought that we had a good plan
 

6577
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:23,570
we just thought that we had a good plan
but we we we underestimated where

6578
02:24:23,570 --> 02:24:23,580
but we we we underestimated where
 

6579
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:26,270
but we we we underestimated where
what what sort of the users were capable

6580
02:24:26,270 --> 02:24:26,280
what what sort of the users were capable
 

6581
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,190
what what sort of the users were capable
of when it comes to that kind of

6582
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:28,200
of when it comes to that kind of
 

6583
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:31,190
of when it comes to that kind of
transition by the way I think we talked

6584
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,200
transition by the way I think we talked
 

6585
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,670
transition by the way I think we talked
way before like a year and a half before

6586
02:24:34,670 --> 02:24:34,680
way before like a year and a half before

what was that what was your memory of

6592
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:42,840
what was that what was your memory of
 

6593
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:44,929
what was that what was your memory of
the end of life did you shed a tear on

6594
02:24:44,929 --> 02:24:44,939
the end of life did you shed a tear on
 

6595
02:24:44,939 --> 02:24:47,830
the end of life did you shed a tear on
January 1st 2020 did was there

6596
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:47,840
January 1st 2020 did was there
 

6597
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:50,330
January 1st 2020 did was there
everyone's standing alone our team had

6598
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:50,340
everyone's standing alone our team had
 

6599
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:53,750
everyone's standing alone our team had
basically moved on years before

6600
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:53,760
basically moved on years before
 

6601
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,690
basically moved on years before
yeah it was it was purely it was a

6602
02:24:56,690 --> 02:24:56,700
yeah it was it was purely it was a
 

6603
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:58,990
yeah it was it was purely it was a
little symbolic moment

6604
02:24:58,990 --> 02:24:59,000
little symbolic moment
 

6605
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:03,110
little symbolic moment

6606
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:03,120
uh to signal to the the remaining users
 

6607
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:05,750
uh to signal to the the remaining users
that

6608
02:25:05,750 --> 02:25:05,760
that
 

6609
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,410
that
there was no longer going to be any new

6610
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:09,420
there was no longer going to be any new
 

6611
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:14,330
there was no longer going to be any new

did you shed a single tier while looking

6614
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
did you shed a single tier while looking
 

6615
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,429
did you shed a single tier while looking
out over the horizon

6616
02:25:18,429 --> 02:25:18,439
out over the horizon
 

6617
02:25:18,439 --> 02:25:22,190
out over the horizon
I'm not not a very poetic person and I

6618
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:22,200
I'm not not a very poetic person and I
 

6619
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:26,450
I'm not not a very poetic person and I
don't shed tears like that but no

6620
02:25:26,450 --> 02:25:26,460

 

6621
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:29,630

yeah we we actually had planned a party

6622
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:29,640
yeah we we actually had planned a party
 

6623
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:32,450
yeah we we actually had planned a party
but the party was planned for uh the

6624
02:25:32,450 --> 02:25:32,460
but the party was planned for uh the
 

6625
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:34,849
but the party was planned for uh the
python the U.S python conference that

6626
02:25:34,849 --> 02:25:34,859
python the U.S python conference that
 

6627
02:25:34,859 --> 02:25:36,590
python the U.S python conference that
year which would never happened of

6628
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:36,600
year which would never happened of
 

6629
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,750
year which would never happened of
course because of the pandemic oh is it

6630
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:38,760
course because of the pandemic oh is it
 

6631
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:42,110
course because of the pandemic oh is it
like in March yeah the conference was uh

6632
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:42,120
like in March yeah the conference was uh
 

6633
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,510
like in March yeah the conference was uh
going to be I think late April that year

6634
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:44,520
going to be I think late April that year
 

6635
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,950
going to be I think late April that year
oh

6636
02:25:45,950 --> 02:25:45,960
oh
 

6637
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:47,809
oh
so that that was a very difficult

6638
02:25:47,809 --> 02:25:47,819
so that that was a very difficult
 

6639
02:25:47,819 --> 02:25:51,050
so that that was a very difficult
decision to cancel it but

6640
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:51,060
decision to cancel it but
 

6641
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:53,330
decision to cancel it but
they did so anyway if we're going to

6642
02:25:53,330 --> 02:25:53,340
they did so anyway if we're going to
 

6643
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:55,969
they did so anyway if we're going to
have a python 4 we're going to have to

6644
02:25:55,969 --> 02:25:55,979
have a python 4 we're going to have to
 

6645
02:25:55,979 --> 02:25:59,210
have a python 4 we're going to have to
have both a different reason for for

6646
02:25:59,210 --> 02:25:59,220
have both a different reason for for
 

6647
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:00,710
have both a different reason for for
having that

6648
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:00,720
having that
 

6649
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:03,710
having that
and a different process for managing the

6650
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:03,720
and a different process for managing the
 

6651
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:05,450
and a different process for managing the
transition can you imagine a possible

6652
02:26:05,450 --> 02:26:05,460
transition can you imagine a possible
 

6653
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:09,410
transition can you imagine a possible
process that so so I think you're

6654
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:09,420
process that so so I think you're
 

6655
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:11,809
process that so so I think you're
implying that if there is a 4.0 in some

6656
02:26:11,809 --> 02:26:11,819
implying that if there is a 4.0 in some
 

6657
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:14,530
implying that if there is a 4.0 in some
ways it would break back compatibility

6658
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:14,540
ways it would break back compatibility
 

6659
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:17,270
ways it would break back compatibility
well so

6660
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:17,280
well so
 

6661
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:20,090
well so
here is here is a concrete thought I've

6662
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:20,100
here is here is a concrete thought I've
 

6663
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,550
here is here is a concrete thought I've
had and I'm not unique but not everyone

6664
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
had and I'm not unique but not everyone
 

6665
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,429
had and I'm not unique but not everyone
agrees with this so this is definitely a

6666
02:26:25,429 --> 02:26:25,439
agrees with this so this is definitely a
 

6667
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:27,290
agrees with this so this is definitely a
personal opinion

6668
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:27,300
personal opinion
 

6669
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:31,610
personal opinion
if we were to try something like that no

6670
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:31,620
if we were to try something like that no
 

6671
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:33,290
if we were to try something like that no
Guild python

6672
02:26:33,290 --> 02:26:33,300
Guild python
 

6673
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:35,510
Guild python
uh

6674
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
uh
 

6675
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,770
uh
my expectation is that

6676
02:26:39,770 --> 02:26:39,780
my expectation is that
 

6677
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:41,770
my expectation is that
it would feel

6678
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:41,780
it would feel
 

6679
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:45,410
it would feel
just different enough

6680
02:26:45,410 --> 02:26:45,420
just different enough
 

6681
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:48,469
just different enough
at least for the the part of the Python

6682
02:26:48,469 --> 02:26:48,479
at least for the the part of the Python
 

6683
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:50,630
at least for the the part of the Python
ecosystem that

6684
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:50,640

6688
02:26:57,349 --> 02:26:57,359

02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:00,969

python
 

6695
02:27:06,359 --> 02:27:08,389
python
and so

6696
02:27:08,389 --> 02:27:08,399
and so
 

6697
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:12,830

those people would likely feel the pain

6698
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:12,840
those people would likely feel the pain
 

6699
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:14,630
those people would likely feel the pain
the most

6700
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:14,640
the most
 

6701
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:18,950
the most
because they even if we don't change

6702
02:27:18,950 --> 02:27:18,960
because they even if we don't change
 

6703
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:21,349
because they even if we don't change
anything about the syntax of the

6704
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
anything about the syntax of the
 

6705
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:23,090
anything about the syntax of the
language and the semantics of the

6706
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:23,100
language and the semantics of the
 

6707
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,889
language and the semantics of the

6708
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:24,899
language when you're writing python code
 

6709
02:27:24,899 --> 02:27:27,770
language when you're writing python code
we we could even say suppose that after

6710
02:27:27,770 --> 02:27:27,780
we we could even say suppose that after
 

6711
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:31,849
we we could even say suppose that after
python say 3 19 instead of 320 we'll

6712
02:27:31,849 --> 02:27:31,859
python say 3 19 instead of 320 we'll
 

6713
02:27:31,859 --> 02:27:36,410
python say 3 19 instead of 320 we'll
have 4.0 suppose that's the time when we

6714
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:36,420
have 4.0 suppose that's the time when we
 

6715
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:39,710
have 4.0 suppose that's the time when we
flip the switch to 4.0 will will not

6716
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:39,720
flip the switch to 4.0 will will not

imagine it was like that

02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:43,500
imagine it was like that
 

6721
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:45,050
imagine it was like that
so

6722
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:45,060
so
 

6723
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:47,990
so
I would probably say

6724
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:48,000
I would probably say

02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,349
I would probably say

everything will be at the python level

4.0 would be a breeze except that there
 

6765
02:28:47,939 --> 02:28:50,030

and I'm not saying they're old they're

6780
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:08,220
and I'm not saying they're old they're
 

6781
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:11,389
and I'm not saying they're old they're
all good but there is a large list of

02:29:11,389 --> 02:29:11,399
all good but there is a large list of

all good but there is a large list of
extensions that would have to do work

6784
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:13,380
extensions that would have to do work
 

6785
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,889
extensions that would have to do work
and some of those extensions are

6786
02:29:15,889 --> 02:29:15,899
and some of those extensions are
 

6787
02:29:15,899 --> 02:29:20,510
and some of those extensions are
currently already low on maintainers and

6788
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:20,520
currently already low on maintainers and
 

6789
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:24,110
currently already low on maintainers and
they're struggling to keep afloat so

6790
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:24,120
they're struggling to keep afloat so
 

6791
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:26,389
they're struggling to keep afloat so
there you can give a huge heads up to

6792
02:29:26,389 --> 02:29:26,399
there you can give a huge heads up to
 

6793
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:29,330
there you can give a huge heads up to
them if you go to 4.0 to really keep

6794
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:29,340
them if you go to 4.0 to really keep
 

6795
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:31,730
them if you go to 4.0 to really keep
developing it yeah we'd probably have to

6796
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:31,740
developing it yeah we'd probably have to
 

6797
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:34,969
developing it yeah we'd probably have to
do something like

6798
02:29:34,969 --> 02:29:34,979

 

6799
02:29:34,979 --> 02:29:37,190

02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:37,200
several years before who knows maybe
 

6801
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:40,849
several years before who knows maybe
five years earlier like 3.15 we would

02:29:40,849 --> 02:29:40,859
five years earlier like 3.15 we would
 

6803
02:29:40,859 --> 02:29:44,090
five years earlier like 3.15 we would
have to say and and I'm just making the

6804
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:44,100
have to say and and I'm just making the
 

6805
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:46,309
have to say and and I'm just making the
the specific numbers up but we at some

6806
02:29:46,309 --> 02:29:46,319
the specific numbers up but we at some
 

6807
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:50,110
the specific numbers up but we at some
point we'd have to say foreign

6808
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:50,120
point we'd have to say foreign
 

6809
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:52,969
point we'd have to say foreign
python could be an option

6810
02:29:52,969 --> 02:29:52,979
python could be an option
 

6811
02:29:52,979 --> 02:29:55,849
python could be an option
it might be a compile time option

6812
02:29:55,849 --> 02:29:55,859
it might be a compile time option
 

6813
02:29:55,859 --> 02:29:57,110
it might be a compile time option
uh

6814
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
uh
 

6815
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:01,190
uh
if you want to use no Guild python you

6816
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:01,200
if you want to use no Guild python you
 

6817
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,530
if you want to use no Guild python you
have to recompile python from source for

6818
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:03,540
have to recompile python from source for
 

6819
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:06,230
have to recompile python from source for
your platform using your tool set

6820
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:06,240
your platform using your tool set
 

6821
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,450
your platform using your tool set
all you have to do is change one

6822
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:08,460
all you have to do is change one
 

6823
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:10,550
all you have to do is change one
configuration variable and then you just

6824
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:10,560
configuration variable and then you just
 

6825
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:11,929
configuration variable and then you just
run make

6826
02:30:11,929 --> 02:30:11,939
run make
 

6827
02:30:11,939 --> 02:30:14,210
run make
or configure and make and it will build

6828
02:30:14,210 --> 02:30:14,220
or configure and make and it will build
 

6829
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:15,469
or configure and make and it will build
it for you

6830
02:30:15,469 --> 02:30:15,479
it for you
 

6831
02:30:15,479 --> 02:30:19,610
it for you
but now you also have to use the the

6832
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:19,620
but now you also have to use the the
 

6833
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:22,190
but now you also have to use the the
no-gill compatible versions of all

6834
02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:22,200
no-gill compatible versions of all
 

6835
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,710
no-gill compatible versions of all
extension modules you want to use

6836
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
extension modules you want to use
 

6837
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,950
extension modules you want to use
and so as long as many extension modules

6838
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:27,960
and so as long as many extension modules
 

6839
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:31,070
and so as long as many extension modules
don't have fully functional

6840
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:31,080
don't have fully functional
 

6841
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:34,190
don't have fully functional
sort of variants that work within the

6842
02:30:34,190 --> 02:30:34,200
sort of variants that work within the
 

6843
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:35,750
sort of variants that work within the
no-gill world

6844
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:35,760
no-gill world
 

6845
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:38,570
no-gill world
that's not a very practical thing for

6846
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:38,580
that's not a very practical thing for
 

6847
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:41,110
that's not a very practical thing for
python users but it would allow

6848
02:30:41,110 --> 02:30:41,120
python users but it would allow
 

6849
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:43,910
python users but it would allow
extension Developers

6850
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:43,920
extension Developers
 

6851
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,870
extension Developers

02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:50,870
to test the waters see what they need to
syntactically to be able to compile at

6854
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:50,880
syntactically to be able to compile at
 

6855
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,469
syntactically to be able to compile at
all maybe they're using

6856
02:30:53,469 --> 02:30:53,479
all maybe they're using
 

6857
02:30:53,479 --> 02:30:56,389
all maybe they're using
functions that are defined by the Python

6858
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:56,399
functions that are defined by the Python
 

6859
02:30:56,399 --> 02:30:58,610
functions that are defined by the Python
3 runtime that won't be in the python 4

6860
02:30:58,610 --> 02:30:58,620
3 runtime that won't be in the python 4
 

6861
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,590
3 runtime that won't be in the python 4
runtime those functions will not work

6862
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:00,600
runtime those functions will not work
 

6863
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:03,830
runtime those functions will not work
they'll have to find an alternative

6864
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
they'll have to find an alternative
 

6865
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,950
they'll have to find an alternative
uh but they can experiment with that and

6866
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
uh but they can experiment with that and
 

6867
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:09,650
uh but they can experiment with that and
sort of write test applications and that

6868
02:31:09,650 --> 02:31:09,660
sort of write test applications and that
 

6869
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:11,750
sort of write test applications and that
would be a way to transition and that

6870
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:11,760
would be a way to transition and that
 

6871
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:16,610
would be a way to transition and that
that could be a series of releases where

6872
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:16,620
that could be a series of releases where
 

6873
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:19,929
that could be a series of releases where
the python 4 is more and more imminent

6874
02:31:19,929 --> 02:31:19,939
the python 4 is more and more imminent
 

6875
02:31:19,939 --> 02:31:23,870
the python 4 is more and more imminent
uh we have supported more and more

6876
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:23,880
uh we have supported more and more
 

6877
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:27,349
uh we have supported more and more
third-party extension modules to have

6878
02:31:27,349 --> 02:31:27,359
third-party extension modules to have
 

6879
02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:30,349
third-party extension modules to have
solid support that works for no Guild

6880
02:31:30,349 --> 02:31:30,359
solid support that works for no Guild
 

6881
02:31:30,359 --> 02:31:33,250
solid support that works for no Guild
python for that new API

6882
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:33,260
python for that new API
 

6883
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:38,809
python for that new API
uh and then sort of python python 4.0 is

6884
02:31:38,809 --> 02:31:38,819
uh and then sort of python python 4.0 is
 

6885
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:41,690
uh and then sort of python python 4.0 is
like the official moment that the mayor

6886
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:41,700
like the official moment that the mayor
 

6887
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:44,330
like the official moment that the mayor
comes out and cuts the ribbon and is now

6888
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:44,340
comes out and cuts the ribbon and is now
 

6889
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:47,690
comes out and cuts the ribbon and is now
a python uh now the sort of no-gill mode

6890
02:31:47,690 --> 02:31:47,700
a python uh now the sort of no-gill mode
 

6891
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:49,910
a python uh now the sort of no-gill mode
is the default and maybe the only mode

6892
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
is the default and maybe the only mode
 

6893
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,590
is the default and maybe the only mode
there is

6894
02:31:51,590 --> 02:31:51,600
there is
 

6895
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,849
there is
the internet wants to know from Reddit

6896
02:31:54,849 --> 02:31:54,859
the internet wants to know from Reddit
 

6897
02:31:54,859 --> 02:31:58,730
the internet wants to know from Reddit
uh it it's uh it's a small and fun

6898
02:31:58,730 --> 02:31:58,740
uh it it's uh it's a small and fun
 

6899
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:00,490
uh it it's uh it's a small and fun
question there's many fun questions but

6900
02:32:00,490 --> 02:32:00,500
question there's many fun questions but
 

6901
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:05,090
question there's many fun questions but
uh out of the Pi Pi packages Pi Pi

6902
02:32:05,090 --> 02:32:05,100
uh out of the Pi Pi packages Pi Pi
 

6903
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:08,210
uh out of the Pi Pi packages Pi Pi
packages uh do you have uh do you have

6905
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,190

ones you like do you in your opinion
 

6907
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:13,370

other must have Pi Pi libraries or ones

02:32:13,370 --> 02:32:13,380
other must have Pi Pi libraries or ones
 

6909
02:32:13,380 --> 02:32:16,010

you use all the time constantly oh my

that
 

6913
02:32:17,939 --> 02:32:19,790
that
I should really have a standard answer

6914
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:19,800
I should really have a standard answer
 

6915
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:22,790
I should really have a standard answer
for that question but like a positive

6916
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:22,800
for that question but like a positive
 

6917
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:24,830
for that question but like a positive
standard answer but my current standard

6918
02:32:24,830 --> 02:32:24,840
standard answer but my current standard
 

6919
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:28,010
standard answer but my current standard
answer is that I'm not a big user of

6920
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:28,020
answer is that I'm not a big user of
 

6921
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:29,870
answer is that I'm not a big user of
third-party packages

6922
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:29,880
third-party packages
 

6923
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:33,010
third-party packages
when I write python code I'm usually

6924
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:33,020
when I write python code I'm usually
 

6925
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:35,750
when I write python code I'm usually
developing some tooling around building

6926
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:35,760
developing some tooling around building
 

6927
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,530
developing some tooling around building
python itself

6928
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:38,540
python itself
 

6929
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:41,330
python itself
and the last thing we want is

6930
02:32:41,330 --> 02:32:41,340
and the last thing we want is
 

6931
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,910
and the last thing we want is
dependencies on third-party packages so

6932
02:32:43,910 --> 02:32:43,920
dependencies on third-party packages so
 

6933
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:46,130
dependencies on third-party packages so
I I tend to just use the standard

6934
02:32:46,130 --> 02:32:46,140
I I tend to just use the standard
 

6935
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:48,110
I I tend to just use the standard
library and that's where your focus is

6936
02:32:48,110 --> 02:32:48,120
library and that's where your focus is
 

6937
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:50,150
library and that's where your focus is
that's where your mind is

6938
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:50,160
that's where your mind is
 

6939
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,910
that's where your mind is
but do you do you keep an eye of what's

6940
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:52,920
but do you do you keep an eye of what's
 

6941
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:55,070
but do you do you keep an eye of what's
out there to understand where the

6942
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:55,080
out there to understand where the
 

6943
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:57,469
out there to understand where the
standard Library could be moving should

6944
02:32:57,469 --> 02:32:57,479
standard Library could be moving should
 

6945
02:32:57,479 --> 02:32:59,809
standard Library could be moving should
be moving it's a good kind of landscape

6946
02:32:59,809 --> 02:32:59,819
be moving it's a good kind of landscape
 

6947
02:32:59,819 --> 02:33:02,510
be moving it's a good kind of landscape
of what's missing from the same Library

6948
02:33:02,510 --> 02:33:02,520
of what's missing from the same Library
 

6949
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:04,910
of what's missing from the same Library
well usually when something's missing

6950
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:04,920
well usually when something's missing
 

6951
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:09,849
well usually when something's missing
from the standard Library nowadays uh

6952
02:33:09,849 --> 02:33:09,859
from the standard Library nowadays uh
 

6953
02:33:09,859 --> 02:33:15,230
from the standard Library nowadays uh
it is a relatively new idea and there is

6954
02:33:15,230 --> 02:33:15,240
it is a relatively new idea and there is
 

6955
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:18,950
it is a relatively new idea and there is
a third party implementation or maybe

6956
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:18,960
a third party implementation or maybe
 

6957
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:21,170
a third party implementation or maybe
possibly multiple third-party

6958
02:33:21,170 --> 02:33:21,180
possibly multiple third-party
 

6959
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:24,710
possibly multiple third-party
implementations but they evolve at a

6960
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:24,720
implementations but they evolve at a
 

6961
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,929
implementations but they evolve at a
much higher rate than they could when

6962
02:33:26,929 --> 02:33:26,939
much higher rate than they could when
 

6963
02:33:26,939 --> 02:33:28,730
much higher rate than they could when
they're in the standard Library so they

6964
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:28,740
they're in the standard Library so they
 

6965
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:33,530
they're in the standard Library so they
it would be a big reduction in in

6966
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:33,540
it would be a big reduction in in
 

6967
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:35,410
it would be a big reduction in in
activity to

6968
02:33:35,410 --> 02:33:35,420
activity to
 

6969
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,670
activity to
incorporate things like that in the

6970
02:33:37,670 --> 02:33:37,680
incorporate things like that in the
 

6971
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,070
incorporate things like that in the
standard Library so I I like that there

6972
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:40,080
standard Library so I I like that there
 

6973
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:42,590
standard Library so I I like that there
is a lively package ecosystem and that

6974
02:33:42,590 --> 02:33:42,600
is a lively package ecosystem and that
 

6975
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:45,230
is a lively package ecosystem and that
sort of recent Trends in the standard

6976
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:45,240
sort of recent Trends in the standard
 

6977
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:47,270
sort of recent Trends in the standard
Library are actually that we're doing

6978
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:47,280
Library are actually that we're doing
 

6979
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,250
Library are actually that we're doing
the occasional spring cleaning where

6980
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:49,260
the occasional spring cleaning where
 

6981
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:51,650
the occasional spring cleaning where
we're just

6982
02:33:51,650 --> 02:33:51,660
we're just
 

6983
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:54,490
we're just
we're we're

6984
02:33:54,490 --> 02:33:54,500
we're we're
 

6985
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,830
we're we're
choosing some

6986
02:33:56,830 --> 02:33:56,840
choosing some
 

6987
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:59,929
choosing some
modules that have not had a lot of

6988
02:33:59,929 --> 02:33:59,939
modules that have not had a lot of
 

6989
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:05,050
modules that have not had a lot of
change in a long time and that maybe

6990
02:34:05,050 --> 02:34:05,060
change in a long time and that maybe
 

6991
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:08,210
change in a long time and that maybe
would be better off not existing at all

6992
02:34:08,210 --> 02:34:08,220
would be better off not existing at all
 

6993
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:10,190
would be better off not existing at all
at this point because there might be a

6994
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,200
at this point because there might be a
 

6995
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,809
at this point because there might be a
better third party

6996
02:34:11,809 --> 02:34:11,819
better third party
 

6997
02:34:11,819 --> 02:34:14,750
better third party
alternative anyway and we're sort of

6998
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:14,760
alternative anyway and we're sort of
 

6999
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:18,050
alternative anyway and we're sort of
slowly removing those that often those

7000
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:18,060
slowly removing those that often those
 

7001
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:20,270
slowly removing those that often those
are things that I sort of

7002
02:34:20,270 --> 02:34:20,280
are things that I sort of
 

7003
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:24,670
are things that I sort of
I spiked somewhere in 1992 or 1993 and

7004
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:24,680
I spiked somewhere in 1992 or 1993 and
 

7005
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:27,530
I spiked somewhere in 1992 or 1993 and
if you look look through the commit

7006
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:27,540
if you look look through the commit
 

7007
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:30,250
if you look look through the commit
history it's very sad like

7008
02:34:30,250 --> 02:34:30,260
history it's very sad like
 

7009
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:33,530
history it's very sad like
all cosmetic changes like changes in the

lives does it make sense to you why
 

7027
02:34:55,740 --> 02:34:58,490
lives does it make sense to you why
python has become the primary the

a time in the early 2000s that it really
 

7077
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:58,309
a time in the early 2000s that it really
looked like Pearl was going to dominate

like biosciences

7080
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:00,660
like biosciences
 

7081
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:02,809
like biosciences
because DNA search was all based on

why python
 

7099
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:25,670
why python
became the lingua Franca of the

02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:14,630
libraries that in in his days were
written in Fortran that that solved

the scientists that use the libraries
 

7139
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:30,290
the scientists that use the libraries
use them to solve continuously different

scientists
 

7147
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:38,690
scientists
were

7148
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:38,700
were
 

7149
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:42,170
were
were required to to use say Fortran

7150
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:42,180
were required to to use say Fortran
 

7151
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,150
were required to to use say Fortran
because Fortran was the library the

7152
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160
because Fortran was the library the
 

7153
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:46,570
because Fortran was the library the
language that the library was written in

7154
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:46,580
language that the library was written in
 

7155
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:49,250
language that the library was written in
and then the scientist would have to

7156
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:49,260
and then the scientist would have to
 

7157
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:52,490
and then the scientist would have to
write an application that sort of uses

7158
02:37:52,490 --> 02:37:52,500
write an application that sort of uses
 

7159
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:55,010
write an application that sort of uses
the library to solve a particular

02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:00,000
of answer a set of questions and the
 

7165
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,809
of answer a set of questions and the
safe same for C plus plus

safe same for C plus plus
 

7167
02:38:02,819 --> 02:38:05,050

because of and there's there's
 

7169
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:08,210
because of and there's there's
interoperability so the dusty decks are

7170
02:38:08,210 --> 02:38:08,220
interoperability so the dusty decks are
 

7171
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:11,450
interoperability so the dusty decks are

02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:11,460
written either in C plus plus or Fortran
 

7173
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:13,010
written either in C plus plus or Fortran
uh

7174
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:13,020
uh
 

7175
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:15,410
uh
and so Paul DuBois was one of the people

7176
02:38:15,410 --> 02:38:15,420
and so Paul DuBois was one of the people
 

7177
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:16,670
and so Paul DuBois was one of the people
who

7178
02:38:16,670 --> 02:38:16,680
who
 

7179
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:19,190
who
I think in the mid 90s

7180
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:19,200
I think in the mid 90s
 

7181
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:23,150
I think in the mid 90s
saw that that you needed a higher level

7182
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:23,160
saw that that you needed a higher level
 

7183
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:24,590
saw that that you needed a higher level
language

7184
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:24,600
language
 

7185
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:27,290
language
for the scientists

7186
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:27,300
for the scientists
 

7187
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:30,530
for the scientists
to to sort of tie together the

7188
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:30,540
to to sort of tie together the
 

7189
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:33,170
to to sort of tie together the
fundamental mathematical algorithms of

7190
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:33,180
fundamental mathematical algorithms of
 

7191
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:37,010
fundamental mathematical algorithms of
linear algebra and and other stuff

7192
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:37,020
linear algebra and and other stuff
 

7193
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:39,190
linear algebra and and other stuff
and so

7194
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,200
and so
 

7195
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:42,469
and so
gradually some libraries started

7196
02:38:42,469 --> 02:38:42,479
gradually some libraries started
 

7197
02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:45,349
gradually some libraries started
appearing that did very fundamental

7198
02:38:45,349 --> 02:38:45,359
appearing that did very fundamental
 

7199
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:49,610
appearing that did very fundamental
stuff with arrays of numbers in Python I

7200
02:38:49,610 --> 02:38:49,620
stuff with arrays of numbers in Python I
 

7201
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:52,550
stuff with arrays of numbers in Python I
mean when I first created python I was

7202
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:52,560
mean when I first created python I was
 

7203
02:38:52,560 --> 02:38:55,070
mean when I first created python I was
not expecting it to be used for arrays

7204
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,080
not expecting it to be used for arrays
 

7205
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:56,990
not expecting it to be used for arrays
of numbers much I thought that was like

7206
02:38:56,990 --> 02:38:57,000
of numbers much I thought that was like
 

7207
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,150
of numbers much I thought that was like
an outdated data type

7208
02:38:59,150 --> 02:38:59,160
an outdated data type
 

7209
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:02,150
an outdated data type
and everything was like objects and

7210
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
and everything was like objects and
 

7211
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:05,150
and everything was like objects and
strings and like python was good and

7212
02:39:05,150 --> 02:39:05,160
strings and like python was good and
 

7213
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:07,490
strings and like python was good and
fast at string manipulation and objects

7214
02:39:07,490 --> 02:39:07,500
fast at string manipulation and objects
 

7215
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:10,550
fast at string manipulation and objects
obviously but arrays of numbers were not

7216
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
obviously but arrays of numbers were not
 

7217
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,710
obviously but arrays of numbers were not
very efficient in the multi-dimensional

7218
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:12,720
very efficient in the multi-dimensional
 

7219
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:14,630
very efficient in the multi-dimensional
arrays didn't even exist in the language

7220
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:14,640
arrays didn't even exist in the language
 

7221
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:16,630
arrays didn't even exist in the language
at all

7222
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:16,640
at all
 

7223
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:19,849
at all
uh but there were people who realized

7224
02:39:19,849 --> 02:39:19,859
uh but there were people who realized
 

7225
02:39:19,859 --> 02:39:24,050
uh but there were people who realized
that python had extensibility

7226
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:24,060

 

7227
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:26,690

that was flexible enough that they could

02:39:26,690 --> 02:39:26,700
that was flexible enough that they could
 

7229
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:28,870
that was flexible enough that they could
write

is actually already known to our users
 

7319
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:26,270
is actually already known to our users
so

7320
02:41:26,270 --> 02:41:26,280
so
 

7321
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:29,150
so
let's use python as the user interface I

7322
02:41:29,150 --> 02:41:29,160
let's use python as the user interface I
 

7323
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:31,070
let's use python as the user interface I
think that's how tensor I imagine at

7324
02:41:31,070 --> 02:41:31,080
think that's how tensor I imagine at
 

7325
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,809
think that's how tensor I imagine at
least that's how tensorflow ended up

7326
02:41:32,809 --> 02:41:32,819
least that's how tensorflow ended up
 

7327
02:41:32,819 --> 02:41:34,550
least that's how tensorflow ended up
with python as the user interflow

7328
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:34,560
with python as the user interflow
 

7329
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:37,510
with python as the user interflow
interface right but with tensorflow

7330
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,520
interface right but with tensorflow
 

7331
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:42,469
interface right but with tensorflow
there's a deeper history of what the

02:41:42,469 --> 02:41:42,479
there's a deeper history of what the
 

7333
02:41:42,479 --> 02:41:43,969
there's a deeper history of what the
community is it's not just like what

the universities didn't like it but they
 

7387
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:55,010
the universities didn't like it but they
would still pay for it

would still pay for it
 

7389
02:42:55,020 --> 02:42:57,650

the thing is it didn't feed into that

what was leading what was causing the
stress

7496
02:45:26,210 --> 02:45:26,220

 

7497
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:28,550

and looking back

7498
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:28,560
and looking back
 

7499
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:30,889
and looking back
uh

7500
02:45:30,889 --> 02:45:30,899
uh
 

7501
02:45:30,899 --> 02:45:33,730
uh
I I should have sort of

7502
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:33,740
I I should have sort of
 

7503
02:45:33,740 --> 02:45:38,150
I I should have sort of
relinquished my central role as bdfl

7504
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:38,160
relinquished my central role as bdfl
 

7505
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:39,670
relinquished my central role as bdfl
sooner

7506
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:39,680
sooner
 

7507
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,410
sooner
what were the pros and cons of the bdfl

7508
02:45:42,410 --> 02:45:42,420
what were the pros and cons of the bdfl
 

7509
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:44,570
what were the pros and cons of the bdfl
role like what were the you not

7510
02:45:44,570 --> 02:45:44,580
role like what were the you not
 

7511
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:46,490
role like what were the you not
relinquishing it what what are the

7512
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:46,500
relinquishing it what what are the
 

7513
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:48,950
relinquishing it what what are the
benefits of that for the community and

7514
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:48,960
benefits of that for the community and
 

7515
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:51,770
benefits of that for the community and
what are the drawbacks well the the

7516
02:45:51,770 --> 02:45:51,780
what are the drawbacks well the the
 

7517
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:54,230
what are the drawbacks well the the
benefits for the community would be

7518
02:45:54,230 --> 02:45:54,240
benefits for the community would be
 

7519
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:56,150
benefits for the community would be
things like

7520
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:56,160
things like
 

7521
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:58,790
things like
uh

7522
02:45:58,790 --> 02:45:58,800
uh
 

7523
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:03,889
uh
Clarity of vision and sort of

7524
02:46:03,889 --> 02:46:03,899
Clarity of vision and sort of
 

7525
02:46:03,899 --> 02:46:08,090
Clarity of vision and sort of
a clear Direction because I I had

7526
02:46:08,090 --> 02:46:08,100
a clear Direction because I I had
 

7527
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:11,510
a clear Direction because I I had
certain ideas in in mind when I created

7528
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:11,520
certain ideas in in mind when I created
 

7529
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:15,710
certain ideas in in mind when I created
Python and well I sort of let myself be

7530
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:15,720
Python and well I sort of let myself be
 

7531
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:19,429
Python and well I sort of let myself be
influenced by many other ideas as python

7532
02:46:19,429 --> 02:46:19,439
influenced by many other ideas as python
 

7533
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:21,770
influenced by many other ideas as python
evolved and became

7534
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:21,780
evolved and became
 

7535
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:25,429
evolved and became
more successful and more complex and

7536
02:46:25,429 --> 02:46:25,439
more successful and more complex and
 

7537
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:27,590
more successful and more complex and
more used

7538
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,600
more used
 

7539
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,710
more used
I also stuck to certain principles and

7540
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:30,720
I also stuck to certain principles and
 

7541
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:32,990
I also stuck to certain principles and
it's still hard to say what are Python's

7542
02:46:32,990 --> 02:46:33,000
it's still hard to say what are Python's
 

7543
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,790
it's still hard to say what are Python's
core principles

7544
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:34,800
core principles
 

7545
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:39,530
core principles
but the fact that I was playing that

7546
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:39,540
but the fact that I was playing that
 

7547
02:46:39,540 --> 02:46:43,750
but the fact that I was playing that
role and sort of always very active

7548
02:46:43,750 --> 02:46:43,760
role and sort of always very active
 

7549
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:47,570
role and sort of always very active
grew the community in a certain way

7550
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:47,580
grew the community in a certain way
 

7551
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:51,349
grew the community in a certain way
it modeled to the community how to think

7552
02:46:51,349 --> 02:46:51,359
it modeled to the community how to think
 

7553
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:52,790
it modeled to the community how to think
about

7554
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:52,800
about
 

7555
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:55,190
about
how to how to solve a certain problem

7556
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:55,200
how to how to solve a certain problem
 

7557
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:56,510
how to how to solve a certain problem
well

7558
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:56,520
well
 

7559
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:58,250
well
that was a source of stress but it was

7560
02:46:58,250 --> 02:46:58,260
that was a source of stress but it was
 

7561
02:46:58,260 --> 02:46:59,750
that was a source of stress but it was
also beneficial it was a source of

7562
02:46:59,750 --> 02:46:59,760
also beneficial it was a source of
 

7563
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:01,969
also beneficial it was a source of
stress for me personally but it was

7564
02:47:01,969 --> 02:47:01,979
stress for me personally but it was
 

7565
02:47:01,979 --> 02:47:05,150
stress for me personally but it was
beneficial for the community because uh

7566
02:47:05,150 --> 02:47:05,160
beneficial for the community because uh
 

7567
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:07,610
beneficial for the community because uh
people people sort of

7568
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:07,620
people people sort of
 

7569
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:09,710
people people sort of
over time had

7570
02:47:09,710 --> 02:47:09,720
over time had
 

7571
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:12,410
over time had
learned how I was thinking and could

7572
02:47:12,410 --> 02:47:12,420
learned how I was thinking and could
 

7573
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:14,150
learned how I was thinking and could
predict

7574
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
predict
 

7575
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:17,750
predict
yeah but how how I would decide about a

7576
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:17,760
yeah but how how I would decide about a
 

7577
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:19,190
yeah but how how I would decide about a
particular issue and not always

7578
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:19,200
particular issue and not always
 

7579
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:22,730
particular issue and not always
perfectly of course but there was like

7580
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:22,740
perfectly of course but there was like
 

7581
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:24,710
perfectly of course but there was like
there wasn't a lot of jerking around

7582
02:47:24,710 --> 02:47:24,720
there wasn't a lot of jerking around
 

7583
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:27,710
there wasn't a lot of jerking around
like this year we're all this year the

7584
02:47:27,710 --> 02:47:27,720
like this year we're all this year the
 

7585
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:30,170
like this year we're all this year the
Democrats are in power and we're doing

7586
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:30,180
Democrats are in power and we're doing
 

7587
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:31,910
Democrats are in power and we're doing
these kind of things and now the

7588
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:31,920
these kind of things and now the
 

7589
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:33,830
these kind of things and now the
Republicans are in power and they roll

7590
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:33,840
Republicans are in power and they roll
 

7591
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:35,450
Republicans are in power and they roll
all that back and do those kind of

7592
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:35,460
all that back and do those kind of
 

7593
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:36,410
all that back and do those kind of
things

7594
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:36,420
things
 

7595
02:47:36,420 --> 02:47:39,950
things
there is a clear fairly straight path

7596
02:47:39,950 --> 02:47:39,960
there is a clear fairly straight path
 

7597
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:41,030
there is a clear fairly straight path
ahead

7598
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
ahead
 

7599
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:44,690
ahead
and so fortunately the the successor

7600
02:47:44,690 --> 02:47:44,700
and so fortunately the the successor
 

7601
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:47,090
and so fortunately the the successor
structure with the steering Council

7602
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:47,100
structure with the steering Council
 

7603
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:51,050
structure with the steering Council
has has sort of found a similar way of

7604
02:47:51,050 --> 02:47:51,060
has has sort of found a similar way of
 

7605
02:47:51,060 --> 02:47:53,410
has has sort of found a similar way of
of leading the community

7606
02:47:53,410 --> 02:47:53,420
of leading the community
 

7607
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:56,770
of leading the community
in a fairly steady Direction without

7608
02:47:56,770 --> 02:47:56,780
in a fairly steady Direction without
 

7609
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:59,750
in a fairly steady Direction without
stagnating and and for me personally

7610
02:47:59,750 --> 02:47:59,760
stagnating and and for me personally
 

7611
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:02,150
stagnating and and for me personally
it's more fun because there are there

7612
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:02,160
it's more fun because there are there
 

7613
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:04,330
it's more fun because there are there
are things I can just ignore

7614
02:48:04,330 --> 02:48:04,340
are things I can just ignore
 

7615
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:06,530
are things I can just ignore
yeah oh yeah there's a bug in

7616
02:48:06,530 --> 02:48:06,540
yeah oh yeah there's a bug in
 

7617
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:09,170
yeah oh yeah there's a bug in
multi-processing let someone else decide

7618
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:09,180
multi-processing let someone else decide
 

7619
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:12,410
multi-processing let someone else decide
whether that's important to solve or not

7620
02:48:12,410 --> 02:48:12,420
whether that's important to solve or not
 

7621
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:15,950
whether that's important to solve or not
I'll I'll stick to typing in the async

7622
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:15,960
I'll I'll stick to typing in the async
 

7623
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:19,370
I'll I'll stick to typing in the async
io and the faster interpreter yeah it

7624
02:48:19,370 --> 02:48:19,380
io and the faster interpreter yeah it
 

7625
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:20,809
io and the faster interpreter yeah it
allows you to focus a little bit more

7626
02:48:20,809 --> 02:48:20,819
allows you to focus a little bit more
 

7627
02:48:20,819 --> 02:48:22,250
allows you to focus a little bit more
yeah

7628
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:22,260
yeah
 

7629
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:24,830
yeah
uh what are interesting differences in

7630
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:24,840
uh what are interesting differences in
 

7631
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:26,450
uh what are interesting differences in
culture if you can comment on between

7632
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:26,460
culture if you can comment on between
 

7633
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:28,849
culture if you can comment on between
Google Dropbox and Microsoft from our

7634
02:48:28,849 --> 02:48:28,859
Google Dropbox and Microsoft from our
 

7635
02:48:28,859 --> 02:48:30,950
Google Dropbox and Microsoft from our
Python Programming perspective all

7636
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:30,960
Python Programming perspective all
 

7637
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:34,250
Python Programming perspective all
places you've been to the positive

7638
02:48:34,250 --> 02:48:34,260
places you've been to the positive
 

7639
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:36,650
places you've been to the positive
is there a difference or is it just

7640
02:48:36,650 --> 02:48:36,660
is there a difference or is it just
 

7641
02:48:36,660 --> 02:48:39,349
is there a difference or is it just
about people and there's great people

7642
02:48:39,349 --> 02:48:39,359
about people and there's great people
 

7643
02:48:39,359 --> 02:48:41,090
about people and there's great people
everywhere or is there culture

7644
02:48:41,090 --> 02:48:41,100
everywhere or is there culture
 

7645
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:42,950
everywhere or is there culture
differences

7646
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:42,960
differences
 

7647
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:46,130
differences
sort of Dropbox is much smaller than the

7648
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:46,140
sort of Dropbox is much smaller than the
 

7649
02:48:46,140 --> 02:48:50,750
sort of Dropbox is much smaller than the
other two in your list yeah so that

7650
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:50,760
other two in your list yeah so that
 

7651
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:53,330
other two in your list yeah so that
that is a big difference the set of

7652
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:53,340
that is a big difference the set of
 

7653
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:55,010
that is a big difference the set of
products they provide is more it's

7654
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:55,020
products they provide is more it's
 

7655
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:57,650
products they provide is more it's
narrower so they're more focused smaller

7656
02:48:57,650 --> 02:48:57,660
narrower so they're more focused smaller
 

7657
02:48:57,660 --> 02:49:00,410
narrower so they're more focused smaller
code base yeah and and Dropbox sort of

7658
02:49:00,410 --> 02:49:00,420
code base yeah and and Dropbox sort of
 

7659
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:03,530
code base yeah and and Dropbox sort of
at least during the time I was there

7660
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:03,540
at least during the time I was there
 

7661
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:06,950
at least during the time I was there
had the tendency of sort of

7662
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:06,960
had the tendency of sort of
 

7663
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:09,770
had the tendency of sort of
making a big plan putting the whole

7664
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:09,780
making a big plan putting the whole
 

7665
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:12,830
making a big plan putting the whole
company behind that plan for a year and

7666
02:49:12,830 --> 02:49:12,840
company behind that plan for a year and
 

7667
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:15,290
company behind that plan for a year and
then evaluate and then suddenly find

7668
02:49:15,290 --> 02:49:15,300
then evaluate and then suddenly find
 

7669
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:17,230
then evaluate and then suddenly find
that

7670
02:49:17,230 --> 02:49:17,240
that
 

7671
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:20,389
that
everything was wrong about the plan and

7672
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:20,399
everything was wrong about the plan and
 

7673
02:49:20,399 --> 02:49:22,190
everything was wrong about the plan and
then they had to do something completely

7674
02:49:22,190 --> 02:49:22,200
then they had to do something completely
 

7675
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:23,630
then they had to do something completely
different

7676
02:49:23,630 --> 02:49:23,640
different
 

7677
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:25,670
different
so there were there was like

7678
02:49:25,670 --> 02:49:25,680
so there were there was like
 

7679
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:29,210
so there were there was like
the annual engineering reorg was was

7680
02:49:29,210 --> 02:49:29,220
the annual engineering reorg was was
 

7681
02:49:29,220 --> 02:49:31,250
the annual engineering reorg was was
sort of an unpleasant tradition that

7682
02:49:31,250 --> 02:49:31,260
sort of an unpleasant tradition that
 

7683
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:33,710
sort of an unpleasant tradition that
Dropbox because like oh there's a new VP

7684
02:49:33,710 --> 02:49:33,720
Dropbox because like oh there's a new VP
 

7685
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:35,690
Dropbox because like oh there's a new VP
of engineering and so now all the

7686
02:49:35,690 --> 02:49:35,700
of engineering and so now all the
 

7687
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:38,510
of engineering and so now all the
directors are being reshuffled and this

7688
02:49:38,510 --> 02:49:38,520
directors are being reshuffled and this
 

7689
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:41,290
directors are being reshuffled and this
guy was in charge of of

7690
02:49:41,290 --> 02:49:41,300
guy was in charge of of
 

7691
02:49:41,300 --> 02:49:43,790
guy was in charge of of
infrastructure one year and the next

7692
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:43,800
infrastructure one year and the next
 

7693
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:46,309
infrastructure one year and the next
year he was made in charge of I don't

7694
02:49:46,309 --> 02:49:46,319
year he was made in charge of I don't
 

7695
02:49:46,319 --> 02:49:48,230
year he was made in charge of I don't
know product development

7696
02:49:48,230 --> 02:49:48,240
know product development
 

7697
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:50,090
know product development
it's fascinating because like you don't

7698
02:49:50,090 --> 02:49:50,100
it's fascinating because like you don't
 

7699
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:51,650
it's fascinating because like you don't
think about these companies internally

7700
02:49:51,650 --> 02:49:51,660
think about these companies internally
 

7701
02:49:51,660 --> 02:49:54,710
think about these companies internally
but I you know Dropbox to me from the

7702
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
but I you know Dropbox to me from the
 

7703
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,050
but I you know Dropbox to me from the
very beginning was one of my favorite uh

7704
02:49:57,050 --> 02:49:57,060
very beginning was one of my favorite uh
 

7705
02:49:57,060 --> 02:49:58,910
very beginning was one of my favorite uh
Services there's certain like programs

7706
02:49:58,910 --> 02:49:58,920
Services there's certain like programs
 

7707
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:01,010
Services there's certain like programs
and online services that

7708
02:50:01,010 --> 02:50:01,020
and online services that
 

7709
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:03,530
and online services that
make me happy make me more efficient and

7710

make me happy make me more efficient and
 

7711
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:05,750
make me happy make me more efficient and
all that kind of stuff but one of the

7712
02:50:05,750 --> 02:50:05,760
all that kind of stuff but one of the
 

7713
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:07,730
all that kind of stuff but one of the
powers of those kinds of services they

7714
02:50:07,730 --> 02:50:07,740
powers of those kinds of services they
 

7715
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:09,469
powers of those kinds of services they
disappear they you're not supposed to

7716
02:50:09,469 --> 02:50:09,479
disappear they you're not supposed to
 

7717
02:50:09,479 --> 02:50:11,389
disappear they you're not supposed to
think about how it all works but it's

7718
02:50:11,389 --> 02:50:11,399
think about how it all works but it's
 

7719
02:50:11,399 --> 02:50:13,849
think about how it all works but it's
incredible to me that you can sync stuff

7720
02:50:13,849 --> 02:50:13,859
incredible to me that you can sync stuff
 

7721
02:50:13,859 --> 02:50:15,530
incredible to me that you can sync stuff
effortlessly

7722
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:15,540
effortlessly
 

7723
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:19,550
effortlessly
across so many machines so quickly and

7724
02:50:19,550 --> 02:50:19,560
across so many machines so quickly and
 

7725
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:21,710
across so many machines so quickly and
like don't have to worry about conflicts

7726
02:50:21,710 --> 02:50:21,720
like don't have to worry about conflicts
 

7727
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:23,990
like don't have to worry about conflicts
they they take care of the you know as a

7728
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:24,000
they they take care of the you know as a
 

7729
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,849
they they take care of the you know as a
person that comes from version

7730
02:50:25,849 --> 02:50:25,859
person that comes from version
 

7731
02:50:25,859 --> 02:50:27,469
person that comes from version
repositories and all that kind of stuff

7732
02:50:27,469 --> 02:50:27,479
repositories and all that kind of stuff
 

7733
02:50:27,479 --> 02:50:31,550
repositories and all that kind of stuff
or merge is super difficult and uh just

7734
02:50:31,550 --> 02:50:31,560
or merge is super difficult and uh just
 

7735
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:32,929
or merge is super difficult and uh just
keeping different versions different

7736
02:50:32,929 --> 02:50:32,939
keeping different versions different
 

7737
02:50:32,939 --> 02:50:34,849
keeping different versions different
files is very tricky the fact that they

7738
02:50:34,849 --> 02:50:34,859
files is very tricky the fact that they
 

7739
02:50:34,859 --> 02:50:36,530
files is very tricky the fact that they
could take care of that is just I don't

7740
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:36,540
could take care of that is just I don't
 

7741
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:38,870
could take care of that is just I don't
know the the engineering behind the

7742
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
know the the engineering behind the
 

7743
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,969
know the the engineering behind the
scenes must be super difficult both on

7744
02:50:40,969 --> 02:50:40,979
scenes must be super difficult both on
 

7745
02:50:40,979 --> 02:50:42,530
scenes must be super difficult both on
the computer infrastructure and the

7746
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:42,540
the computer infrastructure and the
 

7747
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:46,150
the computer infrastructure and the
software a lot of internal sort of

7748
02:50:46,150 --> 02:50:46,160
software a lot of internal sort of
 

7749
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:49,610
software a lot of internal sort of
hand-wringing about things like that but

7750
02:50:49,610 --> 02:50:49,620
hand-wringing about things like that but
 

7751
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:52,490
hand-wringing about things like that but
the the product itself always worked

7752
02:50:52,490 --> 02:50:52,500
the the product itself always worked
 

7753
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,190
the the product itself always worked
very smoothly yeah it does but there's

7754
02:50:55,190 --> 02:50:55,200
very smoothly yeah it does but there's
 

7755
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:57,050
very smoothly yeah it does but there's
probably a lot of lessons to that you

7756
02:50:57,050 --> 02:50:57,060
probably a lot of lessons to that you
 

7757
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:59,150
probably a lot of lessons to that you
can have a lot of turmoil inside on the

7758
02:50:59,150 --> 02:50:59,160
can have a lot of turmoil inside on the
 

7759
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:02,030
can have a lot of turmoil inside on the
engineering side but If the product is

7760
02:51:02,030 --> 02:51:02,040
engineering side but If the product is
 

7761
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,770
engineering side but If the product is
good the product is good and don't maybe

7762
02:51:03,770 --> 02:51:03,780
good the product is good and don't maybe
 

7763
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:05,990
good the product is good and don't maybe
don't mess with that either it is you

7764
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
don't mess with that either it is you
 

7765
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,550
don't mess with that either it is you
know when it's good

7766
02:51:07,550 --> 02:51:07,560
know when it's good
 

7767
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:09,770
know when it's good
keep it's like with Google focus on the

7768
02:51:09,770 --> 02:51:09,780
keep it's like with Google focus on the
 

7769
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:11,290
keep it's like with Google focus on the
search and the ads

7770

and don't forget what you do extremely
well and in what ways do you provide

7778
02:51:21,250 --> 02:51:21,260
well and in what ways do you provide
 

7779
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:24,290
well and in what ways do you provide
value and happiness to the world make

7780
02:51:24,290 --> 02:51:24,300
value and happiness to the world make

02:51:28,429 --> 02:51:28,439
um is there something else to say about
 

7785
02:51:28,439 --> 02:51:30,830
um is there something else to say about
Google and Microsoft Microsoft has said

7786

embracing open source culture embracing
 

7795
02:51:42,359 --> 02:51:43,849
embracing open source culture embracing
the developer culture is pretty

7796
02:51:43,849 --> 02:51:43,859
the developer culture is pretty
 

7797
02:51:43,859 --> 02:51:45,889
the developer culture is pretty
interesting to see that's like why I

7798
02:51:45,889 --> 02:51:45,899
interesting to see that's like why I
 

7799
02:51:45,899 --> 02:51:47,510
interesting to see that's like why I
joined Microsoft

7800
02:51:47,510 --> 02:51:47,520
joined Microsoft
 

7801
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:50,510

I mean after after retiring and thinking

7802
02:51:50,510 --> 02:51:50,520
I mean after after retiring and thinking
 

7803
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:53,150
I mean after after retiring and thinking
that I would stay retired for the rest

7804

that I would stay retired for the rest
 

7805
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:54,769
that I would stay retired for the rest
of my life which of course was a

7806
02:51:54,769 --> 02:51:54,779
of my life which of course was a
 

7807
02:51:54,779 --> 02:51:57,610
of my life which of course was a
ridiculous thought but that I was I was

7808

ridiculous thought but that I was I was
 

7809

I was done working for a bit and then
the pandemic made me realize that work

7812

the pandemic made me realize that work
 

7813
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:05,570
the pandemic made me realize that work
work can also provide a source of

7833
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:38,150
I've been been talking to a bunch of
excel people lately and Excel is like 35

7834
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:38,160
excel people lately and Excel is like 35
 

7835
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:41,510
excel people lately and Excel is like 35
years old yeah and they can still read

7836
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:41,520
years old yeah and they can still read
 

7837
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:44,690
years old yeah and they can still read
spreadsheets that that they might find

7838
02:52:44,690 --> 02:52:44,700
spreadsheets that that they might find
 

7839
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:48,889
spreadsheets that that they might find
on an old floppy Drive

7840
02:52:48,889 --> 02:52:48,899

 

7841
02:52:48,899 --> 02:52:50,750

yeah there's man they built so many

7842
02:52:50,750 --> 02:52:50,760
yeah there's man they built so many
 

7843
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:53,170
yeah there's man they built so many
incredible tools through the years

7844
02:52:53,170 --> 02:52:53,180
incredible tools through the years
 

7845
02:52:53,180 --> 02:52:58,389
incredible tools through the years
Excel one of the great shames of my life

7846
02:52:58,389 --> 02:52:58,399
Excel one of the great shames of my life
 

7847
02:52:58,399 --> 02:53:00,830
Excel one of the great shames of my life
is that I've never learned how to use

7848
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:00,840
is that I've never learned how to use
 

7849
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:03,469
is that I've never learned how to use
Excel well I mean it just always felt

7850
02:53:03,469 --> 02:53:03,479
Excel well I mean it just always felt
 

7851
02:53:03,479 --> 02:53:05,929
Excel well I mean it just always felt
like so many features are there it's

7852
02:53:05,929 --> 02:53:05,939
like so many features are there it's
 

7853
02:53:05,939 --> 02:53:08,510
like so many features are there it's
similar with ideas like pie charm

7854
02:53:08,510 --> 02:53:08,520
similar with ideas like pie charm
 

7855
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:11,510
similar with ideas like pie charm
it feels like I I converge quickly to

7856
02:53:11,510 --> 02:53:11,520
it feels like I I converge quickly to
 

7857
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,190
it feels like I I converge quickly to
the dumbest way to use a thing to get

7858
02:53:13,190 --> 02:53:13,200
the dumbest way to use a thing to get
 

7859
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:15,469
the dumbest way to use a thing to get
the job done when clearly there's so

7860
02:53:15,469 --> 02:53:15,479
the job done when clearly there's so
 

7861
02:53:15,479 --> 02:53:17,570
the job done when clearly there's so
much more power at your fingertips

7862
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:17,580
much more power at your fingertips
 

7863
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:20,269
much more power at your fingertips
yeah but there's I I do think there's

7864
02:53:20,269 --> 02:53:20,279
yeah but there's I I do think there's
 

7865
02:53:20,279 --> 02:53:22,910
yeah but there's I I do think there's
probably expert users of Excel and oh

7866
02:53:22,910 --> 02:53:22,920
probably expert users of Excel and oh
 

7867
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:26,389
probably expert users of Excel and oh
that Excel is a cash cow actually oh it

7868
02:53:26,389 --> 02:53:26,399
that Excel is a cash cow actually oh it
 

7869
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:29,210
that Excel is a cash cow actually oh it
actually brings in money oh yeah a lot

7870
02:53:29,210 --> 02:53:29,220
actually brings in money oh yeah a lot
 

7871
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:32,030
actually brings in money oh yeah a lot
of the engineering sort of if you look

7872
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:32,040
of the engineering sort of if you look
 

7873
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:34,309
of the engineering sort of if you look
deep inside Excel

7874
02:53:34,309 --> 02:53:34,319
deep inside Excel
 

7875
02:53:34,319 --> 02:53:37,190
deep inside Excel
there's some very good engineering very

7876
02:53:37,190 --> 02:53:37,200
there's some very good engineering very
 

7877
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:39,590
there's some very good engineering very
very impressive stuff

7878
02:53:39,590 --> 02:53:39,600
very impressive stuff
 

7879
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:41,870
very impressive stuff
okay now I need to definitely learn it's

7880
02:53:41,870 --> 02:53:41,880
okay now I need to definitely learn it's
 

7881
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:44,150
okay now I need to definitely learn it's
a little better I had issues because I'm

7882
02:53:44,150 --> 02:53:44,160
a little better I had issues because I'm
 

7883
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:47,090
a little better I had issues because I'm
a keyboard person so I had issues coming

7884
02:53:47,090 --> 02:53:47,100
a keyboard person so I had issues coming
 

7885
02:53:47,100 --> 02:53:48,469
a keyboard person so I had issues coming
up with shortcuts I mean Microsoft

7886
02:53:48,469 --> 02:53:48,479
up with shortcuts I mean Microsoft
 

7887
02:53:48,479 --> 02:53:49,550
up with shortcuts I mean Microsoft
sometimes

7888
02:53:49,550 --> 02:53:49,560
sometimes
 

7889
02:53:49,560 --> 02:53:51,650
sometimes
uh it's changed over the years but

7890
02:53:51,650 --> 02:53:51,660
uh it's changed over the years but
 

7891
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:53,150
uh it's changed over the years but
sometimes they kind of want to make

7892
02:53:53,150 --> 02:53:53,160
sometimes they kind of want to make
 

7893
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:56,090
sometimes they kind of want to make
things easier for you on the surface and

7894
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:56,100
things easier for you on the surface and
 

7895
02:53:56,100 --> 02:54:00,110
things easier for you on the surface and
therefore make it harder for like uh

7896
02:54:00,110 --> 02:54:00,120
therefore make it harder for like uh
 

7897
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:02,389
therefore make it harder for like uh
people that like to have shortcuts and

7898
02:54:02,389 --> 02:54:02,399
people that like to have shortcuts and
 

7899
02:54:02,399 --> 02:54:04,370
people that like to have shortcuts and
all that kind of stuff to optimize their

7900
02:54:04,370 --> 02:54:04,380
all that kind of stuff to optimize their
 

7901
02:54:04,380 --> 02:54:06,769
all that kind of stuff to optimize their
workflow now Excel is probably people

7902
02:54:06,769 --> 02:54:06,779
workflow now Excel is probably people
 

7903
02:54:06,779 --> 02:54:08,210
workflow now Excel is probably people
are probably yelling at me and it's like

7904
02:54:08,210 --> 02:54:08,220
are probably yelling at me and it's like
 

7905
02:54:08,220 --> 02:54:10,250
are probably yelling at me and it's like
no Excel probably has a lot of ways to

7906
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:10,260
no Excel probably has a lot of ways to
 

7907
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:13,130
no Excel probably has a lot of ways to
optimize work in fact I keep discovering

7908
02:54:13,130 --> 02:54:13,140
optimize work in fact I keep discovering
 

7909
02:54:13,140 --> 02:54:15,349
optimize work in fact I keep discovering
that there are many features in Excel

7910
02:54:15,349 --> 02:54:15,359
that there are many features in Excel
 

7911
02:54:15,359 --> 02:54:19,090
that there are many features in Excel
that only exists at keyboard shortcuts

7912
02:54:19,090 --> 02:54:19,100
that only exists at keyboard shortcuts
 

7913
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:21,590
that only exists at keyboard shortcuts
yeah that's the sense I have and now

7914
02:54:21,590 --> 02:54:21,600
yeah that's the sense I have and now
 

7915
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:24,050
yeah that's the sense I have and now
like I'm embarrassed that it's just you

7916
02:54:24,050 --> 02:54:24,060
like I'm embarrassed that it's just you
 

7917
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:25,610
like I'm embarrassed that it's just you
just have to know what they are yeah

7918
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:25,620
just have to know what they are yeah
 

7919
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:29,269
just have to know what they are yeah
that's that's like there's no logic or

7920
02:54:29,269 --> 02:54:29,279
that's that's like there's no logic or
 

7921
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:31,790
that's that's like there's no logic or
or Reason to the assignment of the

7922
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:31,800
or Reason to the assignment of the
 

7923
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:33,950
or Reason to the assignment of the
keyboard shortcuts because they they go

7924
02:54:33,950 --> 02:54:33,960
keyboard shortcuts because they they go
 

7925
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:37,070
keyboard shortcuts because they they go
back even longer than 35 years

7926
02:54:37,070 --> 02:54:37,080
back even longer than 35 years
 

7927
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:39,530
back even longer than 35 years
can you maybe comment about Sachin Adela

7928
02:54:39,530 --> 02:54:39,540
can you maybe comment about Sachin Adela
 

7929
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:42,410
can you maybe comment about Sachin Adela
and how hard it is for CEO to sort of

7930
02:54:42,410 --> 02:54:42,420
and how hard it is for CEO to sort of
 

7931
02:54:42,420 --> 02:54:44,750
and how hard it is for CEO to sort of
pivot a company towards open source or

7932
02:54:44,750 --> 02:54:44,760
pivot a company towards open source or
 

7933
02:54:44,760 --> 02:54:46,429
pivot a company towards open source or
develop a culture is there something you

7934
02:54:46,429 --> 02:54:46,439
develop a culture is there something you
 

7935
02:54:46,439 --> 02:54:49,010
develop a culture is there something you
could see about like how what's the role

7936
02:54:49,010 --> 02:54:49,020
could see about like how what's the role
 

7937
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:51,769
could see about like how what's the role
of leadership in such a

7938
02:54:51,769 --> 02:54:51,779
of leadership in such a
 

7939
02:54:51,779 --> 02:54:53,570
of leadership in such a
pivot and definition of a new vision

7940
02:54:53,570 --> 02:54:53,580
pivot and definition of a new vision
 

7941
02:54:53,580 --> 02:54:59,570

sense
he took the organization that had very

7952
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:11,760
he took the organization that had very
 

7953
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:15,070
he took the organization that had very
solid pieces but that was also

7954
02:55:15,070 --> 02:55:15,080
solid pieces but that was also
 

7955
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,809
solid pieces but that was also
struggling

7956
02:55:16,809 --> 02:55:16,819
struggling
 

7957
02:55:16,819 --> 02:55:20,510
struggling
with all sorts of shameful things

7958
02:55:20,510 --> 02:55:20,520
with all sorts of shameful things
 

7959

way to Learn Python because you learn
 

8209
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:59,030
way to Learn Python because you learn
just enough to run this model and that's

8210
03:00:59,030 --> 03:00:59,040
just enough to run this model and that's
 

8211
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:01,910
just enough to run this model and that's
like a sneaky way to get get in there to

03:01:10,849 --> 03:01:10,859
how to run functions and I'm not sure if
 

8219
03:01:10,859 --> 03:01:12,769
how to run functions and I'm not sure if
it's the best way to learn the basics of

8220
03:01:12,769 --> 03:01:12,779
it's the best way to learn the basics of
 

8221
03:01:12,779 --> 03:01:14,990
it's the best way to learn the basics of
python but it could be nice to just get

8222
03:01:14,990 --> 03:01:15,000
python but it could be nice to just get
 

8223
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,730

fall in love first and then figure out

8224
03:01:16,730 --> 03:01:16,740
fall in love first and then figure out
 

8225
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:19,250
fall in love first and then figure out
the basics right yeah you can't expect

8226
03:01:19,250 --> 03:01:19,260
the basics right yeah you can't expect

03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:44,570
someone else can but that doesn't make
you a coder yeah actually coding has

8290
03:02:44,570 --> 03:02:44,580
you a coder yeah actually coding has
 

8291
03:02:44,580 --> 03:02:47,150
you a coder yeah actually coding has
changed in fascinating ways because so

8292
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:47,160
changed in fascinating ways because so
 

8293
03:02:47,160 --> 03:02:49,610
changed in fascinating ways because so
much of uh coding is copying pasting

8294
03:02:49,610 --> 03:02:49,620
much of uh coding is copying pasting
 

8295
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:52,070
much of uh coding is copying pasting
from stack Overflow and then adjusting

8296
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:52,080
from stack Overflow and then adjusting
 

8297
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:54,050
from stack Overflow and then adjusting
which is another way of coding and I

8298
03:02:54,050 --> 03:02:54,060
which is another way of coding and I
 

8299
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:55,730
which is another way of coding and I
don't want to talk down to that kind of

8300
03:02:55,730 --> 03:02:55,740
don't want to talk down to that kind of
 

8301
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:57,769
don't want to talk down to that kind of
style of coding because it's kind of

8302
03:02:57,769 --> 03:02:57,779
style of coding because it's kind of
 

8303
03:02:57,779 --> 03:02:59,750
style of coding because it's kind of
nicely efficient but you know where that

8304
03:02:59,750 --> 03:02:59,760
nicely efficient but you know where that
 

8305
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:05,769
nicely efficient but you know where that
is going

8306
03:03:05,769 --> 03:03:05,779

 

8307
03:03:05,779 --> 03:03:09,769

I use it every day and it really yeah it

8308
03:03:09,769 --> 03:03:09,779
I use it every day and it really yeah it
 

8309
03:03:09,779 --> 03:03:12,650
I use it every day and it really yeah it
writes a lot of code for me and usually

8310
03:03:12,650 --> 03:03:12,660
writes a lot of code for me and usually
 

8311
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:15,050
writes a lot of code for me and usually
it's slightly wrong but it still saves

8312
03:03:15,050 --> 03:03:15,060
it's slightly wrong but it still saves
 

8313
03:03:15,060 --> 03:03:17,630
it's slightly wrong but it still saves
me typing because all I have to do is

8314
03:03:17,630 --> 03:03:17,640
me typing because all I have to do is
 

8315
03:03:17,640 --> 03:03:20,990
me typing because all I have to do is
like change one word in a line of text

8316
03:03:20,990 --> 03:03:21,000
like change one word in a line of text
 

8317
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,750
like change one word in a line of text
that otherwise it it generated perfectly

8318
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:23,760
that otherwise it it generated perfectly
 

8319
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:27,290
that otherwise it it generated perfectly
and like how many times are you looking

8320
03:03:27,290 --> 03:03:27,300
and like how many times are you looking
 

8321
03:03:27,300 --> 03:03:29,570
and like how many times are you looking
for like oh what was I doing this

8322
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:29,580
for like oh what was I doing this
 

8323
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:31,550
for like oh what was I doing this
morning I was looking for a begin marker

8324
03:03:31,550 --> 03:03:31,560
morning I was looking for a begin marker
 

8325
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:33,710
morning I was looking for a begin marker
and I look was looking for an end marker

8326
03:03:33,710 --> 03:03:33,720
and I look was looking for an end marker
 

8327
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:37,250
and I look was looking for an end marker
and so begin is

8328
03:03:37,250 --> 03:03:37,260
and so begin is
 

8329
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:41,630
and so begin is
blah blah blah search for begin this is

8330
03:03:41,630 --> 03:03:41,640
blah blah blah search for begin this is
 

8331
03:03:41,640 --> 03:03:45,170
blah blah blah search for begin this is
the begin token and then the next line I

8332
03:03:45,170 --> 03:03:45,180
the begin token and then the next line I
 

8333
03:03:45,180 --> 03:03:48,889
the begin token and then the next line I
type e and it it completes the whole

8334
03:03:48,889 --> 03:03:48,899
type e and it it completes the whole
 

8335
03:03:48,899 --> 03:03:51,769
type e and it it completes the whole
line with end instead of begin that's a

8336
03:03:51,769 --> 03:03:51,779
line with end instead of begin that's a
 

8337
03:03:51,779 --> 03:03:54,110
line with end instead of begin that's a
very simple example sometimes it it sort

8338
03:03:54,110 --> 03:03:54,120
very simple example sometimes it it sort
 

8339
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:54,889
very simple example sometimes it it sort
of

8340
03:03:54,889 --> 03:03:54,899
of
 

8341
03:03:54,899 --> 03:03:57,290
of
if I name my function right it writes a

8342
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:57,300
if I name my function right it writes a
 

8343
03:03:57,300 --> 03:04:00,050
if I name my function right it writes a
5 or 10 line function

8344
03:04:00,050 --> 03:04:00,060
5 or 10 line function
 

8345
03:04:00,060 --> 03:04:04,429
5 or 10 line function
and you know python enough to very

8346
03:04:04,429 --> 03:04:04,439
and you know python enough to very
 

8347
03:04:04,439 --> 03:04:07,130
and you know python enough to very
quickly then detect the issues so it

8348
03:04:07,130 --> 03:04:07,140
quickly then detect the issues so it
 

8349
03:04:07,140 --> 03:04:09,050
quickly then detect the issues so it
becomes a really good dance partner then

8350
03:04:09,050 --> 03:04:09,060
becomes a really good dance partner then
 

8351
03:04:09,060 --> 03:04:11,389
becomes a really good dance partner then
it doesn't save me a lot of thinking but

8352
03:04:11,389 --> 03:04:11,399
it doesn't save me a lot of thinking but
 

8353
03:04:11,399 --> 03:04:14,269
it doesn't save me a lot of thinking but
since I'm a poor typist I'm very much

8354
03:04:14,269 --> 03:04:14,279
since I'm a poor typist I'm very much
 

8355
03:04:14,279 --> 03:04:17,870
since I'm a poor typist I'm very much
appreciative of all the all the typing

8356
03:04:17,870 --> 03:04:17,880
appreciative of all the all the typing
 

8357
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:19,730
appreciative of all the all the typing
it does for me

8358
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:19,740
it does for me
 

8359
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:22,130
it does for me
much better actually than the the

8360
03:04:22,130 --> 03:04:22,140
much better actually than the the
 

8361
03:04:22,140 --> 03:04:24,710
much better actually than the the
previous generation of suggestions that

8362
03:04:24,710 --> 03:04:24,720
previous generation of suggestions that
 

8363
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:27,469
previous generation of suggestions that
are also still built in vs code

8364
03:04:27,469 --> 03:04:27,479
are also still built in vs code
 

8365
03:04:27,479 --> 03:04:30,650
are also still built in vs code
uh where when you hit like a DOT

8366
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:30,660
uh where when you hit like a DOT
 

8367
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:34,190
uh where when you hit like a DOT
it it tries to guess what the type is of

8368
03:04:34,190 --> 03:04:34,200
it it tries to guess what the type is of
 

8369
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:36,050
it it tries to guess what the type is of
the variable to the left of the dot and

8370
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:36,060
the variable to the left of the dot and
 

8371
03:04:36,060 --> 03:04:38,750
the variable to the left of the dot and
then it gives you a list a pop-down menu

8372
03:04:38,750 --> 03:04:38,760
then it gives you a list a pop-down menu
 

8373
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:41,690
then it gives you a list a pop-down menu
of what the attributes of that object

8374
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:41,700
of what the attributes of that object
 

8375
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:44,210
of what the attributes of that object
are but copilot is much much smoother

8376
03:04:44,210 --> 03:04:44,220
are but copilot is much much smoother
 

8377
03:04:44,220 --> 03:04:45,969
are but copilot is much much smoother
than that well it's fascinating to hear

8378
03:04:45,969 --> 03:04:45,979
than that well it's fascinating to hear
 

8379
03:04:45,979 --> 03:04:49,790
than that well it's fascinating to hear
that you use GitHub copilot uh do you

8380
03:04:49,790 --> 03:04:49,800
that you use GitHub copilot uh do you
 

8381
03:04:49,800 --> 03:04:51,349
that you use GitHub copilot uh do you
think do you worry about the future of

8382
03:04:51,349 --> 03:04:51,359
think do you worry about the future of
 

8383
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:52,790
think do you worry about the future of
that

8384
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:52,800
that
 

8385
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:56,269
that
um did the automatic code generation

8386
03:04:56,269 --> 03:04:56,279
um did the automatic code generation
 

8387
03:04:56,279 --> 03:04:59,150
um did the automatic code generation
the increasing amount of that kind of

8388
03:04:59,150 --> 03:04:59,160
the increasing amount of that kind of
 

8389
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:01,550
the increasing amount of that kind of
capability are programmers

existence of stack overflow
 

8399
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:13,550

I don't think so it helps you take care

8400
03:05:13,550 --> 03:05:13,560
I don't think so it helps you take care
 

8401
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:16,490
I don't think so it helps you take care
of the boring stuff and you shouldn't

of the boring stuff and you shouldn't

python in the next 10 20 50 years 100
years you look forward you ever think

8446
03:06:16,969 --> 03:06:16,979
years you look forward you ever think
 

8447
03:06:16,979 --> 03:06:19,250
years you look forward you ever think
about you ever imagine a future

8448
03:06:19,250 --> 03:06:19,260
about you ever imagine a future
 

8449
03:06:19,260 --> 03:06:21,530
about you ever imagine a future
of human civilization or living inside

8450
03:06:21,530 --> 03:06:21,540
of human civilization or living inside
 

8451
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:23,570
of human civilization or living inside
the metaverse

8452
03:06:23,570 --> 03:06:23,580
the metaverse
 

8453
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:25,370
the metaverse
on Mars

8454
03:06:25,370 --> 03:06:25,380
on Mars
 

8455
03:06:25,380 --> 03:06:27,950
on Mars
humanoid robots everywhere what part

8456
03:06:27,950 --> 03:06:27,960
humanoid robots everywhere what part
 

8457
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:30,170
humanoid robots everywhere what part
does python play in that

8458
03:06:30,170 --> 03:06:30,180
does python play in that
 

8459
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:33,530
does python play in that
it'll eventually become sort of a legacy

8460
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:33,540
it'll eventually become sort of a legacy
 

8461
03:06:33,540 --> 03:06:36,889
it'll eventually become sort of a legacy
language uh that plays an important role

8462
03:06:36,889 --> 03:06:36,899
language uh that plays an important role
 

8463
03:06:36,899 --> 03:06:38,630
language uh that plays an important role
but that that most people have never

8464
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:38,640
but that that most people have never
 

8465
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:41,690
but that that most people have never
heard of and uh don't need to know about

8466
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:41,700
heard of and uh don't need to know about
 

8467
03:06:41,700 --> 03:06:43,010
heard of and uh don't need to know about
just like

8468
03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:43,020
just like
 

8469
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:45,110
just like
all kinds of

8470
03:06:45,110 --> 03:06:45,120
all kinds of
 

8471
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:48,170
all kinds of
basic structures in in

8472
03:06:48,170 --> 03:06:48,180
basic structures in in
 

8473
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:51,830
basic structures in in
biology like mitochondria

8474
03:06:51,830 --> 03:06:51,840
biology like mitochondria
 

8475
03:06:51,840 --> 03:06:54,769
biology like mitochondria
so it permeates all of life all of

8476
03:06:54,769 --> 03:06:54,779
so it permeates all of life all of
 

8477
03:06:54,779 --> 03:06:56,870
so it permeates all of life all of
digital life but people just build on

8478
03:06:56,870 --> 03:06:56,880
digital life but people just build on
 

8479
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:58,730
digital life but people just build on
top of it and they only know the stuff

8480
03:06:58,730 --> 03:06:58,740
top of it and they only know the stuff
 

8481
03:06:58,740 --> 03:07:01,070
top of it and they only know the stuff
that's on top of it yeah

8482
03:07:01,070 --> 03:07:01,080
that's on top of it yeah
 

8483
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:02,389
that's on top of it yeah
you guys you build layers of

8484
03:07:02,389 --> 03:07:02,399
you guys you build layers of
 

8485
03:07:02,399 --> 03:07:05,150
you guys you build layers of
abstractions I mean most programmers

8486
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:05,160
abstractions I mean most programmers
 

8487
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:06,590
abstractions I mean most programmers
nowadays

8488
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:06,600
nowadays
 

8489
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:10,309
nowadays
rarely need to do binary arithmetic

8490
03:07:10,309 --> 03:07:10,319
rarely need to do binary arithmetic
 

8491
03:07:10,319 --> 03:07:13,250
rarely need to do binary arithmetic
right

8492
03:07:13,250 --> 03:07:13,260

 

8493
03:07:13,260 --> 03:07:16,010

yeah or even think about it or even

8494
03:07:16,010 --> 03:07:16,020
yeah or even think about it or even
 

8495
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:18,410
yeah or even think about it or even
learn about it or they could go quite

8496
03:07:18,410 --> 03:07:18,420
learn about it or they could go quite
 

8497
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:21,370
learn about it or they could go quite
far without knowing I started

8498
03:07:21,370 --> 03:07:21,380
far without knowing I started
 

8499
03:07:21,380 --> 03:07:24,830
far without knowing I started
building little digital circuits out of

8500
03:07:24,830 --> 03:07:24,840
building little digital circuits out of
 

8501
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:27,349
building little digital circuits out of
nand gates that I built myself with

8502
03:07:27,349 --> 03:07:27,359
nand gates that I built myself with
 

8503
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:30,290
nand gates that I built myself with
transistors and resistors so I'd sort of

8504
03:07:30,290 --> 03:07:30,300
transistors and resistors so I'd sort of
 

8505
03:07:30,300 --> 03:07:33,349
transistors and resistors so I'd sort of
I feel very blessed that

8506
03:07:33,349 --> 03:07:33,359
I feel very blessed that
 

8507
03:07:33,359 --> 03:07:35,630
I feel very blessed that
with with that start when I was a

8508
03:07:35,630 --> 03:07:35,640
with with that start when I was a
 

8509
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:37,190
with with that start when I was a
teenager

8510
03:07:37,190 --> 03:07:37,200
teenager
 

8511
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:41,210
teenager
I I learned some of the basic at least

8512
03:07:41,210 --> 03:07:41,220
I I learned some of the basic at least
 

8513
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:42,889
I I learned some of the basic at least
Concepts

8514
03:07:42,889 --> 03:07:42,899
Concepts
 

8515
03:07:42,899 --> 03:07:46,250
Concepts
that that go into building a computer

8516
03:07:46,250 --> 03:07:46,260
that that go into building a computer
 

8517
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:49,969
that that go into building a computer
and I sort of every part

8518
03:07:49,969 --> 03:07:49,979
and I sort of every part
 

8519
03:07:49,979 --> 03:07:53,510
and I sort of every part
I have some understanding what

8520
03:07:53,510 --> 03:07:53,520
I have some understanding what
 

8521
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:56,330
I have some understanding what
what it's for and why it's there and how

8522
03:07:56,330 --> 03:07:56,340
what it's for and why it's there and how
 

8523
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:59,269
what it's for and why it's there and how
it works and I can forget about all that

8524
03:07:59,269 --> 03:07:59,279
it works and I can forget about all that
 

8525
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:01,969
it works and I can forget about all that
most of the time but I sort of

8526
03:08:01,969 --> 03:08:01,979
most of the time but I sort of
 

8527
03:08:01,979 --> 03:08:04,969
most of the time but I sort of
I enjoy knowing oh if you go deeper you

8528
03:08:04,969 --> 03:08:04,979
I enjoy knowing oh if you go deeper you
 

8529
03:08:04,979 --> 03:08:08,450
I enjoy knowing oh if you go deeper you
at some point you get to uh nand Gates

8530
03:08:08,450 --> 03:08:08,460
at some point you get to uh nand Gates
 

8531
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:13,010
at some point you get to uh nand Gates
and have others and shift registers and

8532
03:08:13,010 --> 03:08:13,020
and have others and shift registers and
 

8533
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:15,290
and have others and shift registers and
when it comes to the point of how do you

8534
03:08:15,290 --> 03:08:15,300
when it comes to the point of how do you
 

8535
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:17,269
when it comes to the point of how do you
how do you actually make a chip out of

8536
03:08:17,269 --> 03:08:17,279
how do you actually make a chip out of
 

8537
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:19,670
how do you actually make a chip out of
silicon I have no idea that's just magic

8538
03:08:19,670 --> 03:08:19,680
silicon I have no idea that's just magic
 

8539
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:20,929
silicon I have no idea that's just magic
to me

8540
03:08:20,929 --> 03:08:20,939
to me
 

8541
03:08:20,939 --> 03:08:23,090
to me
but you enjoy knowing that you can walk

8542
03:08:23,090 --> 03:08:23,100
but you enjoy knowing that you can walk
 

8543
03:08:23,100 --> 03:08:25,490
but you enjoy knowing that you can walk
a while towards the lower and lower

8544
03:08:25,490 --> 03:08:25,500
a while towards the lower and lower
 

8545
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:27,530
a while towards the lower and lower
layers but you don't need to

8546
03:08:27,530 --> 03:08:27,540
layers but you don't need to
 

8547
03:08:27,540 --> 03:08:30,950
layers but you don't need to
it's nice the other day as a sort of

8548
03:08:30,950 --> 03:08:30,960
it's nice the other day as a sort of
 

8549
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:33,469
it's nice the other day as a sort of
a mental exercise I was trying to figure

8550
03:08:33,469 --> 03:08:33,479
a mental exercise I was trying to figure
 

8551
03:08:33,479 --> 03:08:38,750
a mental exercise I was trying to figure
out if I could build a

8552
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:38,760

 

8553
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:43,370

a flip-flop circuit out of uh relays

8554
03:08:43,370 --> 03:08:43,380
a flip-flop circuit out of uh relays
 

8555
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:45,349
a flip-flop circuit out of uh relays
it was just sort of

8556
03:08:45,349 --> 03:08:45,359
it was just sort of
 

8557
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:48,170
it was just sort of
trying to remember oh how does it really

8558
03:08:48,170 --> 03:08:48,180
trying to remember oh how does it really
 

8559
03:08:48,180 --> 03:08:50,570
trying to remember oh how does it really
relay work yeah there's like this

8560
03:08:50,570 --> 03:08:50,580
relay work yeah there's like this
 

8561
03:08:50,580 --> 03:08:52,309
relay work yeah there's like this
electromagnetic

8562
03:08:52,309 --> 03:08:52,319
electromagnetic
 

8563
03:08:52,319 --> 03:08:56,110
electromagnetic
force that pulls a switch open or shut

8564
03:08:56,110 --> 03:08:56,120
force that pulls a switch open or shut
 

8565
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:59,030
force that pulls a switch open or shut
uh and you can have have like it can

8566
03:08:59,030 --> 03:08:59,040
uh and you can have have like it can
 

8567
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:01,670
uh and you can have have like it can
open one switch and another shut another

8568
03:09:01,670 --> 03:09:01,680
open one switch and another shut another
 

8569
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:03,830
open one switch and another shut another
and

8570
03:09:03,830 --> 03:09:03,840
and
 

8571
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:06,290
and
uh you can have multiple contacts that

8572
03:09:06,290 --> 03:09:06,300
uh you can have multiple contacts that
 

8573
03:09:06,300 --> 03:09:08,809
uh you can have multiple contacts that
go at once and how many relays do I

8574
03:09:08,809 --> 03:09:08,819
go at once and how many relays do I
 

8575
03:09:08,819 --> 03:09:11,570
go at once and how many relays do I
really need to sort of represent one bit

8576
03:09:11,570 --> 03:09:11,580
really need to sort of represent one bit
 

8577
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:14,090
really need to sort of represent one bit
of information can really just feed on

8578
03:09:14,090 --> 03:09:14,100
of information can really just feed on
 

8579
03:09:14,100 --> 03:09:17,269
of information can really just feed on
itself there was I don't think I I got

8580
03:09:17,269 --> 03:09:17,279
itself there was I don't think I I got
 

8581
03:09:17,279 --> 03:09:19,250
itself there was I don't think I I got
to the final solution but it was fun

8582
03:09:19,250 --> 03:09:19,260
to the final solution but it was fun
 

8583
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:21,110
to the final solution but it was fun
that I

8584
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:21,120
that I
 

8585
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:23,929
that I
I could still do a little bit of problem

8586
03:09:23,929 --> 03:09:23,939
I could still do a little bit of problem
 

8587
03:09:23,939 --> 03:09:26,809
I could still do a little bit of problem
solving and thinking at that level

8588
03:09:26,809 --> 03:09:26,819
solving and thinking at that level
 

8589
03:09:26,819 --> 03:09:28,730
solving and thinking at that level
and it's cool how we build on top of

8590
03:09:28,730 --> 03:09:28,740
and it's cool how we build on top of
 

8591
03:09:28,740 --> 03:09:30,769
and it's cool how we build on top of
each other so there's people that are

8592
03:09:30,769 --> 03:09:30,779
each other so there's people that are
 

8593
03:09:30,779 --> 03:09:33,170
each other so there's people that are
just you you stood on the shoulders of

8594
03:09:33,170 --> 03:09:33,180
just you you stood on the shoulders of
 

8595
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:34,849
just you you stood on the shoulders of
giants and there's others will stand on

8596
03:09:34,849 --> 03:09:34,859
giants and there's others will stand on
 

8597
03:09:34,859 --> 03:09:37,250
giants and there's others will stand on
your shoulders and it's it's a giant

8598
03:09:37,250 --> 03:09:37,260
your shoulders and it's it's a giant
 

8599
03:09:37,260 --> 03:09:39,710
your shoulders and it's it's a giant
beautiful hire yeah I feel I sort of

8600
03:09:39,710 --> 03:09:39,720
beautiful hire yeah I feel I sort of
 

8601
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:42,650
beautiful hire yeah I feel I sort of
cover covered this middle layer of the

8602
03:09:42,650 --> 03:09:42,660
cover covered this middle layer of the
 

8603
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:45,349
cover covered this middle layer of the
technology stack where and sort of

8604
03:09:45,349 --> 03:09:45,359
technology stack where and sort of
 

8605
03:09:45,359 --> 03:09:47,630
technology stack where and sort of
Peters out glow the

8606
03:09:47,630 --> 03:09:47,640
Peters out glow the
 

8607
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:50,929
Peters out glow the
the level of of nand gates

8608
03:09:50,929 --> 03:09:50,939
the level of of nand gates
 

8609
03:09:50,939 --> 03:09:54,290
the level of of nand gates
and at the at the top I sort of I lose

8610
03:09:54,290 --> 03:09:54,300
and at the at the top I sort of I lose
 

8611
03:09:54,300 --> 03:09:56,290
and at the at the top I sort of I lose
track when it gets to machine learning

8612
03:09:56,290 --> 03:09:56,300
track when it gets to machine learning
 

8613
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:58,670
track when it gets to machine learning
and then eventually the machine learning

8614
03:09:58,670 --> 03:09:58,680
and then eventually the machine learning
 

8615
03:09:58,680 --> 03:10:01,070
and then eventually the machine learning
will build higher and higher layers that

8616
03:10:01,070 --> 03:10:01,080
will build higher and higher layers that
 

8617
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:03,110
will build higher and higher layers that
will help us understand the lowest layer

8618
03:10:03,110 --> 03:10:03,120
will help us understand the lowest layer
 

8619
03:10:03,120 --> 03:10:05,929
will help us understand the lowest layer
of the physics and thereby the universe

8620
03:10:05,929 --> 03:10:05,939
of the physics and thereby the universe
 

8621
03:10:05,939 --> 03:10:08,210
of the physics and thereby the universe
figures out how

8622
03:10:08,210 --> 03:10:08,220
figures out how
 

8623
03:10:08,220 --> 03:10:12,410
figures out how
it itself Works maybe maybe not

8624
03:10:12,410 --> 03:10:12,420
it itself Works maybe maybe not
 

8625
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:15,290
it itself Works maybe maybe not
yeah I did I mean it's it's possible I

8626
03:10:15,290 --> 03:10:15,300
yeah I did I mean it's it's possible I
 

8627
03:10:15,300 --> 03:10:17,809
yeah I did I mean it's it's possible I
mean if you think of human consciousness

8628
03:10:17,809 --> 03:10:17,819
mean if you think of human consciousness
 

8629
03:10:17,819 --> 03:10:21,710
mean if you think of human consciousness
if that's even the right concept

8630
03:10:21,710 --> 03:10:21,720
if that's even the right concept
 

8631
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:24,590
if that's even the right concept
it's it's interesting that that sort of

8632
03:10:24,590 --> 03:10:24,600
it's it's interesting that that sort of
 

8633
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:27,830
it's it's interesting that that sort of
we have this super parallel brain that

8634
03:10:27,830 --> 03:10:27,840
we have this super parallel brain that
 

8635
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,210
we have this super parallel brain that
does all these

8636
03:10:29,210 --> 03:10:29,220
does all these
 

8637
03:10:29,220 --> 03:10:31,670
does all these
incredible parallel operations like

8638
03:10:31,670 --> 03:10:31,680
incredible parallel operations like
 

8639
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:33,290
incredible parallel operations like
image recognition

8640
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:33,300
image recognition
 

8641
03:10:33,300 --> 03:10:36,710
image recognition
I recognize your face does you huge

8642
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:36,720
I recognize your face does you huge
 

8643
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:39,530
I recognize your face does you huge
amount of processing that goes on in

8644
03:10:39,530 --> 03:10:39,540
amount of processing that goes on in
 

8645
03:10:39,540 --> 03:10:41,510
amount of processing that goes on in
parallel there's lots of nerves between

8646
03:10:41,510 --> 03:10:41,520
parallel there's lots of nerves between
 

8647
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,490
parallel there's lots of nerves between
my eyes and my brain

8648
03:10:43,490 --> 03:10:43,500
my eyes and my brain
 

8649
03:10:43,500 --> 03:10:45,110
my eyes and my brain
and the brain does a whole bunch of

8650
03:10:45,110 --> 03:10:45,120
and the brain does a whole bunch of
 

8651
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:47,090
and the brain does a whole bunch of
stuff all at once because it's actually

8652
03:10:47,090 --> 03:10:47,100
stuff all at once because it's actually
 

8653
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:49,490
stuff all at once because it's actually
a really slow circuits but there are

8654
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:49,500
a really slow circuits but there are
 

8655
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:52,370
a really slow circuits but there are
many of them that all work together

8656
03:10:52,370 --> 03:10:52,380
many of them that all work together
 

8657
03:10:52,380 --> 03:10:55,010
many of them that all work together
on the other hand when I'm speaking

8658
03:10:55,010 --> 03:10:55,020
on the other hand when I'm speaking
 

8659
03:10:55,020 --> 03:10:58,250
on the other hand when I'm speaking
everything is completely sequential

8660
03:10:58,250 --> 03:10:58,260
everything is completely sequential
 

8661
03:10:58,260 --> 03:11:01,250
everything is completely sequential
I I have to sort of string words

8662
03:11:01,250 --> 03:11:01,260
I I have to sort of string words
 

8663
03:11:01,260 --> 03:11:03,469
I I have to sort of string words
together one at a time

8664
03:11:03,469 --> 03:11:03,479
together one at a time
 

8665
03:11:03,479 --> 03:11:06,830
together one at a time
and when I'm thinking about stuff when

8666
03:11:06,830 --> 03:11:06,840
and when I'm thinking about stuff when
 

8667
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:09,830
and when I'm thinking about stuff when
I'm when I'm understanding the world

8668
03:11:09,830 --> 03:11:09,840
I'm when I'm understanding the world
 

8669
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:12,769
I'm when I'm understanding the world
I'm also thinking of everything like one

8670
03:11:12,769 --> 03:11:12,779
I'm also thinking of everything like one
 

8671
03:11:12,779 --> 03:11:15,469
I'm also thinking of everything like one
step at a time

8672
03:11:15,469 --> 03:11:15,479
step at a time
 

8673
03:11:15,479 --> 03:11:17,870
step at a time
and so we we've we've sort of we've got

8674
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:17,880
and so we we've we've sort of we've got
 

8675
03:11:17,880 --> 03:11:20,769
and so we we've we've sort of we've got
all this this incredible

8676
03:11:20,769 --> 03:11:20,779
all this this incredible
 

8677
03:11:20,779 --> 03:11:23,929
all this this incredible
parallel circuitry in our brains and

8678
03:11:23,929 --> 03:11:23,939
parallel circuitry in our brains and
 

8679
03:11:23,939 --> 03:11:27,230
parallel circuitry in our brains and
eventually we use that to simulate a

8680
03:11:27,230 --> 03:11:27,240
eventually we use that to simulate a
 

8681
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:30,950
eventually we use that to simulate a
single threaded much much higher level

8682
03:11:30,950 --> 03:11:30,960
single threaded much much higher level
 

8683
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:34,250
single threaded much much higher level
interpreter

8684
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,260

 

8685
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:36,230

uh it's exactly I mean that's the

8686
03:11:36,230 --> 03:11:36,240
uh it's exactly I mean that's the
 

8687
03:11:36,240 --> 03:11:38,330
uh it's exactly I mean that's the
illusion of it that's the illusion

8688
03:11:38,330 --> 03:11:38,340
illusion of it that's the illusion
 

8689
03:11:38,340 --> 03:11:40,429
illusion of it that's the illusion
of it for us that it's a single

8690
03:11:40,429 --> 03:11:40,439
of it for us that it's a single
 

8691
03:11:40,439 --> 03:11:43,309
of it for us that it's a single
sequential set of thoughts and all of

8692
03:11:43,309 --> 03:11:43,319
sequential set of thoughts and all of
 

8693
03:11:43,319 --> 03:11:45,769
sequential set of thoughts and all of
that came from a single cell through the

8694
03:11:45,769 --> 03:11:45,779
that came from a single cell through the
 

8695
03:11:45,779 --> 03:11:49,070
that came from a single cell through the
process of embryogenesis so DNA is the

8696
03:11:49,070 --> 03:11:49,080
process of embryogenesis so DNA is the
 

8697
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:50,809
process of embryogenesis so DNA is the
code

8698
03:11:50,809 --> 03:11:50,819
code
 

8699
03:11:50,819 --> 03:11:53,510
code
DNA holds the entirety of the code the

8700
03:11:53,510 --> 03:11:53,520
DNA holds the entirety of the code the
 

8701
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:55,610
DNA holds the entirety of the code the
information and how to use that

8702
03:11:55,610 --> 03:11:55,620
information and how to use that
 

8703
03:11:55,620 --> 03:11:58,130
information and how to use that
information to build up an organism the

8704
03:11:58,130 --> 03:11:58,140
information to build up an organism the
 

8705
03:11:58,140 --> 03:11:59,809
information to build up an organism the
entire like

8706
03:11:59,809 --> 03:11:59,819
entire like
 

8707
03:11:59,819 --> 03:12:02,929
entire like
the arms how is it built yeah the brain

8708
03:12:02,929 --> 03:12:02,939
the arms how is it built yeah the brain
 

8709
03:12:02,939 --> 03:12:05,090
the arms how is it built yeah the brain
it's so it's you don't buy a computer

8710
03:12:05,090 --> 03:12:05,100
it's so it's you don't buy a computer
 

8711
03:12:05,100 --> 03:12:08,929
it's so it's you don't buy a computer
you buy like uh you buy a a seed a

8712
03:12:08,929 --> 03:12:08,939
you buy like uh you buy a a seed a
 

8713
03:12:08,939 --> 03:12:11,349
you buy like uh you buy a a seed a
diagram and then you plant the computer

8714
03:12:11,349 --> 03:12:11,359
diagram and then you plant the computer
 

8715
03:12:11,359 --> 03:12:14,570
diagram and then you plant the computer
and it builds itself in almost the same

8716
03:12:14,570 --> 03:12:14,580
and it builds itself in almost the same
 

8717
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:17,929
and it builds itself in almost the same
way and then does the computation and

8718
03:12:17,929 --> 03:12:17,939
way and then does the computation and
 

8719
03:12:17,939 --> 03:12:21,410
way and then does the computation and
then is uh eventually dies

8720
03:12:21,410 --> 03:12:21,420
then is uh eventually dies
 

8721
03:12:21,420 --> 03:12:24,290
then is uh eventually dies
it gets stale but gives birth to Young

8722
03:12:24,290 --> 03:12:24,300
it gets stale but gives birth to Young
 

8723
03:12:24,300 --> 03:12:25,550
it gets stale but gives birth to Young
computers

8724
03:12:25,550 --> 03:12:25,560
computers
 

8725
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:27,830
computers
more and more and gives them lessons but

8726
03:12:27,830 --> 03:12:27,840
more and more and gives them lessons but
 

8727
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:29,690
more and more and gives them lessons but
they figure stuff out on their own and

8728
03:12:29,690 --> 03:12:29,700
they figure stuff out on their own and
 

8729
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:33,110
they figure stuff out on their own and
over time it goes on that way and those

8730
03:12:33,110 --> 03:12:33,120
over time it goes on that way and those
 

8731
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:35,510
over time it goes on that way and those
computers when they go to college try to

8732
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:35,520
computers when they go to college try to
 

8733
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:37,429
computers when they go to college try to
figure out how to program and they built

8734
03:12:37,429 --> 03:12:37,439
figure out how to program and they built
 

8735
03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:39,410
figure out how to program and they built
their own little computers they're

8736
03:12:39,410 --> 03:12:39,420
their own little computers they're
 

8737
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:40,550
their own little computers they're
increasingly more intelligent

8738
03:12:40,550 --> 03:12:40,560
increasingly more intelligent
 

8739
03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:43,010
increasingly more intelligent
increasingly higher and higher levels of

8740
03:12:43,010 --> 03:12:43,020
increasingly higher and higher levels of
 

8741
03:12:43,020 --> 03:12:45,650
increasingly higher and higher levels of
abstractions isn't it interesting that

8742
03:12:45,650 --> 03:12:45,660
abstractions isn't it interesting that
 

8743
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:48,650
abstractions isn't it interesting that
that you sort of you see the same thing

8744
03:12:48,650 --> 03:12:48,660
that you sort of you see the same thing
 

8745
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:51,349
that you sort of you see the same thing
appearing at different levels though

8746
03:12:51,349 --> 03:12:51,359
appearing at different levels though
 

8747
03:12:51,359 --> 03:12:54,790
appearing at different levels though
because you have like

8748
03:12:54,790 --> 03:12:54,800
because you have like
 

8749
03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:59,150
because you have like
cells that that create new cells

8750
03:12:59,150 --> 03:12:59,160
cells that that create new cells
 

8751
03:12:59,160 --> 03:13:01,849
cells that that create new cells
and and eventually that builds a whole

8752
03:13:01,849 --> 03:13:01,859
and and eventually that builds a whole
 

8753
03:13:01,859 --> 03:13:04,190
and and eventually that builds a whole
organism but then the animal or the

8754
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:04,200
organism but then the animal or the
 

8755
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:06,110
organism but then the animal or the
plant or the human

8756
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:06,120
plant or the human
 

8757
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:10,910
plant or the human
has its own mechanism of replication

8758
03:13:10,910 --> 03:13:10,920
has its own mechanism of replication
 

8759
03:13:10,920 --> 03:13:15,650
has its own mechanism of replication
that that is is sort of connected in a

8760
03:13:15,650 --> 03:13:15,660
that that is is sort of connected in a
 

8761
03:13:15,660 --> 03:13:17,990
that that is is sort of connected in a
very complicated way to the mechanism of

8762
03:13:17,990 --> 03:13:18,000
very complicated way to the mechanism of
 

8763
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,570
very complicated way to the mechanism of

8764
03:13:20,570 --> 03:13:20,580
replication of the cells and then if you
 

8765
03:13:20,580 --> 03:13:23,269
replication of the cells and then if you
if you look inside the cell if you see

8766
03:13:23,269 --> 03:13:23,279
if you look inside the cell if you see
 

8767
03:13:23,279 --> 03:13:26,690
if you look inside the cell if you see
how DNA and proteins are are connected

8768
03:13:26,690 --> 03:13:26,700
how DNA and proteins are are connected
 

8769
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,790
how DNA and proteins are are connected
then there is yet another completely

03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:28,800
then there is yet another completely
 

8771
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:32,210
then there is yet another completely
different mechanism whereby proteins are

8772
03:13:32,210 --> 03:13:32,220
different mechanism whereby proteins are
 

8773
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:34,389
different mechanism whereby proteins are
mass produced

8774
03:13:34,389 --> 03:13:34,399
mass produced
 

8775
03:13:34,399 --> 03:13:37,969
mass produced
using enzymes and and and a little bit

8776
03:13:37,969 --> 03:13:37,979
using enzymes and and and a little bit
 

8777
03:13:37,979 --> 03:13:40,309
using enzymes and and and a little bit
of code from from DNA and of course

8778
03:13:40,309 --> 03:13:40,319
of code from from DNA and of course
 

8779
03:13:40,319 --> 03:13:44,030
of code from from DNA and of course
viruses break into it at that level

8780
03:13:44,030 --> 03:13:44,040
viruses break into it at that level
 

8781
03:13:44,040 --> 03:13:46,490
viruses break into it at that level
and while the mechanisms might be

8782
03:13:46,490 --> 03:13:46,500
and while the mechanisms might be
 

8783
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:49,429
and while the mechanisms might be
different it seems like the nature of

8784
03:13:49,429 --> 03:13:49,439
different it seems like the nature of
 

8785
03:13:49,439 --> 03:13:52,550
different it seems like the nature of
the mechanism is the same and it carries

8786
03:13:52,550 --> 03:13:52,560
the mechanism is the same and it carries
 

8787
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:56,030
the mechanism is the same and it carries
across natural languages and programming

uh maybe even human civilizations or

uh maybe even human civilizations or
 

8795
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:03,410
uh maybe even human civilizations or

and then all the way down to uh the

8799
