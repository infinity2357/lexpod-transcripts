the right decisions to uh to to to
 

485
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,910
the right decisions to uh to to to

487
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,590
restore safety but also to potentially
create uh a better Paradigm uh for peace

that the Palestinian people in Gaza are

560
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
that the Palestinian people in Gaza are
 

561
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,990
that the Palestinian people in Gaza are
essentially hostages in uh in Gaza you

562
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,000
essentially hostages in uh in Gaza you
 

563
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,350
essentially hostages in uh in Gaza you
have basically 2. you know two million

564
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,189
and just finally what I would say is you
know what we saw with Hamas was that if

590
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:28,199
know what we saw with Hamas was that if
 

591
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:31,350
know what we saw with Hamas was that if
you go back to 2007 they basically had

592
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
you go back to 2007 they basically had
 

593
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,189
you go back to 2007 they basically had
just one plan that they did over and

594
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:33,199
just one plan that they did over and
 

595
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,990
just one plan that they did over and
over and you know we were very careful

596
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,000
over and you know we were very careful
 

597
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,230
over and you know we were very careful
to try to monitor very closely and stop

598
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,240
to try to monitor very closely and stop
 

599

the Iranian money and the resources from
 

601
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,910
the Iranian money and the resources from
coming in and again we took a little bit

602
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
coming in and again we took a little bit
 

603
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,069
coming in and again we took a little bit
of criticism from the International

604
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:43,079
of criticism from the International
 

605
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,389

Community from keeping the Border tight
but unfortunately every time you'd allow

608
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,560
but unfortunately every time you'd allow
 

609
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,310
but unfortunately every time you'd allow
construction materials to go into Gaza

610
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,320
construction materials to go into Gaza
 

611
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,670

they'd use them to build tunnels not
 

613
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,790

homes you would have equipment that
 

615
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,350
homes you would have equipment that
would come in to build pipes they turn

616
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
would come in to build pipes they turn

it into bombs so um it was very very
 

619

this focus on destruction and
Annihilation but uh you saw this in 2015

Annihilation but uh you saw this in 2015
 

679
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,310
Annihilation but uh you saw this in 2015
2016 when the Iranian government had

680
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,320
2016 when the Iranian government had
 

681
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,350
2016 when the Iranian government had
resources the region was less safe and

682
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,360
resources the region was less safe and
 

683
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,870
resources the region was less safe and
since you know now uh there's been more

684
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
since you know now uh there's been more
 

685
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,870
since you know now uh there's been more
resources allowed to go to the Iranian

686
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
resources allowed to go to the Iranian
 

687
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,189
resources allowed to go to the Iranian
regime uh by lack of enforcement of

688
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
regime uh by lack of enforcement of
 

689
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,430
regime uh by lack of enforcement of
sanctions and as a result Iran is

690
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
sanctions and as a result Iran is
 

691
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,230
sanctions and as a result Iran is
funding Hezbollah Hamas um they were

692
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240

693
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,470
funding Hezbollah Hamas um they were
funding the houthis now there's a little

694
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,480
funding the houthis now there's a little
 

695
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,389
funding the houthis now there's a little
bit of a Daton between Saudi and Iran

696
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:23,399
bit of a Daton between Saudi and Iran
 

697
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,670
bit of a Daton between Saudi and Iran
which has led to that going down which

698
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,680
which has led to that going down which
 

699
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,949
which has led to that going down which
only further proves that Iran was behind

700
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
only further proves that Iran was behind
 

701
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,389
only further proves that Iran was behind
the houthis which is what the Saudis had

702
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
the houthis which is what the Saudis had
 

703
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,949
the houthis which is what the Saudis had
been saying for years and Iran was

704
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:29,959
been saying for years and Iran was
 

705
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,949
been saying for years and Iran was
denying so there's a very strong um

706
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
denying so there's a very strong um
 

707
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,550
denying so there's a very strong um
relationship between the two and we

708
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:35,560
relationship between the two and we
 

709
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,389

directly it's usually through its
 

715
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,110
directly it's usually through its
proxies and in this case Hamas has been

716
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,120
proxies and in this case Hamas has been
 

717
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,269
proxies and in this case Hamas has been
a proxy for Iran who wanted to obviously

a proxy for Iran who wanted to obviously
 

719

a proxy for Iran who wanted to obviously
see the destruction of Israel but also

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
flood referring to the aloa mosque how
 

731
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,749

00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:06,759
much of this attack is about the alaa
 

733
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,670
much of this attack is about the alaa
mosque in actuality I don't think any of

734
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
mosque in actuality I don't think any of
 

735
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,670
mosque in actuality I don't think any of

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,189
something that uh all of the uh Shia
jihadists have used for years in order

740
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
jihadists have used for years in order
 

741
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,550
jihadists have used for years in order
to justify their actions that are

742
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:21,560
to justify their actions that are
 

743
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,189
to justify their actions that are
aggressive towards Israel so uh this is

744
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:24,199
aggressive towards Israel so uh this is
 

745
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,790
aggressive towards Israel so uh this is
something I'll maybe even take a step

746
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:25,800
something I'll maybe even take a step
 

747
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,030
something I'll maybe even take a step
back and go through when I was working

748
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,040
back and go through when I was working
 

749
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,990
back and go through when I was working
uh initially in my first year on the

you know the conclusion of a problem set
is essentially the beginning of a new

1110
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
is essentially the beginning of a new
 

1111
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,549
is essentially the beginning of a new
paradigm so when I would think about how

1112
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
paradigm so when I would think about how
 

1113
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,269
paradigm so when I would think about how
do you how do you move pieces around the

1114
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:07,279
do you how do you move pieces around the
 

1115
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,950
do you how do you move pieces around the
board you couldn't say let me just solve

1116
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
board you couldn't say let me just solve
 

1117
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,590
board you couldn't say let me just solve
the problem you have to think about what

1118
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:10,600
the problem you have to think about what
 

1119
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,990
the problem you have to think about what
happens the day after the signing and

1120
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,000
happens the day after the signing and
 

1121
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,830
happens the day after the signing and
how do you create a paradigm that has

1122
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:14,840
how do you create a paradigm that has
 

1123
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,230
how do you create a paradigm that has
positivity to it so uh the biggest piece

1124
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
positivity to it so uh the biggest piece
 

1125
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,029
positivity to it so uh the biggest piece

the next evening the sun set and things
 

1161
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,070
the next evening the sun set and things
moved on and so by doing that what

1162
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
moved on and so by doing that what
 

1163
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,750
moved on and so by doing that what
president Trump did was he he

1164
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
president Trump did was he he
 

1165
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,350

slaughtered a lot of the Sacred cows of
 

1167
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,430
slaughtered a lot of the Sacred cows of
these these false barriers that people

1168
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,440
these these false barriers that people
 

1169
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,390
these these false barriers that people
had erected and showed people that the

1170
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,400
had erected and showed people that the
 

1171
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,830
had erected and showed people that the
vast majority of the people in the

1172
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840
vast majority of the people in the
 

1173
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,149
vast majority of the people in the
Middle East whether they're Jewish

1174
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
Middle East whether they're Jewish
 

1175
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,190
Middle East whether they're Jewish
Muslim Christian whatever religion they

1176
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,200
Muslim Christian whatever religion they
 

1177
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,789
Muslim Christian whatever religion they
are they just want to live better lives

1178
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
are they just want to live better lives
 

1179
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,110
are they just want to live better lives
and so what we basically did was create

1180
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
and so what we basically did was create
 

1181
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,710
and so what we basically did was create
a paradigm where the voices for peace

1182
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
a paradigm where the voices for peace
 

1183
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,430
a paradigm where the voices for peace
the voices for together now finally had

1184
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
the voices for together now finally had
 

1185
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,190
the voices for together now finally had
a forum in where they were able to do it

1186
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,200
a forum in where they were able to do it
 

1187
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,750
a forum in where they were able to do it
and we did that in the backdrop the way

1188
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
and we did that in the backdrop the way
 

1189
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,390
and we did that in the backdrop the way
we're able to be successful was we

1190
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:31,400
we're able to be successful was we
 

1191
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,029
we're able to be successful was we
severely limited the resources of Iran

1192
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:34,039
severely limited the resources of Iran
 

1193
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,070
severely limited the resources of Iran
and they were focused more internally

1194
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
and they were focused more internally
 

1195
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,990
and they were focused more internally
and they couldn't cause the trouble that

1196
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
and they couldn't cause the trouble that
 

1197
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,990
and they couldn't cause the trouble that
they were causing everywhere else since

1198
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
they were causing everywhere else since
 

1199
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,590
they were causing everywhere else since
we've left obviously the Dynamics have

1200
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
we've left obviously the Dynamics have
 

1201
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,149
we've left obviously the Dynamics have
changed but um the the way you get to

1202
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
changed but um the the way you get to
 

1203
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,190
changed but um the the way you get to
peace is obviously number one through

1204
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,200
peace is obviously number one through
 

1205
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,029
peace is obviously number one through
strength and number two by finding a way

1206
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
strength and number two by finding a way
 

1207
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,549
strength and number two by finding a way
for people to be better off tomorrow

1208
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:51,559
for people to be better off tomorrow
 

1209
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,669
for people to be better off tomorrow
than they are today and what I found was

1210
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:54,679
than they are today and what I found was
 

1211
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,390
than they are today and what I found was
that most of the voices looking for

1212
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
that most of the voices looking for
 

1213
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,230
that most of the voices looking for
violence or trouble were people who were

you had to figure out where do you put
borders ultimately uh you had a security

borders ultimately uh you had a security
 

1263
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,950
borders ultimately uh you had a security
uh Paradigm which I was much more

1264
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:57,960
uh Paradigm which I was much more
 

1265
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,389
uh Paradigm which I was much more
favorable to Israel's perspective on uh

1266
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:00,399
favorable to Israel's perspective on uh
 

1267
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,430
favorable to Israel's perspective on uh
and obviously the events of the past 48

1268
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:02,440
and obviously the events of the past 48
 

1269
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,710
and obviously the events of the past 48
Hours have fully Justified that um that

1270
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:05,720
Hours have fully Justified that um that
 

1271
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,630
Hours have fully Justified that um that
that that bias um and then uh in

1272
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
that that bias um and then uh in
 

1273
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,590
that that bias um and then uh in
addition to that you had to deal with

1274
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
addition to that you had to deal with
 

1275
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,950
addition to that you had to deal with
the religious sites but I felt

1276
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
the religious sites but I felt
 

1277
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,590
the religious sites but I felt
operationally that wasn't actually as

1278
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:12,600
operationally that wasn't actually as
 

1279
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,389
operationally that wasn't actually as
complicated as people made it because

1280
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:14,399
complicated as people made it because
 

1281
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,149
complicated as people made it because
you wanted to just leave it open for

1282
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
you wanted to just leave it open for
 

1283
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,750
you wanted to just leave it open for
everybody then I went through and I I

1284
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:18,760
everybody then I went through and I I
 

1285
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,870
everybody then I went through and I I
felt that the Palestinian leadership was

1286
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
felt that the Palestinian leadership was
 

1287
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,389
felt that the Palestinian leadership was
fairly disincentivized to make a deal

1288
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:23,399
fairly disincentivized to make a deal
 

1289
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,990
fairly disincentivized to make a deal
because there was just this Paradigm

1290
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
because there was just this Paradigm
 

1291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,029
because there was just this Paradigm
where for they had been millions of

1292
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:28,039
where for they had been millions of
 

1293
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,430
where for they had been millions of
dollars coming in from the International

dollars coming in from the International
 

1295
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,389
dollars coming in from the International
Community and I think that they feared

1296
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:31,399
Community and I think that they feared
 

1297
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,549
Community and I think that they feared
that if they made a deal they would lose

1298
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:33,559
that if they made a deal they would lose
 

1299
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,590
that if they made a deal they would lose
their relevancy internationally and the

1300
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
their relevancy internationally and the
 

1301
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,389
their relevancy internationally and the
money would stop flowing into the

1302
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:37,399
money would stop flowing into the
 

1303
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:40,070
money would stop flowing into the

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
country so what I tried to do is to say
 

1305
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,750
country so what I tried to do is to say
you know my my Approach when I would get

1306
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
you know my my Approach when I would get
 

1307
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,029
you know my my Approach when I would get
into a hard problem say how do I

1308
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:44,039
into a hard problem say how do I
 

1309
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,110
into a hard problem say how do I
understand all the different Escape

1310

are things I was saying you know three

1534
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
are things I was saying you know three
 

1535
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,470
are things I was saying you know three
four years ago uh that that was the

1536
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,480
four years ago uh that that was the
 

1537
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,509
four years ago uh that that was the
objective and that was really the fear

1538
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:47,519
objective and that was really the fear
 

1539
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,590
objective and that was really the fear
now that's been proven you know

1540
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
now that's been proven you know
 

1541
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,590
now that's been proven you know
unfortunately the fear has has

1542
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
unfortunately the fear has has
 

1543
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,909
unfortunately the fear has has
manifested um and in exchange you can

1544
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
manifested um and in exchange you can
 

1545
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,029
manifested um and in exchange you can
rebuild the place and you can give the

1546
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:56,039
rebuild the place and you can give the
 

1547
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,350
rebuild the place and you can give the
people a much better life but Hamas has

1548
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,360
people a much better life but Hamas has
 

1549
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,190
people a much better life but Hamas has
not shown a desire for that or a

1550
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,200
not shown a desire for that or a
 

1551
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,750
not shown a desire for that or a
capability for that and I don't think

1552
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
capability for that and I don't think
 

1553
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,830
capability for that and I don't think
there's enough trust to allow them to do

1554
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
there's enough trust to allow them to do

there's enough trust to allow them to do
that which is why you know under the

to do with that and that's why they've

1850
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:22,359
to do with that and that's why they've
 

1851
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,990
to do with that and that's why they've
been working to disrupt so I think the

incredibly stable situation with
 

1857
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,069
incredibly stable situation with
momentum I think they

1858
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
momentum I think they
 

1859
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,030
momentum I think they
underestimated um the uh the the way

1860

underestimated um the uh the the way
that Iran would approach the region to

1865
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,790
undermine I think they gave way too much
rope to Iran and I think that they

1866
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
rope to Iran and I think that they
 

1867
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,310
rope to Iran and I think that they
didn't seize when they had an

1868
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
didn't seize when they had an
 

1869
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,630
didn't seize when they had an
opportunity of strength with the

the number I saw last year I think under

2040
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:51,079
the number I saw last year I think under
 

2041
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,589
the number I saw last year I think under
Trump the number was maybe like four or

2042
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:52,599
Trump the number was maybe like four or
 

2043
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,950
Trump the number was maybe like four or
five billion dollars of oil revenue and

2044
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:54,960
five billion dollars of oil revenue and
 

2045
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,230
five billion dollars of oil revenue and
in total I think last year it was

2046
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,240
in total I think last year it was
 

2047
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,870
in total I think last year it was
something like $45 billion in Revenue

2048
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:58,880
something like $45 billion in Revenue
 

2049
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,150
something like $45 billion in Revenue
this year I think it'll be even more

2050
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,160
this year I think it'll be even more
 

2051
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,630
this year I think it'll be even more
that's a combination of them driving up

2052
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:01,640
that's a combination of them driving up
 

2053
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,109
that's a combination of them driving up
oil prices but also allowing much more

2054
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:04,119
oil prices but also allowing much more
 

2055
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,270
oil prices but also allowing much more
sales uh you would think that they would

2056
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,280

2057
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,030
sales uh you would think that they would
find a way to get them to behave and

2058
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,040
find a way to get them to behave and
 

2059
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,790
find a way to get them to behave and
allow them to to have this happen or if

2060
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
allow them to to have this happen or if
 

2061
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,950
allow them to to have this happen or if
that's not the case then be tough go

2062
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
that's not the case then be tough go
 

2063
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,630
that's not the case then be tough go
back to being tough that's what you have

2064
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
back to being tough that's what you have
 

2065
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,150
back to being tough that's what you have
to do building off of Abraham Accords as

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,160
to do building off of Abraham Accords as

normalization there's been a lot of

2070
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:21,880
normalization there's been a lot of
 

2071
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,510
normalization there's been a lot of
promising progress towards this what

2072
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
promising progress towards this what
 

2073
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,589
promising progress towards this what
does it take to uh not allow this

2074

does it take to uh not allow this
 

2075
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,790
does it take to uh not allow this
tragedy uh damage the progress towards

Israel solity normalization I think

2078
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
Israel solity normalization I think
 

2079
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,589
Israel solity normalization I think
right now it's probably not the best to

2080
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:36,599
right now it's probably not the best to
 

2081
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,069
right now it's probably not the best to
think about that I think that we want to

2082
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,079
think about that I think that we want to
 

2083
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,550
think about that I think that we want to
think about that after whatever is going

2084
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
think about that after whatever is going
 

2085
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,150
think about that after whatever is going
to happen is going to happen now I think

2086
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,160
to happen is going to happen now I think
 

2087
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,910
to happen is going to happen now I think
right now the number one priority for

2088
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
right now the number one priority for
 

2089
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,510
right now the number one priority for
Israel has to be to uh fully regain uh

2090
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
Israel has to be to uh fully regain uh

two is to figure out how you can like I

2094

said eliminate or degrade uh the Hamas

2096
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839

2097
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,349
said eliminate or degrade uh the Hamas
capability or other Iranian threats to

apparatus I think that the Israeli

2102
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:00,839
apparatus I think that the Israeli
 

2103
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,630
apparatus I think that the Israeli
leadership right now should proceed uh

2104
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:03,640
leadership right now should proceed uh
 

2105
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,910
leadership right now should proceed uh
with that and I don't think that they

2106
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:04,920
with that and I don't think that they
 

2107
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,069
with that and I don't think that they
should be thinking about normalization

2108
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:07,079
should be thinking about normalization
 

2109
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,309
should be thinking about normalization
with Saudi at this moment um my instinct

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,990
still people on the US side picking up
the phone and

2226
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000

2231
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,870
human beings as friends as allies and
just keeping that channel communication

2232
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
just keeping that channel communication
 

2233
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,870
just keeping that channel communication
going cuz I uh maybe you can correct me

2234
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:17,880
going cuz I uh maybe you can correct me
 

2235
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,390
going cuz I uh maybe you can correct me
but I just feel like there's just simple

2236
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:21,400
but I just feel like there's just simple
 

2237
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,390
but I just feel like there's just simple
human dynamics that play out here the

2238
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
human dynamics that play out here the
 

2239
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,790
human dynamics that play out here the
divisions can form and just run away

2240
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:26,800
divisions can form and just run away
 

2241
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,790
divisions can form and just run away
from you over simple

2242
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,800
from you over simple
 

2243
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,430
from you over simple
misunderstandings over

2244
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,440
misunderstandings over
 

2245
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,950
misunderstandings over
um just inability to see a

2246
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:35,960
um just inability to see a
 

2247
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,670
um just inability to see a
tragedy uh from the same perspective

2248
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,680
tragedy uh from the same perspective
 

2249
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,510
tragedy uh from the same perspective
because of conversations that could have

2250
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,520
because of conversations that could have
 

2251
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,390
because of conversations that could have
happened but didn't happen I think

2252
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
happened but didn't happen I think
 

2253
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,190
happened but didn't happen I think
there'll definitely be communication but

2254
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,200
there'll definitely be communication but
 

2255
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,589
there'll definitely be communication but
you know words on phone calls is is only

2256
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:48,599
you know words on phone calls is is only
 

2257
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,870
you know words on phone calls is is only
worth so much it's really you know trust

2258
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
worth so much it's really you know trust
 

2259
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,150
worth so much it's really you know trust
between people and power and obviously

2260
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,160
between people and power and obviously
 

2261
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,309
between people and power and obviously
when you're in a position of power you

2262
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:55,319
when you're in a position of power you
 

2263
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:56,670
when you're in a position of power you
represent your country country and your

2264
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:56,680
represent your country country and your
 

2265
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,190
represent your country country and your
country's interests but the ability to

2266
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,200
country's interests but the ability to
 

2267
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,990
country's interests but the ability to
have trusting relationships where people

2268
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
have trusting relationships where people
 

2269
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,829
have trusting relationships where people
feel like they're okay taking you know

feel like they're okay taking you know
 

2271
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,430
feel like they're okay taking you know
more risks to help each other uh that's

2272
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:06,440
more risks to help each other uh that's
 

2273
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,150
more risks to help each other uh that's
actually what's most important so

2274
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,160
actually what's most important so
 

2275
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,589
actually what's most important so
communication I hope for but uh you know

2276
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:10,599
communication I hope for but uh you know
 

2277
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,030
communication I hope for but uh you know
deepening and trusting relationships uh

2278
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
deepening and trusting relationships uh
 

2279
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,190
deepening and trusting relationships uh
that's what I believe makes progress and

2280
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,200
that's what I believe makes progress and
 

2281
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,430
that's what I believe makes progress and
keeps people

2282
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:16,440
keeps people
 

2283
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,190
keeps people
safe and we talk quite extensively about

2284
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
safe and we talk quite extensively about
 

2285
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,230
safe and we talk quite extensively about
the value of trust and negotiation and

2286
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:21,240
the value of trust and negotiation and
 

2287
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,190
the value of trust and negotiation and
just working with leaders which I think

2288
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,200
just working with leaders which I think
 

2289
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,109
just working with leaders which I think
is a fascinating conversation and you've

2290
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
is a fascinating conversation and you've
 

2291
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,030
is a fascinating conversation and you've
taught me a lot about that

2292
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
taught me a lot about that
 

2293
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,030
taught me a lot about that
let me ask you about the end here what

2294
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,040
let me ask you about the end here what
 

2295
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,630
let me ask you about the end here what
are the various trajectories this war

2296
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
are the various trajectories this war
 

2297
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,950
are the various trajectories this war
can take in your view uh what are some

2298
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:35,960
can take in your view uh what are some
 

2299
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,870
can take in your view uh what are some
of the end States as you've said which

2300
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
of the end States as you've said which
 

2301
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,109
of the end States as you've said which
are

2302
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:40,119
are
 

2303
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,069
are
desirable and are

2304
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:43,079
desirable and are
 

2305
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,190
desirable and are
achievable I I mentioned this earlier

2306
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
achievable I I mentioned this earlier
 

2307
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,750
achievable I I mentioned this earlier
but whenever I would get a problem set

2308
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:46,760
but whenever I would get a problem set
 

2309
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,390
but whenever I would get a problem set
in government I'd always think through

2310
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,400
in government I'd always think through
 

2311
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,630
in government I'd always think through
from a first principles perspective

2312
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
from a first principles perspective
 

2313
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,750
from a first principles perspective
what's the logical outcome right and

2314
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:52,760
what's the logical outcome right and
 

2315
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,069
what's the logical outcome right and
forget about all the reasons why it

2316
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
forget about all the reasons why it
 

2317
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,349
forget about all the reasons why it
can't happen that's what everyone in

2318
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
can't happen that's what everyone in
 

2319
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,630
can't happen that's what everyone in
governments always rush to talk about

2320
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:57,640
governments always rush to talk about
 

2321
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,870
governments always rush to talk about
but I do think here number one Israel

2322
00:43:59,870 --> 00:43:59,880
but I do think here number one Israel
 

2323
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,589
but I do think here number one Israel
has to have a secure environment where

2324
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
has to have a secure environment where
 

2325
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,109
has to have a secure environment where
they don't feel threatened from uh from

2326
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
they don't feel threatened from uh from
 

2327
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,309
they don't feel threatened from uh from
from Gaza and number two is the people

2328
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:07,319
from Gaza and number two is the people
 

2329
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,390
from Gaza and number two is the people
in Gaza need to have an environment

2330
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:09,400
in Gaza need to have an environment
 

2331
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,030
in Gaza need to have an environment
where they feel uh like they can live a

2332
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,040
where they feel uh like they can live a
 

2333
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,230
where they feel uh like they can live a
better life and have opportunities so

2334
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
better life and have opportunities so
 

2335
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,790
better life and have opportunities so
that's the end State and so I think that

2336
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
that's the end State and so I think that
 

2337
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,670
that's the end State and so I think that
the International Community should come

2338
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:18,680
the International Community should come
 

2339
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,829
the International Community should come
together I do think that uh the people

2340
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:20,839
together I do think that uh the people
 

2341
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,030
together I do think that uh the people
who are usually putting blame on Israel

2342
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
who are usually putting blame on Israel
 

2343
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,270
who are usually putting blame on Israel
should now realize that maybe they've

2344
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
should now realize that maybe they've
 

2345
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,270
should now realize that maybe they've
been a little bit of harsh here and that

2346
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
been a little bit of harsh here and that
 

2347

framework that we believe can be a

2380
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:08,960
framework that we believe can be a
 

2381
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,190
framework that we believe can be a
long-term solution where the Palestinian

2382
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
long-term solution where the Palestinian
 

2383
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,030
long-term solution where the Palestinian
people really have a chance to live a

better life that's really the best way
 

2387
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,030
better life that's really the best way
to get there there's tons of complicated

2388
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,040
to get there there's tons of complicated
 

2389
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,190
to get there there's tons of complicated
factors uh but that's the end state that

2390
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
factors uh but that's the end state that
 

2391
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,230
factors uh but that's the end state that
the global Community should be looking

2392
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,240
the global Community should be looking
 

2393
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,870
the global Community should be looking
to come together and it's very

2394
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
to come together and it's very
 

2395
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,589
to come together and it's very
achievable it's very very achievable so

2396
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
achievable it's very very achievable so
 

2397
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,829
achievable it's very very achievable so
there's uh as we stand here today

2398
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
there's uh as we stand here today
 

2399
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,430
there's uh as we stand here today
there's a lot of different ways that

2400
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:29,440
there's a lot of different ways that
 

2401
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,990
there's a lot of different ways that
this war can evolve if a ground Invasion

2402
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
this war can evolve if a ground Invasion
 

2403
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,430
this war can evolve if a ground Invasion
happens uh by Israeli forces of Gaza and

2404
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
happens uh by Israeli forces of Gaza and
 

2405
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,910
happens uh by Israeli forces of Gaza and
if the number is correct of 100,000

2406
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
if the number is correct of 100,000
 

2407
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,910
if the number is correct of 100,000
Israeli soldiers do you worry about

2408
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:42,920
Israeli soldiers do you worry about
 

2409
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,349
Israeli soldiers do you worry about
various trajectories that can take uh of

2410
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:45,359
various trajectories that can take uh of
 

2411
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,510
various trajectories that can take uh of
the consequences that might have of of

2412
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
the consequences that might have of of
 

2413
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,470
the consequences that might have of of
an

2414
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
an
 

2415
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,470
an
unprecedented ground troop attack yeah

2416
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:51,480
unprecedented ground troop attack yeah
 

2417
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,430
unprecedented ground troop attack yeah
so I think as a leader you know you

2418
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
so I think as a leader you know you
 

2419
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,109
so I think as a leader you know you
can't change yesterday but you have the

2420
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:56,119
can't change yesterday but you have the
 

2421
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,430
can't change yesterday but you have the
ability to change tomorrow and that's a

2422
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:58,440
ability to change tomorrow and that's a
 

2423
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,990
ability to change tomorrow and that's a
very important uh fundamental I mean

2424
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:01,000
very important uh fundamental I mean
 

2425
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,309
very important uh fundamental I mean
that that's true for all of us not just

2426
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
that that's true for all of us not just
 

2427
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,829
that that's true for all of us not just
leaders but you know we saw with uh with

2428
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:04,839
leaders but you know we saw with uh with
 

2429
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:08,109
leaders but you know we saw with uh with
911 how America was caught off guard uh

2430
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:08,119
911 how America was caught off guard uh
 

2431
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,430
911 how America was caught off guard uh
by terrorist attack we acted um you know

2432
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
by terrorist attack we acted um you know
 

2433
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,870
by terrorist attack we acted um you know
somewhat rationally somewhat emotionally

2434
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:13,880
somewhat rationally somewhat emotionally
 

2435
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,150
somewhat rationally somewhat emotionally
uh which led to a 20-year war with

2436
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
uh which led to a 20-year war with
 

2437
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,430
uh which led to a 20-year war with
trillions of dollars lost you know that

2438
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:18,440
trillions of dollars lost you know that
 

2439
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,589
trillions of dollars lost you know that
I think almost a million lives lost not

2440
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:20,599
I think almost a million lives lost not
 

2441
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:23,069
I think almost a million lives lost not
just American but all lives and it was a

2442
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:23,079
just American but all lives and it was a
 

2443
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,549
just American but all lives and it was a
total tragedy what occurred um I think

2444
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:25,559
total tragedy what occurred um I think
 

2445
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,829
total tragedy what occurred um I think
right now the Temptation is to to be

2446
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
right now the Temptation is to to be
 

2447
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,549
right now the Temptation is to to be
strong I think that that's that's a

2448
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:29,559
strong I think that that's that's a
 

2449
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,230
strong I think that that's that's a
necessity I do think eliminating risk is

2450
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
necessity I do think eliminating risk is
 

2451
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,829
necessity I do think eliminating risk is
the right objective I think the goal

2452
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:33,839
the right objective I think the goal
 

2453
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,309
the right objective I think the goal
should be to stay very clear about what

2454
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:35,319
should be to stay very clear about what
 

2455
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:38,230
should be to stay very clear about what
the objective is but also um this attack

2456
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
the objective is but also um this attack
 

2457
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,349
the objective is but also um this attack
was very well planned uh not to walk

2458
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:40,359
was very well planned uh not to walk
 

2459
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,990
was very well planned uh not to walk
into another trap I think you have to be

2460
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
into another trap I think you have to be
 

2461
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,790
into another trap I think you have to be
very smart very cautious I've been happy

2462
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:43,800
very smart very cautious I've been happy
 

2463
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,109
very smart very cautious I've been happy
to see that uh what they've been doing

2464
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:46,119
to see that uh what they've been doing
 

2465
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,670
to see that uh what they've been doing
uh in retaliation so far has been uh

2466
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:48,680
uh in retaliation so far has been uh
 

2467
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,990
uh in retaliation so far has been uh
somewhat measured and they've taken

2468
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
somewhat measured and they've taken
 

2469
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,150
somewhat measured and they've taken
their time to try to assess uh what's

2470
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,160
their time to try to assess uh what's
 

2471
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,870
their time to try to assess uh what's
achievable again I don't have access to

2472
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:53,880
achievable again I don't have access to
 

2473
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,470
achievable again I don't have access to
the intelligence and you know we're

militarily and I don't think he wants to
 

2573
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,670
militarily and I don't think he wants to
see his legacy

be somebody who left Israel more

2576

2579
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,710
vulnerable than it had to be so I think
in that regard he'll be incredibly

2580

in that regard he'll be incredibly
 

2581
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,270
in that regard he'll be incredibly
strong but I also think that he'll

2582
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:07,280
strong but I also think that he'll
 

2583
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,950

that he takes um and not um create more
 

2587

that he takes um and not um create more
risk than than needed and that's easy to

2588
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:14,440
risk than than needed and that's easy to

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,670
and you have a very vibrant democracy
with that being said you know the times

2656
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
with that being said you know the times
 

2657
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,069
with that being said you know the times
in Jewish history where the Jewish

2658
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
in Jewish history where the Jewish
 

2659
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,750
in Jewish history where the Jewish
people have been most vulnerable have

2660
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:39,760
people have been most vulnerable have
 

2661
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,190
people have been most vulnerable have
been when there's been Division and

2662
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
been when there's been Division and
 

2663
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,150
been when there's been Division and
that's when uh the temple was destroyed

2664
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
that's when uh the temple was destroyed
 

2665
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,430
that's when uh the temple was destroyed
uh but that's not just with the Jewish

2666
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
uh but that's not just with the Jewish
 

2667
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,990
uh but that's not just with the Jewish
people and with Israel that's in all

2668
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,000
people and with Israel that's in all
 

2669
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,710
people and with Israel that's in all
societies so I definitely believe that

2670
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:49,720
societies so I definitely believe that
 

2671
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,870
societies so I definitely believe that
this division has left them um less

2672
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
this division has left them um less
 

2673
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,030
this division has left them um less
prepared for the situation than it would

2674
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
prepared for the situation than it would
 

2675
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,549
prepared for the situation than it would
I do think think there's real lessons we

2676
00:50:56,549 --> 00:50:56,559
I do think think there's real lessons we
 

2677
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,270
I do think think there's real lessons we
should be taking from this here in

2678
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:58,280
should be taking from this here in
 

2679
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,230
should be taking from this here in
America where we're in a time where

2680
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
America where we're in a time where
 

2681
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,990
America where we're in a time where
we're very divided but I do think that

2682
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,000
we're very divided but I do think that
 

2683
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,829
we're very divided but I do think that
uh it'd be very wise for our leaders to

2684
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:04,839
uh it'd be very wise for our leaders to
 

2685
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:07,710
uh it'd be very wise for our leaders to
find the areas where we do agree and

2686
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:07,720
find the areas where we do agree and
 

2687
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,589
find the areas where we do agree and
find ways to you know secure our

2688
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
find ways to you know secure our
 

2689
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,390
find ways to you know secure our
Southern border to make sure that we

2690
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,400

2691
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,069
Southern border to make sure that we
know who's in our country what risks uh

2692
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:14,079
know who's in our country what risks uh
 

2693
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,910
know who's in our country what risks uh
we all face um and I do think that um

2694
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
we all face um and I do think that um
 

2695
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,829
we all face um and I do think that um
that division definitely creates risk

2696
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:19,839
that division definitely creates risk
 

2697
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,910
that division definitely creates risk

their anger towards the Hamas leadership
 

2751
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,030
their anger towards the Hamas leadership

all these people are angry about is
 

2759
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,789
all these people are angry about is
Hamas and if they direct their anger

2760
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:39,799
Hamas and if they direct their anger
 

2761
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,950
Hamas and if they direct their anger
towards Hamas and put the attention on

the failings of Hamas and put forth a
vision for what they'd like to see

00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
vision for what they'd like to see
 

2767
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,109

leadership in Gaza do and they respect
 

2769
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,390
leadership in Gaza do and they respect
that there's a real fear that Israel has

2770
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:51,400
that there's a real fear that Israel has
 

2771
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,950
that there's a real fear that Israel has
and any country would have of having a

2772
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:53,960
and any country would have of having a
 

2773
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,789
and any country would have of having a
group of terrorists next to them them

group of terrorists next to them them
 

2775
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:58,190
group of terrorists next to them them
that's calling for their destruction I

2776
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:58,200
that's calling for their destruction I
 

2777
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,270
that's calling for their destruction I
think that that recognition of finding a

2778
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:00,280
think that that recognition of finding a
 

2779
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,870
think that that recognition of finding a
way for Israel to be secure and then

2780
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:03,880
way for Israel to be secure and then
 

2781
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,750
way for Israel to be secure and then
having um an opportunity for the

2782
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
having um an opportunity for the
 

2783
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,829
having um an opportunity for the
Palestinian people to live a better life

2784
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,839
Palestinian people to live a better life
 

2785
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,430
Palestinian people to live a better life
is the right Pathway to try and pursue

2786
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:10,440
is the right Pathway to try and pursue
 

2787
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,270
is the right Pathway to try and pursue
so to you there's a clear distinction

2788
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:12,280
so to you there's a clear distinction
 

2789
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,950
so to you there's a clear distinction
between Hamas and the Palestinian people

2790
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
between Hamas and the Palestinian people
 

2791
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,710
between Hamas and the Palestinian people
in that Hamas is the enemy of

2792
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:17,720
in that Hamas is the enemy of
 

2793
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,230
in that Hamas is the enemy of
progress and the flourishing of the

2794
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
progress and the flourishing of the
 

2795
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,589
progress and the flourishing of the
Palestinian people 100% it's very very

2796
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:22,599
Palestinian people 100% it's very very
 

2797
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,750
Palestinian people 100% it's very very
clear and I think that if people were

2798
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:24,760
clear and I think that if people were
 

2799
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,549
clear and I think that if people were
honest about the situation if they spent

2800
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
honest about the situation if they spent
 

2801
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,750
honest about the situation if they spent
a time to really understand it again you

2802
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:28,760
a time to really understand it again you
 

2803
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,870
a time to really understand it again you
know if you follow the conference I did

2804
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
know if you follow the conference I did
 

2805
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,230
know if you follow the conference I did
in Bahrain we had all of the leading

capabilities and and and knowhow and so
uh I think that if it's managed

2946
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,160
uh I think that if it's managed
 

2947
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,549
uh I think that if it's managed
correctly and if Iran is is is able to

correctly and if Iran is is is able to
be restrained and and and suppressed

because actually once you have this

2958
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
because actually once you have this
 

2959
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,430
because actually once you have this
economic sphere if you could bring Iraq

2960
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,440
economic sphere if you could bring Iraq
 

2961
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,870

uh that makes it even bigger and
 

2965
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,589
uh that makes it even bigger and
stronger and the Persian people are

2966
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:38,599

sometimes also
can be in a bad place and then Society

3188
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:51,000
can be in a bad place and then Society
 

3189
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,829
can be in a bad place and then Society
can push them to a worse and worse place

3190
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:52,839
can push them to a worse and worse place
 

3191
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:54,589
can push them to a worse and worse place
but we all have the power to make them

3192
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:54,599
but we all have the power to make them
 

3193

01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,470
that was hard in a negotiation
after that I would

3434
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
after that I would
 

3435
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,430
after that I would
say taking maybe a first principles

3436
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
say taking maybe a first principles
 

3437
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,630
say taking maybe a first principles
approach to what the outcome of whatever

3438
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:33,640
approach to what the outcome of whatever
 

3439
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,670
approach to what the outcome of whatever
problem you're looking to solve should

3440
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
problem you're looking to solve should
 

3441
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,549
problem you're looking to solve should
be now you have different kinds of

3442
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:37,559
be now you have different kinds of
 

3443
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,109
be now you have different kinds of
negotiations I always tried to create a

3444
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:40,119
negotiations I always tried to create a
 

3445
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:42,510
negotiations I always tried to create a
framework in the negotiation where it

3446
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:42,520
framework in the negotiation where it
 

3447
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,109
framework in the negotiation where it
wasn't me against you it was always

3448
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
wasn't me against you it was always
 

3449
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,670
wasn't me against you it was always
let's agree on what the outcome is that

3450
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
let's agree on what the outcome is that
 

3451
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,829
let's agree on what the outcome is that
we're trying to accomplish let's all sit

3452
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:49,839
we're trying to accomplish let's all sit
 

3453
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,230
we're trying to accomplish let's all sit
on the same side of the table and say we

3454
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
on the same side of the table and say we
 

3455
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,390
on the same side of the table and say we
want to get to this outcome how do we

3456
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
want to get to this outcome how do we
 

3457
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,029
want to get to this outcome how do we
get there uh really trying to create a

3458
01:05:56,029 --> 01:05:56,039
get there uh really trying to create a
 

3459
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,349
get there uh really trying to create a
road map and so once you understand the

3460
01:05:58,349 --> 01:05:58,359
road map and so once you understand the
 

3461
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,349
road map and so once you understand the
destination you want to get to the end

3462
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:00,359
destination you want to get to the end
 

3463
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,470
destination you want to get to the end
point then you'd have to work backwards

3464
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
point then you'd have to work backwards
 

3465
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,430
point then you'd have to work backwards
and really try to put yourself in their

3466
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:04,440
and really try to put yourself in their
 

3467
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,870
and really try to put yourself in their
shoes and try to understand what were

3468
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
shoes and try to understand what were
 

3469
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,829
shoes and try to understand what were
their motivations macro uh most of the

3470
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
their motivations macro uh most of the
 

3471
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,710
their motivations macro uh most of the
time you have to assume that a Leader's

3472
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:11,720
time you have to assume that a Leader's
 

3473
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,750
time you have to assume that a Leader's
primary objective was to stay in power

3474
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
primary objective was to stay in power
 

3475
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,990
primary objective was to stay in power
and so all decisions made would be made

3476
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,000
and so all decisions made would be made
 

3477
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,150
and so all decisions made would be made
through the framework of what it would

3478
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:19,160
through the framework of what it would
 

3479
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,150
through the framework of what it would
take to to do that and how would impact

3480
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:21,160
take to to do that and how would impact
 

3481
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,150
take to to do that and how would impact
their ability to do that and then

3482
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:23,160
their ability to do that and then
 

3483
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,710
their ability to do that and then
finally I would just say that in any

3484
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:25,720
finally I would just say that in any
 

3485
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,309
finally I would just say that in any
negotiation you have to understand the

3486
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:27,319
negotiation you have to understand the
 

3487
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:30,390
negotiation you have to understand the
power dynamics as well and you have to

3488
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
power dynamics as well and you have to
 

3489
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,349
power dynamics as well and you have to
then wait your approach in order to

3490
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:32,359
then wait your approach in order to
 

3491
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:34,910
then wait your approach in order to
maneuver pieces to accomplish the

3492
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:34,920
maneuver pieces to accomplish the
 

3493
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,750
maneuver pieces to accomplish the
objective and so um in areas where we

3494
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
objective and so um in areas where we
 

3495
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,789
objective and so um in areas where we
had stronger power dynamics I'd always

3496
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:39,799
had stronger power dynamics I'd always
 

3497
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:41,710
had stronger power dynamics I'd always
look at it and say what are the

3498
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:41,720
look at it and say what are the
 

3499
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,230
look at it and say what are the
potential Escape Routes where a

3500
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:43,240
potential Escape Routes where a
 

3501
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,589
potential Escape Routes where a
politician would say this is just the

3502
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
politician would say this is just the
 

3503
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,150
politician would say this is just the
reason why we can't get there and I'd

3504
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:47,160
reason why we can't get there and I'd
 

3505
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,950
reason why we can't get there and I'd
always think how can you try to

3506
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
always think how can you try to
 

3507
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,950
always think how can you try to
eliminate those Escape Routes or make

3508
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
eliminate those Escape Routes or make
 

3509
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,990
eliminate those Escape Routes or make
them much harder to accomplish then

3510
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:53,000
them much harder to accomplish then
 

3511
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,829
them much harder to accomplish then
ultimately think about what's the golden

3512
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:54,839
ultimately think about what's the golden
 

3513
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,069
ultimately think about what's the golden
bridge that you want to create for them

3514
01:06:57,069 --> 01:06:57,079
bridge that you want to create for them
 

3515
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,670
bridge that you want to create for them
in order to get to the other side where

3516
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
in order to get to the other side where
 

3517
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,750
in order to get to the other side where
they were motivated to get there because

3518
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
they were motivated to get there because
 

3519
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,230
they were motivated to get there because
it was in their self-interest to get

3520
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:03,240
it was in their self-interest to get
 

3521
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,349
it was in their self-interest to get
there but also because it helped

3522
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
there but also because it helped
 

3523
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,190
there but also because it helped
accomplish the different objective and I

3524
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
accomplish the different objective and I
 

3525
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,230
accomplish the different objective and I
have many examples that that I live

3526
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,240
have many examples that that I live
 

3527
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,589
have many examples that that I live
through with that obviously negotiating

3528
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
through with that obviously negotiating
 

3529
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,710
through with that obviously negotiating
uh in Congress for for prison reform I

3530
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:13,720
uh in Congress for for prison reform I
 

3531
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,789
uh in Congress for for prison reform I
had to form a lot of trust with uh

3532
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:15,799
had to form a lot of trust with uh
 

3533
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,950
had to form a lot of trust with uh
Democrats whether it was Hakeem Jeff or

3534
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:17,960
Democrats whether it was Hakeem Jeff or
 

3535
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,670
Democrats whether it was Hakeem Jeff or
dick Durban and then also on the

3536
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
dick Durban and then also on the
 

3537
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,309
dick Durban and then also on the
Republican side with um I had Mike Lee I

3538
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:23,319
Republican side with um I had Mike Lee I
 

3539
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,950
Republican side with um I had Mike Lee I
had Lindsey grah I had Tim Scott uh

3540
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:25,960
had Lindsey grah I had Tim Scott uh
 

3541
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,390
had Lindsey grah I had Tim Scott uh
Senator Grassley and then also Doug

3542
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
Senator Grassley and then also Doug
 

3543
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,470
Senator Grassley and then also Doug
Collins in the house was tremendous and

3544
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
Collins in the house was tremendous and
 

3545
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,950
Collins in the house was tremendous and
you know every time we maneuvered

3546
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:31,960
you know every time we maneuvered
 

3547
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,470
you know every time we maneuvered
something we would get attacked either

3548
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:33,480
something we would get attacked either
 

3549
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,269
something we would get attacked either
from the left uh you know there was a

3550
01:07:35,269 --> 01:07:35,279
from the left uh you know there was a
 

3551
01:07:35,279 --> 01:07:36,870
from the left uh you know there was a
time we were being attacked by you know

3552
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
time we were being attacked by you know
 

3553
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,029
time we were being attacked by you know
Nancy Pelosi John Lewis uh for not being

3554
01:07:40,029 --> 01:07:40,039
Nancy Pelosi John Lewis uh for not being
 

3555
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:41,870
Nancy Pelosi John Lewis uh for not being
you know inclusive enough and then there

3556
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:41,880
you know inclusive enough and then there
 

3557
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,390
you know inclusive enough and then there
were times that we maneuvered it we'd be

3558
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:43,400
were times that we maneuvered it we'd be
 

3559
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,390
were times that we maneuvered it we'd be
attacked from the right for maybe going

3560
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:45,400
attacked from the right for maybe going
 

3561
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,109
attacked from the right for maybe going
too far and ultimately we had to find

3562
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
too far and ultimately we had to find
 

3563
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,069
too far and ultimately we had to find
just the right place where we can get it

3564
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:49,079
just the right place where we can get it
 

3565
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,349
just the right place where we can get it
done and the same thing happened with uh

3566
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
done and the same thing happened with uh
 

3567
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,549
done and the same thing happened with uh
usmca where we were negotiating the

3568
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:53,559
usmca where we were negotiating the
 

3569
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:55,309
usmca where we were negotiating the
biggest trade deal in the history of the

3570
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:55,319
biggest trade deal in the history of the
 

3571
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,349
biggest trade deal in the history of the
world which was $1.3 trillion in annual

3572
01:07:58,349 --> 01:07:58,359
world which was $1.3 trillion in annual
 

3573
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:01,190
world which was $1.3 trillion in annual
trade between Mexico Canada the United

3574
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,200
trade between Mexico Canada the United
 

3575
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,710
trade between Mexico Canada the United
States of America and we were able to

3576
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:03,720
States of America and we were able to
 

3577
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,630
States of America and we were able to
form good trust with the other side and

3578
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
form good trust with the other side and
 

3579
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,230
form good trust with the other side and
try to say how do we create win-win

3580
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
try to say how do we create win-win
 

3581
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,390
try to say how do we create win-win
outcomes and ultimately we're able to do

3582
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,400
outcomes and ultimately we're able to do
 

3583
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,710
outcomes and ultimately we're able to do
something in a record time that people

3584
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
something in a record time that people
 

3585
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,870
something in a record time that people
thought was very uh hard to do and both

3586
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:14,880
thought was very uh hard to do and both
 

3587
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,349
thought was very uh hard to do and both

just to go back to the trust thing you

01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:31,400
just to go back to the trust thing you
 

3661
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,950
just to go back to the trust thing you
sometimes see that with leaders where

3662
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
sometimes see that with leaders where
 

3663
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,590
sometimes see that with leaders where
they're kind of it looks like they're

3664
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:34,600
they're kind of it looks like they're
 

3665
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,470
they're kind of it looks like they're
trying to screw over the other person

3666
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
trying to screw over the other person

4051
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,229
this and I was getting calls from
friends at the time saying I'm trying to

4052
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:33,239
friends at the time saying I'm trying to
 

4053
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:35,430
friends at the time saying I'm trying to
go to Hawaii for a vacation should I not

4055
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,510
go to Hawaii for a vacation should I not
be going is it not safe I mean we forget

4056
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
be going is it not safe I mean we forget
 

4057
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,070
be going is it not safe I mean we forget
we forget the psychology of how intense

4058
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
we forget the psychology of how intense
 

4059
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,470
we forget the psychology of how intense
that was at the time and then through

4060
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
that was at the time and then through
 

4061
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,310
that was at the time and then through
that interaction he caught some of his

4062
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:45,320
that interaction he caught some of his
 

4063
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,830
that interaction he caught some of his
contacts in North Korea and then we were

4064
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:46,840
contacts in North Korea and then we were
 

4065
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,550
contacts in North Korea and then we were
able with the CIA to open up a back

4066
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
able with the CIA to open up a back
 

4067
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,510
able with the CIA to open up a back
channel that ultimately led to the the

4068
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:52,520
channel that ultimately led to the the
 

4069
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,149
channel that ultimately led to the the
deescalation the meeting between Trump

4070
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
deescalation the meeting between Trump
 

4071
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,430
deescalation the meeting between Trump
and Kim Jung good which led to a

4072
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
and Kim Jung good which led to a
 

4073
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,470
and Kim Jung good which led to a
deescalation so that was really the

4074
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:57,480
deescalation so that was really the
 

4075
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,229
deescalation so that was really the
mindset which was whenever there's a

4076
01:16:59,229 --> 01:16:59,239
mindset which was whenever there's a
 

4077
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,470
mindset which was whenever there's a
problem just pick up the phone and try

4078
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:01,480
problem just pick up the phone and try
 

4079
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,950
problem just pick up the phone and try
and I think president Trump had a very

4080
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
and I think president Trump had a very
 

4081
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,270
and I think president Trump had a very
similar approach which was let's let's

4082
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
similar approach which was let's let's
 

4083
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,310
similar approach which was let's let's
give it a shot and he wasn't afraid to

4084
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:07,320
give it a shot and he wasn't afraid to
 

4085
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,629
give it a shot and he wasn't afraid to
go after the hard ones too and I'll say

4086
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:09,639
go after the hard ones too and I'll say
 

4087
01:17:09,639 --> 01:17:13,430
go after the hard ones too and I'll say
one final thing on this which is that in

4088
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
one final thing on this which is that in
 

4089
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,310
one final thing on this which is that in
politics the incentive structure is just

4090
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:16,320
politics the incentive structure is just
 

4091
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,510
politics the incentive structure is just
much different than in the real world

4092
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:18,520
much different than in the real world
 

4093
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,110
much different than in the real world
right in the sense that you have a hard

4094
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,120
right in the sense that you have a hard
 

4095
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,629
right in the sense that you have a hard
problem then if you try to solve a hard

4096
01:17:22,629 --> 01:17:22,639
problem then if you try to solve a hard
 

4097
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,590
problem then if you try to solve a hard
problem the likelihood of failure is

4098
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:24,600
problem the likelihood of failure is
 

4099
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,830
problem the likelihood of failure is
great whereas in the business world if

4100
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
great whereas in the business world if
 

4101
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,189
great whereas in the business world if
you're going after a hard problem we

4102
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
you're going after a hard problem we
 

4103
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,590
you're going after a hard problem we
celebrate those people right we we we

4104
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
celebrate those people right we we we
 

4105
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,830
celebrate those people right we we we
want our entrepreneurs and our great

4106
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
want our entrepreneurs and our great
 

4107
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,870
want our entrepreneurs and our great
people to go after solving the big hard

4108
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:33,880
people to go after solving the big hard
 

4109
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,510
people to go after solving the big hard
problems but in politics if you try to

4110
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
problems but in politics if you try to
 

4111
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,470
problems but in politics if you try to
take on a hard problem you have a high

4112
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:37,480
take on a hard problem you have a high
 

4113
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,310
take on a hard problem you have a high
likelihood of failure you'll get a lot

4114
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:39,320
likelihood of failure you'll get a lot
 

4115
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,629
likelihood of failure you'll get a lot
of criticism uh on your pathway to

4116
01:17:41,629 --> 01:17:41,639
of criticism uh on your pathway to
 

4117
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:44,070
of criticism uh on your pathway to
trying to accomplish that if you fail

4118
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,080
trying to accomplish that if you fail
 

4119
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,629
trying to accomplish that if you fail
and then if you fail it has a higher

4120
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:45,639
and then if you fail it has a higher
 

4121
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:47,830
and then if you fail it has a higher
probability of leading to you losing

4122
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
probability of leading to you losing
 

4123
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,229
probability of leading to you losing
your opportunity to serve and so it's

4124
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:51,239
your opportunity to serve and so it's
 

4125
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:52,270
your opportunity to serve and so it's
just one of these things where people

4126
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:52,280
just one of these things where people
 

4127
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,510
just one of these things where people
want to play it safe which is not the

4128
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:54,520
want to play it safe which is not the
 

4129
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,669
want to play it safe which is not the
notion that that that really was taken

4130
01:17:56,669 --> 01:17:56,679
notion that that that really was taken
 

4131
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:58,149
notion that that that really was taken
during the time that President Trump was

4132
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
during the time that President Trump was
 

4133
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,189
during the time that President Trump was
in office do you think it has to be that

4134
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:00,199
in office do you think it has to be that
 

4135
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:02,910
in office do you think it has to be that
way I think I think there's something in

4136
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:02,920
way I think I think there's something in
 

4137
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,030
way I think I think there's something in
in the human Spirit like in the public

4138
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
in the human Spirit like in the public
 

4139
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,990
in the human Spirit like in the public
that desires politicians to take

4140
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,000
that desires politicians to take
 

4141
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,189
that desires politicians to take
big take on the big bold problems right

4142
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:12,199
big take on the big bold problems right
 

4143
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:14,629
big take on the big bold problems right
like why why is it the politicians need

4144
01:18:14,629 --> 01:18:14,639
like why why is it the politicians need
 

4145
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:16,990
like why why is it the politicians need
to be so afraid of failure I don't think

4146
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:17,000
to be so afraid of failure I don't think
 

4147
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,790
to be so afraid of failure I don't think
it has to be that way and that's I think

4148
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
it has to be that way and that's I think
 

4149
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,430
it has to be that way and that's I think
one of the great lessons from the time

4150
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
one of the great lessons from the time
 

4151
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,149
one of the great lessons from the time
of the the Trump Administration and he

4152
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:23,159
of the the Trump Administration and he
 

4153
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:24,430
of the the Trump Administration and he
brought a lot of people from the

4154
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:24,440
brought a lot of people from the
 

4155
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,590
brought a lot of people from the
business world into government uh the

4156
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:26,600
business world into government uh the
 

4157
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,510
business world into government uh the
business people have a much different

4158
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:28,520
business people have a much different
 

4159
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,550
business people have a much different
mindset than government people and there

4160
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
mindset than government people and there
 

4161
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,629
mindset than government people and there
was a lot of resistance and I think part

4162
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:32,639
was a lot of resistance and I think part
 

4163
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:34,629
was a lot of resistance and I think part
of why there was so much resistance was

4164
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:34,639
of why there was so much resistance was
 

4165
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:36,950
of why there was so much resistance was
because you know I think about it from

4166
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:36,960
because you know I think about it from
 

4167
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,669
because you know I think about it from
my personal sense was that if I was

4168
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
my personal sense was that if I was
 

4169
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,310
my personal sense was that if I was
successful with no traditional

4170
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:41,320
successful with no traditional
 

4171
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,709
successful with no traditional
qualifications to do diplomacy it meant

4172
01:18:43,709 --> 01:18:43,719
qualifications to do diplomacy it meant
 

4173
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,390
qualifications to do diplomacy it meant
that all the people with traditional

4174
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:45,400
that all the people with traditional
 

4175
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,750
that all the people with traditional
qualifications and diplomacy didn't

4176
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
qualifications and diplomacy didn't
 

4177
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,310
qualifications and diplomacy didn't
necessarily need those qualifications in

4178
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:49,320
necessarily need those qualifications in
 

4179
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,910
necessarily need those qualifications in
order to be successful and that same

4180
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:51,920
order to be successful and that same
 

4181
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,830
order to be successful and that same
that same sentiment manifested itself in

4182
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:54,840
that same sentiment manifested itself in
 

4183
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,790
that same sentiment manifested itself in
many areas in government and and I think

4184
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
many areas in government and and I think
 

4185
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,550
many areas in government and and I think
that in the business world it's it's

4186
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,560
that in the business world it's it's
 

4187
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,510
that in the business world it's it's
outcome oriented it's results oriented

4188
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:01,520
outcome oriented it's results oriented
 

4189
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,270
outcome oriented it's results oriented
and you know what we would see in in New

4190
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
and you know what we would see in in New
 

4191
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,709
and you know what we would see in in New
York is there they would stab you in the

4192
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
York is there they would stab you in the
 

4193
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,149
York is there they would stab you in the
eye and DC they would stab you in the

4194
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
eye and DC they would stab you in the
 

4195
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,430
eye and DC they would stab you in the
back and it just became a whole

4196
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
back and it just became a whole
 

4197
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,590
back and it just became a whole
different Dynamic of of of how you work

4198
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:10,600
different Dynamic of of of how you work
 

4199
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,830
different Dynamic of of of how you work
through these different areas so the

4200
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
through these different areas so the
 

4201
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,470
through these different areas so the
answer is it doesn't have to be that way

4202
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:13,480
answer is it doesn't have to be that way
 

4203
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,790
answer is it doesn't have to be that way
you just need the right courageous

4204
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800

and then also

4668
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:22,719
and then also
 

4669
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,310
and then also
focus on the fact that you know the

4670
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
focus on the fact that you know the
 

4671
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,550
focus on the fact that you know the
actions are actually what's going to

4672
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:25,560
actions are actually what's going to
 

4673
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,790
actions are actually what's going to
matter more than the words and so you

4674
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:27,800
matter more than the words and so you
 

4675
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,709
matter more than the words and so you
have a difference between leaders and

4676
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:29,719
have a difference between leaders and
 

4677
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:31,310
have a difference between leaders and
politicians you know politicians are

4678
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:31,320
politicians you know politicians are
 

4679
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,870
politicians you know politicians are
there to say the right thing and to hold

4680
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
there to say the right thing and to hold
 

4681
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,990
there to say the right thing and to hold
the power leaders are people who are

4682
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:35,000
the power leaders are people who are
 

4683
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,510
the power leaders are people who are
willing to do things that will be

4684
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:36,520
willing to do things that will be
 

4685
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,709
willing to do things that will be
transformational from my perspective and

4686
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:38,719
transformational from my perspective and
 

4687
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,430
transformational from my perspective and
so when I would think about um

4688
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:42,440
so when I would think about um
 

4689
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,709
so when I would think about um
diplomacy words without actions or

4690
01:27:45,709 --> 01:27:45,719
diplomacy words without actions or
 

4691
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,189
diplomacy words without actions or
without the threat of actions and that

4692
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
without the threat of actions and that
 

4693
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,030
without the threat of actions and that
was something that President Trump did

4694
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,040
was something that President Trump did
 

4695
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,510
was something that President Trump did
very well was that people knew that he

4696
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,520
very well was that people knew that he
 

4697
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,910
very well was that people knew that he
was willing to take take action he was

4698
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:52,920
was willing to take take action he was
 

4699
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,430
was willing to take take action he was
very unpredictable in how he would act

4700
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:55,440
very unpredictable in how he would act
 

4701
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,910
very unpredictable in how he would act
and that made our words much more

4702
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:56,920
and that made our words much more
 

4703
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,070
and that made our words much more
effective in what they did so it's all a

4704
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,080
effective in what they did so it's all a
 

4705
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,430
effective in what they did so it's all a
combination but you know coming from the

4706
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
combination but you know coming from the
 

4707
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,550
combination but you know coming from the
private sector we were all about results

4708
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:03,560
private sector we were all about results
 

4709
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,790
private sector we were all about results
right if you're in government you can

4710
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:05,800
right if you're in government you can
 

4711
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,790
right if you're in government you can
work on something for 10 years and fail

4712
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:07,800
work on something for 10 years and fail
 

4713
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,229
work on something for 10 years and fail
and then retire and they consider you an

4714
01:28:09,229 --> 01:28:09,239
and then retire and they consider you an
 

4715
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:11,750
and then retire and they consider you an
expert in the private sector if you work

4716
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
expert in the private sector if you work
 

4717
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,390
expert in the private sector if you work
on something for 10 weeks and you don't

4718
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:13,400
on something for 10 weeks and you don't
 

4719
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,149
on something for 10 weeks and you don't
have a success then you're unemployed

4720
01:28:15,149 --> 01:28:15,159
have a success then you're unemployed
 

4721
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,310
have a success then you're unemployed
you know so it's it's it's a different

4722
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:17,320
you know so it's it's it's a different
 

4723
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,430
you know so it's it's it's a different
kind of notion and um and it was just

4724
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:20,440
kind of notion and um and it was just
 

4725
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,669
kind of notion and um and it was just
understanding the mentality and trying

to adjust and and Bridging the divides
uh between the different trainings is

01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,070
uh between the different trainings is

01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,830
set so there was a couple skill sets
that I found were quite deficient in

4789
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,750
military DHS professionals uh DOD and we
basically all came together and then

4790
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:28,760
basically all came together and then
 

4791
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,709
basically all came together and then
once we had a good project management

4792
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:30,719
once we had a good project management
 

4793
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,310
once we had a good project management
plan we were able to kind of move very

4794
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,320
plan we were able to kind of move very
 

4795
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,470
plan we were able to kind of move very
very quickly I think we built about 470

4796
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
very quickly I think we built about 470
 

4797
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,910
very quickly I think we built about 470
mies of uh border barrier in about two

4798
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:36,920
mies of uh border barrier in about two
 

4799

mies of uh border barrier in about two
years basically and that was very that

4800
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
years basically and that was very that
 

4801
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,510
years basically and that was very that
worked very well because we basically

4802
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:42,520
worked very well because we basically
 

4803
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,310
worked very well because we basically
brought private sector project

4804
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,320
brought private sector project
 

4805
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,070
brought private sector project
management skill sets which uh which

4806
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:47,080
management skill sets which uh which
 

4807
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,669
management skill sets which uh which
were quite often missing in government

4808
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
were quite often missing in government
 

4809
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,109
were quite often missing in government
the second one is just you know we spoke

4810
01:29:51,109 --> 01:29:51,119
the second one is just you know we spoke
 

4811
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,430
the second one is just you know we spoke
about negotiation earlier I would say

4812
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
about negotiation earlier I would say
 

4813
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,149
about negotiation earlier I would say
that most people in government it's just

4814
01:29:55,149 --> 01:29:55,159
that most people in government it's just
 

4815
01:29:55,159 --> 01:29:57,270
that most people in government it's just
a different form of negotiation than you

4816
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
a different form of negotiation than you
 

4817
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,470
a different form of negotiation than you
see in the private sector um and way

4818
01:29:59,470 --> 01:29:59,480
see in the private sector um and way
 

4819
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,390
see in the private sector um and way
less effective in that regard which is

4820
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:01,400
less effective in that regard which is
 

4821
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,229
less effective in that regard which is
why I think it's good the more we can

4822
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:03,239
why I think it's good the more we can
 

4823

times like when it is inefficient when
 

4889
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,790
times like when it is inefficient when
it doesn't work why is that the case the

4890
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:12,800
it doesn't work why is that the case the
 

4891
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,870
it doesn't work why is that the case the
bureaucracy that you spoke to uh the

4892

01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:18,760
we don't have enough time on this
 

4897
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,070
we don't have enough time on this
podcast to go into it but it's uh

4898
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,080
podcast to go into it but it's uh
 

4899
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,270
podcast to go into it but it's uh
there's there's a lot of aspects that

there's there's a lot of aspects that
 

4901
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,990
there's there's a lot of aspects that
work as well right but I do think we've

4902
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:25,000
work as well right but I do think we've
 

4903
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,830
work as well right but I do think we've
gotten too big you know Neil's book that

4904

remember thinking about that uh one
 

4927
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:50,669
remember thinking about that uh one
thing I was very proud of of the work of

the Trump Administration was that you
had four years consecutively where there

4932

had four years consecutively where there
was a net decrease in the cost of

was a net decrease in the cost of
 

4935
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,790
was a net decrease in the cost of
regulations so to give you a context in

4936
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
regulations so to give you a context in
 

4937
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,430
regulations so to give you a context in
the last year of Obama in 2016 there

4938
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
the last year of Obama in 2016 there
 

4939
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,790
the last year of Obama in 2016 there
were 6 million man hours spent by the

4940
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:03,800
were 6 million man hours spent by the
 

4941
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,629
were 6 million man hours spent by the
private sector complying with new

4942
01:32:05,629 --> 01:32:05,639
private sector complying with new
 

4943
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,629
private sector complying with new
federal regulations and that's not

4944
01:32:07,629 --> 01:32:07,639
federal regulations and that's not
 

4945
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:09,470
federal regulations and that's not
really what the intent of our government

4946
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:09,480
really what the intent of our government
 

4947
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,950
really what the intent of our government
was right if we have rules or

4948
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
was right if we have rules or
 

4949
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,550
was right if we have rules or
regulations those should be legislated

4950
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
regulations those should be legislated
 

4951
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,070
regulations those should be legislated
by Congress they shouldn't be put in by

4952
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:15,080
by Congress they shouldn't be put in by
 

4953
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,830
by Congress they shouldn't be put in by
you know by bureaucrats who are

4954
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:16,840
you know by bureaucrats who are
 

4955
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,229
you know by bureaucrats who are
basically saying I want to follow this

4956
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
basically saying I want to follow this
 

4957
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,310
basically saying I want to follow this
objective so using kind of the power of

4958
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
objective so using kind of the power of
 

4959
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,149
objective so using kind of the power of
the pen in order to do that so the

4960
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:22,159
the pen in order to do that so the
 

4961
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,669
the pen in order to do that so the
deregulatory effort was actually very

4962
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:24,679
deregulatory effort was actually very
 

4963
01:32:24,679 --> 01:32:26,910
deregulatory effort was actually very
critical to Trump's economic success

4964
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:26,920
critical to Trump's economic success
 

4965
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,669
critical to Trump's economic success
that happened in the beginning of the

4966
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:28,679
that happened in the beginning of the
 

4967
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:30,950
that happened in the beginning of the
administration and then what I saw with

4968
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:30,960
administration and then what I saw with
 

4969
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,830
administration and then what I saw with
regulation was anytime either there was

4970
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:32,840
regulation was anytime either there was
 

4971
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,910
regulation was anytime either there was
legislation or regulation coming the

4972
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:34,920
legislation or regulation coming the
 

4973
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,229
legislation or regulation coming the
people pushing for it were usually the

4974
01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:37,239
people pushing for it were usually the
 

4975
01:32:37,239 --> 01:32:38,590
people pushing for it were usually the
people who would benefit from the

4976
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:38,600
people who would benefit from the
 

4977
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,750
people who would benefit from the
regulatory capture so you had these you

4978

regulatory capture so you had these you
 

4979
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,870
regulatory capture so you had these you
know you look at you know the great

4980
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:41,880
know you look at you know the great
 

4981
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,870
know you look at you know the great
financial crisis where you had these big

4982
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:43,880
financial crisis where you had these big
 

4983
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,750
financial crisis where you had these big
banking reforms well what happened

4984
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
banking reforms well what happened
 

4985
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,830
banking reforms well what happened
during the big banking reforms then you

4986
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:47,840
during the big banking reforms then you
 

4987
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,350
during the big banking reforms then you
had a big reduction in the amount of

4988
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
had a big reduction in the amount of
 

4989
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,229
had a big reduction in the amount of
banks that occurred and the big Banks

4990
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:51,239
banks that occurred and the big Banks
 

4991
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,510
banks that occurred and the big Banks
became even bigger whereas I don't think

4992
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
became even bigger whereas I don't think
 

4993
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,550
became even bigger whereas I don't think
that was the intention of the

4994
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
that was the intention of the
 

4995
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,350
that was the intention of the
legislation but the people who were

4996
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:56,360
legislation but the people who were
 

4997
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,149
legislation but the people who were
writing the legislation and influencing

4998
01:32:58,149 --> 01:32:58,159
writing the legislation and influencing
 

4999
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,270
writing the legislation and influencing
it had a lot of the constituencies from

5000
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:00,280
it had a lot of the constituencies from
 

5001
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,910
it had a lot of the constituencies from
those larger institutions and then what

5002
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
those larger institutions and then what
 

5003
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,750
those larger institutions and then what
happened as a result of that a lot of

5004
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
happened as a result of that a lot of
 

5005
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,629
happened as a result of that a lot of
these smaller institutions didn't have

5006
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:05,639
these smaller institutions didn't have
 

5007
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:08,310
these smaller institutions didn't have
the ability to uh be as competitive they

5008
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:08,320
the ability to uh be as competitive they
 

5009
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,990
the ability to uh be as competitive they
had more restrictions more costs they

5010
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
had more restrictions more costs they
 

5011
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,870
had more restrictions more costs they
became less profitable but these were

5012
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:11,880
became less profitable but these were
 

5013
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,350
became less profitable but these were
the banks that were serving small

5014
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
the banks that were serving small
 

5015
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,430
the banks that were serving small
business which is the biggest uh creator

5016
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:15,440
business which is the biggest uh creator
 

5017
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,390
business which is the biggest uh creator
of jobs in our country and then as a

5018
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:17,400
of jobs in our country and then as a
 

5019
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,149
of jobs in our country and then as a
result the bigger Banks got more

5020
01:33:19,149 --> 01:33:19,159
result the bigger Banks got more
 

5021
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:20,750
result the bigger Banks got more
powerful and what happened in the

5022
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:20,760
powerful and what happened in the
 

5023
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,790
powerful and what happened in the
country as a result of the the

5024
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
country as a result of the the
 

5025
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,790
country as a result of the the
regulations that they put in place the

5026
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:24,800
regulations that they put in place the
 

5027
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,470
regulations that they put in place the
wealth Gap in the country grew it didn't

5028
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:26,480
wealth Gap in the country grew it didn't
 

5029
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,950
wealth Gap in the country grew it didn't
shrink and so I think often times what

5030
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:29,960
shrink and so I think often times what
 

5031
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,669
shrink and so I think often times what
they say these regulations are intended

5032
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
they say these regulations are intended
 

5033
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,510
they say these regulations are intended
to be the result often becomes the

5034
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:34,520
to be the result often becomes the
 

5035
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,709
to be the result often becomes the
opposite and so you know what what

5036
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:36,719
opposite and so you know what what
 

5037
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:37,790
opposite and so you know what what
president Trump did and his

5038
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:37,800
president Trump did and his
 

5039
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,510
president Trump did and his
administration was they did a massive

5040
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:39,520
administration was they did a massive
 

5041
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,350
administration was they did a massive
deregulatory effort and I think they

5042
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
deregulatory effort and I think they
 

5043
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,910
deregulatory effort and I think they
pledged that for every one regulation

5044
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:44,920
pledged that for every one regulation
 

5045
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,149
pledged that for every one regulation
they put on because you do need some

5046
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
they put on because you do need some
 

5047
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,149
they put on because you do need some
regulation in an economy and in a

5048
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
regulation in an economy and in a
 

5049
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,189
regulation in an economy and in a
society uh they would take off too and

5050
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:50,199
society uh they would take off too and
 

5051
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:51,830
society uh they would take off too and
in the first year they limited eight

5052
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:51,840
in the first year they limited eight
 

5053
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,629
in the first year they limited eight
regulations for everyone and so um so

5054
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:54,639
regulations for everyone and so um so
 

5055
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:55,870
regulations for everyone and so um so
that was just something I took from it

5056
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:55,880
that was just something I took from it
 

5057
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,590
that was just something I took from it
which which was uh I thought very

5058
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
which which was uh I thought very
 

5059
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,070
which which was uh I thought very
interesting and you had to really I

5060
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
interesting and you had to really I
 

5061
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,109
interesting and you had to really I
think you just have to think through

5062
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:01,119
think you just have to think through
 

5063
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:02,709
think you just have to think through
what are the consequences going to be of

5064
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:02,719
what are the consequences going to be of
 

5065
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,470
what are the consequences going to be of
the different actions you take and often

5066
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:05,480
the different actions you take and often
 

5067
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,629
the different actions you take and often
government gets it wrong by taking an

5068
01:34:07,629 --> 01:34:07,639
government gets it wrong by taking an
 

5069
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:09,390
government gets it wrong by taking an
action that feels right but has big

5070
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:09,400

action that feels right but has big
negative consequences down the road

5072
01:34:11,629 --> 01:34:11,639
negative consequences down the road

01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:09,719
it and then I just basically said like
 

5359
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:11,109
it and then I just basically said like
you know I'd had hardship earlier in my

is that you can't really spend energy on
 

5367
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,750
is that you can't really spend energy on
the things that you don't control all

5368
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:20,760

the things that you don't control all
you do is spend your time and energy

how that's not celebrated that is
 

5533
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,470
how that's not celebrated that is
something very different in the private

5534
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:22,480
something very different in the private
 

5535
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,229
something very different in the private
sector when you take on big challenges

5536
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
sector when you take on big challenges
 

5537

01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,750
to see it fail or they want to criticize
those people who are trying to take that

that you know as a country we should be
thinking big we should be dreaming big

5550
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:37,000
thinking big we should be dreaming big
 

5551
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,270
thinking big we should be dreaming big
and we should be encouraging our

5552
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:38,280
and we should be encouraging our
 

5553
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,550
and we should be encouraging our
politicians to try and to fail more and

01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
are which I thought was a very elegant
 

6511
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,709
are which I thought was a very elegant
way of saying it and I I would see this

6512
01:59:36,709 --> 01:59:36,719
way of saying it and I I would see this
 

6513
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,430
way of saying it and I I would see this
time and time again in the white house

6514
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
time and time again in the white house
 

6515
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,310
time and time again in the white house
where you had people who were now given

6516
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:41,320
where you had people who were now given
 

6517
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,910
where you had people who were now given
a lot of responsibility and power and it

6518
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:43,920
a lot of responsibility and power and it
 

6519
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,430
a lot of responsibility and power and it
went to their head and they they they

6520
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:46,440
went to their head and they they they
 

6521
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,790
went to their head and they they they
acted very crazily and um maybe didn't

6522
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
acted very crazily and um maybe didn't
 

6523
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,189
acted very crazily and um maybe didn't
act in a way that I thought was always

6524
01:59:52,189 --> 01:59:52,199
act in a way that I thought was always
 

6525
01:59:52,199 --> 01:59:53,910
act in a way that I thought was always
conducive to the objective so I think

6526
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:53,920
conducive to the objective so I think
 

6527
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,430
conducive to the objective so I think
it's a very big problem that you have uh

6528
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:57,440
it's a very big problem that you have uh
 

6529
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,870
it's a very big problem that you have uh
whether it's it's something that's

6530
01:59:58,870 --> 01:59:58,880
whether it's it's something that's
 

6531
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,270
whether it's it's something that's
solvable I think it's about having the

6532
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:00,280
solvable I think it's about having the
 

6533
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,870
solvable I think it's about having the
right leaders and and hopefully for the

6534
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:01,880
right leaders and and hopefully for the
 

6535
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:03,270
right leaders and and hopefully for the
leaders having good friends I mean I'm

6536
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
leaders having good friends I mean I'm
 

6537
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,270
leaders having good friends I mean I'm
still friends with a lot of the people I

6538
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:05,280
still friends with a lot of the people I
 

6539
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,830
still friends with a lot of the people I
interacted with when I was in government

6540
02:00:06,830 --> 02:00:06,840
interacted with when I was in government
 

6541
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,470
interacted with when I was in government
and you know the number one thing I try

6542
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:08,480
and you know the number one thing I try
 

6543
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,350
and you know the number one thing I try
to be to to them is just a good friend I

6544
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:10,360
to be to to them is just a good friend I
 

6545

to be to to them is just a good friend I
try to be somebody who they can talk

6546
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:12,480
try to be somebody who they can talk
 

6547
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:14,189
try to be somebody who they can talk
about things with I don't go in trying

6548
02:00:14,189 --> 02:00:14,199
about things with I don't go in trying
 

6549
02:00:14,199 --> 02:00:15,510
about things with I don't go in trying
to tell them what to do on different

6550
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:15,520
to tell them what to do on different
 

6551
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,510
to tell them what to do on different
things or um you know or or and I think

6552
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:18,520
things or um you know or or and I think
 

6553
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,030
things or um you know or or and I think
that that's a big thing is that people

6554
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:20,040
that that's a big thing is that people
 

6555
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,149
that that's a big thing is that people
just need friends and they need

6556
02:00:21,149 --> 02:00:21,159
just need friends and they need
 

6557
02:00:21,159 --> 02:00:23,149
just need friends and they need
conversation and if they have that then

6558
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:23,159
conversation and if they have that then
 

6559
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:25,550
conversation and if they have that then
hopefully that allows them to keep their

6560
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:25,560
hopefully that allows them to keep their
 

6561
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,069
hopefully that allows them to keep their
head in the right

6562
02:00:27,069 --> 02:00:27,079
head in the right
 

6563
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:29,350
head in the right
place I think this is a good place to

6564
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:29,360
place I think this is a good place to
 

6565
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,310

help make that happen sure um so uh we
 

6581
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,149
help make that happen sure um so uh we
passed a a law called the first step act

6582
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:52,159
passed a a law called the first step act
 

6583
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:53,910
passed a a law called the first step act
which was the largest prison and

6584

which was the largest prison and

Criminal Justice Reform Bill that's been

6586
02:00:56,589 --> 02:00:56,599
Criminal Justice Reform Bill that's been
 

6587
02:00:56,599 --> 02:00:59,669
Criminal Justice Reform Bill that's been
done maybe in 30 40 50 years in the US

6589
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:02,310
done maybe in 30 40 50 years in the US
and so uh what it basically did was two

6590
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:02,320
and so uh what it basically did was two
 

6591

02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:09,189
system and it took a certain class of
offenders and allowed them to become

offenders and allowed them to become
 

6597
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:12,229
offenders and allowed them to become
eligible for earlier release if they go

6598
02:01:12,229 --> 02:01:12,239
eligible for earlier release if they go
 

6599
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:14,390
eligible for earlier release if they go
through the certain trainings that will

6600
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:14,400
through the certain trainings that will
 

6601
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,550
through the certain trainings that will
allow them to have a lower uh

6602
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:16,560
allow them to have a lower uh
 

6603
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,709
allow them to have a lower uh
probability of going back so you know

6604
02:01:18,709 --> 02:01:18,719
probability of going back so you know
 

6605
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:20,629
probability of going back so you know
stepping back you look at the prison

stepping back you look at the prison
 

6607
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:22,350
stepping back you look at the prison
system you say what's the purpose is it

6608
02:01:22,350 --> 02:01:22,360
system you say what's the purpose is it
 

6609
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:25,350

second chances I saw firsthand uh when

6616
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:31,400
second chances I saw firsthand uh when
 

6617
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,910
second chances I saw firsthand uh when
my father was a client of the system how

6618
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:33,920
my father was a client of the system how
 

6619
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,790
my father was a client of the system how
inefficient it was and how much better

6620
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:35,800
inefficient it was and how much better
 

6621
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:38,270
inefficient it was and how much better
it could be and you know when my father

6635
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,990
very very proud of doing and what we saw
through our micro experience was that if

6636
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,000
through our micro experience was that if
 

6637
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,510
through our micro experience was that if
you give people mentorship if you give

6638
02:01:54,510 --> 02:01:54,520
you give people mentorship if you give
 

6639
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:57,069
you give people mentorship if you give
them go job training uh a lot of people

6640

you know leave they have addiction
issues um and they can't find housing

and so you know people leave prison with
 

6647
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,430
and so you know people leave prison with
a criminal record and they're less

02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:06,440
a criminal record and they're less
 

6649
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,229
a criminal record and they're less
likely to go back and reintegrate in

6650
02:02:08,229 --> 02:02:08,239
likely to go back and reintegrate in
 

6651
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:13,030
likely to go back and reintegrate in
society without help from from from

6652
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,040
society without help from from from
 

6653
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,550
society without help from from from
different institutions that can help

different institutions that can help
 

6655
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,430
different institutions that can help
them do that so we modeled the reforms

6656
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:16,440
them do that so we modeled the reforms
 

6657
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,790
them do that so we modeled the reforms
off of what they did in Texas and

6658
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:17,800
off of what they did in Texas and
 

6659
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,030
off of what they did in Texas and
Georgia and states where they basically

6660
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:20,040
Georgia and states where they basically
 

6661
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,830
Georgia and states where they basically
put a lot of job training alcohol and

6662
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:22,840
put a lot of job training alcohol and
 

6663

02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
addiction treatment programs in the
 

6665
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:27,149
addiction treatment programs in the
prisons as a way to incentivize the

6666
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:27,159
prisons as a way to incentivize the
 

6667
02:02:27,159 --> 02:02:28,950
prisons as a way to incentivize the
prisoners to work on themselves while

6668

prisoners to work on themselves while
 

6669
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,069
prisoners to work on themselves while
they're there in order to allow them to

6670
02:02:31,069 --> 02:02:31,079
they're there in order to allow them to
 

6671
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:33,270
they're there in order to allow them to
re-enter Society uh it's turned out to

6672
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
re-enter Society uh it's turned out to
 

6673
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,910
re-enter Society uh it's turned out to
be very successful so far they just had

6674
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:34,920
be very successful so far they just had
 

6675
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:37,709
be very successful so far they just had
a report that showed that uh the general

6676
02:02:37,709 --> 02:02:37,719
a report that showed that uh the general
 

6677

a report that showed that uh the general
population has had a 47% re recidivism

6678
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:40,920
population has had a 47% re recidivism
 

6679
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,069
population has had a 47% re recidivism
rate meaning that people who leave

6680
02:02:42,069 --> 02:02:42,079
rate meaning that people who leave
 

6681
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:44,709
rate meaning that people who leave
federal prison half of them go back and

6682
02:02:44,709 --> 02:02:44,719
federal prison half of them go back and
 

6683
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:46,390
federal prison half of them go back and
people who have now taken this program

6684
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:46,400
people who have now taken this program
 

6685
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,229
people who have now taken this program
only 12% of them go back so number one

6686
02:02:49,229 --> 02:02:49,239
only 12% of them go back so number one
 

6687
02:02:49,239 --> 02:02:51,310
only 12% of them go back so number one
you're making Community safer because if

6688
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:51,320
you're making Community safer because if
 

6689
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:52,709
you're making Community safer because if
people are going to now get a job and

6690
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
people are going to now get a job and
 

6691
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,189
people are going to now get a job and
enter Society instead of committing

6692
02:02:54,189 --> 02:02:54,199
enter Society instead of committing
 

6693
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:56,229
enter Society instead of committing
future crimes you're avoiding future

6694
02:02:56,229 --> 02:02:56,239
future crimes you're avoiding future
 

6695
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,470
future crimes you're avoiding future
crimes and number two um you're giving

6696
02:02:58,470 --> 02:02:58,480
crimes and number two um you're giving
 

6697
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,030
crimes and number two um you're giving
people a second chance at life and so

6698
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:01,040
people a second chance at life and so
 

6699
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,550
people a second chance at life and so
that was the first part of it the second

6700
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,560
that was the first part of it the second
 

6701
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:05,109
that was the first part of it the second
thing we did was there was a rule pass

6702
02:03:05,109 --> 02:03:05,119
thing we did was there was a rule pass
 

6703
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:09,069
thing we did was there was a rule pass
in the 90s that basically penalized uh

6704
02:03:09,069 --> 02:03:09,079
in the 90s that basically penalized uh
 

6705
02:03:09,079 --> 02:03:12,030
in the 90s that basically penalized uh
crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty

6706
02:03:12,030 --> 02:03:12,040
crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty
 

6707
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:15,149
crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty
of what uh regular cocaine was and I

6708
02:03:15,149 --> 02:03:15,159
of what uh regular cocaine was and I
 

6709
02:03:15,159 --> 02:03:16,790
of what uh regular cocaine was and I
think a lot of the motivations what

6710
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
think a lot of the motivations what
 

6711
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,189
think a lot of the motivations what
people say in retrospect was that was

6712
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
people say in retrospect was that was
 

6713
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:21,030
people say in retrospect was that was
more of a black drug drug and cocaine

6714
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
more of a black drug drug and cocaine
 

6715
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:23,229
more of a black drug drug and cocaine
was more of a white drug and so there

6716
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:23,239
was more of a white drug and so there
 

6717
02:03:23,239 --> 02:03:25,229
was more of a white drug and so there
was a really racial disparity in terms

6718
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:25,239
was a really racial disparity in terms
 

6719
02:03:25,239 --> 02:03:27,069
was a really racial disparity in terms
of what the application of these

6720
02:03:27,069 --> 02:03:27,079
of what the application of these
 

6721
02:03:27,079 --> 02:03:30,229
of what the application of these
sentences were so um they they then

6722
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:30,239
sentences were so um they they then
 

6723
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:32,550
sentences were so um they they then
revised that to make it 18 to1 and what

6724
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
revised that to make it 18 to1 and what
 

6725
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,350
revised that to make it 18 to1 and what
we did in this bill is we allowed it to

6726
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:34,360
we did in this bill is we allowed it to
 

6727
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:37,069
we did in this bill is we allowed it to
go retroactive to allow people who were

6728
02:03:37,069 --> 02:03:37,079
go retroactive to allow people who were
 

6729
02:03:37,079 --> 02:03:40,030
go retroactive to allow people who were
in prison with sentences under the what

6730
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:40,040
in prison with sentences under the what
 

6731
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:42,149
in prison with sentences under the what
we thought was the racist law to be able

6732
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:42,159
we thought was the racist law to be able
 

6733
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:43,910
we thought was the racist law to be able
to make an application to a judge in

6734
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
to make an application to a judge in
 

6735
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,310
to make an application to a judge in
order to be dismissed and it was based

6736
02:03:45,310 --> 02:03:45,320
order to be dismissed and it was based
 

6737
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:48,870
order to be dismissed and it was based
on good behavior um you know being re

6738
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
on good behavior um you know being re
 

6739
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,270
on good behavior um you know being re
abilitate and the fact that they would

6740
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,280
abilitate and the fact that they would
 

6741
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,870
abilitate and the fact that they would
have a low probability of offending in

6742
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:51,880
have a low probability of offending in
 

6743
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,709
have a low probability of offending in
the future and so that was really the

6744
02:03:53,709 --> 02:03:53,719
the future and so that was really the
 

6745
02:03:53,719 --> 02:03:54,990
the future and so that was really the
meat of it and there was a couple other

6746
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:55,000
meat of it and there was a couple other
 

6747
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,310
meat of it and there was a couple other
things in there we did as well which

6748
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,320
things in there we did as well which
 

6749
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:59,990
things in there we did as well which
were also uh quite good so uh we did it

6750
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:00,000
were also uh quite good so uh we did it
 

6751
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,430
were also uh quite good so uh we did it
um worked very closely with the

6752
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
um worked very closely with the
 

6753
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,990
um worked very closely with the
Democrats Republicans uh to do it at

6754
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
Democrats Republicans uh to do it at
 

6755
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,390
Democrats Republicans uh to do it at
first president Trump was a little bit

6756
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:05,400
first president Trump was a little bit
 

6757
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,310
first president Trump was a little bit
skeptical of it because he's a big

6758
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:07,320
skeptical of it because he's a big
 

6759
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,709
skeptical of it because he's a big
strong Law and Order uh supporter but he

6760
02:04:09,709 --> 02:04:09,719
strong Law and Order uh supporter but he
 

6761
02:04:09,719 --> 02:04:11,870
strong Law and Order uh supporter but he
made me work very hard to put together a

6762
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:11,880
made me work very hard to put together a
 

6763
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,510
made me work very hard to put together a
coalition of Republicans and Democrats

6764
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:14,520
coalition of Republicans and Democrats
 

6765
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,069
coalition of Republicans and Democrats
and law enforcement we had the support

6766
02:04:16,069 --> 02:04:16,079
and law enforcement we had the support
 

6767
02:04:16,079 --> 02:04:19,069
and law enforcement we had the support
from uh from the the the the the

6768
02:04:19,069 --> 02:04:19,079
from uh from the the the the the
 

6769
02:04:19,079 --> 02:04:20,390
from uh from the the the the the
policemen we had the support from the

6770
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:20,400
policemen we had the support from the
 

6771
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,629
policemen we had the support from the
ACLU and ultimately we were able to get

6772
02:04:22,629 --> 02:04:22,639
ACLU and ultimately we were able to get
 

6773
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:24,709
ACLU and ultimately we were able to get
it together and it was an amazing thing

6774
02:04:24,709 --> 02:04:24,719
it together and it was an amazing thing
 

6775
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:26,430
it together and it was an amazing thing
we ended up getting 87 votes in the

6776
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:26,440
we ended up getting 87 votes in the
 

6777
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:29,910
we ended up getting 87 votes in the
Senate um you know this was happened for

6778
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:29,920
Senate um you know this was happened for
 

6779
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,669
Senate um you know this was happened for
me at a time um it was while the Russia

6780
02:04:32,669 --> 02:04:32,679
me at a time um it was while the Russia
 

6781
02:04:32,679 --> 02:04:34,910
me at a time um it was while the Russia
investigation stuff was still happening

6782
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:34,920
investigation stuff was still happening
 

6783
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,830
investigation stuff was still happening
uh new Chief of Staff came in John Kelly

6784
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:36,840
uh new Chief of Staff came in John Kelly
 

6785
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,069
uh new Chief of Staff came in John Kelly
he basically marginalized me in the

6786
02:04:39,069 --> 02:04:39,079
he basically marginalized me in the
 

6787
02:04:39,079 --> 02:04:40,830
he basically marginalized me in the
operations so I had kind of less

6788
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:40,840
operations so I had kind of less
 

6789
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,510
operations so I had kind of less
day-to-day responsibilities in the White

6790
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:42,520
day-to-day responsibilities in the White
 

6791
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,990
day-to-day responsibilities in the White
House and so for me this effort became

6792
02:04:44,990 --> 02:04:45,000
House and so for me this effort became
 

6793
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,270
House and so for me this effort became
one of my full-time efforts along with

6794
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:47,280
one of my full-time efforts along with
 

6795
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,350
one of my full-time efforts along with
uh negotiating the Mexico trade deal and

6796
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:49,360
uh negotiating the Mexico trade deal and
 

6797
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,549
uh negotiating the Mexico trade deal and
along with the Middle East efforts and

6798
02:04:51,549 --> 02:04:51,559
along with the Middle East efforts and
 

6799
02:04:51,559 --> 02:04:53,149
along with the Middle East efforts and
the reason why that was great was

6800
02:04:53,149 --> 02:04:53,159
the reason why that was great was
 

6801
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:55,470
the reason why that was great was
because it didn't have a lot of support

6802
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:55,480
because it didn't have a lot of support
 

6803
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,830
because it didn't have a lot of support
uh from the Republican caucus originally

6804
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:57,840
uh from the Republican caucus originally
 

6805
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,189
uh from the Republican caucus originally
and people thought there was no way it

6806
02:04:59,189 --> 02:04:59,199
and people thought there was no way it
 

6807
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:01,470
and people thought there was no way it
would happen so I really was able to be

6808
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:01,480
would happen so I really was able to be
 

6809
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:04,470
would happen so I really was able to be
the chief executive the middle executive

6810
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,480
the chief executive the middle executive
 

6811
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,830
the chief executive the middle executive
the low executive the intern and through

6812
02:05:06,830 --> 02:05:06,840
the low executive the intern and through
 

6813
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,549
the low executive the intern and through
that process I really got an education

6814
02:05:09,549 --> 02:05:09,559
that process I really got an education
 

6815
02:05:09,559 --> 02:05:11,350
that process I really got an education
on how Congress works on how to pass

6816
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
on how Congress works on how to pass
 

6817
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,790

02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:37,760
like that kind
 

7129
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:41,629
like that kind
of humility is is required to be a great

7130
02:10:41,629 --> 02:10:41,639
of humility is is required to be a great
 

7131
02:10:41,639 --> 02:10:43,589
of humility is is required to be a great
leader and I feel like that's actually a

7132
02:10:43,589 --> 02:10:43,599
leader and I feel like that's actually a
 

7133
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:46,830
leader and I feel like that's actually a
good way to have long-term power because

7134
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:46,840
good way to have long-term power because
 

7135
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:49,990
good way to have long-term power because
karma has a viral aspect to it just

7136
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,000
karma has a viral aspect to it just
 

7137
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,750
karma has a viral aspect to it just
doing good by others I feel like is uh

7138
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:53,760
doing good by others I feel like is uh
 

7139
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,109
doing good by others I feel like is uh
I'd like to say that's true Lex I I

7140
02:10:56,109 --> 02:10:56,119
I'd like to say that's true Lex I I
 

7141
02:10:56,119 --> 02:10:58,629
I'd like to say that's true Lex I I
think it's just way more complicated I

7142
02:10:58,629 --> 02:10:58,639
think it's just way more complicated I
 

7143
02:10:58,639 --> 02:10:59,910
think it's just way more complicated I
mean you look what happened this week

7144
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
mean you look what happened this week
 

7145
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,149
mean you look what happened this week
with with Kevin McCarthy right he did

7146
02:11:02,149 --> 02:11:02,159
with with Kevin McCarthy right he did
 

7147
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:05,030
with with Kevin McCarthy right he did
what he thought was morally right um he

7148
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
what he thought was morally right um he
 

7149
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:06,549
what he thought was morally right um he
thought you know he did a bipartisan

7150
02:11:06,549 --> 02:11:06,559
thought you know he did a bipartisan
 

7151
02:11:06,559 --> 02:11:08,709
thought you know he did a bipartisan
deal uh he was told that you know they

7152
02:11:08,709 --> 02:11:08,719
deal uh he was told that you know they
 

7153
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:10,310
deal uh he was told that you know they
would have his back and then the moment

7154
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,320
would have his back and then the moment
 

7155
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:11,990
would have his back and then the moment
things got tough they they cut him loose

7156
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,000
things got tough they they cut him loose
 

7157
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,709
things got tough they they cut him loose
so again I don't know if that's that's

7158
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
so again I don't know if that's that's
 

7159
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:16,030
so again I don't know if that's that's
if that was the right thing or the wrong

7160
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:16,040
if that was the right thing or the wrong
 

7161
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,549
if that was the right thing or the wrong
thing right I've also seen leaders on

7162
02:11:17,549 --> 02:11:17,559
thing right I've also seen leaders on
 

7163
02:11:17,559 --> 02:11:19,589
thing right I've also seen leaders on
the other ends say I'm going to do

7164
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:19,599
the other ends say I'm going to do
 

7165
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:23,229
the other ends say I'm going to do
things that are shortterm more selfish

7166
02:11:23,229 --> 02:11:23,239
things that are shortterm more selfish
 

7167
02:11:23,239 --> 02:11:25,189
things that are shortterm more selfish
but the way they justify to themselves

7168
02:11:25,189 --> 02:11:25,199
but the way they justify to themselves
 

7169
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:28,270
but the way they justify to themselves
is to say I believe that myelf staying

7170
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:28,280
is to say I believe that myelf staying
 

7171
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,229
is to say I believe that myelf staying
in power is existential to the greater

7172
02:11:31,229 --> 02:11:31,239
in power is existential to the greater
 

7173
02:11:31,239 --> 02:11:33,510
in power is existential to the greater
good so I will do things that maybe are

7174
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:33,520
good so I will do things that maybe are
 

7175
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,830
good so I will do things that maybe are
not in the greater good now because I

7176
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:35,840
not in the greater good now because I
 

7177
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:39,870
not in the greater good now because I
believe that my maintaining power is and

7178
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:39,880
believe that my maintaining power is and
 

7179
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:41,910
believe that my maintaining power is and
so it's it's complicated I in an

7180
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:41,920
so it's it's complicated I in an
 

7181
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:43,390
so it's it's complicated I in an
idealized World I'd love to believe

7182
02:11:43,390 --> 02:11:43,400
idealized World I'd love to believe
 

7183
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,629
idealized World I'd love to believe
that's the case but it's just way more

7184
02:11:45,629 --> 02:11:45,639
that's the case but it's just way more
 

7185
02:11:45,639 --> 02:11:48,589
that's the case but it's just way more
complicated than that yeah I wish it

7186
02:11:48,589 --> 02:11:48,599
complicated than that yeah I wish it
 

7187
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:53,990
complicated than that yeah I wish it
wasn't but it is yeah maybe I I do just

7188
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:54,000
wasn't but it is yeah maybe I I do just
 

7189
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,390
wasn't but it is yeah maybe I I do just
wish people zoomed out when people in

7190
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,400
wish people zoomed out when people in
 

7191
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,229
wish people zoomed out when people in
politics zoomed out a bit and just ask

7192
02:11:58,229 --> 02:11:58,239
politics zoomed out a bit and just ask
 

7193
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,390
politics zoomed out a bit and just ask
themselves what are we all doing this

7194
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:00,400
themselves what are we all doing this
 

7195
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,709
themselves what are we all doing this
for you know like sometimes you can get

7196
02:12:02,709 --> 02:12:02,719
for you know like sometimes you can get
 

7197
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:05,470
for you know like sometimes you can get
like a little bit lost in the game of it

7198
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:05,480
like a little bit lost in the game of it
 

7199
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:07,109
like a little bit lost in the game of it
if you zoom out you realize like

7200
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:07,119
if you zoom out you realize like
 

7201
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:08,870
if you zoom out you realize like
Integrity is way more

7202
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
Integrity is way more
 

7203
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,790
Integrity is way more
important than like little gains of

7204
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:11,800
important than like little gains of
 

7205
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:14,830
important than like little gains of
money or little gains in power in the

7206
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:14,840
money or little gains in power in the
 

7207
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:16,549
money or little gains in power in the
long term just when you look yourself in

7208
02:12:16,549 --> 02:12:16,559
long term just when you look yourself in
 

7209
02:12:16,559 --> 02:12:18,790
long term just when you look yourself in
the mirror at the end of the day

7210
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:18,800
the mirror at the end of the day
 

7211
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,549
the mirror at the end of the day
and also how history remembers you I

7212
02:12:22,549 --> 02:12:22,559
and also how history remembers you I
 

7213
02:12:22,559 --> 02:12:26,310
and also how history remembers you I
just feel like people do some dark stuff

7214
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:26,320
just feel like people do some dark stuff
 

7215
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,830
just feel like people do some dark stuff
when they're like in that moment when

7216
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
when they're like in that moment when
 

7217
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,350
when they're like in that moment when
they're losing power and they try to

7218
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:30,360
they're losing power and they try to
 

7219
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,910
they're losing power and they try to
hold on a little too hard MH this is

7220
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:32,920
hold on a little too hard MH this is
 

7221
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:34,870
hold on a little too hard MH this is
when this is when they can do really

7222
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:34,880
when this is when they can do really
 

7223
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,589
when this is when they can do really
dark things like bring out the worst in

7224
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
dark things like bring out the worst in
 

7225
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:40,510
dark things like bring out the worst in
themselves and it's just sad to see and

7226
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:40,520
themselves and it's just sad to see and
 

7227
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,910
themselves and it's just sad to see and
I wish there was a kind of Machinery of

7228
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:42,920
I wish there was a kind of Machinery of
 

7229
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,669
I wish there was a kind of Machinery of
government would inspire people to be

7230
02:12:45,669 --> 02:12:45,679
government would inspire people to be
 

7231
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:47,990
government would inspire people to be
their best selves in their last days or

7232
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
their best selves in their last days or
 

7233
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,390
their best selves in their last days or
versus the war cells right when that

7234
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:50,400
versus the war cells right when that
 

7235
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,189
versus the war cells right when that
system gets invented you know you'll

7236
02:12:52,189 --> 02:12:52,199
system gets invented you know you'll
 

7237
02:12:52,199 --> 02:12:54,069
system gets invented you know you'll
you'll share with me what it is but it's

7238
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:54,079
you'll share with me what it is but it's
 

7239
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:55,870
you'll share with me what it is but it's
uh look let me give you another way to

7240
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:55,880
uh look let me give you another way to
 

7241
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:57,910
uh look let me give you another way to
frame it which is and this was kind of

7242
02:12:57,910 --> 02:12:57,920
frame it which is and this was kind of
 

7243
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:00,470
frame it which is and this was kind of
the the revelation we spoke before about

7244
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:00,480
the the revelation we spoke before about
 

7245
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,629
the the revelation we spoke before about
you know kind of when I was getting my

7246
02:13:01,629 --> 02:13:01,639
you know kind of when I was getting my
 

7247
02:13:01,639 --> 02:13:03,430
you know kind of when I was getting my
butt kicked by the russan investigation

7248
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:03,440
butt kicked by the russan investigation
 

7249
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,030
butt kicked by the russan investigation
and all the different areas but kind of

7250
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:06,040
and all the different areas but kind of
 

7251
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:07,709
and all the different areas but kind of
the basic framework I looked at was I

7252
02:13:07,709 --> 02:13:07,719
the basic framework I looked at was I
 

7253
02:13:07,719 --> 02:13:10,310
the basic framework I looked at was I
said okay you know this all feels tough

7254
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:10,320
said okay you know this all feels tough
 

7255
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,510
said okay you know this all feels tough
but I said the game's the game The

7256
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
but I said the game's the game The
 

7257
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,109
but I said the game's the game The
Game's been here you know way longer you

7258
02:13:14,109 --> 02:13:14,119
Game's been here you know way longer you
 

7259
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:15,990
Game's been here you know way longer you
know way before I came and it'll be here

7260
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,000
know way before I came and it'll be here
 

7261
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,470
know way before I came and it'll be here
way long after I leave

7262
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
way long after I leave
 

7263
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,470
way long after I leave
and so I have two choices I can complain

7264
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:20,480
and so I have two choices I can complain
 

7265
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:22,109
and so I have two choices I can complain
that the game's tough it's not fair it's

7266
02:13:22,109 --> 02:13:22,119
that the game's tough it's not fair it's
 

7267
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:24,229
that the game's tough it's not fair it's
not moral or I can go and I can try to

7268
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
not moral or I can go and I can try to
 

7269
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,149
not moral or I can go and I can try to
play the game as hard as possible and I

7270
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
play the game as hard as possible and I
 

7271
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,149
play the game as hard as possible and I
think that there's two different things

7272
02:13:28,149 --> 02:13:28,159
think that there's two different things
 

7273
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:29,470
think that there's two different things
right you have people who are willing to

7274
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:29,480
right you have people who are willing to
 

7275
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,950
right you have people who are willing to
kind of sit in the stands and they're

7276
02:13:30,950 --> 02:13:30,960
kind of sit in the stands and they're
 

7277
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:33,629
kind of sit in the stands and they're
willing to yell at the Players

7278
02:13:33,629 --> 02:13:33,639
willing to yell at the Players
 

7279
02:13:33,639 --> 02:13:37,430
willing to yell at the Players

02:14:10,189 --> 02:14:10,199
collusion accusation the virality the
 

7315
02:14:10,199 --> 02:14:11,750
collusion accusation the virality the
power of that that's a really

7316
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:11,760
power of that that's a really
 

7317
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,229
power of that that's a really
discouraging thing for for people maybe

7318
02:14:14,229 --> 02:14:14,239
discouraging thing for for people maybe
 

7319
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:16,350
discouraging thing for for people maybe
it's the way it has to be but it's it's

7320
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:16,360
it's the way it has to be but it's it's
 

7321
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:19,030
it's the way it has to be but it's it's
it seems like a disincentive people uh

7322
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,040
it seems like a disincentive people uh
 

7323
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,149
it seems like a disincentive people uh
to participate it it is but I'll give

7324
02:14:21,149 --> 02:14:21,159
to participate it it is but I'll give
 

7325
02:14:21,159 --> 02:14:23,270
to participate it it is but I'll give
you again an optimistic side of it is

7326
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:23,280
you again an optimistic side of it is
 

7327
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,870
you again an optimistic side of it is
that you know what you're seeing now

7328
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:24,880
that you know what you're seeing now
 

7329
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,270
that you know what you're seeing now
with social media is I do think with

7330
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
with social media is I do think with
 

7331
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:30,470
with social media is I do think with
what's Happ happening at X there is now

7332
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
what's Happ happening at X there is now
 

7333
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,189
what's Happ happening at X there is now
more of a reversion towards more

7334
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:32,199
more of a reversion towards more
 

7335
02:14:32,199 --> 02:14:36,270
more of a reversion towards more
egalitarian right and egalitarianism of

7336
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:36,280
egalitarian right and egalitarianism of
 

7337
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:39,350
egalitarian right and egalitarianism of
information and so for many years the

7338
02:14:39,350 --> 02:14:39,360
information and so for many years the
 

7339
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,030
information and so for many years the
media Publications were the gate holders

7340
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:42,040
media Publications were the gate holders
 

7341
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:43,990
media Publications were the gate holders
they were The Gatekeepers and then you

7342
02:14:43,990 --> 02:14:44,000
they were The Gatekeepers and then you
 

7343
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,750
they were The Gatekeepers and then you
had these social media companies that

7344
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:45,760
had these social media companies that
 

7345
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,189
had these social media companies that
grew they became so powerful but then

7346
02:14:48,189 --> 02:14:48,199
grew they became so powerful but then
 

7347
02:14:48,199 --> 02:14:49,870
grew they became so powerful but then
they were tilting the scales why they

7348
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:49,880
they were tilting the scales why they
 

7349
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:52,669
they were tilting the scales why they
were doing it you know we can go through

7350
02:14:52,669 --> 02:14:52,679
were doing it you know we can go through
 

7351
02:14:52,679 --> 02:14:55,030
were doing it you know we can go through
long explanations for that but if there

7352
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
long explanations for that but if there
 

7353
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,790
long explanations for that but if there
truly is a real forum and a

7354
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
truly is a real forum and a
 

7355
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,870
truly is a real forum and a
democratization of of information then

7356
02:14:58,870 --> 02:14:58,880
democratization of of information then
 

7357
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,270
democratization of of information then
you would think that the marketplace of

7358
02:15:00,270 --> 02:15:00,280
you would think that the marketplace of
 

7359
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:02,149
you would think that the marketplace of
ideas would surface the real ones and

7360
02:15:02,149 --> 02:15:02,159
ideas would surface the real ones and
 

7361
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:04,270
ideas would surface the real ones and
discredit the non-real ones and I think

7362
02:15:04,270 --> 02:15:04,280
discredit the non-real ones and I think
 

7363
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:06,030
discredit the non-real ones and I think
that as a society we're starting to kind

7364
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:06,040
that as a society we're starting to kind
 

7365
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:08,109
that as a society we're starting to kind
of come to grips with the fact that the

7366
02:15:08,109 --> 02:15:08,119
of come to grips with the fact that the
 

7367
02:15:08,119 --> 02:15:11,270
of come to grips with the fact that the
power Dynamic is changing and that some

7368
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:11,280
power Dynamic is changing and that some
 

7369
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:12,870
power Dynamic is changing and that some
of these institutions that we used to

7370
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:12,880
of these institutions that we used to
 

7371
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,030
of these institutions that we used to
have a lot of faith in don't deserve our

7372
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:15,040
have a lot of faith in don't deserve our
 

7373
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,510
have a lot of faith in don't deserve our
faith and some of them you know will

7374
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:16,520
faith and some of them you know will
 

7375
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:18,669
faith and some of them you know will
actually reform and maybe earn our faith

7376
02:15:18,669 --> 02:15:18,679
actually reform and maybe earn our faith
 

7377
02:15:18,679 --> 02:15:20,910
actually reform and maybe earn our faith
so I think that there there there could

7378
02:15:20,910 --> 02:15:20,920
so I think that there there there could
 

7379
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:22,669
so I think that there there there could
be an optimistic tone again the the

7380
02:15:22,669 --> 02:15:22,679
be an optimistic tone again the the
 

7381
02:15:22,679 --> 02:15:25,109
be an optimistic tone again the the
years of trump I think that you know he

7382
02:15:25,109 --> 02:15:25,119
years of trump I think that you know he
 

7383
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:26,310
years of trump I think that you know he
was an

7384
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,320
was an
 

7385
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,910
was an
outsider and you know he represented

7386
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:28,920
outsider and you know he represented
 

7387
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,390
outsider and you know he represented
something that was existential for this

7388
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:30,400
something that was existential for this
 

7389
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,470
something that was existential for this
to the system right you think about for

7390
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:32,480
to the system right you think about for
 

7391
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,390
to the system right you think about for
the 30 years before you were either part

7392
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,400
the 30 years before you were either part
 

7393
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,990
the 30 years before you were either part
of you know the Clinton Dynasty or the

7394
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:36,000
of you know the Clinton Dynasty or the
 

7395
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,310
of you know the Clinton Dynasty or the
bush Dynasty I think a lot of people in

7396
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:38,320
bush Dynasty I think a lot of people in
 

7397
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,589
bush Dynasty I think a lot of people in
the country felt like that whole class

7398
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:41,599
the country felt like that whole class
 

7399
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:42,830
the country felt like that whole class
whether you wearing a red shirt or a

7400
02:15:42,830 --> 02:15:42,840
whether you wearing a red shirt or a
 

7401
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,549
whether you wearing a red shirt or a
blue shirt wasn't representing them and

7402
02:15:45,549 --> 02:15:45,559
blue shirt wasn't representing them and
 

7403
02:15:45,559 --> 02:15:47,589
blue shirt wasn't representing them and
Trump represented a true Outsider to

7404
02:15:47,589 --> 02:15:47,599
Trump represented a true Outsider to
 

7405
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:50,549
Trump represented a true Outsider to
that system and I do think that as he

7406
02:15:50,549 --> 02:15:50,559
that system and I do think that as he
 

7407
02:15:50,559 --> 02:15:52,910
that system and I do think that as he
went in there there was a lot of norms

7408
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:52,920
went in there there was a lot of norms
 

7409
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:55,430
went in there there was a lot of norms
that were broken to try to stop him from

7410
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:55,440
that were broken to try to stop him from
 

7411
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,510
that were broken to try to stop him from
changing the traditional power structure

7412
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
changing the traditional power structure
 

7413
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,750
changing the traditional power structure
so I think that we're at a time where

7414
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:00,760
so I think that we're at a time where
 

7415
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:03,830
so I think that we're at a time where
maybe there will be an optimistic

7416
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:03,840
maybe there will be an optimistic
 

7417
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,149
maybe there will be an optimistic
breakthrough where you'll have

7418
02:16:05,149 --> 02:16:05,159
breakthrough where you'll have
 

7419
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:07,910
breakthrough where you'll have
institutions that will allow for a lot

7420
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:07,920
institutions that will allow for a lot
 

7421
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,549
institutions that will allow for a lot
more transparency into what truth really

7422
02:16:11,549 --> 02:16:11,559
more transparency into what truth really
 

7423
02:16:11,559 --> 02:16:14,310
more transparency into what truth really

02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:27,790
don't know what you're doing you're
wasting your time and I basically was at

7894
02:24:27,790 --> 02:24:27,800
wasting your time and I basically was at
 

7895
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:30,269
wasting your time and I basically was at
a point where I said look guys but

7896
02:24:30,269 --> 02:24:30,279
a point where I said look guys but
 

7897
02:24:30,279 --> 02:24:31,590
a point where I said look guys but
they're saying they want to do all these

7898
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,600
they're saying they want to do all these
 

7899
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:33,070
they're saying they want to do all these
things shouldn't we at least give them a

7900
02:24:33,070 --> 02:24:33,080
things shouldn't we at least give them a
 

7901
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:35,070
things shouldn't we at least give them a
chance to try to do it like why do we

7902
02:24:35,070 --> 02:24:35,080
chance to try to do it like why do we
 

7903
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:36,389
chance to try to do it like why do we
want to

7904
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:36,399
want to
 

7905
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:39,510
want to
predetermine their their their Direction

7906
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,520
predetermine their their their Direction
 

7907
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,230
predetermine their their their Direction
by not giving them a chance to change

7908
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:41,240
by not giving them a chance to change
 

7909
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:42,590
by not giving them a chance to change
just because things in the past haven't

7910
02:24:42,590 --> 02:24:42,600
just because things in the past haven't
 

7911
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,389
just because things in the past haven't
gotten the way you want them to that

7912
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
gotten the way you want them to that
 

7913
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,830
gotten the way you want them to that
doesn't mean they can't go that way in

7914
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:45,840
doesn't mean they can't go that way in
 

7915
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:48,150
doesn't mean they can't go that way in
the future so we fought the Battle you

7916
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:48,160
the future so we fought the Battle you
 

7917
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:50,070
the future so we fought the Battle you
know they basically deferred and uh and

7918
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:50,080
know they basically deferred and uh and
 

7919
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,750
know they basically deferred and uh and
let me go through with it but when I do

7920
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:51,760
let me go through with it but when I do
 

7921
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:52,950
let me go through with it but when I do
the planning meetings for the trip

7922
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:52,960
the planning meetings for the trip
 

7923
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,429
the planning meetings for the trip
nobody would show up because they all

7924
02:24:54,429 --> 02:24:54,439
nobody would show up because they all
 

7925
02:24:54,439 --> 02:24:55,590
nobody would show up because they all
thought it was going to be an absolute

7926
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
thought it was going to be an absolute
 

7927
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:57,309
thought it was going to be an absolute
disaster and by the way they probably

7928
02:24:57,309 --> 02:24:57,319
disaster and by the way they probably
 

7929
02:24:57,319 --> 02:24:58,510
disaster and by the way they probably
weren't wrong to think that because I'd

7930
02:24:58,510 --> 02:24:58,520
weren't wrong to think that because I'd
 

7931
02:24:58,520 --> 02:24:59,950
weren't wrong to think that because I'd
never planned a foreign trip before and

7932
02:24:59,950 --> 02:24:59,960
never planned a foreign trip before and
 

7933
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:02,469
never planned a foreign trip before and
I'd never done any foreign policy before

7934
02:25:02,469 --> 02:25:02,479
I'd never done any foreign policy before
 

7935
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:04,269
I'd never done any foreign policy before
so during the planning I'd speak to MBS

7936
02:25:04,269 --> 02:25:04,279
so during the planning I'd speak to MBS
 

7937
02:25:04,279 --> 02:25:06,670
so during the planning I'd speak to MBS
almost every day and I'd go through all

7938
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:06,680
almost every day and I'd go through all
 

7939
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,150
almost every day and I'd go through all
the different details and the things

7940
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:08,160
the different details and the things
 

7941
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:09,990
the different details and the things
that uh would be coming up and I said

7942
02:25:09,990 --> 02:25:10,000
that uh would be coming up and I said
 

7943
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,150
that uh would be coming up and I said
look I really need to get these things

7944
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:11,160
look I really need to get these things
 

7945
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:13,750
look I really need to get these things

in writing he sent over a guy Dr mad El
 

7947

them and he came to Washington stayed

7950
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:18,640
them and he came to Washington stayed
 

7951
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:20,590
them and he came to Washington stayed
for 3 weeks and we worked through all

7952
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:20,600
for 3 weeks and we worked through all
 

7953
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,790
for 3 weeks and we worked through all
the different details of what we needed

7954
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:22,800
the different details of what we needed
 

7955
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,670
the different details of what we needed
and we ended up coming to an arrangement

7956
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:24,680
and we ended up coming to an arrangement
 

7957
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:26,790
and we ended up coming to an arrangement
on what it should be so you know I think

7958
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
on what it should be so you know I think
 

7959
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:30,469
on what it should be so you know I think
about now in retrospect why I was so

7960
02:25:30,469 --> 02:25:30,479
about now in retrospect why I was so
 

7961
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:32,429
about now in retrospect why I was so
focused on getting things like this done

7962
02:25:32,429 --> 02:25:32,439
focused on getting things like this done
 

7963
02:25:32,439 --> 02:25:34,630
focused on getting things like this done
and why I I even believed that they

7964
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:34,640
and why I I even believed that they
 

7965
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:37,510
and why I I even believed that they
could be possible but the answer is is

7966
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:37,520
could be possible but the answer is is
 

7967
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:39,670
could be possible but the answer is is
really the people I was talking to on

7968
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:39,680
really the people I was talking to on
 

7969
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:41,710
really the people I was talking to on
the other end were telling me that these

7970
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:41,720
the other end were telling me that these
 

7971
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,950
the other end were telling me that these
things were possible and so just because

7972
02:25:43,950 --> 02:25:43,960
things were possible and so just because
 

7973
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:46,070
things were possible and so just because
they hadn't been done before and just

7974
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:46,080
they hadn't been done before and just
 

7975
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:48,030
they hadn't been done before and just
because others around me didn't believe

7976
02:25:48,030 --> 02:25:48,040
because others around me didn't believe
 

7977
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:50,349
because others around me didn't believe
that they could be done I wasn't willing

7978
02:25:50,349 --> 02:25:50,359
that they could be done I wasn't willing
 

7979
02:25:50,359 --> 02:25:52,550
that they could be done I wasn't willing
to just say well let's not try it just

7980
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:52,560
to just say well let's not try it just
 

7981
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:56,190
to just say well let's not try it just
seems like that cynicism that takes over

7982
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:56,200
seems like that cynicism that takes over
 

7983
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,870
seems like that cynicism that takes over
is paralyzing and uh you sent me a great

7984
02:25:58,870 --> 02:25:58,880
is paralyzing and uh you sent me a great
 

7985
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:01,830

essay from from Paul Graham I'm a big

7986

essay from from Paul Graham I'm a big
 

7987
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,990
essay from from Paul Graham I'm a big
fan of that I think explains a lot of

7988
02:26:03,990 --> 02:26:04,000
fan of that I think explains a lot of
 

7989
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,590
fan of that I think explains a lot of
your success the essay is called how to

7990
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:06,600
your success the essay is called how to
 

7991
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:09,110
your success the essay is called how to
do great work and people should go

7992
02:26:09,110 --> 02:26:09,120
do great work and people should go
 

7993
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:10,710
do great work and people should go
definitely read the full essay there's a

7994
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
definitely read the full essay there's a
 

7995
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:13,349
definitely read the full essay there's a
few things I could read from it uh some

7996
02:26:13,349 --> 02:26:13,359
few things I could read from it uh some
 

7997
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:15,309

quotes having new ideas is a strange

7998
02:26:15,309 --> 02:26:15,319
quotes having new ideas is a strange
 

7999
02:26:15,319 --> 02:26:17,030
quotes having new ideas is a strange
game because it usually consists of

8000
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:17,040
game because it usually consists of
 

8001
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:18,710
game because it usually consists of
seeing things that were right under your

8002
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:18,720
seeing things that were right under your
 

8003
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:20,950
seeing things that were right under your
nose once you've seen a new idea it

8004
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:20,960
nose once you've seen a new idea it
 

8005
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:23,750
nose once you've seen a new idea it
tends to seem obvious Why did no one

8006
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:23,760
tends to seem obvious Why did no one
 

8007
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,389
tends to seem obvious Why did no one
think of this

8008
02:26:25,389 --> 02:26:25,399
think of this
 

8009
02:26:25,399 --> 02:26:28,469
think of this
before seeing something obvious sounds

8010
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:28,479
before seeing something obvious sounds
 

8011
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,830
before seeing something obvious sounds
easy and yet empirically having new

8012
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:30,840
easy and yet empirically having new
 

8013
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:33,190
easy and yet empirically having new
ideas is hard and like the steps you

8014
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,200
ideas is hard and like the steps you
 

8015
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:36,590
ideas is hard and like the steps you
took seem trivial and yet nobody was

8016
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:36,600
took seem trivial and yet nobody was
 

8017
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,429
took seem trivial and yet nobody was
taking them or at least in the past they

8018
02:26:38,429 --> 02:26:38,439
taking them or at least in the past they
 

8019
02:26:38,439 --> 02:26:40,590
taking them or at least in the past they
weren't successful so the successes

8020
02:26:40,590 --> 02:26:40,600
weren't successful so the successes
 

8021
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:43,030
weren't successful so the successes
you've had were as simple as essentially

8022
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:43,040
you've had were as simple as essentially
 

8023
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:47,110
you've had were as simple as essentially
picking up the phone or trying M um

8024
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:47,120
picking up the phone or trying M um

02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:48,630
picking up the phone or trying M um
there's a lot of interesting things here

8026
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:48,640
there's a lot of interesting things here
 

8027
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:52,389
there's a lot of interesting things here
to talk about this aspect of doing the

8028
02:26:52,389 --> 02:26:52,399
to talk about this aspect of doing the
 

8029
02:26:52,399 --> 02:26:54,790
to talk about this aspect of doing the
seemingly simple that seems to be so

02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:54,800
seemingly simple that seems to be so
 

8031
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:57,910
seemingly simple that seems to be so
hard to do uh it as Paul describes

8032
02:26:57,910 --> 02:26:57,920
hard to do uh it as Paul describes
 

8033
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,510
hard to do uh it as Paul describes
requires a willingness to break rules

8034
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:00,520
requires a willingness to break rules
 

8035
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:01,910
requires a willingness to break rules
there are two ways to be comfortable

8036
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:01,920
there are two ways to be comfortable
 

8037
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,630
there are two ways to be comfortable
breaking rules to enjoy breaking them

8038
02:27:04,630 --> 02:27:04,640
breaking rules to enjoy breaking them
 

8039
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:06,550
breaking rules to enjoy breaking them
and to be indifferent to them that's an

8040
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:06,560
and to be indifferent to them that's an
 

8041
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:08,550
and to be indifferent to them that's an
interesting distinction I call these two

8042
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:08,560
interesting distinction I call these two
 

8043
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,790
interesting distinction I call these two
cases being aggressively and passively

8044
02:27:10,790 --> 02:27:10,800
cases being aggressively and passively
 

8045
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:13,429
cases being aggressively and passively
independent minded so again that's to

8046
02:27:13,429 --> 02:27:13,439

now and I just loved it but when we were

8118
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:35,960
now and I just loved it but when we were
 

8119
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:39,230
now and I just loved it but when we were
talking about uh why certain people who

8120
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:39,240
talking about uh why certain people who
 

8121
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:41,030
talking about uh why certain people who
don't have traditional qualifications

work and solve complex problems it made

8126
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:46,240
work and solve complex problems it made
 

8127
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:47,630
work and solve complex problems it made
me think of of that essay which is why I

8128
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:47,640
me think of of that essay which is why I
 

8129
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:50,150
me think of of that essay which is why I
shared it and I I think that in the

8130
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
shared it and I I think that in the
 

8131
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,710
shared it and I I think that in the
context of the work that I was doing

8132
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:52,720
context of the work that I was doing
 

8133
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:55,750
context of the work that I was doing
here uh perhaps not having the

8134
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:55,760
here uh perhaps not having the
 

8135
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,790
here uh perhaps not having the
historical context uh became an

8136
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:57,800
historical context uh became an
 

8137
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:59,990
historical context uh became an
advantage and obviously went back and

8138
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,000
advantage and obviously went back and
 

8139
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,309
advantage and obviously went back and
then tried to study it but you if you go

8140
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:02,319
then tried to study it but you if you go
 

8141
02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:04,110
then tried to study it but you if you go
into a problem I always find that

8142
02:29:04,110 --> 02:29:04,120
into a problem I always find that
 

8143
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:06,309
into a problem I always find that
especially in the political realm my

8144
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:06,319
especially in the political realm my
 

8145
02:29:06,319 --> 02:29:08,870
especially in the political realm my
favorite um political issues are ones

8146
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:08,880
favorite um political issues are ones
 

8147
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,990
favorite um political issues are ones
where they're contrarian by being

8148
02:29:10,990 --> 02:29:11,000
where they're contrarian by being
 

8149
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,230
where they're contrarian by being
obvious and you know sometimes they feel

8150
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:13,240
obvious and you know sometimes they feel
 

8151
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:15,429
obvious and you know sometimes they feel
very intuitive and so you take them on

8152
02:29:15,429 --> 02:29:15,439
very intuitive and so you take them on
 

8153
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:17,070
very intuitive and so you take them on
there's always a lot of resistance when

8154
02:29:17,070 --> 02:29:17,080
there's always a lot of resistance when
 

8155
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:18,830
there's always a lot of resistance when
you go against something that's been

8156
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:18,840
you go against something that's been
 

8157
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:21,510
you go against something that's been
accepted um as the way that you're

8158
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:21,520
accepted um as the way that you're
 

8159
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:24,830
accepted um as the way that you're
supposed to do things um and I came to

8160
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:24,840
supposed to do things um and I came to
 

8161
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,269
supposed to do things um and I came to
learn over the course of my time in

8162
02:29:26,269 --> 02:29:26,279
learn over the course of my time in
 

8163
02:29:26,279 --> 02:29:28,269
learn over the course of my time in
government that when everyone was

8164
02:29:28,269 --> 02:29:28,279
government that when everyone was
 

8165
02:29:28,279 --> 02:29:30,309
government that when everyone was
agreeing with what I was doing then it

8166
02:29:30,309 --> 02:29:30,319
agreeing with what I was doing then it
 

8167
02:29:30,319 --> 02:29:32,550
agreeing with what I was doing then it
actually made me more nervous because I

8168
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,560
actually made me more nervous because I
 

8169
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,670
actually made me more nervous because I
felt like you have these problems they

8170
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:34,680
felt like you have these problems they
 

8171
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:36,870
felt like you have these problems they
haven't been solved for a long time and

8172
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:36,880
haven't been solved for a long time and
 

8173
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:38,550
haven't been solved for a long time and
then if you take the same approach as

8174
02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:38,560
then if you take the same approach as
 

8175
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,910
then if you take the same approach as
others you're going to fail just like

8176
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:39,920
others you're going to fail just like
 

8177
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:42,309
others you're going to fail just like
they did so taking a different approach

8178
02:29:42,309 --> 02:29:42,319
they did so taking a different approach
 

8179
02:29:42,319 --> 02:29:43,910
they did so taking a different approach
doesn't mean you're going to succeed but

8180
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:43,920
doesn't mean you're going to succeed but
 

8181
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:45,550
doesn't mean you're going to succeed but
at least if you fail you're going to

8182
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:45,560
at least if you fail you're going to
 

8183
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:49,349
at least if you fail you're going to
fail in an original way and so I did

8184
02:29:49,349 --> 02:29:49,359
fail in an original way and so I did
 

8185
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:52,750
fail in an original way and so I did
like this a lot and I I think that um

8186
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:52,760
like this a lot and I I think that um
 

8187
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:54,469
like this a lot and I I think that um
you know what I saw was the people who

8188
02:29:54,469 --> 02:29:54,479
you know what I saw was the people who
 

8189
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:56,230
you know what I saw was the people who
were very good at getting things done

8190
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:56,240
were very good at getting things done
 

8191
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:58,710
were very good at getting things done
that hadn't been done before were people

8192
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
that hadn't been done before were people
 

8193
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,510
that hadn't been done before were people
who came with different qualifications

8194
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:00,520
who came with different qualifications
 

8195
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:02,710
who came with different qualifications
different perspectives and they came in

8196
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:02,720
different perspectives and they came in
 

8197
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:04,349
different perspectives and they came in
and and really work the problem in

8198
02:30:04,349 --> 02:30:04,359
and and really work the problem in
 

8199
02:30:04,359 --> 02:30:06,750
and and really work the problem in
untraditional ways and so I think in the

8200
02:30:06,750 --> 02:30:06,760
untraditional ways and so I think in the
 

8201
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:08,830
untraditional ways and so I think in the
Middle East I came in with a very

8202
02:30:08,830 --> 02:30:08,840

8203
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:10,910
Middle East I came in with a very
different approach than people before me

8204
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:10,920
different approach than people before me
 

8205
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:12,389
different approach than people before me
not because I came in deliberately

understand from people why the problem
 

8213

understand from people why the problem
hadn't been solved and then think from a

well so if we can create a a security
architecture for that region and then we

8390
02:33:29,910 --> 02:33:29,920
architecture for that region and then we
 

8391
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,230
architecture for that region and then we
can create economic integration between

8392

8497
02:35:29,479 --> 02:35:33,070
that can take off and take such a long
time to repair and you've worked with

8498
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:33,080
time to repair and you've worked with
 

8499
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:34,670
time to repair and you've worked with
this in the Middle East with Israel and

8500
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:34,680
this in the Middle East with Israel and
 

8501

so on how the
 

8503
02:35:37,479 --> 02:35:41,110
so on how the

history the narratives the stories they
 

8505
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:43,110
history the narratives the stories they
they kind of have this momentum that's

8506
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
they kind of have this momentum that's
 

8507
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,950
they kind of have this momentum that's
so hard to

8508
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:44,960
so hard to
 

8509
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:47,510

of lessons from that just how much of a
dramatic impact it had on creating

8524
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:09,760
dramatic impact it had on creating
 

8525
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,590
dramatic impact it had on creating
tension between the United States and

8526
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:11,600
tension between the United States and
 

8527
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:13,830
tension between the United States and
Saudi and in general in the Middle East

Saudi and in general in the Middle East
 

8529

02:36:14,910 --> 02:36:14,920
like
 

8531
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:16,710
like
the

8532
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:16,720
the
 

8533
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:20,990
the
that somehow s's not a friend but is

8534
02:36:20,990 --> 02:36:21,000
that somehow s's not a friend but is
 

8535
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,830
that somehow s's not a friend but is
against the ideals and the values of the

8536
02:36:22,830 --> 02:36:22,840
against the ideals and the values of the
 

8537
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:25,230
against the ideals and the values of the
United States yeah so it it definitely

8538
02:36:25,230 --> 02:36:25,240
United States yeah so it it definitely
 

8539
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:27,309
United States yeah so it it definitely
created massive tension and it became a

8540
02:36:27,309 --> 02:36:27,319
created massive tension and it became a
 

8541
02:36:27,319 --> 02:36:28,389
created massive tension and it became a
very

8542
02:36:28,389 --> 02:36:28,399
very
 

8543
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:30,469
very
high-profile uh action that actually

8544
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
high-profile uh action that actually
 

8545
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,429
high-profile uh action that actually
overshadowed a lot of the good work that

8546
02:36:32,429 --> 02:36:32,439
overshadowed a lot of the good work that
 

8547
02:36:32,439 --> 02:36:34,150
overshadowed a lot of the good work that
was being done in the region and a lot

8548
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:34,160
was being done in the region and a lot
 

8549
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:37,070
was being done in the region and a lot
of the progress we were making but when

8550
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:37,080
of the progress we were making but when
 

8551
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:39,269
of the progress we were making but when
you think about this or you think about

8552
02:36:39,269 --> 02:36:39,279
you think about this or you think about
 

8553
02:36:39,279 --> 02:36:41,830
you think about this or you think about
the other issues that we've gone through

8554
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:41,840
the other issues that we've gone through
 

8555
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,429
the other issues that we've gone through
today I think the general framework that

8556
02:36:44,429 --> 02:36:44,439
today I think the general framework that
 

8557
02:36:44,439 --> 02:36:45,950
today I think the general framework that
I always try to approach things with

8558
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:45,960
I always try to approach things with
 

8559
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,429
I always try to approach things with
with is you can't change what happened

8560
02:36:48,429 --> 02:36:48,439
with is you can't change what happened
 

8561
02:36:48,439 --> 02:36:51,070
with is you can't change what happened
yesterday you can only learn from it and

8562
02:36:51,070 --> 02:36:51,080
yesterday you can only learn from it and
 

8563
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:53,070
yesterday you can only learn from it and
then you can change how you deal with

8564
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:53,080
then you can change how you deal with
 

8565
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:55,469
then you can change how you deal with
tomorrow and when I think about you know

8566
02:36:55,469 --> 02:36:55,479
tomorrow and when I think about you know
 

8567
02:36:55,479 --> 02:36:57,830
tomorrow and when I think about you know
the people in power what do I hope that

8568
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:57,840
the people in power what do I hope that
 

8569
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,710
the people in power what do I hope that
they're spending their time focused on

8570
02:36:59,710 --> 02:36:59,720
they're spending their time focused on
 

8571
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:02,550
they're spending their time focused on
number two basic things number one is

8572
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:02,560
number two basic things number one is
 

8573
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:04,150
number two basic things number one is
how do I create you know Safety and

8574
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
how do I create you know Safety and
 

8575
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:06,950
how do I create you know Safety and
Security for for my people um and and

8576
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:06,960
Security for for my people um and and
 

8577
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:08,950
Security for for my people um and and
for for the world and then how do I give

8578
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:08,960
for for the world and then how do I give
 

8579
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:10,830
for for the world and then how do I give
people the opportunity to live a better

8580
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:10,840
people the opportunity to live a better
 

8581
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:14,150
people the opportunity to live a better
life and so when things like this happen

8582
02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:14,160
life and so when things like this happen
 

8583
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:16,469
life and so when things like this happen
obviously you know there are certain

8584
02:37:16,469 --> 02:37:16,479
obviously you know there are certain
 

8585
02:37:16,479 --> 02:37:18,790
obviously you know there are certain
reactions that are appropriate um but

8586
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:18,800
reactions that are appropriate um but
 

8587
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:21,389
reactions that are appropriate um but
ultimately you have to think through how

8588
02:37:21,389 --> 02:37:21,399
ultimately you have to think through how
 

8589
02:37:21,399 --> 02:37:23,190
ultimately you have to think through how
do you not allow the Paradigm that

8590
02:37:23,190 --> 02:37:23,200
do you not allow the Paradigm that
 

8591
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,230
do you not allow the Paradigm that
you're creating in the world to lead to

8592
02:37:25,230 --> 02:37:25,240
you're creating in the world to lead to
 

8593
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:27,870
you're creating in the world to lead to
worse outcomes than would happen

8594
02:37:27,870 --> 02:37:27,880
worse outcomes than would happen
 

8595
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:29,429
worse outcomes than would happen
otherwise and so when I would think

8596
02:37:29,429 --> 02:37:29,439
otherwise and so when I would think
 

8597
02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:31,309
otherwise and so when I would think
about foreign policy in general one of

8598
02:37:31,309 --> 02:37:31,319
about foreign policy in general one of
 

8599
02:37:31,319 --> 02:37:33,830
about foreign policy in general one of
the differences between foreign policy

8600
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:33,840
the differences between foreign policy
 

8601
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:35,910
the differences between foreign policy
and business is that in business the

8602
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:35,920
and business is that in business the
 

8603
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:37,710
and business is that in business the
conclusion of a problem set you finish a

8604
02:37:37,710 --> 02:37:37,720
conclusion of a problem set you finish a
 

8605
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:39,910
conclusion of a problem set you finish a
deal you either have you know a company

8606
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:39,920
deal you either have you know a company
 

8607
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:42,230
deal you either have you know a company
or a property or if you sell it you have

8608
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:42,240
or a property or if you sell it you have
 

8609
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:43,990
or a property or if you sell it you have
you know less to do and and and more

8610
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:44,000
you know less to do and and and more
 

8611
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,590
you know less to do and and and more
Capital hopefully if it's successful

8612
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:45,600
Capital hopefully if it's successful
 

8613
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,630
Capital hopefully if it's successful
right

8614
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
right
 

8615
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,429
right
in a political deal it's always about

8616
02:37:49,429 --> 02:37:49,439
in a political deal it's always about
 

8617
02:37:49,439 --> 02:37:51,469
in a political deal it's always about
Paradigm so the end of a problem set is

8618
02:37:51,469 --> 02:37:51,479
Paradigm so the end of a problem set is
 

8619
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:53,469
Paradigm so the end of a problem set is
always the beginning of a new paradigm

8620
02:37:53,469 --> 02:37:53,479
always the beginning of a new paradigm
 

8621
02:37:53,479 --> 02:37:55,030
always the beginning of a new paradigm
and you're always thinking through how

8622
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:55,040
and you're always thinking through how
 

8623
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:57,630
and you're always thinking through how
do you create an environment that leads

8624
02:37:57,630 --> 02:37:57,640
do you create an environment that leads
 

8625
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:01,030
do you create an environment that leads
to hopefully the best amount of positive

8626
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:01,040
to hopefully the best amount of positive
 

8627
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,269
to hopefully the best amount of positive
outcomes that could occur versus

8628
02:38:03,269 --> 02:38:03,279
outcomes that could occur versus
 

8629
02:38:03,279 --> 02:38:05,269
outcomes that could occur versus
creating a paradigm that will lead to

8630
02:38:05,269 --> 02:38:05,279
creating a paradigm that will lead to
 

8631
02:38:05,279 --> 02:38:07,870
creating a paradigm that will lead to
negative outcomes so you know bad things

8632
02:38:07,870 --> 02:38:07,880
negative outcomes so you know bad things
 

8633
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:10,950
negative outcomes so you know bad things
happen um you know a lot in the world

8634
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:10,960
happen um you know a lot in the world
 

8635
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:12,750
happen um you know a lot in the world
and um you have to make sure that when

8636
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:12,760
and um you have to make sure that when
 

8637
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:14,110
and um you have to make sure that when
those happen you know people are held

8638
02:38:14,110 --> 02:38:14,120
those happen you know people are held
 

8639
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:16,190
those happen you know people are held
accountable for it but you o don't want

8640
02:38:16,190 --> 02:38:16,200
accountable for it but you o don't want
 

8641
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:18,070
accountable for it but you o don't want
to make sure that in the process of

8642
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:18,080
to make sure that in the process of
 

8643
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,590
to make sure that in the process of
making sure that there's accountability

8644
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:19,600
making sure that there's accountability
 

8645
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:22,870
making sure that there's accountability
for these actions you don't set a lot of

8646
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:22,880
for these actions you don't set a lot of
 

8647
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,830
for these actions you don't set a lot of
progress that the world is making back

8648
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:24,840
progress that the world is making back
 

8649
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:28,269
progress that the world is making back
that will lead to worse off situation

8650
02:38:28,269 --> 02:38:28,279
that will lead to worse off situation
 

8651
02:38:28,279 --> 02:38:30,349
that will lead to worse off situation
for many more

for many more
 

8653
02:38:30,359 --> 02:38:32,790
for many more

8674
02:38:55,309 --> 02:38:55,319
simple answer I would say that it's
 

8675
02:38:55,319 --> 02:38:58,070
simple answer I would say that it's
structural and if you go back to the

8676
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:58,080
structural and if you go back to the
 

8677
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,190
structural and if you go back to the
incentive structure of different leaders

8678
02:39:00,190 --> 02:39:00,200
incentive structure of different leaders
 

8679
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:02,309
incentive structure of different leaders

8687
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:10,030
criticized for saying this but it's what
I believe so I'm going to say it is that

8688
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:10,040
I believe so I'm going to say it is that
 

8689
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:11,750
I believe so I'm going to say it is that
the incentive structure was all wrong

8690
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:11,760
the incentive structure was all wrong
 

8691
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,269
the incentive structure was all wrong

more of an operational plan and it was a

more of an operational plan and it was a
 

8699
02:39:19,479 --> 02:39:22,309
more of an operational plan and it was a
pragmatic plan it was over 180 pages in

criticized the fact that it was coming
 

8715
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:37,429
criticized the fact that it was coming
from us and didn't want to debate the

8716
02:39:37,429 --> 02:39:37,439
from us and didn't want to debate the
 

8717
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:40,070
from us and didn't want to debate the
merits of the operational pieces of it

8718
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:40,080
merits of the operational pieces of it
 

8719
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:43,670
merits of the operational pieces of it
so I created a slide where I showed from

8720
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:43,680
so I created a slide where I showed from
 

8721

02:39:47,479 --> 02:39:49,190
there all the different peace
discussions I put a dove in the slide

8726
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,200
discussions I put a dove in the slide
 

8727
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,230
discussions I put a dove in the slide
for those and then I put a tank for

8728
02:39:51,230 --> 02:39:51,240
for those and then I put a tank for
 

8729
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:52,469
for those and then I put a tank for
every time there was a war because there

8730
02:39:52,469 --> 02:39:52,479
every time there was a war because there
 

8731
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:54,190
every time there was a war because there
was always skirmishes between Hamas and

8732
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:54,200
was always skirmishes between Hamas and
 

8733
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:55,830
was always skirmishes between Hamas and
and Hezbollah and and and the

8734
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:55,840
and Hezbollah and and and the
 

8735
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:57,870
and Hezbollah and and and the
Palestinians and then I showed two lines

8736
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:57,880
Palestinians and then I showed two lines
 

8737
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:59,550
Palestinians and then I showed two lines
and they both went from the bottom of

8738
02:39:59,550 --> 02:39:59,560
and they both went from the bottom of
 

8739
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:02,469
and they both went from the bottom of
the page all the way up like this one of

8740
02:40:02,469 --> 02:40:02,479
the page all the way up like this one of
 

8741
02:40:02,479 --> 02:40:05,070
the page all the way up like this one of
the lines was Israeli settlements so

8742
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:05,080
the lines was Israeli settlements so
 

8743
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:07,510
the lines was Israeli settlements so
every time uh a negotiation failed

8744
02:40:07,510 --> 02:40:07,520
every time uh a negotiation failed
 

8745
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:09,710
every time uh a negotiation failed
Israel was able to get more land and

8746
02:40:09,710 --> 02:40:09,720
Israel was able to get more land and
 

8747
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:11,389
Israel was able to get more land and
every and then the other one was money

8748
02:40:11,389 --> 02:40:11,399
every and then the other one was money
 

8749
02:40:11,399 --> 02:40:13,269
every and then the other one was money
to the Palestinians and I said every

8750
02:40:13,269 --> 02:40:13,279
to the Palestinians and I said every
 

8751
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:15,030
to the Palestinians and I said every
time a negotiation failed the

8752
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:15,040
time a negotiation failed the
 

8753
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,550
time a negotiation failed the
Palestinians would get more money the

8754
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:17,560
Palestinians would get more money the
 

8755
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:19,510
Palestinians would get more money the
problem with that money though was that

8756
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:19,520
problem with that money though was that
 

8757
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,030
problem with that money though was that
it wasn't going to the people you know a

8758
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:21,040
it wasn't going to the people you know a
 

8759
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:22,550
it wasn't going to the people you know a
lot some of it would make its way down

8760
02:40:22,550 --> 02:40:22,560
lot some of it would make its way down
 

8761
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:23,630
lot some of it would make its way down
but most of it was going to the

8762
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:23,640
but most of it was going to the
 

8763
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:25,750
but most of it was going to the
politicians you had leadership of the

8764
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:25,760
politicians you had leadership of the
 

8765
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,630
politicians you had leadership of the
Palestinians who was basically I think

8766
02:40:27,630 --> 02:40:27,640
Palestinians who was basically I think
 

8767
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:29,150
Palestinians who was basically I think
at that point was in like the 16th year

8768
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:29,160
at that point was in like the 16th year
 

8769
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:30,590
at that point was in like the 16th year
of a four-year term so he wasn't

8770
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:30,600
of a four-year term so he wasn't
 

8771
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:32,790
of a four-year term so he wasn't
democratically elected and a lot of what

8772
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:32,800
democratically elected and a lot of what
 

8773
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:34,750
democratically elected and a lot of what
I tried to show was that there was no

8774
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:34,760
I tried to show was that there was no
 

8775
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:37,510
I tried to show was that there was no
rule of law there was no Judicial System

8776
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:37,520
rule of law there was no Judicial System
 

8777
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:39,429
rule of law there was no Judicial System
there were no property rights and there

8778
02:40:39,429 --> 02:40:39,439
there were no property rights and there
 

8779
02:40:39,439 --> 02:40:41,590
there were no property rights and there
was no opportunity or hope for the

8780
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:41,600
was no opportunity or hope for the
 

8781
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,389
was no opportunity or hope for the
people to live a better life and so all

8782
02:40:44,389 --> 02:40:44,399
people to live a better life and so all
 

8783
02:40:44,399 --> 02:40:47,590
people to live a better life and so all
of the uh envoys to date were basically

8784
02:40:47,590 --> 02:40:47,600
of the uh envoys to date were basically
 

8785
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:50,030
of the uh envoys to date were basically
trained to go and do the same things and

8786
02:40:50,030 --> 02:40:50,040
trained to go and do the same things and
 

8787
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:52,070
trained to go and do the same things and
I again I got massively criticized by

8788
02:40:52,070 --> 02:40:52,080
I again I got massively criticized by
 

8789
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:54,349
I again I got massively criticized by
all the previous envoys for not doing it

8790
02:40:54,349 --> 02:40:54,359
all the previous envoys for not doing it
 

8791
02:40:54,359 --> 02:40:56,510
all the previous envoys for not doing it
the same way they did but I thought the

8792
02:40:56,510 --> 02:40:56,520
the same way they did but I thought the
 

8793
02:40:56,520 --> 02:40:58,190
the same way they did but I thought the
problem structurally just didn't make

8794
02:40:58,190 --> 02:40:58,200
problem structurally just didn't make
 

8795
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,990
problem structurally just didn't make
sense and so I felt like the incentive

8796
02:41:00,990 --> 02:41:01,000
sense and so I felt like the incentive
 

8797
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,269
sense and so I felt like the incentive
structure was all wrong and I took a

8798
02:41:03,269 --> 02:41:03,279
structure was all wrong and I took a
 

8799
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:05,630
structure was all wrong and I took a
different approach and so what's what's

8800
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:05,640
different approach and so what's what's
 

8801
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:07,710
different approach and so what's what's
the different approach I started writing

8802
02:41:07,710 --> 02:41:07,720
the different approach I started writing
 

8803
02:41:07,720 --> 02:41:09,950
the different approach I started writing
down a document these are the you know

8804
02:41:09,950 --> 02:41:09,960
down a document these are the you know
 

8805
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:11,910
down a document these are the you know
11 issues but there's really only three

8806
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:11,920
11 issues but there's really only three
 

8807
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:14,990
11 issues but there's really only three
issues that matter I said just tell me

8808
02:41:14,990 --> 02:41:15,000
issues that matter I said just tell me
 

8809
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,710
issues that matter I said just tell me
what you think the compromise is that

8810
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:16,720
what you think the compromise is that
 

8811
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:18,230
what you think the compromise is that
you think the other side could live with

8812
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:18,240
you think the other side could live with
 

8813
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:20,349
you think the other side could live with
that you would accept and it was very

8814
02:41:20,349 --> 02:41:20,359
that you would accept and it was very
 

8815
02:41:20,359 --> 02:41:21,990
that you would accept and it was very
hard to get them talking about this oh

8816
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:22,000
hard to get them talking about this oh
 

8817

hard to get them talking about this oh

02:44:09,399 --> 02:44:12,590
people to represent the Muslim World on
the aloa mosque and so the reason why I

8976
02:44:12,590 --> 02:44:12,600
the aloa mosque and so the reason why I
 

8977
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,550
the aloa mosque and so the reason why I
felt like it had never been solved was

8978
02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:14,560
felt like it had never been solved was
 

8979
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:16,349
felt like it had never been solved was
it was a riddle a that I believed was

8980
02:44:16,349 --> 02:44:16,359
it was a riddle a that I believed was
 

8981
02:44:16,359 --> 02:44:18,790
it was a riddle a that I believed was
designed to not be solved but B you were

8982
02:44:18,790 --> 02:44:18,800
designed to not be solved but B you were
 

8983
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:20,550
designed to not be solved but B you were
conflating two separate issues you had

8984
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,560
conflating two separate issues you had
 

8985
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,510
conflating two separate issues you had
the issue between Israel and and the

8986
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:22,520
the issue between Israel and and the
 

8987
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:24,190
the issue between Israel and and the
Muslim World which really was the issue

8988
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:24,200
Muslim World which really was the issue
 

8989
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:26,750
Muslim World which really was the issue
of the aloa mosque and then you had just

8990
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:26,760
of the aloa mosque and then you had just
 

8991
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:28,950
of the aloa mosque and then you had just
a territorial dispute which throughout

8992
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:28,960
a territorial dispute which throughout
 

8993
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,349
a territorial dispute which throughout
history you have lots of territorial

8994
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
history you have lots of territorial
 

8995
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:31,830
history you have lots of territorial
disputes and they're usually resolved in

8996
02:44:31,830 --> 02:44:31,840
disputes and they're usually resolved in
 

8997
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:35,190
disputes and they're usually resolved in
different ways so if you go back to the

8998
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,200
different ways so if you go back to the
 

8999
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,790
different ways so if you go back to the
Israeli Palestinian issue there's just a

9000
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:36,800
Israeli Palestinian issue there's just a
 

9001
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:38,750
Israeli Palestinian issue there's just a
couple components you need to solve

9002
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:38,760
couple components you need to solve
 

9003
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:40,990
couple components you need to solve
number one is territorial contiguity

9004
02:44:40,990 --> 02:44:41,000
number one is territorial contiguity
 

9005
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,269
number one is territorial contiguity
right you need to figure out where do

9006
02:44:42,269 --> 02:44:42,279
right you need to figure out where do
 

9007
02:44:42,279 --> 02:44:43,950
right you need to figure out where do
you draw the lines and that's something

9008
02:44:43,950 --> 02:44:43,960
you draw the lines and that's something
 

9009
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:46,429
you draw the lines and that's something
that you know you can talk about what

9010
02:44:46,429 --> 02:44:46,439
that you know you can talk about what
 

9011
02:44:46,439 --> 02:44:48,870
that you know you can talk about what
people were owed 70 years ago but it's

9012
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:48,880
people were owed 70 years ago but it's
 

9013
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:50,790
people were owed 70 years ago but it's
much more productive to say this is what

9014
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:50,800
much more productive to say this is what
 

9015
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:53,190
much more productive to say this is what
you can make work today right and that's

9016
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,200
you can make work today right and that's
 

9017
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:55,070
you can make work today right and that's
kind of what we did I we literally spent

9018
02:44:55,070 --> 02:44:55,080
kind of what we did I we literally spent
 

9019
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:56,550
kind of what we did I we literally spent
months and months drawing a map and we

9020
02:44:56,550 --> 02:44:56,560
months and months drawing a map and we
 

9021
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:57,910
months and months drawing a map and we
put something out probably change a

9022
02:44:57,910 --> 02:44:57,920
put something out probably change a
 

9023
02:44:57,920 --> 02:44:59,349
put something out probably change a
couple lines here and there but by and

9024
02:44:59,349 --> 02:44:59,359
couple lines here and there but by and
 

9025
02:44:59,359 --> 02:45:02,030
couple lines here and there but by and
large it was a very pragmatic solution

9026
02:45:02,030 --> 02:45:02,040
large it was a very pragmatic solution
 

9027
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:03,309
large it was a very pragmatic solution
um that I think could work and I think

9028
02:45:03,309 --> 02:45:03,319
um that I think could work and I think
 

9029
02:45:03,319 --> 02:45:04,389
um that I think could work and I think
it could work for the Safety and

9030
02:45:04,389 --> 02:45:04,399
it could work for the Safety and
 

9031
02:45:04,399 --> 02:45:06,950
it could work for the Safety and
Security of Israel which was number one

9032
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
Security of Israel which was number one
 

9033
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:08,990
Security of Israel which was number one
um so first issue is drawing a map

9034
02:45:08,990 --> 02:45:09,000
um so first issue is drawing a map
 

9035
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,630
um so first issue is drawing a map
second issue is security again

9036
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:11,640
second issue is security again
 

9037
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:14,429
second issue is security again
Israel um and again this is one issue we

9038
02:45:14,429 --> 02:45:14,439
Israel um and again this is one issue we
 

9039
02:45:14,439 --> 02:45:16,230
Israel um and again this is one issue we
were incredibly sympathetic with Israel

9040
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:16,240
were incredibly sympathetic with Israel
 

9041
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:18,429
were incredibly sympathetic with Israel
which is you can't expect a you know a

9042
02:45:18,429 --> 02:45:18,439
which is you can't expect a you know a
 

9043
02:45:18,439 --> 02:45:20,349
which is you can't expect a you know a
prime minister of Israel to make a deal

9044
02:45:20,349 --> 02:45:20,359
prime minister of Israel to make a deal
 

9045
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:21,710
prime minister of Israel to make a deal
where he's going to make his people less

9046
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:21,720
where he's going to make his people less
 

9047
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,830
where he's going to make his people less
secure than before so we worked very

9048
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:23,840
secure than before so we worked very
 

9049
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:24,990
secure than before so we worked very
closely with them on a security

9050
02:45:24,990 --> 02:45:25,000
closely with them on a security
 

9051
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,670
closely with them on a security
apparatus we laid something out that I

9052
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:26,680
apparatus we laid something out that I
 

9053
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:29,630
apparatus we laid something out that I
think would keep the whole area safer

9054
02:45:29,630 --> 02:45:29,640
think would keep the whole area safer
 

9055
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:30,790
think would keep the whole area safer
and it would it would make sure Israel

9056
02:45:30,790 --> 02:45:30,800
and it would it would make sure Israel
 

9057
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:32,550
and it would it would make sure Israel
was safe and also keep the Palestinian

9058
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
was safe and also keep the Palestinian
 

9059
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,630
was safe and also keep the Palestinian
Shu safe so you need security number

9060
02:45:34,630 --> 02:45:34,640
Shu safe so you need security number
 

9061
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:36,309
Shu safe so you need security number
three was the religious sites and that

9062
02:45:36,309 --> 02:45:36,319
three was the religious sites and that
 

9063
02:45:36,319 --> 02:45:39,110
three was the religious sites and that
was one that was actually always made

9064
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:39,120
was one that was actually always made
 

9065
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:41,670
was one that was actually always made
much more complicated by people uh the

9066
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:41,680
much more complicated by people uh the
 

9067
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:43,309
much more complicated by people uh the
aloa mosque because you basically have

9068
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:43,319
aloa mosque because you basically have
 

9069
02:45:43,319 --> 02:45:45,110
aloa mosque because you basically have
Haram Al Sharif which is a place where

9070
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,120
Haram Al Sharif which is a place where
 

9071
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,910
Haram Al Sharif which is a place where
the mosque was built in the sth OR 8th

9072
02:45:46,910 --> 02:45:46,920
the mosque was built in the sth OR 8th
 

9073
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:49,950
the mosque was built in the sth OR 8th
Century um but originally it was where

9074
02:45:49,950 --> 02:45:49,960
Century um but originally it was where
 

9075
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:51,630
Century um but originally it was where
the the holy of holies were in the betam

9076
02:45:51,630 --> 02:45:51,640
the the holy of holies were in the betam
 

9077
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:53,630
the the holy of holies were in the betam
mdash for the Jewish people so and then

9078
02:45:53,630 --> 02:45:53,640
mdash for the Jewish people so and then
 

9079
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,030
mdash for the Jewish people so and then
you know compounding by the fact that

9080
02:45:55,030 --> 02:45:55,040
you know compounding by the fact that
 

9081
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:56,670
you know compounding by the fact that
you have all the Christian holy sites in

9082
02:45:56,670 --> 02:45:56,680
you have all the Christian holy sites in
 

9083
02:45:56,680 --> 02:45:59,070
you have all the Christian holy sites in
Jerusalem it's a city that should be

9084
02:45:59,070 --> 02:45:59,080
Jerusalem it's a city that should be
 

9085
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:01,349
Jerusalem it's a city that should be
bringing everyone together but in fact

9086
02:46:01,349 --> 02:46:01,359
bringing everyone together but in fact
 

9087
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:03,190
bringing everyone together but in fact
has become a place where you have you

9088
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:03,200
has become a place where you have you
 

9089
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:06,150
has become a place where you have you
know Wars and and and and and hatred and

9090
02:46:06,150 --> 02:46:06,160
know Wars and and and and and hatred and
 

9091
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:07,429
know Wars and and and and and hatred and
a lot of different conflicts that have

9092
02:46:07,429 --> 02:46:07,439
a lot of different conflicts that have
 

9093
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:09,590
a lot of different conflicts that have
risen because of it but what I said was

9094
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:09,600
risen because of it but what I said was
 

9095
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,110
risen because of it but what I said was
instead of fighting over concepts of

9096
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120
instead of fighting over concepts of
 

9097
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:13,349
instead of fighting over concepts of
sovereignty which is interesting how I

9098
02:46:13,349 --> 02:46:13,359
sovereignty which is interesting how I
 

9099
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:14,670
sovereignty which is interesting how I
got to the notion that this wasn't

9100
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:14,680
got to the notion that this wasn't
 

9101
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:16,790
got to the notion that this wasn't
really the big issue I B said just

9102
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:16,800
really the big issue I B said just
 

9103
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,110
really the big issue I B said just
operationally why don't we just make it

9104
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:18,120
operationally why don't we just make it
 

9105
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:20,110
operationally why don't we just make it
simple let everyone come and be able to

9106
02:46:20,110 --> 02:46:20,120
simple let everyone come and be able to
 

9107
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:21,550
simple let everyone come and be able to
worship as long as they're being able to

9108
02:46:21,550 --> 02:46:21,560
worship as long as they're being able to
 

9109
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:25,190
worship as long as they're being able to
worship peacefully so that's really the

9110
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:25,200
worship peacefully so that's really the
 

9111
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:28,190
worship peacefully so that's really the
Contours of it and what the Palestinians

9112
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:28,200
Contours of it and what the Palestinians
 

9113
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:29,790
Contours of it and what the Palestinians
have done is they've kind of deflected

9114
02:46:29,790 --> 02:46:29,800
have done is they've kind of deflected
 

9115
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:31,429
have done is they've kind of deflected
from a lot of their own shortcomings and

9116
02:46:31,429 --> 02:46:31,439
from a lot of their own shortcomings and
 

9117
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:32,870
from a lot of their own shortcomings and
a lot of the Arab leaders did that as

9118
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:32,880
a lot of the Arab leaders did that as
 

9119
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,710
a lot of the Arab leaders did that as
well kind of in the pre- Abraham mord

9120
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:34,720
well kind of in the pre- Abraham mord
 

9121
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:36,830
well kind of in the pre- Abraham mord
Days by kind of allowing this issue to

9122
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:36,840
Days by kind of allowing this issue to
 

9123
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,429
Days by kind of allowing this issue to
be so prevalent so one thing I'll say on

9124
02:46:39,429 --> 02:46:39,439
be so prevalent so one thing I'll say on
 

9125
02:46:39,439 --> 02:46:41,070
be so prevalent so one thing I'll say on
the Palestinians is that you know what

9126
02:46:41,070 --> 02:46:41,080
the Palestinians is that you know what
 

9127
02:46:41,080 --> 02:46:43,510
the Palestinians is that you know what
we tried to do by laying outed plan was

9128
02:46:43,510 --> 02:46:43,520

but I do believe that you're not going
 

9409
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,670
but I do believe that you're not going
to solve that by litigating the past

9410
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:53,680
to solve that by litigating the past
 

9411
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:55,750
to solve that by litigating the past
you're only going to solve that by

9412
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:55,760
you're only going to solve that by
 

9413
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,550
you're only going to solve that by
creating an exciting Paradigm for the

9414
02:51:57,550 --> 02:51:57,560
creating an exciting Paradigm for the
 

9415
02:51:57,560 --> 02:51:59,790
creating an exciting Paradigm for the
future and getting everyone to buy in

future and getting everyone to buy in
 

9417
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:02,469
future and getting everyone to buy in
and then move towards that and maybe

9418
02:52:02,469 --> 02:52:02,479
and then move towards that and maybe
 

9419
02:52:02,479 --> 02:52:04,389
and then move towards that and maybe
increase the chance of uh being able to

9420
02:52:04,389 --> 02:52:04,399
increase the chance of uh being able to
 

9421
02:52:04,399 --> 02:52:06,150
increase the chance of uh being able to
establish an economy where the

9527
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:15,150
a lot of things and I joke that we made
peace on plan C but only because we went

through the alphabet three times failing

9530
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:16,960
through the alphabet three times failing
 

9531
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:19,110
through the alphabet three times failing
at every letter and by the time but we

9532
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:19,120
at every letter and by the time but we
 

9533
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:20,630
at every letter and by the time but we
didn't give up we kept going and we got

9534
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:20,640
didn't give up we kept going and we got
 

9535
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:22,830
didn't give up we kept going and we got
it done and maybe this a a good place to

9536
02:54:22,830 --> 02:54:22,840
it done and maybe this a a good place to
 

9537
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:25,670
it done and maybe this a a good place to
also step back and say what is Arab

9538
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:25,680

that's probably the best place to start

9546
02:54:35,309 --> 02:54:35,319
that's probably the best place to start
 

9547
02:54:35,319 --> 02:54:37,590

9593
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:31,110
but the the single biggest benefit that
I've seen from the Accords is that if

9594
02:55:31,110 --> 02:55:31,120
I've seen from the Accords is that if
 

9595
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:34,910
I've seen from the Accords is that if
you were uh an Arab or a Muslim and you

9596
02:55:34,910 --> 02:55:34,920
you were uh an Arab or a Muslim and you
 

9597
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:38,229
you were uh an Arab or a Muslim and you
were um and you were willing to say

9598
02:55:38,229 --> 02:55:38,239
were um and you were willing to say
 

9599
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:40,150
were um and you were willing to say
positive things about Israel or the Jews

9600
02:55:40,150 --> 02:55:40,160
positive things about Israel or the Jews
 

9601
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:42,229
positive things about Israel or the Jews
before this came out you would been

9602
02:55:42,229 --> 02:55:42,239
before this came out you would been
 

9603
02:55:42,239 --> 02:55:44,710
before this came out you would been
viciously attacked by the media or the

9604
02:55:44,710 --> 02:55:44,720
viciously attacked by the media or the
 

9605
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:47,510
viciously attacked by the media or the
hordes of influencers or the uh

9606
02:55:47,510 --> 02:55:47,520
hordes of influencers or the uh
 

9607
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:49,750
hordes of influencers or the uh
extremists in these different countries

there's
a a nice way to kind of make clear why

these agreements have such a
transformative effect especially in the

9658

transformative effect especially in the
 

9659
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:58,429
transformative effect especially in the
long term I would say the simplest form

9660
02:56:58,429 --> 02:56:58,439
long term I would say the simplest form
 

9661
02:56:58,439 --> 02:57:00,830
long term I would say the simplest form
is it's just a mindset and it's almost

9662
02:57:00,830 --> 02:57:00,840
is it's just a mindset and it's almost
 

9663
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:02,710
is it's just a mindset and it's almost
like you're taught all your

9664
02:57:02,710 --> 02:57:02,720
like you're taught all your
 

9665
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:05,349
like you're taught all your
life we're enemies or we can't be

9666
02:57:05,349 --> 02:57:05,359
life we're enemies or we can't be
 

9667
02:57:05,359 --> 02:57:07,349
life we're enemies or we can't be
friends with that

9668
02:57:07,349 --> 02:57:07,359
friends with that
 

9669
02:57:07,359 --> 02:57:10,510
friends with that
tribe on the other side of the fence and

9670
02:57:10,510 --> 02:57:10,520
tribe on the other side of the fence and
 

9671
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:11,990
tribe on the other side of the fence and
then like one day the leaders get up and

9672
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:12,000
then like one day the leaders get up and
 

9673
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,469
then like one day the leaders get up and
say no it's okay now and there was never

9674
02:57:14,469 --> 02:57:14,479
say no it's okay now and there was never
 

9675
02:57:14,479 --> 02:57:16,469
say no it's okay now and there was never
an issue between the people the people

9676
02:57:16,469 --> 02:57:16,479
an issue between the people the people
 

9677
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:17,950
an issue between the people the people
were just taught different things and

9678
02:57:17,950 --> 02:57:17,960
were just taught different things and
 

9679
02:57:17,960 --> 02:57:19,550
were just taught different things and
they were separated from each other but

9680
02:57:19,550 --> 02:57:19,560
they were separated from each other but
 

9681
02:57:19,560 --> 02:57:21,670
they were separated from each other but
again one of the things that I respect

9682
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:21,680
again one of the things that I respect
 

9683
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:24,110
again one of the things that I respect
about the work you do is you believe in

9684
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:24,120
about the work you do is you believe in
 

9685
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:25,870
about the work you do is you believe in
the power of conversation and the power

9686
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:25,880
the power of conversation and the power
 

9687
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:28,469
the power of conversation and the power
of human interaction and you know these

9688
02:57:28,469 --> 02:57:28,479
of human interaction and you know these
 

9689
02:57:28,479 --> 02:57:31,429
of human interaction and you know these
issues and and gaps between us feel so

9690
02:57:31,429 --> 02:57:31,439
issues and and gaps between us feel so
 

9691
02:57:31,439 --> 02:57:33,950
issues and and gaps between us feel so
big when we think about them when we're

9692
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:33,960
big when we think about them when we're
 

9693
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:36,150
big when we think about them when we're
told about them when we read about them

9694
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:36,160
told about them when we read about them
 

9695
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:38,150
told about them when we read about them
but when we go and sit with each other

9696
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:38,160
but when we go and sit with each other
 

9697
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,830
but when we go and sit with each other
all of a sudden we realize maybe we have

9698
02:57:39,830 --> 02:57:39,840
all of a sudden we realize maybe we have
 

9699
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:41,750
all of a sudden we realize maybe we have
a lot more in common than we have that

9700
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:41,760
a lot more in common than we have that
 

9701
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:45,030
a lot more in common than we have that
divides us for me what I've seen about

9702
02:57:45,030 --> 02:57:45,040
divides us for me what I've seen about
 

9703
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:46,790
divides us for me what I've seen about
it that's made the biggest difference is

9704
02:57:46,790 --> 02:57:46,800
it that's made the biggest difference is
 

9705
02:57:46,800 --> 02:57:49,030
it that's made the biggest difference is
I've seen people who wouldn't have the

9706
02:57:49,030 --> 02:57:49,040
I've seen people who wouldn't have the
 

9707
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:53,349
I've seen people who wouldn't have the
ability to be together be together and

9708
02:57:53,349 --> 02:57:53,359
ability to be together be together and
 

9709
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:55,309
ability to be together be together and
that's now forming a nucleus of

9710
02:57:55,309 --> 02:57:55,319
that's now forming a nucleus of
 

9711
02:57:55,319 --> 02:57:58,030
that's now forming a nucleus of
togetherness which is a restoration so

9712
02:57:58,030 --> 02:57:58,040
togetherness which is a restoration so
 

9713
02:57:58,040 --> 02:57:59,750
togetherness which is a restoration so
you think about the modern Middle East

9714
02:57:59,750 --> 02:57:59,760
you think about the modern Middle East
 

9715
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:03,590
you think about the modern Middle East
from uh from post Holocaust to now again

9716
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:03,600
from uh from post Holocaust to now again
 

9717
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:06,750
from uh from post Holocaust to now again
in 1948 after uh the that war of

9718
02:58:06,750 --> 02:58:06,760
in 1948 after uh the that war of
 

9719
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:09,830
in 1948 after uh the that war of
independence you had Jews living in

9720
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:09,840
independence you had Jews living in
 

9721
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:13,269
independence you had Jews living in
Baghdad and Cairo uh then they became so

9722
02:58:13,269 --> 02:58:13,279
Baghdad and Cairo uh then they became so
 

9723
02:58:13,279 --> 02:58:16,070
Baghdad and Cairo uh then they became so
anti- Jewish that they then expelled all

9724
02:58:16,070 --> 02:58:16,080
anti- Jewish that they then expelled all
 

9725
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:18,590
anti- Jewish that they then expelled all
of the Jews from all these capitals of

9726
02:58:18,590 --> 02:58:18,600
of the Jews from all these capitals of
 

9727
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:20,469
of the Jews from all these capitals of
those cities so you think about the

9728
02:58:20,469 --> 02:58:20,479
those cities so you think about the
 

9729
02:58:20,479 --> 02:58:22,429
those cities so you think about the
Jewish history in Baghdad I mean I think

9730
02:58:22,429 --> 02:58:22,439
Jewish history in Baghdad I mean I think
 

9731

Jewish history in Baghdad I mean I think
the talmud was written in Baghdad it was

9732

the talmud was written in Baghdad it was
 

9733
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:26,750
the talmud was written in Baghdad it was
a place where in Babylon where the

9734
02:58:26,750 --> 02:58:26,760
a place where in Babylon where the
 

9735
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:29,429
a place where in Babylon where the
Jewish people thrived I think in 570 BC

9736
02:58:29,429 --> 02:58:29,439
Jewish people thrived I think in 570 BC
 

9737
02:58:29,439 --> 02:58:32,590
Jewish people thrived I think in 570 BC
when nanzer conquered Jerusalem he took

9738
02:58:32,590 --> 02:58:32,600
when nanzer conquered Jerusalem he took
 

9739
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:34,349
when nanzer conquered Jerusalem he took
about 10,000 Jews back with him to

9740
02:58:34,349 --> 02:58:34,359
about 10,000 Jews back with him to
 

9741
02:58:34,359 --> 02:58:35,950
about 10,000 Jews back with him to
Babylon because he thought it'd be good

9742

Babylon because he thought it'd be good
 

9743
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:37,670
Babylon because he thought it'd be good
for his economy and during that that

9744
02:58:37,670 --> 02:58:37,680
for his economy and during that that
 

9745
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:39,710
for his economy and during that that
that place the Jews actually flourished

that place the Jews actually flourished
and had a good uh life there so for

his
 

10011
03:03:23,720 --> 03:03:26,309
his
unpredictability I think that as a

10012
03:03:26,309 --> 03:03:26,319
unpredictability I think that as a
 

10013
03:03:26,319 --> 03:03:29,950
unpredictability I think that as a
leader he's um he consumes a ton of

10014
03:03:29,950 --> 03:03:29,960
leader he's um he consumes a ton of
 

10015

managed or have his information filtered
 

10019
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:36,910
managed or have his information filtered
so he'll speak to a lot of people to

10020
03:03:36,910 --> 03:03:36,920
so he'll speak to a lot of people to
 

10021
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:39,469
so he'll speak to a lot of people to
draw his information himself uh he's

somebody who's about results I think he
wants to deliver results um and I think

10030
03:03:50,269 --> 03:03:50,279
wants to deliver results um and I think
 

10031
03:03:50,279 --> 03:03:52,110

it she'd served 22 years in prison while
 

10093
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:57,550
it she'd served 22 years in prison while
in prison I mean she's basically was a

10094
03:04:57,550 --> 03:04:57,560
in prison I mean she's basically was a
 

10095
03:04:57,560 --> 03:05:00,030
in prison I mean she's basically was a
grandmother and she um she was you know

10096
03:05:00,030 --> 03:05:00,040
grandmother and she um she was you know
 

10097
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:01,870
grandmother and she um she was you know
putting on the prison plays she was

03:05:01,880 --> 03:05:03,590
putting on the prison plays she was
mentoring you know young women in prison

10100
03:05:03,590 --> 03:05:03,600
mentoring you know young women in prison
 

10101
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:06,309
mentoring you know young women in prison
somebody who again there's always a risk

10102
03:05:06,309 --> 03:05:06,319
somebody who again there's always a risk
 

10103
03:05:06,319 --> 03:05:08,229
somebody who again there's always a risk
but by and large had a very very very

10104
03:05:08,229 --> 03:05:08,239
but by and large had a very very very
 

10105
03:05:08,239 --> 03:05:10,790
but by and large had a very very very
low risk of of committing a crime in the

10106
03:05:10,790 --> 03:05:10,800
low risk of of committing a crime in the
 

10107
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:12,630
low risk of of committing a crime in the
future and then it goes back to the

10108
03:05:12,630 --> 03:05:12,640
future and then it goes back to the
 

10109
03:05:12,640 --> 03:05:15,349
future and then it goes back to the
notion of are we going to judge people

10110
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:15,359
notion of are we going to judge people
 

10111
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:16,910
notion of are we going to judge people
by the worst decision they make in their

10112
03:05:16,910 --> 03:05:16,920
by the worst decision they make in their
 

10113
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:19,710
by the worst decision they make in their
life and so president Trump uh was

10114
03:05:19,710 --> 03:05:19,720
life and so president Trump uh was
 

10115
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:21,150
life and so president Trump uh was
willing to Grant the climate scene went

10116
03:05:21,150 --> 03:05:21,160
willing to Grant the climate scene went
 

10117
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:22,469
willing to Grant the climate scene went
and I think that it just goes to the

10118
03:05:22,469 --> 03:05:22,479
and I think that it just goes to the
 

10119
03:05:22,479 --> 03:05:24,990
and I think that it just goes to the
notion of like maybe this goes back to

10120
03:05:24,990 --> 03:05:25,000
notion of like maybe this goes back to
 

10121
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,830
notion of like maybe this goes back to
his unpredictability in a positive way

10122
03:05:26,830 --> 03:05:26,840
his unpredictability in a positive way
 

10123
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:28,790
his unpredictability in a positive way
which is if you go sit with him and you

10124
03:05:28,790 --> 03:05:28,800
which is if you go sit with him and you
 

10125
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:30,469
which is if you go sit with him and you
make your case he'll hear you he'll

10126
03:05:30,469 --> 03:05:30,479
make your case he'll hear you he'll
 

10127
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:32,590
make your case he'll hear you he'll
listen to you and he's not afraid to act

10128
03:05:32,590 --> 03:05:32,600
listen to you and he's not afraid to act
 

10129
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:34,990
listen to you and he's not afraid to act
and he's not afraid to be controversial

10130
03:05:34,990 --> 03:05:35,000
and he's not afraid to be controversial
 

10131
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,990
and he's not afraid to be controversial
which I think is a good thing so from a

10132
03:05:36,990 --> 03:05:37,000
which I think is a good thing so from a
 

10133
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:38,389
which I think is a good thing so from a
foreign policy point of view in

10134
03:05:38,389 --> 03:05:38,399
foreign policy point of view in
 

10135
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:40,630
foreign policy point of view in
particular his unpredictability just

10136
03:05:40,630 --> 03:05:40,640
particular his unpredictability just
 

10137
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:42,190
particular his unpredictability just
meant that everyone was always on their

10138
03:05:42,190 --> 03:05:42,200
meant that everyone was always on their
 

10139
03:05:42,200 --> 03:05:45,229
meant that everyone was always on their
back foot people were afraid to kind of

10140
03:05:45,229 --> 03:05:45,239
back foot people were afraid to kind of
 

10141
03:05:45,239 --> 03:05:47,110
back foot people were afraid to kind of
cross America and what I would tell

10142
03:05:47,110 --> 03:05:47,120
cross America and what I would tell
 

10143
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:48,590
cross America and what I would tell
people who don't like Trump is I would

10144
03:05:48,590 --> 03:05:48,600
people who don't like Trump is I would
 

10145
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:50,229
people who don't like Trump is I would
say think about how crazy he's making

10146
03:05:50,229 --> 03:05:50,239

10156
03:06:00,070 --> 03:06:00,080
in some of these agreements I've been
 

10157

Mexico was legitimately concerned and
 

10187
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:35,070

smartly so that President Trump was

10188
03:06:35,070 --> 03:06:35,080
smartly so that President Trump was
 

10189
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:37,349
smartly so that President Trump was
going to impose tariffs on the car

10190
03:06:37,349 --> 03:06:37,359
going to impose tariffs on the car
 

10191
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:38,469
going to impose tariffs on the car
industry which would have been

10192
03:06:38,469 --> 03:06:38,479
industry which would have been
 

10193
03:06:38,479 --> 03:06:40,910
industry which would have been
decimating to their economy and by the

10194
03:06:40,910 --> 03:06:40,920
decimating to their economy and by the
 

10195
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,389
decimating to their economy and by the
way he was ready to do it we were

10196
03:06:42,389 --> 03:06:42,399
way he was ready to do it we were
 

10197
03:06:42,399 --> 03:06:44,630
way he was ready to do it we were
holding it back from doing it with every

10198
03:06:44,630 --> 03:06:44,640
holding it back from doing it with every
 

10199
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:46,030
holding it back from doing it with every
ounce of strength that we could so it

10200
03:06:46,030 --> 03:06:46,040
ounce of strength that we could so it
 

10201
03:06:46,040 --> 03:06:47,389
ounce of strength that we could so it
wasn't a bluff I mean that would was

10202
03:06:47,389 --> 03:06:47,399
wasn't a bluff I mean that would was
 

10203
03:06:47,399 --> 03:06:49,830
wasn't a bluff I mean that would was
actually real but they were smart to

10204
03:06:49,830 --> 03:06:49,840
actually real but they were smart to

strategic advantage to play uh us and
China against each other because of the

10326
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
China against each other because of the
 

10327
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:10,389
China against each other because of the
way that everything was done before they

10328
03:09:10,389 --> 03:09:10,399
way that everything was done before they
 

10329
03:09:10,399 --> 03:09:11,910
way that everything was done before they
were stuck with China but not getting a

10330
03:09:11,910 --> 03:09:11,920
were stuck with China but not getting a
 

10331
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:14,670
were stuck with China but not getting a
lot for it um under Bush they took

10332
03:09:14,670 --> 03:09:14,680
lot for it um under Bush they took
 

10333
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:17,030
lot for it um under Bush they took
Georgia under Obama they took Crimea

10334
03:09:17,030 --> 03:09:17,040
Georgia under Obama they took Crimea
 

10335
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,469
Georgia under Obama they took Crimea
under Trump there was no problems and

10336
03:09:19,469 --> 03:09:19,479
under Trump there was no problems and
 

10337
03:09:19,479 --> 03:09:22,389
under Trump there was no problems and
then under Biden U unfortunately I think

10338
03:09:22,389 --> 03:09:22,399
then under Biden U unfortunately I think
 

10339
03:09:22,399 --> 03:09:24,229
then under Biden U unfortunately I think
they misplayed a couple of things uh

10340
03:09:24,229 --> 03:09:24,239
they misplayed a couple of things uh
 

10341
03:09:24,239 --> 03:09:26,389
they misplayed a couple of things uh
which I think provoked uh you know

10342
03:09:26,389 --> 03:09:26,399
which I think provoked uh you know
 

10343
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:29,070
which I think provoked uh you know
Russia to to go forward um still no

10344
03:09:29,070 --> 03:09:29,080
Russia to to go forward um still no
 

10345
03:09:29,080 --> 03:09:30,670
Russia to to go forward um still no
excuse to do what they did I think that

10346
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:30,680
excuse to do what they did I think that
 

10347
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:32,309
excuse to do what they did I think that
the invasion was a terrible thing and

10348
03:09:32,309 --> 03:09:32,319
the invasion was a terrible thing and
 

10349
03:09:32,319 --> 03:09:34,550
the invasion was a terrible thing and
and should not have occurred um but with

10350
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:34,560
and should not have occurred um but with
 

10351
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:38,510
and should not have occurred um but with
that being said um I think 100% if Trump

10352
03:09:38,510 --> 03:09:38,520
that being said um I think 100% if Trump
 

10353
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:39,910
that being said um I think 100% if Trump
was President there would not be a war

10354
03:09:39,910 --> 03:09:39,920
was President there would not be a war
 

10355
03:09:39,920 --> 03:09:42,469
was President there would not be a war

we've seen a long time uh and he has a
 

10411
03:10:44,279 --> 03:10:46,349
we've seen a long time uh and he has a

03:10:46,349 --> 03:10:46,359
ton of my respect and admiration for
 

10413
03:10:46,359 --> 03:10:48,990

coincided with that sentiment and so
 

10421
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:01,110
coincided with that sentiment and so
there has to be some form of of off-ramp

what's
 

10439
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,030
what's
happening that's really what it will

something I'm involved in now so I don't

put that together but essentially they
 

10449
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:29,070
put that together but essentially they
need somebody in between them who can

10450
03:11:29,070 --> 03:11:29,080
need somebody in between them who can
 

10451

willing to put thems on the line yeah to
 

10509
03:12:38,439 --> 03:12:40,030
willing to put thems on the line yeah to
go and do it and you know again if

10510
03:12:40,030 --> 03:12:40,040
go and do it and you know again if
 

10511
03:12:40,040 --> 03:12:41,870
go and do it and you know again if
you're the US president and you're the

10512
03:12:41,870 --> 03:12:41,880
you're the US president and you're the
 

10513
03:12:41,880 --> 03:12:43,950
you're the US president and you're the
most powerful Nation in the world you

10514
03:12:43,950 --> 03:12:43,960
most powerful Nation in the world you
 

10515
03:12:43,960 --> 03:12:46,110
most powerful Nation in the world you
should be trying yeah but I do think

10516

should be trying yeah but I do think
 

10517
03:12:46,120 --> 03:12:48,070
should be trying yeah but I do think
again the posture that the US has taken

10518
03:12:48,070 --> 03:12:48,080
again the posture that the US has taken
 

10519
03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:52,030
again the posture that the US has taken
has probably been in a place where they

10520
03:12:52,030 --> 03:12:52,040
has probably been in a place where they
 

10521

the trust of Russia based on the way

10524
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:54,840
the trust of Russia based on the way
 

10525
03:12:54,840 --> 03:12:58,110
the trust of Russia based on the way
that they've played their moves to date

10526
03:12:58,110 --> 03:12:58,120
that they've played their moves to date

10529
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:00,510

03:17:58,160 --> 03:18:01,309
twice and so from his perspective there
is you know in the early days of Russia

10808
03:18:01,309 --> 03:18:01,319
is you know in the early days of Russia
 

10809
03:18:01,319 --> 03:18:03,429
is you know in the early days of Russia
uh they were attacked by the Mongols

10810
03:18:03,429 --> 03:18:03,439
uh they were attacked by the Mongols
 

10811
03:18:03,439 --> 03:18:05,590
uh they were attacked by the Mongols
they were very vulnerable and a lot of

10812
03:18:05,590 --> 03:18:05,600
they were very vulnerable and a lot of
 

10813
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:08,070
they were very vulnerable and a lot of
the geography of Russia Today is really

10814
03:18:08,070 --> 03:18:08,080
the geography of Russia Today is really
 

10815
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:09,750
the geography of Russia Today is really
designed for defensive purposes that

10816
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:09,760
designed for defensive purposes that
 

10817
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:11,389
designed for defensive purposes that
they have natural barriers that makes

10818
03:18:11,389 --> 03:18:11,399
they have natural barriers that makes
 

10819
03:18:11,399 --> 03:18:13,110
they have natural barriers that makes
them easier to defend and Russia is a

10820
03:18:13,110 --> 03:18:13,120
them easier to defend and Russia is a
 

10821
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:14,790
them easier to defend and Russia is a
massive landmass it's twice the size of

10822
03:18:14,790 --> 03:18:14,800
massive landmass it's twice the size of
 

10823
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:16,750
massive landmass it's twice the size of
America they have 11 time zones in the

10824
03:18:16,750 --> 03:18:16,760
America they have 11 time zones in the
 

10825
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:20,389
America they have 11 time zones in the
country and so I do think that for um

10826
03:18:20,389 --> 03:18:20,399
country and so I do think that for um
 

10827
03:18:20,399 --> 03:18:22,630
country and so I do think that for um
for Vladimir Putin his biggest concern

10828
03:18:22,630 --> 03:18:22,640
for Vladimir Putin his biggest concern
 

10829
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:26,429
for Vladimir Putin his biggest concern
is how do we create a security Paradigm

10830
03:18:26,429 --> 03:18:26,439
is how do we create a security Paradigm
 

10831
03:18:26,439 --> 03:18:29,189
is how do we create a security Paradigm
in the west of his country that won't be

10832
03:18:29,189 --> 03:18:29,199
in the west of his country that won't be
 

10833
03:18:29,199 --> 03:18:30,670
in the west of his country that won't be
a creep and I think that there's like

10834
03:18:30,670 --> 03:18:30,680
a creep and I think that there's like
 

10835
03:18:30,680 --> 03:18:32,110
a creep and I think that there's like
two different parts of the mindset you

10836
03:18:32,110 --> 03:18:32,120
two different parts of the mindset you
 

10837
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:34,309
two different parts of the mindset you
know the people who are most cynical of

10838
03:18:34,309 --> 03:18:34,319
know the people who are most cynical of
 

10839
03:18:34,319 --> 03:18:35,630
know the people who are most cynical of
Putin will say well he's just trying to

10840
03:18:35,630 --> 03:18:35,640
Putin will say well he's just trying to
 

10841
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:37,590
Putin will say well he's just trying to
recreate the USSR he's being

10842
03:18:37,590 --> 03:18:37,600
recreate the USSR he's being
 

10843
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:39,309
recreate the USSR he's being
expansionist and the people who want to

10844
03:18:39,309 --> 03:18:39,319
expansionist and the people who want to
 

10845
03:18:39,319 --> 03:18:42,229
expansionist and the people who want to
be sympathetic to him will say well if

10846
03:18:42,229 --> 03:18:42,239
be sympathetic to him will say well if
 

10847
03:18:42,239 --> 03:18:43,710
be sympathetic to him will say well if
you think about it the Russian

10848
03:18:43,710 --> 03:18:43,720
you think about it the Russian
 

10849
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:45,990
you think about it the Russian
perception of the NATO arrange

10850
03:18:45,990 --> 03:18:46,000
perception of the NATO arrange
 

10851
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:47,429
perception of the NATO arrange
Arrangement was that they wouldn't be

10852
03:18:47,429 --> 03:18:47,439
Arrangement was that they wouldn't be
 

10853
03:18:47,439 --> 03:18:50,189
Arrangement was that they wouldn't be
expanding Westward over the last years

10854
03:18:50,189 --> 03:18:50,199
expanding Westward over the last years
 

10855
03:18:50,199 --> 03:18:51,550
expanding Westward over the last years
they've included all these countries

10856
03:18:51,550 --> 03:18:51,560
they've included all these countries
 

10857
03:18:51,560 --> 03:18:52,950
they've included all these countries
that they said they promised they

10858
03:18:52,950 --> 03:18:52,960
that they said they promised they
 

10859
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:54,990
that they said they promised they
wouldn't include who knows what the

10860
03:18:54,990 --> 03:18:55,000
wouldn't include who knows what the
 

10861
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:58,349
wouldn't include who knows what the
promises were or was were or weren't but

10862
03:18:58,349 --> 03:18:58,359
promises were or was were or weren't but
 

10863
03:18:58,359 --> 03:19:01,229
promises were or was were or weren't but
what I do know from his perspective is

10864
03:19:01,229 --> 03:19:01,239
what I do know from his perspective is
 

10865
03:19:01,239 --> 03:19:03,070
what I do know from his perspective is
allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a

10866
03:19:03,070 --> 03:19:03,080
allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a
 

10867
03:19:03,080 --> 03:19:05,269
allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a
red line and that's why we never offered

10868
03:19:05,269 --> 03:19:05,279
red line and that's why we never offered
 

10869
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:07,150
red line and that's why we never offered
it we never provoked it we never brought

10870
03:19:07,150 --> 03:19:07,160
it we never provoked it we never brought
 

10871
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:08,469
it we never provoked it we never brought
it up we said we're going to arm them

10872
03:19:08,469 --> 03:19:08,479
it up we said we're going to arm them
 

10873
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:09,790
it up we said we're going to arm them
and we basically said just just calm

10874
03:19:09,790 --> 03:19:09,800
and we basically said just just calm
 

10875
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:10,990
and we basically said just just calm
down we don't want any conflicts there

10876
03:19:10,990 --> 03:19:11,000
down we don't want any conflicts there
 

10877
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:12,750
down we don't want any conflicts there
we have bigger issues and opportunities

10878
03:19:12,750 --> 03:19:12,760
we have bigger issues and opportunities
 

10879
03:19:12,760 --> 03:19:15,229
we have bigger issues and opportunities
to work for him so I do think you have

10880
03:19:15,229 --> 03:19:15,239
to work for him so I do think you have
 

10881
03:19:15,239 --> 03:19:16,830
to work for him so I do think you have
to think through what's a paradigm that

10882
03:19:16,830 --> 03:19:16,840
to think through what's a paradigm that
 

10883
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:21,269
to think through what's a paradigm that
he can accept um and I do think that you

10884
03:19:21,269 --> 03:19:21,279
he can accept um and I do think that you
 

10885
03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:22,990
he can accept um and I do think that you
know he'll give the justification for

10886
03:19:22,990 --> 03:19:23,000
know he'll give the justification for
 

10887
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,510
know he'll give the justification for
why he's done what he's done and then I

10888
03:19:25,510 --> 03:19:25,520
why he's done what he's done and then I
 

10889
03:19:25,520 --> 03:19:27,830
why he's done what he's done and then I
think the framework for a solution is

10890
03:19:27,830 --> 03:19:27,840
think the framework for a solution is
 

10891
03:19:27,840 --> 03:19:30,429
think the framework for a solution is
about how do we move both parties

10892
03:19:30,429 --> 03:19:30,439
about how do we move both parties
 

10893
03:19:30,439 --> 03:19:32,510
about how do we move both parties

10895

opportunity to do it because I think
 

10897
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:37,389
opportunity to do it because I think
it's a conversation that will only help

and the possibility of collaboration
 

10985
03:21:12,600 --> 03:21:14,469

so during the transition president Trump

10986
03:21:14,469 --> 03:21:14,479
so during the transition president Trump
 

10987
03:21:14,479 --> 03:21:17,389
so during the transition president Trump
took a call from the the head of Taiwan

10988
03:21:17,389 --> 03:21:17,399
took a call from the the head of Taiwan
 

10989
03:21:17,399 --> 03:21:20,389
took a call from the the head of Taiwan
and that sent the Chinese into a a real

10990
03:21:20,389 --> 03:21:20,399
and that sent the Chinese into a a real
 

10991
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:23,229
and that sent the Chinese into a a real
Tail Spin and he didn't do it I think to

10992
03:21:23,229 --> 03:21:23,239
Tail Spin and he didn't do it I think to
 

10993
03:21:23,239 --> 03:21:25,269
Tail Spin and he didn't do it I think to
be provocative to them as much as just

10994
03:21:25,269 --> 03:21:25,279
be provocative to them as much as just
 

10995
03:21:25,279 --> 03:21:27,429
be provocative to them as much as just
as a businessman he felt you answer your

10996
03:21:27,429 --> 03:21:27,439
as a businessman he felt you answer your
 

10997
03:21:27,439 --> 03:21:28,870
as a businessman he felt you answer your
call somebody wants to speak to you you

10998
03:21:28,870 --> 03:21:28,880
call somebody wants to speak to you you
 

10999
03:21:28,880 --> 03:21:30,110
call somebody wants to speak to you you
speak to them like you you want to have

11000
03:21:30,110 --> 03:21:30,120
speak to them like you you want to have
 

11001
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:31,590
speak to them like you you want to have
conversations hear their point of view

11002
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:31,600
conversations hear their point of view
 

11003
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,750
conversations hear their point of view
and but it was taken as a very big

11004
03:21:33,750 --> 03:21:33,760
and but it was taken as a very big
 

11005
03:21:33,760 --> 03:21:35,710
and but it was taken as a very big
insult and it was against tradition and

11006
03:21:35,710 --> 03:21:35,720
insult and it was against tradition and
 

11007
03:21:35,720 --> 03:21:39,389
insult and it was against tradition and
Norm um and so that was something that

11008
03:21:39,389 --> 03:21:39,399
Norm um and so that was something that
 

11009
03:21:39,399 --> 03:21:42,389
Norm um and so that was something that
set us off in in a wrong direction

11010
03:21:42,389 --> 03:21:42,399
set us off in in a wrong direction
 

11011
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:45,110
set us off in in a wrong direction
my view at the time was that you know we

11012
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:45,120
my view at the time was that you know we
 

11013
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:47,229
my view at the time was that you know we
are kind of entering a G2 World whether

11014
03:21:47,229 --> 03:21:47,239
are kind of entering a G2 World whether
 

11015
03:21:47,239 --> 03:21:50,710
are kind of entering a G2 World whether
people want to admit it or not and that

11016
03:21:50,710 --> 03:21:50,720
people want to admit it or not and that
 

11017
03:21:50,720 --> 03:21:52,950
people want to admit it or not and that
a lot of these countries in what I call

11018
03:21:52,950 --> 03:21:52,960
a lot of these countries in what I call
 

11019
03:21:52,960 --> 03:21:54,349
a lot of these countries in what I call
the Middle Market countries were

11020
03:21:54,349 --> 03:21:54,359
the Middle Market countries were
 

11021
03:21:54,359 --> 03:21:55,750
the Middle Market countries were
basically playing this when China was

11022
03:21:55,750 --> 03:21:55,760
basically playing this when China was
 

11023
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:57,110
basically playing this when China was
being aggressive with their one belt one

11024
03:21:57,110 --> 03:21:57,120
being aggressive with their one belt one
 

11025
03:21:57,120 --> 03:21:58,750
being aggressive with their one belt one
road they were basically playing us and

11026
03:21:58,750 --> 03:21:58,760
road they were basically playing us and
 

11027
03:21:58,760 --> 03:22:01,750
road they were basically playing us and
China against each other and I thought

11028
03:22:01,750 --> 03:22:01,760
China against each other and I thought
 

11029
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:04,349
China against each other and I thought
that by the two leaders coming together

11030
03:22:04,349 --> 03:22:04,359
that by the two leaders coming together
 

11031
03:22:04,359 --> 03:22:05,429
that by the two leaders coming together
there were some things they wouldn't

11032
03:22:05,429 --> 03:22:05,439
there were some things they wouldn't
 

11033
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:08,030
there were some things they wouldn't
agree on uh but there's a lot that they

11034
03:22:08,030 --> 03:22:08,040
agree on uh but there's a lot that they
 

11035
03:22:08,040 --> 03:22:10,389
agree on uh but there's a lot that they
probably could agree on which could lead

11036
03:22:10,389 --> 03:22:10,399
probably could agree on which could lead
 

11037
03:22:10,399 --> 03:22:14,269
probably could agree on which could lead
to um resolutions to a lot of issues uh

11038
03:22:14,269 --> 03:22:14,279
to um resolutions to a lot of issues uh
 

11039
03:22:14,279 --> 03:22:15,910
to um resolutions to a lot of issues uh
in the world that that that was like my

11040
03:22:15,910 --> 03:22:15,920
in the world that that that was like my
 

11041
03:22:15,920 --> 03:22:19,469
in the world that that that was like my
most optimistic view um my my most more

11042
03:22:19,469 --> 03:22:19,479
most optimistic view um my my most more
 

11043
03:22:19,479 --> 03:22:21,269
most optimistic view um my my most more
pragmatic view is that President Trump

11044
03:22:21,269 --> 03:22:21,279
pragmatic view is that President Trump
 

11045
03:22:21,279 --> 03:22:23,349
pragmatic view is that President Trump
had very big issues on trade that he

11046
03:22:23,349 --> 03:22:23,359
had very big issues on trade that he

had very big issues on trade that he
wanted to get to with China you know he

11048

wanted to get to with China you know he
 

11049
03:22:24,840 --> 03:22:26,990
wanted to get to with China you know he
felt like China their Trade Practices

11050
03:22:26,990 --> 03:22:27,000
felt like China their Trade Practices
 

11051
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:28,710
felt like China their Trade Practices
were unfair they weren't following all

11052
03:22:28,710 --> 03:22:28,720
were unfair they weren't following all

the global rules of trade uh he was a

11055
03:22:30,840 --> 03:22:32,070
the global rules of trade uh he was a
little bit nervous that they would be

11056
03:22:32,070 --> 03:22:32,080
little bit nervous that they would be
 

11057
03:22:32,080 --> 03:22:33,750
little bit nervous that they would be
provocative with Taiwan and I felt like

provocative with Taiwan and I felt like
 

11059

provocative with Taiwan and I felt like
the two of them getting together would

11060
03:22:35,590 --> 03:22:35,600
the two of them getting together would
 

11061
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:38,189
the two of them getting together would
be the best way to try and resolve that

11062
03:22:38,189 --> 03:22:38,199
be the best way to try and resolve that
 

11063
03:22:38,199 --> 03:22:40,990
be the best way to try and resolve that

lighthiser as a as a back Channel with
 

11343
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:20,870
lighthiser as a as a back Channel with
the Chinese to make sure we can just

11344
03:27:20,870 --> 03:27:20,880
the Chinese to make sure we can just
 

11345
03:27:20,880 --> 03:27:22,990
the Chinese to make sure we can just
deescalate things and get to Solutions

11346

deescalate things and get to Solutions
 

11347
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:27,229
deescalate things and get to Solutions
in a uh in the best way possible and so

11348
03:27:27,229 --> 03:27:27,239
in a uh in the best way possible and so
 

11349
03:27:27,239 --> 03:27:29,309
in a uh in the best way possible and so
um so anyway it was a fascinating time

11350
03:27:29,309 --> 03:27:29,319
um so anyway it was a fascinating time
 

11351
03:27:29,319 --> 03:27:31,189
um so anyway it was a fascinating time
but if you think about the global

11352
03:27:31,189 --> 03:27:31,199
but if you think about the global
 

11353
03:27:31,199 --> 03:27:33,429
but if you think about the global
awareness of the the bad practices that

11354
03:27:33,429 --> 03:27:33,439
awareness of the the bad practices that
 

11355
03:27:33,439 --> 03:27:36,150
awareness of the the bad practices that
China was putting in place today versus

11356
03:27:36,150 --> 03:27:36,160
China was putting in place today versus
 

11357
03:27:36,160 --> 03:27:38,790
China was putting in place today versus
what they were in 2016 I think one of

11358
03:27:38,790 --> 03:27:38,800
what they were in 2016 I think one of
 

11359
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:40,349
what they were in 2016 I think one of
President Trump's most successful

11360
03:27:40,349 --> 03:27:40,359
President Trump's most successful
 

11361
03:27:40,359 --> 03:27:43,269
President Trump's most successful
policies was Shifting the way the entire

11362
03:27:43,269 --> 03:27:43,279

11363
03:27:43,279 --> 03:27:46,910

world understood the threat of China and

11364
03:27:46,910 --> 03:27:46,920
world understood the threat of China and
 

11365
03:27:46,920 --> 03:27:49,910
world understood the threat of China and
then putting in place the beginning of a

11366
03:27:49,910 --> 03:27:49,920
then putting in place the beginning of a
 

11367
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:53,469
then putting in place the beginning of a
regime to try and rebalance the world so

11368
03:27:53,469 --> 03:27:53,479
regime to try and rebalance the world so
 

11369
03:27:53,479 --> 03:27:55,550
regime to try and rebalance the world so
that we could have more economic parity

11370
03:27:55,550 --> 03:27:55,560
that we could have more economic parity
 

11371

11403
03:28:31,520 --> 03:28:33,950
thesis of the book and maybe with a
hopeful view how it's possible to have a

11404
03:28:33,950 --> 03:28:33,960
hopeful view how it's possible to have a
 

11405
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:36,950
hopeful view how it's possible to have a
trajectory of these two superpowers

11406
03:28:36,950 --> 03:28:36,960
trajectory of these two superpowers
 

11407
03:28:36,960 --> 03:28:38,950
trajectory of these two superpowers
working together in the 21st

11408
03:28:38,950 --> 03:28:38,960
working together in the 21st
 

11409
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:41,990
working together in the 21st
century uh versus fighting against each

11410
03:28:41,990 --> 03:28:42,000
century uh versus fighting against each
 

11411
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:44,990
century uh versus fighting against each
other perfect so um it's a very very big

11412
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,000
other perfect so um it's a very very big
 

11413
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,429
other perfect so um it's a very very big
book and I I I think it's a book

the world got stronger China remained
 

11475
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:51,950
the world got stronger China remained
weaker uh then you had the the the the

11722
03:34:05,750 --> 03:34:05,760
trend they went they they they subsidize
 

11723
03:34:05,760 --> 03:34:07,790
trend they went they they they subsidize
solar panels a lot of the American solar

11724
03:34:07,790 --> 03:34:07,800
solar panels a lot of the American solar
 

11725
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:09,790
solar panels a lot of the American solar
panel players were put out of business

11726
03:34:09,790 --> 03:34:09,800
panel players were put out of business
 

11727
03:34:09,800 --> 03:34:12,590
panel players were put out of business
so now I think it's 90 plus% of solar

11728
03:34:12,590 --> 03:34:12,600
so now I think it's 90 plus% of solar
 

11729
03:34:12,600 --> 03:34:14,790
so now I think it's 90 plus% of solar
panels in the world are manufactured in

11730
03:34:14,790 --> 03:34:14,800
panels in the world are manufactured in
 

11731
03:34:14,800 --> 03:34:16,870
panels in the world are manufactured in
China then all the rare Earths that you

11732
03:34:16,870 --> 03:34:16,880
China then all the rare Earths that you
 

11733
03:34:16,880 --> 03:34:20,229
China then all the rare Earths that you
need in order to make these solar panels

11734
03:34:20,229 --> 03:34:20,239
need in order to make these solar panels
 

11735
03:34:20,239 --> 03:34:22,349
need in order to make these solar panels
and to make these electric vehicles

11736
03:34:22,349 --> 03:34:22,359
and to make these electric vehicles
 

11737
03:34:22,359 --> 03:34:24,030
and to make these electric vehicles
China's bought up most of them and a lot

11738
03:34:24,030 --> 03:34:24,040
China's bought up most of them and a lot
 

11739
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:26,309
China's bought up most of them and a lot
of the refining capacities in China so

11740
03:34:26,309 --> 03:34:26,319
of the refining capacities in China so
 

11741
03:34:26,319 --> 03:34:28,510
of the refining capacities in China so
thinking through strategically how do we

11742
03:34:28,510 --> 03:34:28,520
thinking through strategically how do we
 

11743
03:34:28,520 --> 03:34:30,030
thinking through strategically how do we
create an even playing field so that

11744
03:34:30,030 --> 03:34:30,040
create an even playing field so that
 

11745
03:34:30,040 --> 03:34:32,550
create an even playing field so that
we're not at the mercy of them and how

11746
03:34:32,550 --> 03:34:32,560
we're not at the mercy of them and how
 

11747
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:35,110
we're not at the mercy of them and how
you can have a rules-based world order

11748
03:34:35,110 --> 03:34:35,120
you can have a rules-based world order
 

11749
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:37,030
you can have a rules-based world order
that was really kind of the thought of

11750
03:34:37,030 --> 03:34:37,040
that was really kind of the thought of
 

11751
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:40,510
that was really kind of the thought of
what we were trying to work towards so

11752
03:34:40,510 --> 03:34:40,520

12307
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:27,830
again I wasn't going to then take his
plan and then execute it but I thought

12308
03:44:27,830 --> 03:44:27,840
plan and then execute it but I thought
 

12309
03:44:27,840 --> 03:44:30,070
plan and then execute it but I thought
it would be very provocative to

it would be very provocative to
 

12311
03:44:30,080 --> 03:44:31,830
it would be very provocative to
understand from the people in the region

12312
03:44:31,830 --> 03:44:31,840
understand from the people in the region
 

12313
03:44:31,840 --> 03:44:34,830
understand from the people in the region
and instructive how they would use the

12314
03:44:34,830 --> 03:44:34,840
and instructive how they would use the
 

12315
03:44:34,840 --> 03:44:36,630
and instructive how they would use the
resource and the power that the US had

12316
03:44:36,630 --> 03:44:36,640
resource and the power that the US had
 

12317

places focus on the right ideas I think

12400
03:46:14,269 --> 03:46:14,279
places focus on the right ideas I think
 

12401
03:46:14,279 --> 03:46:16,710
places focus on the right ideas I think
the advancement that we can have for

12402
03:46:16,710 --> 03:46:16,720
the advancement that we can have for
 

12403
03:46:16,720 --> 03:46:18,630
the advancement that we can have for
human history and for society can be

12404

human history and for society can be
 

12405
03:46:18,640 --> 03:46:21,110
human history and for society can be
tremendous and I think that right now I

12406
03:46:21,110 --> 03:46:21,120
tremendous and I think that right now I
 

12407
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:22,830
tremendous and I think that right now I
see we're at a place in society where

12408
03:46:22,830 --> 03:46:22,840
see we're at a place in society where
 

12409
03:46:22,840 --> 03:46:24,990
see we're at a place in society where
there's a lot of what I call squabbles

12410
03:46:24,990 --> 03:46:25,000
there's a lot of what I call squabbles
 

12411
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:26,550
there's a lot of what I call squabbles
between countries which are really Man

12412
03:46:26,550 --> 03:46:26,560
between countries which are really Man
 

12413
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:30,590
between countries which are really Man
versus Man issues and those are as old

12414
03:46:30,590 --> 03:46:30,600
versus Man issues and those are as old
 

12415
03:46:30,600 --> 03:46:31,830
versus Man issues and those are as old
as time right you know we've been

12416
03:46:31,830 --> 03:46:31,840
as time right you know we've been
 

12417
03:46:31,840 --> 03:46:34,510
as time right you know we've been
fighting about Borders or or or religion

12418
03:46:34,510 --> 03:46:34,520
fighting about Borders or or or religion
 

12419
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:37,070
fighting about Borders or or or religion
or you know or who wronged somebody a

12420
03:46:37,070 --> 03:46:37,080
or you know or who wronged somebody a
 

12421
03:46:37,080 --> 03:46:38,990
or you know or who wronged somebody a
hundred or a thousand years ago and

12422
03:46:38,990 --> 03:46:39,000
hundred or a thousand years ago and
 

12423
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:40,590
hundred or a thousand years ago and
these are what I call more tribal

12424
03:46:40,590 --> 03:46:40,600
these are what I call more tribal
 

12425
03:46:40,600 --> 03:46:42,870
these are what I call more tribal
battles but I do think that as we

12426
03:46:42,870 --> 03:46:42,880
battles but I do think that as we
 

12427
03:46:42,880 --> 03:46:44,870
battles but I do think that as we
advance with artificial intelligence as

12428
03:46:44,870 --> 03:46:44,880
advance with artificial intelligence as
 

12429
03:46:44,880 --> 03:46:47,870
advance with artificial intelligence as
energy becomes cheaper uh and it's more

12430
03:46:47,870 --> 03:46:47,880
energy becomes cheaper uh and it's more
 

12431
03:46:47,880 --> 03:46:49,349
energy becomes cheaper uh and it's more
readily available I think we're going to

12432
03:46:49,349 --> 03:46:49,359
readily available I think we're going to
 

12433
03:46:49,359 --> 03:46:51,110
readily available I think we're going to
have massive industrialization I think

12434
03:46:51,110 --> 03:46:51,120
have massive industrialization I think
 

12435
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:52,870
have massive industrialization I think
we're going to have massive advancement

12436
03:46:52,870 --> 03:46:52,880
we're going to have massive advancement
 

12437
03:46:52,880 --> 03:46:54,830
we're going to have massive advancement
I think in medical and science we're

12438
03:46:54,830 --> 03:46:54,840
I think in medical and science we're
 

12439
03:46:54,840 --> 03:46:56,790
I think in medical and science we're
going to have uh cures for

12440
03:46:56,790 --> 03:46:56,800
going to have uh cures for
 

12441
03:46:56,800 --> 03:46:59,429
going to have uh cures for
diseases we have the potential in 10 20

12442
03:46:59,429 --> 03:46:59,439
diseases we have the potential in 10 20
 

12443
03:46:59,439 --> 03:47:01,229
diseases we have the potential in 10 20
years from now to enter a dawn for

12444
03:47:01,229 --> 03:47:01,239
years from now to enter a dawn for
 

12445
03:47:01,239 --> 03:47:03,189
years from now to enter a dawn for
Humanity that could be incredible we

12446
03:47:03,189 --> 03:47:03,199
Humanity that could be incredible we
 

12447
03:47:03,199 --> 03:47:04,429
Humanity that could be incredible we
could become

12448
03:47:04,429 --> 03:47:04,439
could become
 

12449
03:47:04,439 --> 03:47:06,750
could become
multiplanetary uh we can we can explore

12450
03:47:06,750 --> 03:47:06,760
multiplanetary uh we can we can explore
 

12451
03:47:06,760 --> 03:47:08,990
multiplanetary uh we can we can explore
the wonders of the world we can find

12452
03:47:08,990 --> 03:47:09,000
the wonders of the world we can find
 

12453
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:13,469
the wonders of the world we can find
things we know um so I think that if if

12454
03:47:13,469 --> 03:47:13,479
things we know um so I think that if if
 

12455
03:47:13,479 --> 03:47:16,590
things we know um so I think that if if
we we put our energy towards finding

12456
03:47:16,590 --> 03:47:16,600
we we put our energy towards finding
 

12457
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:18,670
we we put our energy towards finding
these advancements that will improve the

12458
03:47:18,670 --> 03:47:18,680
these advancements that will improve the
 

12459
03:47:18,680 --> 03:47:22,710

lives of of everyone on this planet
 

12461
03:47:22,720 --> 03:47:24,349
lives of of everyone on this planet
instead of figuring out ways to have

12462
03:47:24,349 --> 03:47:24,359
instead of figuring out ways to have
 

12463
03:47:24,359 --> 03:47:26,870
instead of figuring out ways to have
these tensions between us that for me is

12464
03:47:26,870 --> 03:47:26,880
these tensions between us that for me is
 

12465
03:47:26,880 --> 03:47:28,870
these tensions between us that for me is
the most optimistic case for what's

12466
03:47:28,870 --> 03:47:28,880
the most optimistic case for what's
 

12467
03:47:28,880 --> 03:47:30,189
the most optimistic case for what's
possible and the reason why I believe

12468
03:47:30,189 --> 03:47:30,199
possible and the reason why I believe
 

12469
