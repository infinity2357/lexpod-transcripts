the universe
 

175
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,750
the universe
so the intelligent civilizations existed

176
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
so the intelligent civilizations existed
 

177
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,430
so the intelligent civilizations existed
but they've blown themselves up so your

178
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
but they've blown themselves up so your
 

179
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,150
but they've blown themselves up so your
general intuition is that intelligent

180
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
general intuition is that intelligent
 

181
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,949

there you can't just say happily ever
 

251
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,149
there you can't just say happily ever
after so

252
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
after so
 

253
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,550
after so
it's the thing about destruction is it's

254
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
it's the thing about destruction is it's
 

255
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,470
it's the thing about destruction is it's
over after the destruction

256
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
over after the destruction
 

257
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,469
over after the destruction
um we have to do everything right in

258
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
um we have to do everything right in
 

259
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,069
um we have to do everything right in
order to avoid it

260
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
order to avoid it
 

261
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,189
order to avoid it
and uh one thing wrong i mean actually

262
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
and uh one thing wrong i mean actually
 

263
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,990
and uh one thing wrong i mean actually
that's what i really like about

264
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
that's what i really like about
 

265
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,870
that's what i really like about
cryptography

266
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
cryptography
 

267
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,310
cryptography
cryptography it seems like we live in a

268
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
cryptography it seems like we live in a
 

269
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,030

um versus like nuclear weapons the

272
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
um versus like nuclear weapons the
 

273
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,790
um versus like nuclear weapons the
opposite is true

274
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
opposite is true
 

275
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,790
opposite is true
it is much easier to build a warhead

276
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
it is much easier to build a warhead
 

277
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,390
it is much easier to build a warhead
that splits into 100 little warheads

278
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
that splits into 100 little warheads
 

279
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,830
that splits into 100 little warheads
than to build something that can

280
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
than to build something that can
 

281
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,790
than to build something that can
you know take out 100 little warheads uh

282
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
you know take out 100 little warheads uh
 

283
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,790
you know take out 100 little warheads uh
the offense has the advantage there

284
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
the offense has the advantage there
 

285
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,150
the offense has the advantage there
um so maybe our future is in crypto but

286
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
um so maybe our future is in crypto but
 

287
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,189
um so maybe our future is in crypto but
uh so cryptography right the goliath is

288
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
uh so cryptography right the goliath is
 

289
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,830
uh so cryptography right the goliath is
the

290
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
the
 

291
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,950
the
the defense and then all the different

292
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
the defense and then all the different

294
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
hackers
 

295
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,629
hackers
are the uh are the davids and that

296
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
are the uh are the davids and that
 

297
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,670
are the uh are the davids and that
equation is flipped for nuclear war

298
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
equation is flipped for nuclear war
 

299
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,590
equation is flipped for nuclear war
because there's so many like one nuclear

300
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
because there's so many like one nuclear
 

301
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,189
because there's so many like one nuclear
weapon destroys everything

302
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
weapon destroys everything
 

303
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,590
weapon destroys everything
essentially yeah and it is much easier

304
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
essentially yeah and it is much easier
 

305
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,590
essentially yeah and it is much easier
to uh

306
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
to uh
 

307
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,189
to uh

so okay your intuition that the there
 

323
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,029
so okay your intuition that the there
were intelligent

324
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
were intelligent
 

325
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,830

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
wirehead themselves
 

337
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,230
wirehead themselves
what's wirehead um stimulate stimulate

338
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
what's wirehead um stimulate stimulate
 

339
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,990
what's wirehead um stimulate stimulate
their pleasure centers

340
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
their pleasure centers
 

341
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,909
their pleasure centers
uh and just you know live forever in

342
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
uh and just you know live forever in
 

343
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,749
uh and just you know live forever in
this kind of stasis

344
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
this kind of stasis
 

345
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,950
this kind of stasis
they become well i mean i think the

346
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
they become well i mean i think the
 

347
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,390
they become well i mean i think the
reason i believe this is because where

348
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
reason i believe this is because where
 

349
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,230
reason i believe this is because where
are they

350
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
are they
 

351
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,029
are they
if there's some reason they stopped

352
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
if there's some reason they stopped
 

353
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,469
if there's some reason they stopped
expanding

354
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
expanding
 

355
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,430
expanding
because otherwise they would have taken

356
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
because otherwise they would have taken
 

357
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,550
because otherwise they would have taken
over the universe the universe isn't

358
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
over the universe the universe isn't
 

359
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,070
over the universe the universe isn't
that big or at least you know

360
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
that big or at least you know
 

361
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,070
that big or at least you know
let's just talk about the galaxy right

362
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
let's just talk about the galaxy right
 

363
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,150
let's just talk about the galaxy right
70 000 light years across

364
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
70 000 light years across
 

365
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,510
70 000 light years across
uh i took that number from star trek

366
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
uh i took that number from star trek
 

367
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,029
uh i took that number from star trek
voyager i don't know how true it is but

368
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
voyager i don't know how true it is but
 

369
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,230
voyager i don't know how true it is but
um

370
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
um
 

371
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,270
um
uh yeah that's not big right 70

372
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
uh yeah that's not big right 70
 

373
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,230
uh yeah that's not big right 70
000 light years is nothing for some

374
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
000 light years is nothing for some
 

375
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,909
000 light years is nothing for some
possible technology that you can imagine

376
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
possible technology that you can imagine
 

377
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,510
possible technology that you can imagine
that could leverage like wormholes or

378
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
that could leverage like wormholes or
 

379
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,309
that could leverage like wormholes or
something like that

380
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
something like that
 

381
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,590
something like that
you don't even need wormholes just a von

382
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
you don't even need wormholes just a von
 

383
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,510
you don't even need wormholes just a von
neumann probe is enough a von

384
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
neumann probe is enough a von
 

385
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
neumann probe is enough a von
neumann probe and a million years of

386
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
neumann probe and a million years of
 

387
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,110
neumann probe and a million years of
sublight travel and you'd have taken

388
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
sublight travel and you'd have taken
 

389
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,309
sublight travel and you'd have taken
over the whole universe

390
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
over the whole universe
 

391
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,629
over the whole universe
that clearly uh didn't happen so

392
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
that clearly uh didn't happen so
 

393
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,830
that clearly uh didn't happen so
something stopped it

394
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
something stopped it
 

395
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,070
something stopped it
so you mean if you right for for like a

396
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
so you mean if you right for for like a
 

397
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,950
so you mean if you right for for like a
few million years

398
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
few million years
 

399
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,749
few million years
if you sent out probes that travel close

400
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
if you sent out probes that travel close
 

401
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,710
if you sent out probes that travel close
what's sublight

402
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
what's sublight
 

403
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,150
what's sublight
meaning close to the speed of light

404
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
meaning close to the speed of light
 

405
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,710
meaning close to the speed of light
let's it just spreads

406
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
let's it just spreads
 

407
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,909
let's it just spreads
interesting actually that's an

408
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
interesting actually that's an
 

409
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,070
interesting actually that's an
interesting calculation

410
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
interesting calculation
 

411
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,230
interesting calculation
huh so what makes you think that would

412
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
huh so what makes you think that would
 

413
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,150
huh so what makes you think that would
be able to uh communicate with them

414
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
be able to uh communicate with them
 

415
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,350
be able to uh communicate with them
like uh yeah what what's

416
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
like uh yeah what what's
 

417
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,670
like uh yeah what what's
why do you think we would able to be

418
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
why do you think we would able to be
 

419
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,870
why do you think we would able to be
able to comprehend

420
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
able to comprehend
 

421
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,749
able to comprehend
intelligent lives that are out there

422
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
intelligent lives that are out there
 

423
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,150
intelligent lives that are out there
like

424
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
like
 

425
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,870
like
even if they were among us kind of thing

426
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
even if they were among us kind of thing
 

427
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,430
even if they were among us kind of thing
like

428
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
like
 

429
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,870
like
or even just flying around well

430
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
or even just flying around well
 

431
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,070
or even just flying around well
i mean that's possible it's possible

432
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
i mean that's possible it's possible
 

433
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,189
i mean that's possible it's possible
that there is some sort of prime

434
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
that there is some sort of prime
 

435
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,230
that there is some sort of prime
directive

436
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
directive
 

437
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,150
directive
uh that'd be a really cool universe to

438
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
uh that'd be a really cool universe to
 

439
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,830
uh that'd be a really cool universe to
live in um and there's some reason

440
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
live in um and there's some reason
 

441
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,589
live in um and there's some reason
they're not making themselves visible to

442
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
they're not making themselves visible to
 

443
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,790
they're not making themselves visible to
us

444
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
us
 

445
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,430
us
but it makes sense that they would use

446
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
but it makes sense that they would use
 

447
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,029
but it makes sense that they would use
the same

448
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
the same
 

449
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,110
the same
well at least the same entropy well

450
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
well at least the same entropy well
 

451
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,629
well at least the same entropy well
you're implying the same laws of physics

452
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
you're implying the same laws of physics
 

453
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,070
you're implying the same laws of physics
i don't know what you mean by entropy

454
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
i don't know what you mean by entropy
 

455
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,390
i don't know what you mean by entropy
in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy

456
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy
 

457
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,870
in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy
is the scarce resource in the universe

458
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
is the scarce resource in the universe
 

459
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,469
is the scarce resource in the universe
so what do you think about like stephen

460
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
so what do you think about like stephen
 

461
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,710
so what do you think about like stephen
wolfram and everything is a computation

462
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
wolfram and everything is a computation
 

463
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,029
wolfram and everything is a computation
and then what if they are traveling

464
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
and then what if they are traveling
 

465
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,029
and then what if they are traveling
through this world of computation so

466
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
through this world of computation so
 

467
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,629
through this world of computation so
if you think of the universe as just

468
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
if you think of the universe as just
 

469
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,550
if you think of the universe as just
information processing

470
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
information processing
 

471
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,350
information processing
then uh what you're referring to with

472
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
then uh what you're referring to with
 

473
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,110
then uh what you're referring to with
with entropy

474
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
with entropy
 

475
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,469
with entropy
and then these these pockets of

476
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
and then these these pockets of
 

477
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,150
and then these these pockets of
interesting complex computations

478
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
interesting complex computations
 

479
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,350
interesting complex computations
swimming around

480
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
swimming around
 

481
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,950
swimming around
how do we know they're not already here

482
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960

 

483
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,430

how do we know that this like all the

484
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
how do we know that this like all the
 

485
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,990
how do we know that this like all the
different

486
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
different
 

487
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,230
different
amazing things that are full of mystery

488
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
amazing things that are full of mystery
 

489
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,029
amazing things that are full of mystery
on earth

490
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
on earth
 

491
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,909
on earth
are just like little footprints of

492
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
are just like little footprints of
 

493
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,830
are just like little footprints of
intelligence from

494
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
intelligence from
 

495
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,270
intelligence from
light years away maybe i mean

496
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
light years away maybe i mean
 

497
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,189
light years away maybe i mean
i tend to think that as civilizations

498
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
i tend to think that as civilizations
 

499
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,430
i tend to think that as civilizations
expand they use more and more energy

500
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
expand they use more and more energy
 

501
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,869
expand they use more and more energy
uh and you can never overcome the

502
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
uh and you can never overcome the
 

503
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,869
uh and you can never overcome the
problem of waste heat so where is their

504
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
problem of waste heat so where is their
 

505
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,749
problem of waste heat so where is their
waste heat

506
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
waste heat
 

507
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,110
waste heat
so we'd be able to with our crude

508
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
so we'd be able to with our crude
 

509
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,029
so we'd be able to with our crude
methods be able to see like there's a

510
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
methods be able to see like there's a
 

511
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,270
methods be able to see like there's a
whole lot of

512
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
whole lot of
 

513
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,909
whole lot of
energy here but it could be something

514
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
energy here but it could be something
 

515
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,430
energy here but it could be something
we're not i mean we don't understand

516
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
we're not i mean we don't understand
 

517
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,350
we're not i mean we don't understand
dark energy right dark matter

518
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
dark energy right dark matter
 

519
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,629
dark energy right dark matter
it could be just stuff we don't

520
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
it could be just stuff we don't
 

521
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,790
it could be just stuff we don't
understand at all or they could have a

522
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
understand at all or they could have a
 

523
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,950
understand at all or they could have a
fundamentally different physics

524
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
fundamentally different physics
 

525
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,110
fundamentally different physics
you know like that that we just don't

526
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
you know like that that we just don't
 

527
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,029
you know like that that we just don't
even compromise well i think

528
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
even compromise well i think
 

529
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,550
even compromise well i think
okay i mean it depends how far out you

530
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
okay i mean it depends how far out you
 

531
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,230
okay i mean it depends how far out you
want to go i don't think physics is very

532
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
want to go i don't think physics is very
 

533
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,509
want to go i don't think physics is very
different on the other side of the

534
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
different on the other side of the
 

535
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,589
different on the other side of the
galaxy

536
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
galaxy
 

537
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,230
galaxy
i would suspect that they have i mean if

538
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
i would suspect that they have i mean if
 

539
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,029
i would suspect that they have i mean if
they're in our

540
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
they're in our
 

541
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,750
they're in our
universe they have the same physics well

542
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
universe they have the same physics well
 

543
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,430
universe they have the same physics well
yeah that's the assumption we have

544
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
yeah that's the assumption we have
 

545
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,509
yeah that's the assumption we have
but there could be like super trippy

546
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
but there could be like super trippy
 

547
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,750
but there could be like super trippy
things like

548
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
things like
 

549
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,790
things like
like our cognition

550
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
like our cognition
 

551
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,430
like our cognition
only gets to a slice oh and all the

552
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
only gets to a slice oh and all the
 

553
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,269
only gets to a slice oh and all the
possible instruments that we can design

554
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
possible instruments that we can design
 

555
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,870
possible instruments that we can design
only get to a particular slice of the

556
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
only get to a particular slice of the
 

557
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,630
only get to a particular slice of the
universe and there's something much

558
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
universe and there's something much
 

559
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,110
universe and there's something much
like weirder maybe we can try a thought

560
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
like weirder maybe we can try a thought
 

561
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,829
like weirder maybe we can try a thought
experiment

562
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
experiment
 

563
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,910
experiment
um would people from the past

564
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
um would people from the past
 

565
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,750
um would people from the past
be able to detect the remnants of our

566
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
be able to detect the remnants of our
 

567
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,350
be able to detect the remnants of our
uh we would be able to detect our modern

568
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
uh we would be able to detect our modern
 

569
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,190
uh we would be able to detect our modern
civilization i think the answer is

570
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
civilization i think the answer is
 

571
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,630
civilization i think the answer is
obviously yes

572
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
obviously yes
 

573
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,790
obviously yes
you mean past from 100 years ago well

574
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
you mean past from 100 years ago well
 

575
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,470
you mean past from 100 years ago well
let's even go back further let's go to a

576
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
let's even go back further let's go to a
 

577
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,990
let's even go back further let's go to a
million years ago

578
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
million years ago
 

579
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,670
million years ago
right the humans who were lying around

580
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
right the humans who were lying around
 

581
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,509
right the humans who were lying around
in the desert probably didn't even have

582
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
in the desert probably didn't even have
 

583
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,190
in the desert probably didn't even have
maybe they just barely had fire uh

584
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
maybe they just barely had fire uh
 

585
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,509
maybe they just barely had fire uh
they would understand if a 747 flew

586
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
they would understand if a 747 flew
 

587
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,509
they would understand if a 747 flew
overhead

588
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
overhead
 

589
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,509
overhead
in in in this vicinity but not um

590
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
in in in this vicinity but not um
 

591
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,030
in in in this vicinity but not um
if the if a 747 flew on mars

592
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
if the if a 747 flew on mars
 

593
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,949
if the if a 747 flew on mars
because they wouldn't be able to see far

594
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
because they wouldn't be able to see far
 

595
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,310
because they wouldn't be able to see far
because we're not actually communicating

596
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
because we're not actually communicating
 

597
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,110
because we're not actually communicating
that well

598
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
that well
 

599
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,949
that well
with the rest of the universe we're

600
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
with the rest of the universe we're
 

601
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,190
with the rest of the universe we're
doing okay we're just sending out random

602
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
doing okay we're just sending out random
 

603
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,590
doing okay we're just sending out random
like

604
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
like
 

605
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,110
like
50s tracks of music true

606
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
50s tracks of music true
 

607
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,190
50s tracks of music true
and yeah i mean they'd have to you know

608
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
and yeah i mean they'd have to you know
 

609
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,110
and yeah i mean they'd have to you know
the we've only been broadcasting radio

610
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
the we've only been broadcasting radio
 

611
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,949
the we've only been broadcasting radio
waves for

612
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
waves for
 

613
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,829
waves for
um 150 years and well there's your light

614
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
um 150 years and well there's your light
 

615
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,550
um 150 years and well there's your light
cone

616
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
cone
 

617
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,910
cone
so yeah okay what do you make about all

618
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
so yeah okay what do you make about all
 

619
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,630
so yeah okay what do you make about all
the

620
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
the
 

621
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,150
the
i recently came across this uh having

622
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
i recently came across this uh having
 

623
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,790
i recently came across this uh having
talked to

624
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
talked to
 

625
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,750
talked to
david fravor i don't know if you caught

626
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
david fravor i don't know if you caught
 

627
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,230
david fravor i don't know if you caught
what the

628
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
what the
 

629
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,350
what the
the videos that pentagon released and

630
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
the videos that pentagon released and
 

631
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,750
the videos that pentagon released and
uh the new york times reporting of the

632
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
uh the new york times reporting of the
 

633
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,430
uh the new york times reporting of the
ufo sightings

634
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
ufo sightings
 

635
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,430
ufo sightings
so i kind of looked into it quote

636
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
so i kind of looked into it quote
 

637
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,110
so i kind of looked into it quote
unquote and

638
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
unquote and
 

639
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,310
unquote and
there's actually been like

640
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
there's actually been like
 

641
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,949
there's actually been like
hundreds of thousands of ufo sightings

642
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
hundreds of thousands of ufo sightings
 

643
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,750
hundreds of thousands of ufo sightings
right

644
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
right
 

645
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,990
right
and a lot of it you can explain away in

646
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
and a lot of it you can explain away in
 

647
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,030
and a lot of it you can explain away in
different kinds of ways

648
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
different kinds of ways
 

649
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,630
different kinds of ways
so one is it could be interesting

650
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
so one is it could be interesting
 

651
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,069
so one is it could be interesting
physical phenomena

652
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
physical phenomena
 

653
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,030
physical phenomena
two it could be people wanting to

654
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
two it could be people wanting to
 

655
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,470
two it could be people wanting to
believe

656
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
believe
 

657
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,069
believe
and therefore they conjure up a lot of

658
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
and therefore they conjure up a lot of
 

659
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,509
and therefore they conjure up a lot of
different things that just you know when

660
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
different things that just you know when
 

661
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,030
different things that just you know when
you see different kinds of lights some

662
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
you see different kinds of lights some
 

663
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,630
you see different kinds of lights some
basic physics phenomena

664
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
basic physics phenomena
 

665
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,750
basic physics phenomena

then like you dilute the possibility of

814
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
then like you dilute the possibility of
 

815
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,990
then like you dilute the possibility of
anything being true by

conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy
 

819
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,910
conjuring up all kinds of conspiracy
theories and then you don't know what to

believe and then
 

823
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,389
believe and then
like the idea of truth of objectivity is

824
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
like the idea of truth of objectivity is
 

825
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,670
like the idea of truth of objectivity is
lost completely

829
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,870
everybody has their own truth so you
used to control information by censoring

830
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
used to control information by censoring
 

831
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,430
used to control information by censoring
it

832
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
it
 

833
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,870
it
then the internet happened and

834
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
then the internet happened and
 

835
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,790
then the internet happened and
governments are like oh we can't

836
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
governments are like oh we can't
 

837
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,230
governments are like oh we can't
censor things anymore

838
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
censor things anymore
 

839
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,350
censor things anymore
i know what we'll do you know it's the

840
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
i know what we'll do you know it's the
 

841
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,990
i know what we'll do you know it's the
old story

842
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
old story
 

843
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,790
old story
of uh the story of like tying a flag

844
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
of uh the story of like tying a flag
 

845
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,150
of uh the story of like tying a flag
where the leprechaun tells you the gold

846
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
where the leprechaun tells you the gold
 

847
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,949
where the leprechaun tells you the gold
is buried

848
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
is buried
 

849
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,310
is buried
and you tie one flag and you make the

850
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
and you tie one flag and you make the
 

851
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,910
and you tie one flag and you make the
leprechaun swear to not remove the flag

852
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
leprechaun swear to not remove the flag
 

853
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,110
leprechaun swear to not remove the flag
and you come back to the field later

854
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
and you come back to the field later
 

855
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,150
and you come back to the field later
with a shovel and there's flags

856
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
with a shovel and there's flags
 

857
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,470
with a shovel and there's flags
everywhere

858
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
everywhere
 

859
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,230

that's one way to maintain privacy right

860
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
that's one way to maintain privacy right
 

861
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,150
that's one way to maintain privacy right
is like

862
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
is like
 

863
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,470
is like
in order to protect the contents of this

864
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
in order to protect the contents of this
 

865
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,389
in order to protect the contents of this
conversation for example we could just

866
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
conversation for example we could just
 

867
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,269
conversation for example we could just
generate like millions of deep fake

868
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
generate like millions of deep fake
 

869
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,430
generate like millions of deep fake
conversations where you and i talk

870
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
conversations where you and i talk
 

871
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,430
conversations where you and i talk
and say random things yeah so this is

872
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
and say random things yeah so this is
 

873
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,189
and say random things yeah so this is
just one of them and nobody knows which

874
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
just one of them and nobody knows which
 

875
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,550
just one of them and nobody knows which
one was the real one

876
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
one was the real one
 

877
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,310
one was the real one
this this could be fake right now

878
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
this this could be fake right now
 

879
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,110
this this could be fake right now
classic steganography technique

880
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
classic steganography technique
 

881
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,949

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
okay another absurd question about
 

883
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,030
okay another absurd question about
intelligent life because uh

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,629
we'll talk about just as a programmer
uh do you think intelligent beings out

892
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
uh do you think intelligent beings out
 

893
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,990
uh do you think intelligent beings out
there the civilizations that were out

894
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
there the civilizations that were out

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
something where we engineer machines
 

903
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,949
something where we engineer machines
and are able to encode both

904
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
and are able to encode both
 

905
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,189
and are able to encode both
knowledge into those machines and

906
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199

and with those programming languages if

916
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
and with those programming languages if
 

917
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,230
and with those programming languages if
you think they exist

918
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
you think they exist
 

919
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,990
you think they exist
be at all similar to anything we've

920
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
be at all similar to anything we've
 

921
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,069
be at all similar to anything we've
developed

922
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
developed
 

923
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,550
developed
so i don't see that much of a difference

924
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
so i don't see that much of a difference
 

925
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,829
so i don't see that much of a difference
between

926
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
between
 

927
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,430
between
quote-unquote natural languages and

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880

 

931
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,749

um yeah i think there's so many

932
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
um yeah i think there's so many
 

933
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,829
um yeah i think there's so many
similarities so

934
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
similarities so
 

935
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,470
similarities so
when asked the question what do alien

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
when asked the question what do alien

when asked the question what do alien
languages look like

938
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
languages look like
 

939
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,470
languages look like
i imagine they're not all that

940
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
i imagine they're not all that
 

941
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,389
i imagine they're not all that

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,710
dissimilar from ours
and i think translating in and out of

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
and i think translating in and out of
 

945
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,150
and i think translating in and out of
them

946
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
them
 

947
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,030
them
uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's

948
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's
 

949
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,550
uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's
difficult to compile

like dna to python and then to see
 

953
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,790
like dna to python and then to see
i mean there is a little bit of a gap in

i mean there is a little bit of a gap in
 

955
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,829
i mean there is a little bit of a gap in

that's just
we just haven't cr we haven't understood

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,749
the kind of language that nature uses
well

00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
well
 

971
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,949
well
yet dna is a cad model

972
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
yet dna is a cad model
 

973
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,189
yet dna is a cad model
it's not quite a programming language it

00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
it's not quite a programming language it

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
yeah it's a cad model um so i think in
 

981
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,790
yeah it's a cad model um so i think in
that sense

982
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
that sense
 

983
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,470

molecular level

996
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
molecular level
 

997
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,110
molecular level
um where you need to go to see a lot of

998
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
um where you need to go to see a lot of
 

999
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,509
um where you need to go to see a lot of
these phenomena like protein folding

1000
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
these phenomena like protein folding
 

1001
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,710
these phenomena like protein folding
um so yeah it's not that it's it's not

1002
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
um so yeah it's not that it's it's not
 

1003
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,150
um so yeah it's not that it's it's not
it's not that we don't understand it it

1004
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
it's not that we don't understand it it
 

1005
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,430
it's not that we don't understand it it
just requires a whole lot of compute to

1006
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
just requires a whole lot of compute to
 

1007
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,829
just requires a whole lot of compute to
kind of

1008
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
kind of
 

1009
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,069
kind of
compile it for our human minds it's

1010
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
compile it for our human minds it's
 

1011
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,990
compile it for our human minds it's
inefficient both for the pro

1012
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
inefficient both for the pro
 

1013
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,749
inefficient both for the pro
for the data representation and for the

1014
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
for the data representation and for the
 

1015
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,670
for the data representation and for the
programming yeah it runs well on raw

1016
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
programming yeah it runs well on raw
 

1017
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,629
programming yeah it runs well on raw
nature

1018
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
nature
 

1019
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,150
nature
it runs well in raw nature and when we

1020
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
it runs well in raw nature and when we
 

1021
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,069
it runs well in raw nature and when we
try to build uh emulators or simulators

1022
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
try to build uh emulators or simulators
 

1023
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,870
try to build uh emulators or simulators
for that

1024
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
for that
 

1025
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,270
for that
uh well then manslaughter and i've tried

1026
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
uh well then manslaughter and i've tried
 

1027
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,470
uh well then manslaughter and i've tried
it

1028
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
it
 

1029
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,429
it
it runs in yeah you've commented

1030
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
it runs in yeah you've commented
 

1031
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,069
it runs in yeah you've commented
elsewhere

1032
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
elsewhere
 

1033
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,429
elsewhere
i don't remember where that uh

1034
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
i don't remember where that uh
 

1035
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,750
i don't remember where that uh
one of the problems is simulating nature

1036
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
one of the problems is simulating nature
 

1037
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,270
one of the problems is simulating nature
is tough

1038
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
is tough
 

1039
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,350
is tough
and if you want to sort of deploy a

1040
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
and if you want to sort of deploy a
 

1041
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,429
and if you want to sort of deploy a
prototype

1042
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
prototype
 

1043
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,110
prototype
i forgot how you you put it but it made

1044
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
i forgot how you you put it but it made
 

1045
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,350
i forgot how you you put it but it made
me laugh but animals or humans would

1046
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
me laugh but animals or humans would
 

1047
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,590
me laugh but animals or humans would
need to be involved

1048
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
need to be involved
 

1049
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,950
need to be involved
in order to in order to try to run some

1050
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
in order to in order to try to run some
 

1051
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,990
in order to in order to try to run some
prototype code on um

1052
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
prototype code on um
 

1053
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,430
prototype code on um
like if we're talking about covid and

1054
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
like if we're talking about covid and
 

1055
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,110
like if we're talking about covid and
viruses and so on yeah

1056
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
viruses and so on yeah
 

1057
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,110
viruses and so on yeah
if you were trying to engineer some kind

1058
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
if you were trying to engineer some kind
 

1059
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,870
if you were trying to engineer some kind
of defense mechanisms

1060
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
of defense mechanisms
 

1061
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,470
of defense mechanisms
like a vaccine uh against coven or

1062
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
like a vaccine uh against coven or
 

1063
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,950
like a vaccine uh against coven or
all that kind of stuff that doing any

1064
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
all that kind of stuff that doing any
 

1065
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,549
all that kind of stuff that doing any
kind of experimentation like you can

1066
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
kind of experimentation like you can
 

1067
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,310
kind of experimentation like you can
with like autonomous vehicles would be

1068
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
with like autonomous vehicles would be
 

1069
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,830
with like autonomous vehicles would be
very

1070
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
very
 

1071
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,230
very
technically cost technically and

1072
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
technically cost technically and
 

1073
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,789
technically cost technically and
ethically costly i'm not sure about that

1074
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
ethically costly i'm not sure about that
 

1075
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,310
ethically costly i'm not sure about that
i think you can do tons of

1076
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
i think you can do tons of
 

1077
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,110
i think you can do tons of
uh crazy biology and in test tubes i

1078
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
uh crazy biology and in test tubes i
 

1079
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,430
uh crazy biology and in test tubes i
think

1080
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
think
 

1081
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,630
think
my bigger complaint is more all the

1082
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
my bigger complaint is more all the
 

1083
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,350
my bigger complaint is more all the
tools are so bad

1084
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
tools are so bad
 

1085
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,350
tools are so bad
like literally you mean like like i'm

1086
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
like literally you mean like like i'm
 

1087
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,909
like literally you mean like like i'm
not libraries and i'm not pipetting

1088
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
not libraries and i'm not pipetting
 

1089
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,350
not libraries and i'm not pipetting
like you're handing me a i gotta no no

1090
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
like you're handing me a i gotta no no
 

1091
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,470
like you're handing me a i gotta no no
no no there has to be some

1092
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
no no there has to be some
 

1093
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,909
no no there has to be some
like automating stuff and like the

1094
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
like automating stuff and like the
 

1095
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,390
like automating stuff and like the
yeah but human biology is messy like it

1096
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
yeah but human biology is messy like it
 

1097
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,750
yeah but human biology is messy like it
seems like

1098
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
seems like
 

1099
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,430
seems like
look at those toronto's videos they were

1100
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
look at those toronto's videos they were
 

1101
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,870
look at those toronto's videos they were
a joke it's like it's like a little

1102
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
a joke it's like it's like a little
 

1103
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,710
a joke it's like it's like a little
gantry it's like a little xy gantry high

1104
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
gantry it's like a little xy gantry high
 

1105
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,549
gantry it's like a little xy gantry high
school science project with the pipette

1106
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
school science project with the pipette
 

1107
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,669
school science project with the pipette
i'm like

1108
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
i'm like
 

1109
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,270
i'm like
really gotta be something better you

1110
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
really gotta be something better you
 

1111
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,430
really gotta be something better you
can't build like nice microfluidics and

1112
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
can't build like nice microfluidics and
 

1113
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,590
can't build like nice microfluidics and
i can program the you know

1114
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
i can program the you know
 

1115
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,510
i can program the you know
computation to bio interface i mean this

1116
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
computation to bio interface i mean this
 

1117
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,029
computation to bio interface i mean this
is going to happen

1118
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
is going to happen
 

1119
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,909
is going to happen
but like right now if you are asking me

1120
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
but like right now if you are asking me
 

1121
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,870
but like right now if you are asking me
to pipette

1122
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
to pipette
 

1123
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,310
to pipette
50 milliliters of solution amount

1124
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
50 milliliters of solution amount
 

1125
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,750
50 milliliters of solution amount
this is so crude yeah okay

1126
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
this is so crude yeah okay
 

1127
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,590
this is so crude yeah okay
let's get all the crazy out of the way

1128
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
let's get all the crazy out of the way
 

1129
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,150
let's get all the crazy out of the way
uh so a bunch of people ask me

1130
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
uh so a bunch of people ask me
 

1131
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,590
uh so a bunch of people ask me
since we talked about the simulation

1132
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
since we talked about the simulation
 

1133
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,990
since we talked about the simulation
last time we talked about hacking the

1134
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
last time we talked about hacking the
 

1135
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,789
last time we talked about hacking the
simulation

1136
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
simulation
 

1137
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,830
simulation
do you have any updates any insights

1138
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
do you have any updates any insights
 

1139
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,470
do you have any updates any insights
about how we might be able to go about

1140
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
about how we might be able to go about
 

1141
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,190
about how we might be able to go about
hacking simulation if we indeed do live

1142
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
hacking simulation if we indeed do live
 

1143
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,110
hacking simulation if we indeed do live
in a simulation

1144
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
in a simulation
 

1145
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,830
in a simulation
i think a lot of people misinterpreted

1146
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
i think a lot of people misinterpreted
 

1147
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,310
i think a lot of people misinterpreted
the point of that south by talk

1148
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
the point of that south by talk
 

1149
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,830
the point of that south by talk
the point of the south by talk was not

1150
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
the point of the south by talk was not
 

1151
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,070
the point of the south by talk was not
literally to hack the simulation

1152
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
literally to hack the simulation
 

1153
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,470
literally to hack the simulation
uh i think that this

1154
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480

 

1155
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,110

we this is this is an idea is literally

1156

we this is this is an idea is literally
 

1157
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,710
we this is this is an idea is literally
just i think theoretical physics i think

1158
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
just i think theoretical physics i think
 

1159
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,549
just i think theoretical physics i think
that's the whole

1160
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
that's the whole
 

1161
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,590
that's the whole
you know the whole goal

1162
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
you know the whole goal
 

1163
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,270
you know the whole goal
right you want your grand unified theory

1164
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
right you want your grand unified theory
 

1165
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,870
right you want your grand unified theory
but then okay build a brand new five

1166
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
but then okay build a brand new five
 

1167
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,470
but then okay build a brand new five

this is what nature is i think nature
just provided basically a uh

1322
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
just provided basically a uh
 

1323
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,630
just provided basically a uh
open world and mmorpg and um

1324
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
open world and mmorpg and um
 

1325
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,990
open world and mmorpg and um
you know here it's open world i mean if

1326
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
you know here it's open world i mean if
 

1327

you know here it's open world i mean if
that's the game you want to play you can

1328
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
that's the game you want to play you can
 

1329
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,470
that's the game you want to play you can
play that game but

1330
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
play that game but
 

1331
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,909
play that game but
isn't that isn't that beautiful i know

1332
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
isn't that isn't that beautiful i know
 

1333

isn't that isn't that beautiful i know
if you play diablo they used to have uh

1334
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
if you play diablo they used to have uh
 

1335
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,070
if you play diablo they used to have uh
i think cow level

1336
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
i think cow level
 

1337
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,590
i think cow level
where it's

1338
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
where it's
 

1339
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,350
where it's
so everybody will go just they figured

1340
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
so everybody will go just they figured
 

1341
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,789
so everybody will go just they figured
out this like the best way to gain

1342
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
out this like the best way to gain
 

1343
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,870
out this like the best way to gain
like experience points is to just

1344
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
like experience points is to just
 

1345
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,149
like experience points is to just
slaughter cows over and over and over

1346
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
slaughter cows over and over and over
 

1347
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,190
slaughter cows over and over and over
and uh so they figured out this little

1348
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
and uh so they figured out this little
 

1349
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,950
and uh so they figured out this little
sub game within the bigger game that

1350
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
sub game within the bigger game that
 

1351
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,630
sub game within the bigger game that
this is the most efficient way

1352
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
this is the most efficient way
 

1353
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,029
this is the most efficient way
to get experience points and everybody

1354
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
to get experience points and everybody
 

1355
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,630
to get experience points and everybody
somehow agreed that getting experience

1356
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
somehow agreed that getting experience
 

1357
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,350
somehow agreed that getting experience
points in

1358
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
points in
 

1359
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,110
points in
rpg context where you always want to be

1360
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
rpg context where you always want to be
 

1361
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,390
rpg context where you always want to be
getting more stuff

1362
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
getting more stuff
 

1363
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,029
getting more stuff
more skills more levels keep advancing

1364
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
more skills more levels keep advancing
 

1365
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,310
more skills more levels keep advancing
that seems to be good

1366
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
that seems to be good
 

1367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,510
that seems to be good
so might as well spend sacrifice

1368
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
so might as well spend sacrifice
 

1369
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,070
so might as well spend sacrifice
actual enjoyment of playing a game

1370
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
actual enjoyment of playing a game
 

1371
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,510
actual enjoyment of playing a game
exploring a world

1372
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
exploring a world
 

1373
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,950
exploring a world
and spending like hundreds of hours of

1374
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
and spending like hundreds of hours of
 

1375
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,950
and spending like hundreds of hours of
your time in cow level i mean

1376
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
your time in cow level i mean
 

1377
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,310
your time in cow level i mean
the number of hours i spent in cow level

1378
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
the number of hours i spent in cow level
 

1379
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,070
the number of hours i spent in cow level
i'm not like the most impressive person

1380

i'm not like the most impressive person
 

1381
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,750
i'm not like the most impressive person
because people have probably thousands

1382
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
because people have probably thousands
 

1383
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,430
because people have probably thousands
of hours there but it's ridiculous

1384
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
of hours there but it's ridiculous
 

1385
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,310
of hours there but it's ridiculous
so that's a little absurd game that

1386
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
so that's a little absurd game that
 

1387
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,310
so that's a little absurd game that
brought me joy in some weird dopamine

1388
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
brought me joy in some weird dopamine
 

1389
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,430
brought me joy in some weird dopamine
drug kind of way

bostrom elon musk
and others that talk about an actual

1638
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
and others that talk about an actual
 

1639
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,669
and others that talk about an actual
program

1640
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
program
 

1641
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,149
program
that simulates our universe oh i don't

1642
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:00,159
that simulates our universe oh i don't
 

1643
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,230
that simulates our universe oh i don't
doubt that we're in a simulation i just

1644
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
doubt that we're in a simulation i just
 

1645
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,430
doubt that we're in a simulation i just
think that it's not

1646
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
think that it's not
 

1647
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,510
think that it's not
quite that important i mean i'm

1648
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520
quite that important i mean i'm
 

1649
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,950
quite that important i mean i'm
interested only in simulation theory as

1650
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
interested only in simulation theory as
 

1651
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,310
interested only in simulation theory as
far as like it gives me power

1652
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
far as like it gives me power
 

1653
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,549
far as like it gives me power
over nature uh if it's totally

1654
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
over nature uh if it's totally
 

1655
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,310
over nature uh if it's totally
unfalsifiable then

1656
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
unfalsifiable then
 

1657
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,830
unfalsifiable then
who cares i mean what do you think that

1658
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
who cares i mean what do you think that
 

1659
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,750
who cares i mean what do you think that
experiment would look like like somebody

1660
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
experiment would look like like somebody
 

1661
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,230
experiment would look like like somebody
uh

1662
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,240
uh
 

1663
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,510
uh
on twitter asked ask george what signs

1664
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
on twitter asked ask george what signs
 

1665
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,669
on twitter asked ask george what signs
we would look for to know whether or not

1666
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
we would look for to know whether or not
 

1667
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,789
we would look for to know whether or not
we're in the simulation

1668
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
we're in the simulation
 

1669
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,470
we're in the simulation
which is exactly what you're asking is

1670
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
which is exactly what you're asking is
 

1671
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,070
which is exactly what you're asking is
like

1672
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
like
 

1673
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,029
like
the step that precedes the step of

1674
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
the step that precedes the step of
 

1675
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,710
the step that precedes the step of
knowing how to get more power

1676
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
knowing how to get more power
 

1677
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,870
knowing how to get more power
from this knowledge is to get an

1678
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
from this knowledge is to get an
 

1679
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,630
from this knowledge is to get an
indication that there is some power to

1680
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:34,640
indication that there is some power to
 

1681
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,909
indication that there is some power to
be gained so

1682
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
be gained so
 

1683
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,710
be gained so
get an indication that there you can

1684
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
get an indication that there you can
 

1685
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,510
get an indication that there you can
discover

1686
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,520
discover
 

1687
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,389
discover
and exploit cracks in the simulation or

1688
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
and exploit cracks in the simulation or
 

1689
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,029
and exploit cracks in the simulation or
it doesn't

1690
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
it doesn't
 

1691
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,190
it doesn't
you know in the physics of the universe

1692
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
you know in the physics of the universe
 

1693
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,710
you know in the physics of the universe
yeah

1694
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
yeah
 

1695
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,909
yeah
show me i mean like a memory leak would

1696
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
show me i mean like a memory leak would
 

1697
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,430
show me i mean like a memory leak would
be cool

1698
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
be cool
 

1699
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,830
be cool
like some scrying technology you know

1700
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
like some scrying technology you know
 

1701
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,269
like some scrying technology you know
what what kind of technology

1702
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
what what kind of technology
 

1703
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,230
what what kind of technology
scrying what's that oh that's a weird uh

1704
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
scrying what's that oh that's a weird uh
 

1705
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,350
scrying what's that oh that's a weird uh
this crying is the

1706
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
this crying is the
 

1707
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,630
this crying is the
is the uh paranormal ability to uh

1708
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
is the uh paranormal ability to uh
 

1709
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,029
is the uh paranormal ability to uh
like like remote viewing like being able

1710
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
like like remote viewing like being able
 

1711
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,510
like like remote viewing like being able
to see somewhere where you're not

1712
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
to see somewhere where you're not
 

1713
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,909
to see somewhere where you're not
um so you know i don't think you can do

1714
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
um so you know i don't think you can do
 

1715
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,310
um so you know i don't think you can do
it by chanting in a room but um

1716
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
it by chanting in a room but um
 

1717
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,990
it by chanting in a room but um
if we could find as a memory leak

1718
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
if we could find as a memory leak
 

1719
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,190
if we could find as a memory leak
basically

1720
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200

 

1721
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,029

yeah you're able to access parts you're

1722
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
yeah you're able to access parts you're
 

1723
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,549
yeah you're able to access parts you're
not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and

1724
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and
 

1725
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,070
not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and
thereby discover shortcut

1726
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
thereby discover shortcut
 

1727
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,149
thereby discover shortcut
yeah maybe memory leak means the other

1728
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
yeah maybe memory leak means the other
 

1729
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,430
yeah maybe memory leak means the other
thing as well but i mean like yeah like

1730
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
thing as well but i mean like yeah like
 

1731
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,029
thing as well but i mean like yeah like
an ability to read arbitrary memory

1732
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
an ability to read arbitrary memory
 

1733
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,789
an ability to read arbitrary memory
yeah right and that one's not that

1734
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
yeah right and that one's not that
 

1735
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,470
yeah right and that one's not that
horrifying right the the right ones

1736
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
horrifying right the the right ones
 

1737
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,350
horrifying right the the right ones
start to be horrifying

1738
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
start to be horrifying
 

1739
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,310
start to be horrifying
read right so the the reading is not the

1740
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
read right so the the reading is not the
 

1741
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,029
read right so the the reading is not the
problem yeah

1742
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
problem yeah
 

1743
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,350
problem yeah
it's like heartbleed for the universe oh

1744
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
it's like heartbleed for the universe oh
 

1745
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,549
it's like heartbleed for the universe oh
boy the writing is a big big problem

1746
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
boy the writing is a big big problem
 

1747
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,510
boy the writing is a big big problem
it's a big problem it's the moment you

1748
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
it's a big problem it's the moment you
 

1749
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,269
it's a big problem it's the moment you
can write anything even if it's just

1750
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
can write anything even if it's just
 

1751
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,029
can write anything even if it's just
random noise that's terrifying

1752
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
random noise that's terrifying
 

1753
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,430
random noise that's terrifying
i mean even without even without that

1754
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
i mean even without even without that
 

1755
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,630
i mean even without even without that
like even some of the you know the

1756
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:52,640
like even some of the you know the
 

1757
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,950
like even some of the you know the
nanotech stuff that's coming i think is

1758
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960

 

1759
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,230

i don't know if you're paying attention

1760
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
i don't know if you're paying attention
 

1761
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,389
i don't know if you're paying attention
but actually eric weinstein came out

1762
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
but actually eric weinstein came out
 

1763
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,070
but actually eric weinstein came out
with the theory of everything

1764
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
with the theory of everything
 

1765
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,070
with the theory of everything
i mean that came out he's been working

1766
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
i mean that came out he's been working
 

1767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,830
i mean that came out he's been working
on a theory of everything in the physics

1768
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
on a theory of everything in the physics
 

1769
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,310
on a theory of everything in the physics
world

1770
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
world
 

1771
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,549
world
called geometric community and then for

1772
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
called geometric community and then for
 

1773
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,389
called geometric community and then for
me from computer science person

1774
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399
me from computer science person
 

1775
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,669
me from computer science person
like you stephen wolfram's theory of

1776
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
like you stephen wolfram's theory of
 

1777
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,830
like you stephen wolfram's theory of
everything of like hypographs is super

1778
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
everything of like hypographs is super
 

1779
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,510
everything of like hypographs is super
interesting and beautiful

1780
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
interesting and beautiful
 

1781
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,430
interesting and beautiful
but not from a physics perspective but

1782
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
but not from a physics perspective but
 

1783
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,950
but not from a physics perspective but
from a computational perspective i don't

1784
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
from a computational perspective i don't
 

1785
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,990
from a computational perspective i don't
know have you paid attention

1786
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
know have you paid attention
 

1787
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,269
know have you paid attention
to any of that so again like what would

1788
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
to any of that so again like what would
 

1789
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,110
to any of that so again like what would
make me pay attention and like why like

1790
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
make me pay attention and like why like
 

1791
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,070
make me pay attention and like why like
i hate string theory is okay make a

1792
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
i hate string theory is okay make a
 

1793
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,190
i hate string theory is okay make a
testable prediction

1794
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
testable prediction
 

1795
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,830
testable prediction
right i'm only interested in i'm not

1796
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
right i'm only interested in i'm not
 

1797
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,950
right i'm only interested in i'm not
interested in theories for their

1798
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:34,960
interested in theories for their
 

1799
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,549
interested in theories for their
intrinsic beauty i'm interested in

1800
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
intrinsic beauty i'm interested in
 

1801
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,750
intrinsic beauty i'm interested in
theories that give me power over the

1802
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
theories that give me power over the
 

1803
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,750
theories that give me power over the
universe

1804
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
universe
 

1805
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,669
universe
so if these theories do i'm very

1806
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
so if these theories do i'm very
 

1807
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,750
so if these theories do i'm very
interested um can i just say how

1808
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:43,760
interested um can i just say how
 

1809
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,789
interested um can i just say how
beautiful that

1810
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
beautiful that
 

1811
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,269
beautiful that
is because a lot of physicists say i'm

1812
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
is because a lot of physicists say i'm
 

1813
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,830
is because a lot of physicists say i'm
interested in experimental validation

1814
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
interested in experimental validation
 

1815
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,909
interested in experimental validation
and they skip out the part

1816
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:51,919
and they skip out the part
 

1817
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,310
and they skip out the part
where they say to give me more power in

1818
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
where they say to give me more power in
 

1819
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,430
where they say to give me more power in
the universe

1820

up ethereum

1884
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
up ethereum
 

1885
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,190
up ethereum
and they had a technical deadline

1886
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
and they had a technical deadline
 

1887
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,269
and they had a technical deadline
related to a solidity to ovm compiler

1888
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
related to a solidity to ovm compiler
 

1889
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,669
related to a solidity to ovm compiler
so these are all ethereum technologies

1890
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
so these are all ethereum technologies
 

1891
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,710
so these are all ethereum technologies
so

1892
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
so
 

1893
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,630
so
you stepped in they recognized you uh

1894
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
you stepped in they recognized you uh
 

1895
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,070
you stepped in they recognized you uh
pulled you aside explained their problem

1896
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
pulled you aside explained their problem
 

1897
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,830
pulled you aside explained their problem
and you stepped in and helped them solve

1898
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840
and you stepped in and helped them solve
 

1899
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,029
and you stepped in and helped them solve
the problem

1900
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
the problem
 

1901
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,230
the problem
uh thereby creating legend status

1902
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
uh thereby creating legend status
 

1903
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,549
uh thereby creating legend status
story so uh can you uh

1904
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
story so uh can you uh
 

1905
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,870
story so uh can you uh
tell me the story the little more detail

1906
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
tell me the story the little more detail
 

1907
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,029
tell me the story the little more detail
it seems kind of incredible

1908
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
it seems kind of incredible
 

1909
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,789
it seems kind of incredible
this did this happen yeah yeah it's a

1910
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799
this did this happen yeah yeah it's a
 

1911
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,549
this did this happen yeah yeah it's a
true story it's a true story i mean they

1912
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
true story it's a true story i mean they
 

1913
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,750
true story it's a true story i mean they
wrote a very flattering

1914
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
wrote a very flattering
 

1915
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,190
wrote a very flattering
account of it um they

1916
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
account of it um they
 

1917
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,470
account of it um they
so optimism is the spin the company's

1918
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
so optimism is the spin the company's
 

1919
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,590
so optimism is the spin the company's
called optimism

1920
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
called optimism
 

1921
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,669
called optimism
spin-off of plasma they're trying to

1922
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679
spin-off of plasma they're trying to
 

1923
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,669
spin-off of plasma they're trying to
build l2 solutions on ethereum

1924
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
build l2 solutions on ethereum
 

1925
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,789
build l2 solutions on ethereum
so right now uh

1926
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
so right now uh
 

1927
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,590
so right now uh
every ethereum node has to run every

1928
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
every ethereum node has to run every
 

1929
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,549
every ethereum node has to run every
transaction

1930
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:54,559
transaction
 

1931
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,269
transaction
on the ethereum network um and this kind

1932
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
on the ethereum network um and this kind
 

1933
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,789
on the ethereum network um and this kind
of doesn't scale right because if you

1934
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
of doesn't scale right because if you
 

1935
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,909
of doesn't scale right because if you
have n computers

1936
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
have n computers
 

1937
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,750
have n computers
well you know if that becomes two n

1938
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
well you know if that becomes two n
 

1939
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,029
well you know if that becomes two n
computers you actually still get the

1940
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
computers you actually still get the
 

1941
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,950
computers you actually still get the
same amount of compute

1942
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
same amount of compute
 

1943
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,110
same amount of compute
right this is this is like like o of one

1944
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120
right this is this is like like o of one
 

1945
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,310
right this is this is like like o of one
scaling

1946
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
scaling
 

1947
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,230
scaling
um because they all have to run it okay

1948
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
um because they all have to run it okay
 

1949
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,430
um because they all have to run it okay
fine you get more

1950
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
fine you get more
 

1951
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,590
fine you get more
blockchain security but like the

1952
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
blockchain security but like the
 

1953
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,190
blockchain security but like the
blockchain's already so secure

1954
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
blockchain's already so secure
 

1955
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,350
blockchain's already so secure
can we trade some of that off for speed

1956
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
can we trade some of that off for speed
 

1957
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,710
can we trade some of that off for speed
uh so that's kind of what these l2

1958
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
uh so that's kind of what these l2
 

1959
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,389
uh so that's kind of what these l2
solutions are

1960
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
solutions are
 

1961
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,870
solutions are
they built this thing which kind of um

1962
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
they built this thing which kind of um
 

1963
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,310
they built this thing which kind of um
kind of sandbox

1964
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
kind of sandbox
 

1965
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,710
kind of sandbox
uh for ethereum contracts so they can

1966
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
uh for ethereum contracts so they can
 

1967
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,789
uh for ethereum contracts so they can
run it in this l2 world and it can't do

1968
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
run it in this l2 world and it can't do
 

1969
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,149
run it in this l2 world and it can't do
certain things in l world

1970
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
certain things in l world
 

1971
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,310
certain things in l world
in l1 i can ask you for some definitions

1972
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
in l1 i can ask you for some definitions
 

1973
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,190
in l1 i can ask you for some definitions
what's l2

1974
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
what's l2
 

1975
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,990
what's l2
oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base

1976
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,000
oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base
 

1977
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,029
oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base
ethereum chain

1978
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
ethereum chain
 

1979
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,750
ethereum chain
and then layer two is like a

1980
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
and then layer two is like a
 

1981
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,389
and then layer two is like a
computational layer that runs

1982
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
computational layer that runs
 

1983
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,430
computational layer that runs
um elsewhere but still is kind of

1984
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,440
um elsewhere but still is kind of
 

1985
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,590
um elsewhere but still is kind of
secured by layer one

1986
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
secured by layer one
 

1987
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,750
secured by layer one
and i'm sure a lot of people know but

1988
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
and i'm sure a lot of people know but
 

1989
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,070
and i'm sure a lot of people know but
ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably

1990
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably
 

1991
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,669
ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably
one of the most popular cryptocurrencies

1992
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
one of the most popular cryptocurrencies
 

1993
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,190
one of the most popular cryptocurrencies
second to bitcoin

1994
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
second to bitcoin
 

1995
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,669
second to bitcoin
and a lot of interesting technological

1996
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
and a lot of interesting technological
 

1997
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,710
and a lot of interesting technological
innovations there

1998
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
innovations there
 

1999
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,830
innovations there
maybe you can also slip in

2000
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
maybe you can also slip in
 

2001
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,909
maybe you can also slip in
whenever you talk about this any things

2002
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
whenever you talk about this any things
 

2003
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,269
whenever you talk about this any things
that are exciting to you in the

2004
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
that are exciting to you in the
 

2005
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,990
that are exciting to you in the
ethereum space and why ethereum well i

2006
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
ethereum space and why ethereum well i
 

2007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,389
ethereum space and why ethereum well i
mean

2008
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,399
mean
 

2009
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,990
mean
bitcoin uh is not turn complete

2010
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
bitcoin uh is not turn complete
 

2011
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,190
bitcoin uh is not turn complete
well ethereum is not technically a

2012
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
well ethereum is not technically a
 

2013
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,629
well ethereum is not technically a
terrain complete with a gas limit but

2014
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
terrain complete with a gas limit but
 

2015
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,829
terrain complete with a gas limit but
close enough

2016
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
close enough
 

2017
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,990
close enough
well the gas limit what's the gas limit

2018
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
well the gas limit what's the gas limit
 

2019
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,950
well the gas limit what's the gas limit
resources

2020
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
resources
 

2021
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,470
resources
yeah i mean no computers actually turn

2022
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
yeah i mean no computers actually turn
 

2023
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,109
yeah i mean no computers actually turn
complete right right

2024
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
complete right right
 

2025
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,790
complete right right
you're fine at ram you know what if i

2026
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
you're fine at ram you know what if i
 

2027
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,790
you're fine at ram you know what if i
can actually solve this gas limit you

2028
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
can actually solve this gas limit you
 

2029
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,149
can actually solve this gas limit you
just have so many brilliant

2030
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
just have so many brilliant
 

2031
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,510
just have so many brilliant
words i'm not even gonna ask but that's

2032
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
words i'm not even gonna ask but that's
 

2033
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,950
words i'm not even gonna ask but that's
what that's no that's not my word that's

2034
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
what that's no that's not my word that's
 

2035
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,149
what that's no that's not my word that's
ethereum's word

2036
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
ethereum's word
 

2037
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,149
ethereum's word
gasoline ethereum you have to spend gas

2038
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
gasoline ethereum you have to spend gas
 

2039
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,190
gasoline ethereum you have to spend gas
per instruction

2040
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
per instruction
 

2041
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,629
per instruction
so like different op codes use different

2042
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639
so like different op codes use different
 

2043
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,470
so like different op codes use different
amounts of gas and you

2044
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
amounts of gas and you
 

2045
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,550
amounts of gas and you
buy gas with ether to prevent people

2046
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
buy gas with ether to prevent people
 

2047
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,629
buy gas with ether to prevent people
from basically ddosing the network

2048
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
from basically ddosing the network
 

2049
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,069
from basically ddosing the network
so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then

2050
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then
 

2051
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,990
so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then
what's ethereum it's also proof of work

2052
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
what's ethereum it's also proof of work
 

2053
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,190
what's ethereum it's also proof of work
uh they're working on some

2054
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
uh they're working on some
 

2055
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,109
uh they're working on some
proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff but

2056
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff but
 

2057
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:51,829
proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff but
right now it's

2058
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
right now it's
 

2059
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,190
right now it's
it's proof of work usually a different

2060
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
it's proof of work usually a different
 

2061
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,109
it's proof of work usually a different
hash function from bitcoin that's more

2062
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:55,119
hash function from bitcoin that's more
 

2063
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,270
hash function from bitcoin that's more
asic resistance because you need ram

2064
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
asic resistance because you need ram
 

2065
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,349
asic resistance because you need ram
so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0

2066
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0
 

2067
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,950
so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0
yeah so what uh

2068
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
yeah so what uh
 

2069
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,790
yeah so what uh
what were they trying to do to scale

2070
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
what were they trying to do to scale
 

2071
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,470
what were they trying to do to scale
this whole process so they were like

2072
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
this whole process so they were like
 

2073
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:04,790
this whole process so they were like
well

2074
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
well
 

2075
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,829
well
if we could run contracts elsewhere um

2076
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:07,839
if we could run contracts elsewhere um
 

2077
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,510
if we could run contracts elsewhere um
and then only save the results of that

2078
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
and then only save the results of that
 

2079
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,349
and then only save the results of that
computation

2080
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
computation
 

2081
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,670
computation
uh you know well we don't actually have

2082
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:13,680
uh you know well we don't actually have
 

2083
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,710
uh you know well we don't actually have
to do the computer on the chain we can

2084
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:14,720
to do the computer on the chain we can
 

2085
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,150
to do the computer on the chain we can
do the compute off chain and just post

2086
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
do the compute off chain and just post
 

2087
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,270
do the compute off chain and just post
what the results are

2088
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
what the results are
 

2089
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,790
what the results are
now the problem with that is well

2090
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
now the problem with that is well
 

2091
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,069
now the problem with that is well
somebody could lie about what the

2092
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
somebody could lie about what the
 

2093
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,030
somebody could lie about what the
results are

2094
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
results are
 

2095
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,270
results are
so you need a resolution mechanism and

2096
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
so you need a resolution mechanism and
 

2097
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,950
so you need a resolution mechanism and
the resolution mechanism can be really

2098
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
the resolution mechanism can be really
 

2099
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,069
the resolution mechanism can be really
expensive

2100
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
expensive
 

2101
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,390
expensive
uh because you know you just have to

2102
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
uh because you know you just have to
 

2103
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,510
uh because you know you just have to
make sure that like

2104
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
make sure that like
 

2105
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,069
make sure that like
the person who is saying look i swear

2106
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
the person who is saying look i swear
 

2107
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,670
the person who is saying look i swear
that this is the real computation

2108
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
that this is the real computation
 

2109
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,670
that this is the real computation
i'm staking ten thousand dollars on that

2110
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
i'm staking ten thousand dollars on that
 

2111
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,270
i'm staking ten thousand dollars on that
fact and

2112
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
fact and
 

2113
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,670
fact and
if you prove it wrong yeah it might cost

2114
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,680
if you prove it wrong yeah it might cost
 

2115
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,589
if you prove it wrong yeah it might cost
you three thousand dollars in gas fees

2116
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
you three thousand dollars in gas fees
 

2117
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,630
you three thousand dollars in gas fees
to prove wrong

2118
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
to prove wrong
 

2119
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,829
to prove wrong
but you'll get the ten thousand dollar

2120
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:43,839
but you'll get the ten thousand dollar
 

2121
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,670
but you'll get the ten thousand dollar
bounty so you can secure

2122
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
bounty so you can secure
 

2123
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,790
bounty so you can secure
using those kind of systems um

2124
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
using those kind of systems um
 

2125
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,349
using those kind of systems um
so it's effectively a sandbox which runs

2126
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
so it's effectively a sandbox which runs
 

2127
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,390
so it's effectively a sandbox which runs
contracts

2128
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
contracts
 

2129
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,030
contracts
uh and like just like any kind of normal

2130
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
uh and like just like any kind of normal
 

2131
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,829
uh and like just like any kind of normal
sandbox you have to like replace

2132
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:56,839
sandbox you have to like replace
 

2133
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,750
sandbox you have to like replace
syscalls with um you know calls into the

2134
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
syscalls with um you know calls into the
 

2135
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,829
syscalls with um you know calls into the
hypervisor

2136
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
hypervisor
 

2137
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,349
hypervisor
uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do

2138
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do
 

2139
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,230
uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do
these things mean

2140
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
these things mean
 

2141
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,790
these things mean
uh as long as it's interesting to talk

2142
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
uh as long as it's interesting to talk
 

2143
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,470
uh as long as it's interesting to talk
about yeah i mean you can take like the

2144
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
about yeah i mean you can take like the
 

2145
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,190
about yeah i mean you can take like the
chrome

2146
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,200
chrome
 

2147
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,109
chrome
is maybe the one to think about right so

2148
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
is maybe the one to think about right so
 

2149
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,550
is maybe the one to think about right so
the chrome process that's doing a

2150
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
the chrome process that's doing a
 

2151
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,670
the chrome process that's doing a
rendering

2152
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
rendering
 

2153
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,349
rendering
uh can't for example read a file from

2154
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
uh can't for example read a file from
 

2155
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,710
uh can't for example read a file from
the file system yeah

2156
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
the file system yeah
 

2157
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,470
the file system yeah
it has if it tries to make an open

2158
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
it has if it tries to make an open
 

2159
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,630
it has if it tries to make an open
syscall in linux the open system

2160
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:22,640
syscall in linux the open system
 

2161
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,990
syscall in linux the open system
you can't make it open says call no no

2162
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
you can't make it open says call no no
 

2163
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,150
you can't make it open says call no no
no uh you have to request

2164
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
no uh you have to request
 

2165
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,030
no uh you have to request
from the kind of uh hypervisor process

2166
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
from the kind of uh hypervisor process
 

2167
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,510
from the kind of uh hypervisor process
or

2168
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
or
 

2169
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,349
or
like i don't know what's called in

2170
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
like i don't know what's called in
 

2171
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,829
like i don't know what's called in
chrome but um

2172
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
chrome but um
 

2173
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,829
chrome but um
the canoe hey could you open this file

2174
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
the canoe hey could you open this file
 

2175
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,349
the canoe hey could you open this file
for me and then it does all these checks

2176
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
for me and then it does all these checks
 

2177
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,950
for me and then it does all these checks
and then it passes the file handle back

2178
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
and then it passes the file handle back
 

2179
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,710
and then it passes the file handle back
in if it's approved

2180
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
in if it's approved
 

2181
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,190
in if it's approved
um so that's yeah uh so what's the in

2182
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
um so that's yeah uh so what's the in
 

2183
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,270
um so that's yeah uh so what's the in
the context of ethereum

2184
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
the context of ethereum
 

2185
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,109
the context of ethereum
what are the boundaries of the sandbox

2186
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:47,119
what are the boundaries of the sandbox
 

2187
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,790
what are the boundaries of the sandbox
that we're talking about um well like

2188
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
that we're talking about um well like
 

2189
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,710
that we're talking about um well like
one of the calls that you

2190
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
one of the calls that you
 

2191
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,190
one of the calls that you
actually reading and uh writing any

2192
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
actually reading and uh writing any
 

2193
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,670
actually reading and uh writing any
state to the ethereum contract

2194
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
state to the ethereum contract
 

2195
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,790
state to the ethereum contract
to the ethereum blockchain um

2196
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
to the ethereum blockchain um
 

2197
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,030
to the ethereum blockchain um
writing state is one of those calls that

2198
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,040
writing state is one of those calls that
 

2199
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,109
writing state is one of those calls that
you're going to have to sandbox

2200
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,119
you're going to have to sandbox
 

2201
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,230
you're going to have to sandbox
in layer two because if you let layer

2202
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
in layer two because if you let layer
 

2203
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,870
in layer two because if you let layer
two just

2204
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
two just
 

2205
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,630
two just
arbitrarily right to the ethereum

2206
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640
arbitrarily right to the ethereum
 

2207
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,310
arbitrarily right to the ethereum
blockchain um

2208
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
blockchain um
 

2209
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,790
blockchain um
so layer two is except is really sitting

2210
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
so layer two is except is really sitting
 

2211
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,990
so layer two is except is really sitting
on top of

2212
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
on top of
 

2213
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,990
on top of
layer one so you're gonna have a lot of

2214
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
layer one so you're gonna have a lot of
 

2215
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,430
layer one so you're gonna have a lot of
different kinds of ideas that you can

2216
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
different kinds of ideas that you can
 

2217
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,150
different kinds of ideas that you can
play with

2218
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
play with
 

2219
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,670
play with
yeah and they're all they're not

2220
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
yeah and they're all they're not
 

2221
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,349
yeah and they're all they're not
fundamentally changing

2222
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
fundamentally changing
 

2223
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,109
fundamentally changing
the source code level of ethereum

2224
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
the source code level of ethereum
 

2225
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,069
the source code level of ethereum
well you have to replace a bunch of

2226
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,079
well you have to replace a bunch of
 

2227
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,790
well you have to replace a bunch of
calls

2228
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
calls
 

2229
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,190
calls
with calls into the hypervisor so

2230
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
with calls into the hypervisor so
 

2231
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,829
with calls into the hypervisor so
instead of doing the syscall directly

2232
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839
instead of doing the syscall directly
 

2233
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,750
instead of doing the syscall directly
you you replace it with a call to the

2234
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
you you replace it with a call to the
 

2235
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,190
you you replace it with a call to the
hypervisor

2236
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
hypervisor
 

2237
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,390
hypervisor
so originally they were doing this by

2238
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
so originally they were doing this by
 

2239
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,630
so originally they were doing this by
first running the so solidity is the

2240
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
first running the so solidity is the
 

2241
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,470
first running the so solidity is the
language that most ethereum contracts

2242
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,480
language that most ethereum contracts
 

2243
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,270
language that most ethereum contracts
are written in

2244
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
are written in
 

2245
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,910
are written in
it compiles to a byte code and then they

2246
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
it compiles to a byte code and then they
 

2247
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,950
it compiles to a byte code and then they
wrote this thing they called the

2248
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
wrote this thing they called the
 

2249
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,270
wrote this thing they called the
transpiler and the transpiler took the

2250
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
transpiler and the transpiler took the
 

2251
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,390
transpiler and the transpiler took the
byte code

2252
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,400
byte code
 

2253
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,270
byte code
and it transpiled it into ovm safe

2254
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
and it transpiled it into ovm safe
 

2255
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,910
and it transpiled it into ovm safe
bytecode

2256
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
bytecode
 

2257
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,430
bytecode
basically bytecode that didn't make any

2258
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
basically bytecode that didn't make any
 

2259
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,109
basically bytecode that didn't make any
of those restricted syscalls and added

2260
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
of those restricted syscalls and added
 

2261
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,670
of those restricted syscalls and added
the calls to the hypervisor

2262
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
the calls to the hypervisor
 

2263
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,510
the calls to the hypervisor
this transpiler was a 3000 line mess

2264
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
this transpiler was a 3000 line mess
 

2265
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,910
this transpiler was a 3000 line mess
and it's hard to do it's hard to do if

2266
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
and it's hard to do it's hard to do if
 

2267
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,109
and it's hard to do it's hard to do if
you're trying to do it like that because

2268
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
you're trying to do it like that because
 

2269
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,630
you're trying to do it like that because
you have to kind of like deconstruct the

2270
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
you have to kind of like deconstruct the
 

2271
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,150
you have to kind of like deconstruct the
byte code

2272
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
byte code
 

2273
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,430
byte code
change things about it and then

2274
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
change things about it and then
 

2275
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,270
change things about it and then
reconstruct it

2276
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
reconstruct it
 

2277
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,870
reconstruct it
and i mean as soon as i hear this i'm

2278
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
and i mean as soon as i hear this i'm
 

2279
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,470
and i mean as soon as i hear this i'm
like why don't you just change the

2280
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
like why don't you just change the
 

2281
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,829
like why don't you just change the
compiler

2282
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
compiler
 

2283
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,750
compiler
right why not the first place you build

2284
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
right why not the first place you build
 

2285
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,310
right why not the first place you build
the bytecode just do it in the compiler

2286
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
the bytecode just do it in the compiler
 

2287
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,030
the bytecode just do it in the compiler
uh so yeah you know i asked them how

2288
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
uh so yeah you know i asked them how
 

2289
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,230
uh so yeah you know i asked them how
much they wanted it

2290
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,240
much they wanted it
 

2291
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,190
much they wanted it
uh of course measured in dollars and i'm

2292
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200
uh of course measured in dollars and i'm
 

2293
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,310
uh of course measured in dollars and i'm
like well okay

2294
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
like well okay
 

2295
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,750
like well okay
um and yeah and you wrote the compiler

2296
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
um and yeah and you wrote the compiler
 

2297
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,990
um and yeah and you wrote the compiler
yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff

2298
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff
 

2299
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,870
yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff
to the compiler

2300
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
to the compiler
 

2301
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,790
to the compiler
uh it's open source you can look at it

2302
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
uh it's open source you can look at it
 

2303
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,390
uh it's open source you can look at it
yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last

2304
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last
 

2305
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,140
yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last
night

2306
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,150
night
 

2307
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,349

2315
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,030
uh and it's um c plus plus
see if it's lost yeah so when

2316
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
see if it's lost yeah so when
 

2317
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,190
see if it's lost yeah so when
asked how you were able to do it you

2318
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
asked how you were able to do it you
 

2319

okay i mean is there some
 

2339
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,030
okay i mean is there some
deep profound insights to draw from like

deep profound insights to draw from like
how you problem solve from that because

2342
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
how you problem solve from that because

oh i'm extremely bullish on crypto long

2362
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,160
oh i'm extremely bullish on crypto long

term not any specific crypto project

2364
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
term not any specific crypto project
 

2365
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,470
term not any specific crypto project
but this idea of

2366
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
but this idea of
 

2367
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,829
but this idea of
well two ideas one um

2368
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:51,839
well two ideas one um
 

2369
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,950
well two ideas one um
the nakamoto consensus algorithm is

2370
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
the nakamoto consensus algorithm is
 

2371
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,190
the nakamoto consensus algorithm is
i think one of the greatest innovations

2372
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,200
i think one of the greatest innovations
 

2373
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,470
i think one of the greatest innovations
of the 21st century

2374
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
of the 21st century
 

2375
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,550
of the 21st century
this idea that people can reach

2376
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
this idea that people can reach
 

2377
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,230
this idea that people can reach
consensus you can reach a group

2378
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,240
consensus you can reach a group
 

2379
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,349
consensus you can reach a group
consensus

2380
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
consensus
 

2381
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,109
consensus
using a relatively straightforward

2382
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
using a relatively straightforward
 

2383
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,470
using a relatively straightforward
algorithm

2384
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
algorithm
 

2385
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,069
algorithm
um is wild and

2386
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
um is wild and
 

2387
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,230
um is wild and
like you know satoshi nakamoto people

2388
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
like you know satoshi nakamoto people
 

2389
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,230
like you know satoshi nakamoto people
always ask me who i look up to it's like

2390
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
always ask me who i look up to it's like
 

2391
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,109
always ask me who i look up to it's like
whoever that is who do you think it is i

2392
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
whoever that is who do you think it is i
 

2393
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,430
whoever that is who do you think it is i
mean

2394
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
mean
 

2395
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,190
mean
elon musk is it you it is definitely not

2396
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200
elon musk is it you it is definitely not
 

2397
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,069
elon musk is it you it is definitely not
me and i do not think it's elon musk

2398
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:26,079
me and i do not think it's elon musk
 

2399
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,589
me and i do not think it's elon musk
but yeah this idea of uh

2400
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
but yeah this idea of uh
 

2401
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,069
but yeah this idea of uh
groups reaching consensus in a

2402
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
groups reaching consensus in a
 

2403
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,870
groups reaching consensus in a
decentralized yet formulaic way

2404
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:34,880
decentralized yet formulaic way
 

2405
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,950
decentralized yet formulaic way
is one extremely powerful idea from

2406
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
is one extremely powerful idea from
 

2407
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,390
is one extremely powerful idea from
crypto

2408
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400

 

2409
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,750

maybe the second idea is this idea of

2410
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
maybe the second idea is this idea of
 

2411
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,670
maybe the second idea is this idea of
smart contracts

2412
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
smart contracts
 

2413
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,550
smart contracts
when you write a contract between two

2414
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
when you write a contract between two
 

2415
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,030
when you write a contract between two
parties

2416
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
parties
 

2417
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,150
parties
any contract um this contract

2418
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,160
any contract um this contract
 

2419
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,390
any contract um this contract
if there are disputes it's interpreted

2420
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,400
if there are disputes it's interpreted
 

2421
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,069
if there are disputes it's interpreted
by lawyers

2422
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
by lawyers
 

2423
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,870
by lawyers
lawyers are just really shitty overpaid

2424
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
lawyers are just really shitty overpaid
 

2425
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,910
lawyers are just really shitty overpaid
interpreters

2426
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
interpreters
 

2427
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,430
interpreters
imagine you had let's talk about them in

2428
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
imagine you had let's talk about them in
 

2429
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,710
imagine you had let's talk about them in
terms of a in terms of like let's

2430
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:02,720
terms of a in terms of like let's
 

2431
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,150
terms of a in terms of like let's
compare a lawyer to python

2432
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,160
compare a lawyer to python
 

2433
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,990
compare a lawyer to python
right so lawyer well okay that's really

2434
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
right so lawyer well okay that's really
 

2435
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,150
right so lawyer well okay that's really
oh i never thought of it that way it's

2436
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
oh i never thought of it that way it's
 

2437
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,190
oh i never thought of it that way it's
hilarious

2438
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,200
hilarious
 

2439
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,309
hilarious
so python i'm paying i'm paying um

2440
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
so python i'm paying i'm paying um
 

2441
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,069
so python i'm paying i'm paying um
you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use

2442
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use
 

2443
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,750
you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use
the nice azure machine i can run python

2444
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
the nice azure machine i can run python
 

2445
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,589
the nice azure machine i can run python
for 10 cents an hour

2446
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
for 10 cents an hour
 

2447
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,349
for 10 cents an hour
lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour

2448
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,359
lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour
 

2449
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,190
lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour
so python is is is

2450
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
so python is is is
 

2451
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,790
so python is is is
10 000 x uh better on that axis um

2452
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
10 000 x uh better on that axis um
 

2453
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,950
10 000 x uh better on that axis um
lawyers don't always return the same

2454
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
lawyers don't always return the same
 

2455
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,309
lawyers don't always return the same
answer

2456
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
answer
 

2457
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,309
answer
um python almost always does

2458
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:34,319
um python almost always does
 

2459
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,750
um python almost always does
uh cost

2460
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
uh cost
 

2461
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,870
uh cost
yeah i mean just just cost reliability

2462
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah i mean just just cost reliability
 

2463
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,309
yeah i mean just just cost reliability
everything about python is so much

2464
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
everything about python is so much
 

2465
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,230
everything about python is so much
better than lawyers um so if you can

2466
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
better than lawyers um so if you can
 

2467
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,910
better than lawyers um so if you can
make smart contracts

2468
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
make smart contracts
 

2469
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,309
make smart contracts
this whole concept of code is law

2470
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
this whole concept of code is law
 

2471
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,710
this whole concept of code is law
i i love and i would love to live in a

2472
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
i i love and i would love to live in a
 

2473
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,510
i i love and i would love to live in a
world where everybody accepted that fact

2474
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:55,520
world where everybody accepted that fact
 

2475
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,030
world where everybody accepted that fact
so so maybe uh you can talk about what

2476
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,040
so so maybe uh you can talk about what
 

2477
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,990
so so maybe uh you can talk about what
smart contracts

2478
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
smart contracts
 

2479
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,750
smart contracts
are so let's say um

2480
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
are so let's say um
 

2481
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,510
are so let's say um
let's say you know we have a uh

2482
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
let's say you know we have a uh
 

2483
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,230
let's say you know we have a uh
even something as simple as a safety

2484
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,240
even something as simple as a safety
 

2485
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,349
even something as simple as a safety
deposit box

2486
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
deposit box
 

2487
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,589
deposit box
right safety deposit box that holds a

2488
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
right safety deposit box that holds a
 

2489
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,630
right safety deposit box that holds a
million dollars

2490
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
million dollars
 

2491
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,309
million dollars
i have a contract with the bank that

2492
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
i have a contract with the bank that
 

2493
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,190
i have a contract with the bank that
says two out of these three parties

2494
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
says two out of these three parties
 

2495
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,190
says two out of these three parties
uh must uh be present to open the safety

2496
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
uh must uh be present to open the safety
 

2497
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,109
uh must uh be present to open the safety
deposit box and get the money out

2498
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
deposit box and get the money out
 

2499
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,309
deposit box and get the money out
so that's a contract for the bank and

2500
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
so that's a contract for the bank and
 

2501
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,750
so that's a contract for the bank and
it's only as good as the bank and the

2502
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
it's only as good as the bank and the
 

2503
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,950
it's only as good as the bank and the
lawyers right

2504
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
lawyers right
 

2505
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,710
lawyers right
let's say you know somebody dies and now

2506
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
let's say you know somebody dies and now
 

2507
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,069
let's say you know somebody dies and now
oh we're going to go through a big legal

2508
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
oh we're going to go through a big legal
 

2509
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,670
oh we're going to go through a big legal
dispute about whether oh well was it in

2510
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:35,680
dispute about whether oh well was it in
 

2511
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,510
dispute about whether oh well was it in
the will was it not in the well

2512
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
the will was it not in the well
 

2513
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,069
the will was it not in the well
what like it's just so messy and the

2514
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
what like it's just so messy and the
 

2515
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,630
what like it's just so messy and the
cost

2516
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
cost
 

2517
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,470
cost
to determine truth is so expensive

2518
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
to determine truth is so expensive
 

2519
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,470
to determine truth is so expensive
versus a smart contract which just uses

2520
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480

do you think

2572
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
do you think
 

2573
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,510
do you think
there's something that's appealing to

00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,520
there's something that's appealing to
 

2575
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,950
there's something that's appealing to
you about any one specific

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,829
it's interesting to think about that we
need to create systems

2680

that emerge
are the geniuses in the system i mean

2686
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
are the geniuses in the system i mean
 

2687
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:33,910
are the geniuses in the system i mean
that's

2807
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,829
imagine that in a hundred years that's
not the case right the crypto world has

2808
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
not the case right the crypto world has
 

2809
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,910
not the case right the crypto world has
one very powerful idea going for it and

and they love the analysis
perhaps the over analysis and you right

2972
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,280
perhaps the over analysis and you right
 

2973
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,549
perhaps the over analysis and you right
now at least at your age

this is this is a fair point i do think

2988
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
this is this is a fair point i do think
 

2989
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,910
this is this is a fair point i do think
i have a certain aversion

2990
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
i have a certain aversion
 

2991
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,430
i have a certain aversion
to um this kind of deliberate

2992
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
to um this kind of deliberate
 

2993
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,549
to um this kind of deliberate
intentional way of living life

2994
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
intentional way of living life
 

2995
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,270
intentional way of living life
here eventually the hilarity of this

2996
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
here eventually the hilarity of this
 

2997
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,910
here eventually the hilarity of this
especially

2998
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
especially
 

2999
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,109
especially
since this is recorded

3000
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119

 

3001
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,030

it will reveal beautifully the absurdity

3002
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
it will reveal beautifully the absurdity
 

3003
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,109
it will reveal beautifully the absurdity
when you finally do publish this book

3004
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
when you finally do publish this book
 

3005
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,069
when you finally do publish this book
and i guarantee you you will the story

3006
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
and i guarantee you you will the story
 

3007
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,430
and i guarantee you you will the story
of comma ai

3008
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
of comma ai
 

3009
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,510
of comma ai
would be maybe it'll be a biography

3010
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,520
would be maybe it'll be a biography
 

3011
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,710
would be maybe it'll be a biography
written about you

3012
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
written about you
 

3013
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,390
written about you
they'll be they'll be better i guess and

00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
they'll be they'll be better i guess and
 

3015
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,910
they'll be they'll be better i guess and

you might be able to learn some cute
 

3017
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,430
you might be able to learn some cute
lessons if you're starting a company

3018
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,440
lessons if you're starting a company
 

3019
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,270
lessons if you're starting a company

like comma ai from that book
 

3021
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,270
like comma ai from that book
but if you're asking generic questions

3022

learning things outside

3034
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400

3039
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,990
it feels like from an outsider's
perspective i mean that

3040
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
perspective i mean that
 

3041
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,549
perspective i mean that
uh you know that i don't know if there's

3042
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
uh you know that i don't know if there's
 

3043
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,630
uh you know that i don't know if there's
an advice on that

3044
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:30,640
an advice on that
 

3045
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,270
an advice on that
but it is an interesting curiosity when

00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
but it is an interesting curiosity when
 

3047
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,630
but it is an interesting curiosity when
you become really busy

3048
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
you become really busy
 

3049
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,829

3054
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
but like there's a natural inclination
 

3055
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,030
but like there's a natural inclination
and

3056
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
and
 

3057
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,829
and
trend like just the the the momentum of

3058
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
trend like just the the the momentum of
 

3059
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,309
trend like just the the the momentum of
life

3060
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:48,319
life
 

3061
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,910
life
carries you into a particular direction

3062
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:49,920
carries you into a particular direction
 

3063
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,150
carries you into a particular direction
of wanting to focus and this kind of

3064
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
of wanting to focus and this kind of
 

3065
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,190
of wanting to focus and this kind of
dispersion that curiosity can lead to

3066
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
dispersion that curiosity can lead to
 

3067
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,230
dispersion that curiosity can lead to
gets harder and harder with time because

3068
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240

you're
you get really good at certain things

3072
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:00,800
you get really good at certain things
 

3073
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,150
you get really good at certain things
and it sucks

3074
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
and it sucks
 

3075
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,670
and it sucks

just kidding that was a trick question
 

3271
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,230
just kidding that was a trick question
because i don't have consciousness

3272
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
because i don't have consciousness
 

3273

so come a comma two when did that come

3310
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
so come a comma two when did that come
 

3311
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,390
so come a comma two when did that come
out that that was a year ago

3312

too feature-wise so i mean maybe you can

3328
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
too feature-wise so i mean maybe you can
 

3329
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,470
too feature-wise so i mean maybe you can
also link on like

3330
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
also link on like
 

3331
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,589
also link on like
what is it like what's its purpose

3332
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
what is it like what's its purpose
 

3333
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,870
what is it like what's its purpose
because there's a hardware there's a

3334
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:16,880
because there's a hardware there's a
 

3335

too that's
 

3377
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,630
too that's
um what else is there what am i thinking

3378
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
um what else is there what am i thinking
 

3379
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,950
um what else is there what am i thinking
so the hardware versus software so

3380
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
so the hardware versus software so
 

3381
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,750
so the hardware versus software so
open pilot versus the actual hardware of

00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
uh it has wi-fi radio it has an lte
 

3409
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,390
uh it has wi-fi radio it has an lte
radio it has a screen

3410
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
radio it has a screen
 

3411
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,910
radio it has a screen
uh we use every part of the cell phone

3412
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:35,920
uh we use every part of the cell phone
 

3413
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,510
uh we use every part of the cell phone
and then the interface of the car is

3414
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
and then the interface of the car is
 

3415
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,950
and then the interface of the car is
specific to the car so you keep

3416
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
specific to the car so you keep
 

3417
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,030
specific to the car so you keep
supporting more and more cars

3418
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
supporting more and more cars
 

3419
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,549
supporting more and more cars
um yeah so the interface to the car i

3420
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:42,559
um yeah so the interface to the car i
 

3421
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,470
um yeah so the interface to the car i
mean the device itself just has four can

3422
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
mean the device itself just has four can
 

3423
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,190
mean the device itself just has four can
buses

3424
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
buses
 

3425
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,870

has four cam interfaces on it that are

3426
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
has four cam interfaces on it that are
 

3427
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,069
has four cam interfaces on it that are
connected through the usb port to the

3428
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:48,079
connected through the usb port to the
 

3429
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,349
connected through the usb port to the
phone

3430
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
phone
 

3431
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,870
phone
um and then yeah on those four can buses

3432
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:52,880
um and then yeah on those four can buses
 

3433
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,710
um and then yeah on those four can buses
uh you connect it to the car and there's

3434
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
uh you connect it to the car and there's
 

3435
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,309
uh you connect it to the car and there's
a little harness to do this

3436
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:56,319
a little harness to do this
 

3437
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,309
a little harness to do this
cars are actually surprisingly similar

3438
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
cars are actually surprisingly similar
 

3439
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,390
cars are actually surprisingly similar
so can is the the protocol by which cars

3440
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,400
so can is the the protocol by which cars
 

3441
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,430
so can is the the protocol by which cars
communicate

3442
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
communicate
 

3443
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,430
communicate
and then you're able to read stuff and

3444
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
and then you're able to read stuff and
 

3445
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,270
and then you're able to read stuff and
write stuff to be able to control the

3446
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
write stuff to be able to control the
 

3447
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:05,589
write stuff to be able to control the
car

3448
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
car
 

3449
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,510
car
depending on the car so what's the

3450
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520
depending on the car so what's the
 

3451
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,829
depending on the car so what's the
software side what's open pilot

3452
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
software side what's open pilot
 

3453
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,069
software side what's open pilot
um so i mean open pilot is the hardware

3454
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
um so i mean open pilot is the hardware
 

3455
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,670
um so i mean open pilot is the hardware
is pretty simple compared to open pilot

3456
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
is pretty simple compared to open pilot
 

3457
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,589
is pretty simple compared to open pilot
open pilot is

3458
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:15,599
open pilot is
 

3459
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,030
open pilot is
uh well

3460
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
uh well
 

3461
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,950
uh well
so you have a machine learning model

3462
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:20,960
so you have a machine learning model
 

3463
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,950
so you have a machine learning model
which it's an open pilot it's a

uh you have to counter steer against
 

3507
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,789
uh you have to counter steer against
that and the neural network can't

so what um since we last spoke i don't

3532
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
so what um since we last spoke i don't
 

3533
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,549
so what um since we last spoke i don't
remember when maybe a year ago maybe a

00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
remember when maybe a year ago maybe a
 

3535
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,069
remember when maybe a year ago maybe a
little bit longer

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,710
how uh has open pilot improved we did
exactly what i promised you

3540
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
exactly what i promised you
 

3541
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,150
exactly what i promised you
i promised you that by the end of the

3542
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
i promised you that by the end of the
 

3543
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,910
i promised you that by the end of the
year you'd be able to remove the lanes

3544
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
year you'd be able to remove the lanes
 

3545
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,109
year you'd be able to remove the lanes
um the lateral policy is now

3546
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
um the lateral policy is now
 

3547
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,069
um the lateral policy is now
uh almost completely end to end you can

3548
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
uh almost completely end to end you can
 

3549
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,390
uh almost completely end to end you can
turn the lanes off and it will drive

3550
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
turn the lanes off and it will drive
 

3551
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,910
turn the lanes off and it will drive
drive slightly worse on the highway if

3552
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
drive slightly worse on the highway if
 

3553
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,750
drive slightly worse on the highway if
you turn the lanes off but you can turn

3554
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
you turn the lanes off but you can turn
 

3555
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,190
you turn the lanes off but you can turn
the lanes off and it will drive

3556
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200

um and this year we hope to do the same

3562
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
um and this year we hope to do the same
 

3563
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,230
um and this year we hope to do the same
for the longitudinal policy so that's

3564
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
for the longitudinal policy so that's
 

3565
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,190
for the longitudinal policy so that's
the interesting thing

3566
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
the interesting thing
 

3567
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,230
the interesting thing
is you're not doing you don't appear to

3568
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:04,240
is you're not doing you don't appear to
 

3569
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,829
is you're not doing you don't appear to
be you can correct me you don't appear

3570
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:05,839
be you can correct me you don't appear
 

3571
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,910
be you can correct me you don't appear
to be doing lean

3572
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:07,920
to be doing lean
 

3573
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,789
to be doing lean
detection or lane marking detection or

3574
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
detection or lane marking detection or
 

3575
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,109
detection or lane marking detection or
kind of the segmentation task or

3576
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
kind of the segmentation task or
 

3577
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,349
kind of the segmentation task or
any kind of object detection task you're

3578
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
any kind of object detection task you're
 

3579
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,230
any kind of object detection task you're
doing what's

3580
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,240
doing what's
 

3581
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,670
doing what's
traditionally more called like

3582
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:17,680
traditionally more called like
 

3583
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,349
traditionally more called like
end-to-end learning

3584
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
end-to-end learning
 

3585
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,030
end-to-end learning
so and trained on actual behavior of

3586
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
so and trained on actual behavior of
 

3587
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,990
so and trained on actual behavior of
drivers

3588
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
drivers
 

3589
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,589
drivers
when they're driving the car manually

3590
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
when they're driving the car manually
 

3591
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,230
when they're driving the car manually
and this is hard to do you know it's not

3592
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
and this is hard to do you know it's not
 

3593
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,069
and this is hard to do you know it's not
supervised learning

3594
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
supervised learning
 

3595
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,829
supervised learning
yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's

3596
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's
 

3597
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,990
yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's
a lot of data so it's hard and easy

3598
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
a lot of data so it's hard and easy
 

3599
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,789
a lot of data so it's hard and easy
right it's uh we have a lot of high

3600
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:38,799
right it's uh we have a lot of high
 

3601
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:39,910
right it's uh we have a lot of high
quality data yeah

3602
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
quality data yeah
 

3603
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,589
quality data yeah
like more than you need in the senate

3604
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
like more than you need in the senate
 

3605
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,589
like more than you need in the senate
well we way more than we do we have way

3606
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:43,599
well we way more than we do we have way
 

3607
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,789
well we way more than we do we have way
more data than we need

3608
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:44,799
more data than we need
 

3609
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,630
more data than we need
i mean it's it's an interesting question

3610
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:46,640
i mean it's it's an interesting question
 

3611
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,990
i mean it's it's an interesting question
actually because

3612
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
actually because
 

3613
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,589
actually because
in terms of amount you have more than

3614
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:49,599
in terms of amount you have more than
 

3615
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,430
in terms of amount you have more than
you need

3616
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
you need
 

3617
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,349
you need
but the you know driving is full of edge

3618
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
but the you know driving is full of edge
 

3619
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,030
but the you know driving is full of edge
cases so how do you

3620
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:55,040
cases so how do you
 

3621
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,150
cases so how do you
select the data you train on

3622
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,160
select the data you train on
 

3623
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,990
select the data you train on
i i think this is an interesting open

3624
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
i i think this is an interesting open
 

3625
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,589
i i think this is an interesting open
question like what's

3626
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
question like what's
 

3627
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,069
question like what's
what's the cleverest way to select data

3628
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
what's the cleverest way to select data
 

3629
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,670
what's the cleverest way to select data
that's the question tesla is probably

3630
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
that's the question tesla is probably
 

3631
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,270
that's the question tesla is probably
working on

3632
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,280
working on
 

3633
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,349
working on
uh that's i mean the entirety of machine

3634
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
uh that's i mean the entirety of machine
 

3635
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,470
uh that's i mean the entirety of machine
learning can be they don't seem to

3636
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:10,480
learning can be they don't seem to
 

3637
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,829
learning can be they don't seem to
really care they just kind of select

3638
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:11,839
really care they just kind of select
 

3639
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,670
really care they just kind of select
data but i feel like that

3640
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
data but i feel like that
 

3641
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,109
data but i feel like that
if you want to solve if you want to

3642
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
if you want to solve if you want to
 

3643
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,390
if you want to solve if you want to
create intelligent systems you have to

3644
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
create intelligent systems you have to
 

3645
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,309
create intelligent systems you have to
pick data well

3646
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319
pick data well
 

3647
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,030
pick data well
right and so would you have any hints

3648
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:21,040
right and so would you have any hints
 

3649
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,789
right and so would you have any hints
ideas of how to do it well

3650
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
ideas of how to do it well
 

3651
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,990
ideas of how to do it well
so in some ways that is the definition i

3652
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
so in some ways that is the definition i
 

3653
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,589
so in some ways that is the definition i
like of reinforcement learning versus

3654
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
like of reinforcement learning versus
 

3655
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,190
like of reinforcement learning versus
supervised learning

3656
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:29,200
supervised learning
 

3657
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,109
supervised learning
in supervised learning the weights

3658
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
in supervised learning the weights
 

3659
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,549
in supervised learning the weights
depend on the data

3660
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
depend on the data
 

3661
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,829
depend on the data
right um and this is obviously true but

3662
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
right um and this is obviously true but
 

3663
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:36,549
right um and this is obviously true but
the

3664
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
the
 

3665
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,630
the
uh in reinforcement learning the data

3666
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:38,640
uh in reinforcement learning the data
 

3667
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,390
uh in reinforcement learning the data
depends on the weights

3668
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:40,400
depends on the weights
 

3669
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,789
depends on the weights
yeah right and actually both ways that's

3670
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799
yeah right and actually both ways that's
 

3671
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,910
yeah right and actually both ways that's
that's poetry

3672
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
that's poetry
 

3673
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,510
that's poetry
so it's brilliant how does it know what

3674
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
so it's brilliant how does it know what
 

3675
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,349
so it's brilliant how does it know what
data to turn on well let it pick

3676
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
data to turn on well let it pick
 

3677
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,549
data to turn on well let it pick
we're not there yet but that's the

3678
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
we're not there yet but that's the
 

3679
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,549
we're not there yet but that's the
eventual so you're thinking this

3680
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559
eventual so you're thinking this
 

3681
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,150
eventual so you're thinking this
almost like a reinforcement learning

3682
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:52,160
almost like a reinforcement learning
 

3683
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,069
almost like a reinforcement learning
framework we're going to do rl on the

3684
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:54,079
framework we're going to do rl on the
 

3685
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,349
framework we're going to do rl on the
world

3686
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
world
 

3687
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,430
world
every time a car makes a mistake user

3688
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,440
every time a car makes a mistake user
 

3689
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,390
every time a car makes a mistake user
disengages we

3690
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
disengages we
 

3691
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,670
disengages we
train on that and do our all in the

3692
01:01:59,670 --> 01:01:59,680
train on that and do our all in the
 

3693
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,190
train on that and do our all in the
world ship out a new model that's an

3694
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
world ship out a new model that's an
 

3695
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,190
world ship out a new model that's an
epoch right

3696
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
epoch right
 

3697
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,390
epoch right
and uh for now you're not

3698
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
and uh for now you're not
 

3699
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,710
and uh for now you're not
doing the elon style promising that it's

3700
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
doing the elon style promising that it's
 

3701
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,150
doing the elon style promising that it's
going to be fully autonomous you really

3702
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,160
going to be fully autonomous you really
 

3703
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,390
going to be fully autonomous you really
are sticking to level two

3704
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:12,400
are sticking to level two
 

3705
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,870
are sticking to level two
and like it's supposed to be supervised

3706
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
and like it's supposed to be supervised
 

3707
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,390
and like it's supposed to be supervised
oh it is definitely supposed to be

3708
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:16,400
oh it is definitely supposed to be
 

3709
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,589
oh it is definitely supposed to be
supervising reinforced the fact that

3710
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
supervising reinforced the fact that
 

3711
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,549
supervising reinforced the fact that
it's supervised

3712
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:18,559
it's supervised
 

3713
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,150
it's supervised
um we look at our rate of improvement

3714
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,160
um we look at our rate of improvement
 

3715
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,549
um we look at our rate of improvement
in disengagements um open pilot now has

3716
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
in disengagements um open pilot now has
 

3717
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,230
in disengagements um open pilot now has
an unplanned engagement about every 100

3718
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
an unplanned engagement about every 100
 

3719
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,270
an unplanned engagement about every 100
miles

3720
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
miles
 

3721
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,470
miles
this is up from 10 miles like

3722
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
this is up from 10 miles like
 

3723
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,349
this is up from 10 miles like
maybe maybe uh

3724
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,359
maybe maybe uh
 

3725
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,190
maybe maybe uh
maybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've

3726
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
maybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've
 

3727
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,029
maybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've
seen 10x improvement in a year but

3728
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
seen 10x improvement in a year but
 

3729
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,750
seen 10x improvement in a year but
a hundred miles is still a far cry from

3730
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760
a hundred miles is still a far cry from
 

3731
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,950
a hundred miles is still a far cry from
the hundred thousand you're going to

3732
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:42,960
the hundred thousand you're going to
 

3733
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,750
the hundred thousand you're going to
need

3734
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
need
 

3735
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,670
need
so you're going to somehow need to get

3736
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
so you're going to somehow need to get
 

3737
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,870
so you're going to somehow need to get
um

3738
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:46,880
um
 

3739
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,390
um
three more 10xs in there and your

3740
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
three more 10xs in there and your
 

3741
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,470
three more 10xs in there and your
what's your intuition uh you're

3742
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:52,480
what's your intuition uh you're
 

3743
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,910
what's your intuition uh you're
basically hoping that there's

3744
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
basically hoping that there's
 

3745
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,510
basically hoping that there's
exponential improvement built into the

3746
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
exponential improvement built into the
 

3747
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,870
exponential improvement built into the
baked into the cake somewhere well

3748
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
baked into the cake somewhere well
 

3749
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,309
baked into the cake somewhere well
that's even like i mean 10x improvement

3750
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
that's even like i mean 10x improvement
 

3751
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,990
that's even like i mean 10x improvement
that's already assuming exponential

3752
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
that's already assuming exponential
 

3753
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,750
that's already assuming exponential
right there's definitely exponential

3754
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
right there's definitely exponential
 

3755
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,670
right there's definitely exponential
improvement and i think when elon talks

3756
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
improvement and i think when elon talks
 

3757
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,710
improvement and i think when elon talks
about exponential like

3758
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
about exponential like
 

3759
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,309
about exponential like
these things these systems are going to

3760
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
these things these systems are going to
 

3761
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,750
these things these systems are going to
exponentially improve

3762
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
exponentially improve
 

3763
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,829
exponentially improve
just exponential doesn't mean you're

3764
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
just exponential doesn't mean you're
 

3765
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,510
just exponential doesn't mean you're
getting 100 gigahertz processors

3766
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
getting 100 gigahertz processors
 

3767
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,470
getting 100 gigahertz processors
tomorrow

3768
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
tomorrow
 

3769
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,549
tomorrow
right like it's going to still take a

3770
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
right like it's going to still take a
 

3771
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,069
right like it's going to still take a
while because the gap

3772
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
while because the gap
 

3773
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,710
while because the gap
between even our best system and humans

3774
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
between even our best system and humans
 

3775
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,069
between even our best system and humans
is still large

3776
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:20,079
is still large
 

3777
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,829
is still large
so that's an interesting distinction to

3778
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
so that's an interesting distinction to
 

3779
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,829
so that's an interesting distinction to
draw so if you look at the way tesla's

3780
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
draw so if you look at the way tesla's
 

3781
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,990
draw so if you look at the way tesla's
approaching the problem

3782
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,000
approaching the problem
 

3783
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,109
approaching the problem
and the way you're approaching the

3784
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
and the way you're approaching the
 

3785
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,670
and the way you're approaching the
problem which is very different than the

3786
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
problem which is very different than the
 

3787
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,630
problem which is very different than the
rest of the

3788
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
rest of the
 

3789
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,270
rest of the
self-driving car world so let's put them

3790
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
self-driving car world so let's put them
 

3791
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:33,750
self-driving car world so let's put them
aside

3792
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
aside
 

3793
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,990
aside
is you're treating most the driving task

3794
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
is you're treating most the driving task
 

3795
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,430
is you're treating most the driving task
is a machine learning problem

3796
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
is a machine learning problem
 

3797
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,190
is a machine learning problem
and the way tesla is approaching it is

3798
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
and the way tesla is approaching it is
 

3799
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,870
and the way tesla is approaching it is
with the multi-task learning

3800
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
with the multi-task learning
 

3801
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,589
with the multi-task learning
where you break the task of driving into

3802
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:43,599
where you break the task of driving into
 

3803
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,270
where you break the task of driving into
hundreds of different desks

3804
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,280
hundreds of different desks
 

3805
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,349
hundreds of different desks
and you have this multi-headed neural

3806
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
and you have this multi-headed neural
 

3807
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,750
and you have this multi-headed neural
network that's very good at

3808
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
network that's very good at
 

3809
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,309
network that's very good at
performing each task and there there's

3810
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
performing each task and there there's
 

3811
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,630
performing each task and there there's
presumably something on top that's

3812
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:54,640
presumably something on top that's
 

3813
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,990
presumably something on top that's
stitching stuff together in order to uh

3814
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
stitching stuff together in order to uh
 

3815
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,069
stitching stuff together in order to uh
make controlled decisions policy

3816
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
make controlled decisions policy
 

3817
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,069
make controlled decisions policy
decisions about how you move the car

3818
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
decisions about how you move the car
 

3819
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,430
decisions about how you move the car
but what that allows you there's a

3820
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
but what that allows you there's a
 

3821
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,349
but what that allows you there's a
brilliance to this because it allows you

3822
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
brilliance to this because it allows you
 

3823
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:05,670
brilliance to this because it allows you

01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:05,680
to
 

3825
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,789
to
um master each task like

01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:08,799
um master each task like
 

3827
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,349
um master each task like

like everything is basically a machine

3848
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
like everything is basically a machine
 

3849
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,710
like everything is basically a machine
learning task well there's a

01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,200
it's nice because you can have this
 

3857
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,750
it's nice because you can have this
entire engine data engine that's mining

for each one of these tasks and you can
 

3863
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,670
for each one of these tasks and you can
have people like engineers that are

3864
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:51,680
have people like engineers that are
 

3865
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,589
have people like engineers that are
basically masters of that task

3866
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
basically masters of that task
 

3867
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,029
basically masters of that task
like becoming the best person in the

01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:55,039
like becoming the best person in the
 

3869
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,510
like becoming the best person in the

3881
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,910

at cone detection i i so that's a

3882
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
at cone detection i i so that's a
 

3883
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,670
at cone detection i i so that's a

3893
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,109
network for each of the individual
perception tasks and then you're looking

3894
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
perception tasks and then you're looking
 

3895
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:21,990
perception tasks and then you're looking
at the machine learning

3896
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
at the machine learning
 

3897
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,670
at the machine learning
in a more holistic way basically doing

3898
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:25,680
in a more holistic way basically doing
 

3899
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,870
in a more holistic way basically doing
end-to-end learning

3900
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
end-to-end learning

01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
on the driving task supervised trained
 

3903
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,789
on the driving task supervised trained
on the data of the actual

01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
on the data of the actual
 

3905
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,230
on the data of the actual
driving of people that use comma ai

3906
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240
driving of people that use comma ai
 

3907
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,910
driving of people that use comma ai
like actual human drivers do manual

3908
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920

01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:43,599
moments of disengagement that uh
 

3913
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,990
moments of disengagement that uh
maybe with some labeling could indicate

3914
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
maybe with some labeling could indicate
 

3915
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,510
maybe with some labeling could indicate
the failure of the system so you have

3916
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
the failure of the system so you have
 

3917
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,710
the failure of the system so you have
the

3918

the
 

3919
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,789
the
you have a huge amount of data for

3920
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
you have a huge amount of data for
 

3921
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:51,750
you have a huge amount of data for
positive

3922
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760

3927
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,789

both maintaining the lane as as i think

3928
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
both maintaining the lane as as i think
 

3929
01:05:58,799 --> 01:05:59,910
both maintaining the lane as as i think
you're also working on

3930
01:05:59,910 --> 01:05:59,920
you're also working on
 

3931
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,990
you're also working on
longitudinal control of the vehicle and

3932
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
longitudinal control of the vehicle and
 

3933
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,390
longitudinal control of the vehicle and
then failure cases where the vehicle

3934
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
then failure cases where the vehicle
 

3935
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,029
then failure cases where the vehicle
does something

3936
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
does something
 

3937
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,309
does something
wrong that needs disengagement

3938
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319
wrong that needs disengagement
 

3939
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,870
wrong that needs disengagement
so like what why do you think you're

3940
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:10,880
so like what why do you think you're
 

3941
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,029
so like what why do you think you're
right and tesla is wrong

3942
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:13,039
right and tesla is wrong
 

3943
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,910
right and tesla is wrong
on this and do you think do you think

3944
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
on this and do you think do you think
 

3945
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,589
on this and do you think do you think
you'll come around the tesla way do you

3946
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:17,599
you'll come around the tesla way do you
 

3947
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,029
you'll come around the tesla way do you
think tesla will come around

3948
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
think tesla will come around
 

3949
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,549
think tesla will come around
to your way if you were to start a chess

3950
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
to your way if you were to start a chess
 

3951
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,750
to your way if you were to start a chess
engine company

3952
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
engine company
 

3953
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,190
engine company
would you hire a bishop guy see we have

3954
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
would you hire a bishop guy see we have
 

3955
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,789
would you hire a bishop guy see we have
uh this is monday morning quarterbacking

3956
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:30,799
uh this is monday morning quarterbacking
 

3957
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,600
uh this is monday morning quarterbacking
as uh yes probably

3958
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:33,610
as uh yes probably
 

3959
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,829
as uh yes probably
[Laughter]

3960
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
[Laughter]
 

3961
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,069
[Laughter]
so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the

3962
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the
 

3963
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,510
so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the
rook guy from that company oh we're

3964
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,520
rook guy from that company oh we're
 

3965
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,230
rook guy from that company oh we're
gonna have real good

3966
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
gonna have real good
 

3967
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,829
gonna have real good
rooks well there's not many pieces right

3968
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
rooks well there's not many pieces right
 

3969
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,109
rooks well there's not many pieces right
you can uh yeah there's not many

3970
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:47,119
you can uh yeah there's not many
 

3971
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,670
you can uh yeah there's not many
guys and gals to hire you just have a

3972
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
guys and gals to hire you just have a
 

3973
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,510
guys and gals to hire you just have a
few that work on the bishop a few that

3974
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:51,520
few that work on the bishop a few that
 

3975
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,549
few that work on the bishop a few that
work in the rook

3976
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
work in the rook
 

3977
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,710
work in the rook
but is that not ludicrous today to think

3978
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
but is that not ludicrous today to think
 

3979
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,349
but is that not ludicrous today to think
about in in the world of alpha zero

3980
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
about in in the world of alpha zero
 

3981
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,510
about in in the world of alpha zero
but alpha zero is jessica so the the

3982
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
but alpha zero is jessica so the the
 

3983
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,710
but alpha zero is jessica so the the
fundamental question

3984
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
fundamental question
 

3985
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,230
fundamental question
is how hard is driving compared to chess

3986
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
is how hard is driving compared to chess
 

3987
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,870
is how hard is driving compared to chess
because so long term end to end

3988
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
because so long term end to end
 

3989
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,029
because so long term end to end
will be the right solution the question

3990
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
will be the right solution the question
 

3991
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,270
will be the right solution the question
is how many years away is that

3992
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,280
is how many years away is that
 

3993
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,470
is how many years away is that
end-to-end is going to be the only

3994
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
end-to-end is going to be the only
 

3995
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,630
end-to-end is going to be the only
solution for level five for the only way

3996
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
solution for level five for the only way
 

3997
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,029
solution for level five for the only way
we can

3998
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
we can
 

3999
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,549
we can
of course and of course tesla's gonna

4000
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
of course and of course tesla's gonna
 

4001
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,069
of course and of course tesla's gonna
come around to my way and if you're a

4002
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
come around to my way and if you're a
 

4003
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,870
come around to my way and if you're a
rook guy out there i'm sorry

4004
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:22,880
rook guy out there i'm sorry
 

4005
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,670
rook guy out there i'm sorry
the cone guy i don't know we're gonna

4006
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
the cone guy i don't know we're gonna
 

4007
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,510
the cone guy i don't know we're gonna
specialize each task we're gonna really

4008
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
specialize each task we're gonna really
 

4009
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,069
specialize each task we're gonna really
understand

4010
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:28,079
understand
 

4011
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,109
understand
rook placement yeah i understand the

4012
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
rook placement yeah i understand the
 

4013
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:31,990
rook placement yeah i understand the
intuition you have

4014
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
intuition you have
 

4015
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,029
intuition you have
i mean that

4016
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:35,039

 

4017
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,789

that uh is very compelling notion that

4018
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
that uh is very compelling notion that
 

4019
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,029
that uh is very compelling notion that
we can learn the task and to end

4020
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:39,039
we can learn the task and to end
 

4021
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,390
we can learn the task and to end
like the same compelling notion you

4022
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
like the same compelling notion you
 

4023
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,430
like the same compelling notion you
might have for natural language

4024
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
might have for natural language
 

4025
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,549
might have for natural language
conversation

4026
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
conversation
 

4027
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,870
conversation
i'm not sure

4028
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
i'm not sure
 

4029
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,789
i'm not sure
because one thing you sneaked in there

4030
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:48,799
because one thing you sneaked in there
 

4031
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,630
because one thing you sneaked in there
is the assertion that

4032
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:50,640
is the assertion that
 

4033
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,109
is the assertion that
it's impossible to get to level five

4034
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
it's impossible to get to level five
 

4035
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,270
it's impossible to get to level five
without this kind of approach

4036
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
without this kind of approach
 

4037
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,190
without this kind of approach
i don't know if that's obvious i don't

4038
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
i don't know if that's obvious i don't
 

4039
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,670
i don't know if that's obvious i don't
know if that's obvious either i don't

4040
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
know if that's obvious either i don't
 

4041
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,990
know if that's obvious either i don't
actually uh mean that i think that it is

4042
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
actually uh mean that i think that it is
 

4043
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,430
actually uh mean that i think that it is
much easier

4044
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:03,440
much easier
 

4045
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,950
much easier
to get to level five with an end-to-end

4046
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:04,960
to get to level five with an end-to-end
 

4047
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,789
to get to level five with an end-to-end
approach i think that the other approach

4048
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
approach i think that the other approach
 

4049
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:07,750
approach i think that the other approach
is

4050
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:07,760
is
 

4051
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,309
is
doable but the magnitude of the

4052
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:10,319
doable but the magnitude of the
 

4053
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,910
doable but the magnitude of the
engineering challenge may exceed what

4054
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
engineering challenge may exceed what
 

4055
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,589
engineering challenge may exceed what
humanity is capable of

4056
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
humanity is capable of
 

4057
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,030
humanity is capable of
so but what do you think of the tesla

4058
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,040
so but what do you think of the tesla
 

4059
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,990
so but what do you think of the tesla
data engine approach which to me is an

4060
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,000
data engine approach which to me is an
 

4061
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,669
data engine approach which to me is an
active learning task is kind of

4062
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
active learning task is kind of
 

4063
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,189
active learning task is kind of
fascinating

4064
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:23,199
fascinating
 

4065
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,950
fascinating
is breaking it down into these multiple

4066
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
is breaking it down into these multiple
 

4067
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,309
is breaking it down into these multiple
tasks and

4068
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
tasks and
 

4069
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,470
tasks and
mining their data constantly for like

4073
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,189

01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
for these different tasks but the tasks
 

4075
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,550
for these different tasks but the tasks
themselves are not being learned this is

01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560
themselves are not being learned this is
 

4077
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,590

feature engineering

4078
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600

 

4079
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,950

yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher

4080
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:38,960
yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher
 

4081
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,590
yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher
abstraction level of feature engineering

4082
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:41,600
abstraction level of feature engineering
 

4083
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,110

for the different tasks

4084
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
for the different tasks
 

4085
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,110
for the different tasks
it's task engineering in a sense it's

4086
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
it's task engineering in a sense it's
 

4087
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,950
it's task engineering in a sense it's
slightly better feature engineering but

4088
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
slightly better feature engineering but
 

4089
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,470
slightly better feature engineering but
it still fundamentally is feature

4090
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
it still fundamentally is feature
 

4091
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,269
it still fundamentally is feature

and anything about the history of ai has
 

4095
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,630
and anything about the history of ai has
taught us anything

4096
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
taught us anything
 

4097
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,630
taught us anything
it's that feature engineering approaches

4098
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:54,640
it's that feature engineering approaches
 

4099
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,870
it's that feature engineering approaches
will always be replaced and lose

4100
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:56,880
will always be replaced and lose
 

4101
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,749
will always be replaced and lose
to end to end now to be fair i cannot

really make promises on timelines

4104
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,080
really make promises on timelines
 

4105
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,789
really make promises on timelines
but i can say that when you look at the

4106
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
but i can say that when you look at the
 

4107
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,229
but i can say that when you look at the
code for stockfish and the code for

4108
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
code for stockfish and the code for
 

4109
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:06,950
code for stockfish and the code for
alpha zero

4110
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
alpha zero
 

4111
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,189
alpha zero
one is a lot shorter than the other a

4112
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
one is a lot shorter than the other a
 

4113
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:10,709
one is a lot shorter than the other a
lot more elegant required a lot less

4114
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:10,719
lot more elegant required a lot less
 

4115
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,709

4117
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,950

yeah but there was a lot more murder

4118
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
yeah but there was a lot more murder
 

4119
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,390
yeah but there was a lot more murder
of bad uh

4120
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
of bad uh
 

4121
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,870

agents on the uh alpha zero side

4122
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
agents on the uh alpha zero side
 

4123
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,950
agents on the uh alpha zero side
by murder i mean uh agents that played a

4124
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:28,960
by murder i mean uh agents that played a
 

4125
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,550
by murder i mean uh agents that played a
game and failed miserably

4126
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
game and failed miserably
 

4127
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,990
game and failed miserably
yeah oh in simulation that failure is

4128
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
yeah oh in simulation that failure is
 

4129
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,030
yeah oh in simulation that failure is
less costly yeah in in real world it's

4130
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:37,040
less costly yeah in in real world it's
 

4131
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,789
less costly yeah in in real world it's
wait do you mean in practice like alpha

4132
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
wait do you mean in practice like alpha
 

4133
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,789
wait do you mean in practice like alpha
zero has lost games miserably

4134
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
zero has lost games miserably
 

4135
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,669
zero has lost games miserably
no well i haven't seen that no but i

4136
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
no well i haven't seen that no but i
 

4137
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,950
no well i haven't seen that no but i
know but the the

4138
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
know but the the
 

4139
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,349
know but the the
the the requirement for alpha zero is a

4140
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:47,359
the the requirement for alpha zero is a
 

4141
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:47,990
the the requirement for alpha zero is a

4155
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,350

on the path to us humans yeah so the

4156
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
on the path to us humans yeah so the
 

4157
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,229
on the path to us humans yeah so the
question is can

4158
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
question is can
 

4159
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,470
question is can
can we uh stitch together a human-like

4160
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,480
can we uh stitch together a human-like
 

4161
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,149
can we uh stitch together a human-like
object without having to go through the

4162
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
object without having to go through the

4165
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,030
entirety process of evolution
well no but do the evolution in

4166
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,040
well no but do the evolution in
 

4167
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,870
well no but do the evolution in
simulation yeah that's the question can

4168
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880
simulation yeah that's the question can
 

4169
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,390
simulation yeah that's the question can
we simulate so do you have a sense

4170
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
we simulate so do you have a sense
 

4171
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,149
we simulate so do you have a sense
that's possible to simulate some

4172
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:16,159
that's possible to simulate some
 

4173
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,350
that's possible to simulate some
mu zero is exactly this mu zero is

4174
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
mu zero is exactly this mu zero is
 

4175
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,310
mu zero is exactly this mu zero is
is the solution to this mu zero i think

4176
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:22,320
is the solution to this mu zero i think
 

4177
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,830
is the solution to this mu zero i think
is going to look be looked back

4178
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840
is going to look be looked back
 

4179
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,590
is going to look be looked back
as the canonical paper and i don't think

4180
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
as the canonical paper and i don't think
 

4181
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,350
as the canonical paper and i don't think
deep learning is everything i think that

4182
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
deep learning is everything i think that
 

4183
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,630
deep learning is everything i think that
there's still a bunch of things missing

4184
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
there's still a bunch of things missing
 

4185
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,270
there's still a bunch of things missing
to get there

01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
to get there
 

4187
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,790
to get there
but mu zero i think is going to be

4188
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
but mu zero i think is going to be
 

4189
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,870
but mu zero i think is going to be

01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,270
now on that little transition i mean
how do you make the transition work is

how do you make the transition work is
 

4303
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,510
how do you make the transition work is
uh is this where driver sensing

uh is this where driver sensing
 

4305
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,070
uh is this where driver sensing
comes in like how do you make the

4306
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
comes in like how do you make the
 

4307
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,709
comes in like how do you make the
because you said

none of that is hand coded
 

4373
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,110
none of that is hand coded
actually the stop is hand coded but so

4374
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,120
actually the stop is hand coded but so
 

4375
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,030
actually the stop is hand coded but so
there's some kind of machine learning

4376
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,040
there's some kind of machine learning
 

4377
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,470
there's some kind of machine learning
estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've

4378
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:44,480
estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've
 

4379
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,229
estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've
always been a huge fan of that that

4380
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
always been a huge fan of that that
 

4381
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,630
always been a huge fan of that that
that's uh because it's difficult to do

4382
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
that's uh because it's difficult to do
 

4383
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,669
that's uh because it's difficult to do
every step into that direction

4384
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:53,679
every step into that direction
 

4385
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,430
every step into that direction
is a worthwhile step to take it might be

4386
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
is a worthwhile step to take it might be
 

4387
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,870
is a worthwhile step to take it might be
difficult to do really well like us

4388
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
difficult to do really well like us
 

4389
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,830
difficult to do really well like us
humans are able to

4390
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
humans are able to
 

4391
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,229
humans are able to
estimate risk pretty damn well whatever

4392
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
estimate risk pretty damn well whatever
 

4393
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,430
estimate risk pretty damn well whatever
the hell that is

4394
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,440
the hell that is
 

4395
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,310
the hell that is
that feels like one of the nice features

4396
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
that feels like one of the nice features
 

4397
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,669
that feels like one of the nice features
of us humans

4398
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:05,679
of us humans
 

4399
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,229
of us humans
uh because like we humans are really

4400
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
uh because like we humans are really
 

4401
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,229
uh because like we humans are really
good drivers when we're really like

4402
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:10,239
good drivers when we're really like
 

4403
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,550
good drivers when we're really like
tuned in and we're good at estimating

4404
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
tuned in and we're good at estimating
 

4405
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,149
tuned in and we're good at estimating
risk like when are we supposed to be

4406
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
risk like when are we supposed to be
 

4407
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:14,790
risk like when are we supposed to be
tuned in

4408
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
tuned in
 

4409
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,669
tuned in
yeah and you know people are like oh

4410
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:17,679
yeah and you know people are like oh
 

4411
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:18,870
yeah and you know people are like oh
well you know why would you ever make

4412
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
well you know why would you ever make
 

4413
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,390
well you know why would you ever make
the driver monitoring policy

4414
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
the driver monitoring policy
 

4415
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,070
the driver monitoring policy
less aggressive why would you always not

4416
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,080
less aggressive why would you always not
 

4417
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,830
less aggressive why would you always not
keep it at its most aggressive

4418
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
keep it at its most aggressive
 

4419
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,950
keep it at its most aggressive
because then people are just going to

4420
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
because then people are just going to
 

4421
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,790
because then people are just going to
get fatigued from it yes when they get

4422
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
get fatigued from it yes when they get
 

4423
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,270
get fatigued from it yes when they get
annoyed

4424
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
annoyed
 

4425
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,870
annoyed
you want them yeah you they want you

4426
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
you want them yeah you they want you
 

4427
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,870
you want them yeah you they want you
want the experience to be pleasant

4428
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,880
want the experience to be pleasant
 

4429
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,149
want the experience to be pleasant
obviously i want the experience to be

4430
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
obviously i want the experience to be
 

4431
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,229
obviously i want the experience to be
pleasant but even just from a straight

4432
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:34,239
pleasant but even just from a straight
 

4433
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,910
pleasant but even just from a straight
up safety perspective

4434
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:35,920
up safety perspective
 

4435
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,229

if you alert people when they look

4436
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
if you alert people when they look
 

4437
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,669
if you alert people when they look
around and they're like

4438

around and they're like
 

4439
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,110
around and they're like
why is this thing alerting me there's

4440
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,120
why is this thing alerting me there's
 

4441
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,870
why is this thing alerting me there's
nothing i could possibly hit right now

4442
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
nothing i could possibly hit right now
 

4443
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,110
nothing i could possibly hit right now
people will just learn to tune it out

4444
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
people will just learn to tune it out
 

4445
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,870
people will just learn to tune it out
people will just learn to tune it out to

4446
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,880
people will just learn to tune it out to
 

4447
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,229
people will just learn to tune it out to
put weights on the steering wheel to do

4448
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
put weights on the steering wheel to do
 

4449
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,750
put weights on the steering wheel to do
whatever to overcome it

4450
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
whatever to overcome it
 

4451
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,470
whatever to overcome it
and remember that you're always part of

4452
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,480
and remember that you're always part of
 

4453
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,910
and remember that you're always part of
this adaptive system so

4454
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:53,920
this adaptive system so
 

4455
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,669
this adaptive system so
all i can really say about you know how

4456
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
all i can really say about you know how
 

4457
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,110
all i can really say about you know how
this scale is going forward is yeah

4458
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
this scale is going forward is yeah
 

4459
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,510
this scale is going forward is yeah
something we have to monitor for

4460
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
something we have to monitor for
 

4461
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,189
something we have to monitor for
we don't know this is a great psychology

4462
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:01,199
we don't know this is a great psychology
 

4463
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,030
we don't know this is a great psychology
experiment at scale like we'll see

4464
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,040
experiment at scale like we'll see
 

4465
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,870
experiment at scale like we'll see
yeah it's fascinating track it and

4466
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:04,880
yeah it's fascinating track it and
 

4467
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,550
yeah it's fascinating track it and
making sure you have a good

4468
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560
making sure you have a good
 

4469
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,750
making sure you have a good
understanding of attention is a very key

4470
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
understanding of attention is a very key
 

4471
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,270
understanding of attention is a very key
part of that psychology problem

4472
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280
part of that psychology problem
 

4473
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,030
part of that psychology problem
yeah i think i mean you and i probably

4474
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,040
yeah i think i mean you and i probably
 

4475
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,030
yeah i think i mean you and i probably
have a different come to it differently

4476
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,040
have a different come to it differently
 

4477
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,550
have a different come to it differently
but to me

4478
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
but to me
 

4479
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,790
but to me
it's an it's a fascinating psychology

4480
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
it's an it's a fascinating psychology
 

4481
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,950
it's an it's a fascinating psychology
problem to explore something much deeper

4482
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
problem to explore something much deeper
 

4483
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,990
problem to explore something much deeper
than just driving

4484
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,000
than just driving
 

4485
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,550
than just driving
it's a it's such a nice way to explore

4486
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:24,560
it's a it's such a nice way to explore
 

4487

he wasn't so much interested in that

problem
 

4513
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,790
problem
it's like in order to solve driving the

4514
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
it's like in order to solve driving the
 

4515
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,390
it's like in order to solve driving the
whole point is you want to remove the

4516
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
whole point is you want to remove the
 

4517
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,189
whole point is you want to remove the
human from the picture

4518
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
human from the picture
 

4519
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,430
human from the picture
and it seems like you can't do that

4520
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
and it seems like you can't do that
 

4521
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,590
and it seems like you can't do that
quite yet eventually yes but

4522
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
quite yet eventually yes but
 

4523
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,030
quite yet eventually yes but
you can't quite do that yet so

4524
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040
you can't quite do that yet so
 

4525
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,350
you can't quite do that yet so
this is the moment where and you can't

4526
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
this is the moment where and you can't
 

4527
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,229
this is the moment where and you can't
yet say

4528
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
yet say
 

4529
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,310
yet say
i told you so uh to tesla

4530
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
i told you so uh to tesla
 

4531
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,149
i told you so uh to tesla

to do
 

4539
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,750
to do
drive them off yeah they ship the model

4540
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
drive them off yeah they ship the model
 

4541
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,910
drive them off yeah they ship the model
in shadow mode

4542
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:25,920
in shadow mode
 

4543
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,390
in shadow mode
uh without uh i believe only a visible

4544
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
uh without uh i believe only a visible
 

4545
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,950
uh without uh i believe only a visible
light camera it might even be fisheye

4546
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
light camera it might even be fisheye
 

4547
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,270
light camera it might even be fisheye
uh it's like a low resolution low

4548
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
uh it's like a low resolution low
 

4549
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,709
uh it's like a low resolution low
resolution visible light

4550
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:34,719
resolution visible light
 

4551
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,310
resolution visible light
i mean to be fair that's what we have in

4552
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
i mean to be fair that's what we have in
 

4553
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,070
i mean to be fair that's what we have in
the eon as well our last generation

4554
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,080

this is the one area where i can say our

4558
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,040
this is the one area where i can say our
 

4559
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,470
this is the one area where i can say our
hardware's ahead of tesla the rest of

4560
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
hardware's ahead of tesla the rest of
 

4561
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,990
hardware's ahead of tesla the rest of
our hardware way way behind but our

4562
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
our hardware way way behind but our
 

4563
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,830
our hardware way way behind but our
driver monitoring camera

4564
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
driver monitoring camera
 

4565
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,870
driver monitoring camera
do you think uh i think on the

4566
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:48,880
do you think uh i think on the
 

4567
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,270
do you think uh i think on the
third row tesla podcast or somewhere

4568
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
third row tesla podcast or somewhere
 

4569
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,750
third row tesla podcast or somewhere
else i've heard you say that

4570
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
else i've heard you say that
 

4571
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,350
else i've heard you say that
obviously eventually they're gonna have

4572
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
obviously eventually they're gonna have
 

4573
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,110
obviously eventually they're gonna have
driver monitoring

4574
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
driver monitoring
 

4575
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,790
driver monitoring
i think what i've said is elon will

4576
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
i think what i've said is elon will
 

4577
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,550
i think what i've said is elon will
definitely ship driver monitoring before

4578
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
definitely ship driver monitoring before
 

4579
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,390
definitely ship driver monitoring before
he ships level five the beautiful level

4580
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
he ships level five the beautiful level
 

4581
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,669
he ships level five the beautiful level
and i'm willing to about 10 grand on

before maybe someone would have i should
 

4589
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:10,390
before maybe someone would have i should
have got my money

have got my money
yeah that's an interesting bet i think i

4592
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
yeah that's an interesting bet i think i
 

4593
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,110
yeah that's an interesting bet i think i
i think you're right i'm actually

4594
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,120
i think you're right i'm actually
 

4595
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,590
i think you're right i'm actually
on a human level because he's been

4596
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
on a human level because he's been
 

4597
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,030
on a human level because he's been
he's made the decision like he said that

4598
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
he's made the decision like he said that
 

4599
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,510
he's made the decision like he said that
driver monitoring is the wrong way to go

4600
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
driver monitoring is the wrong way to go
 

4601
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,990
driver monitoring is the wrong way to go
but like you have to think of as a human

4602
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,000
but like you have to think of as a human
 

4603
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,110
but like you have to think of as a human
as a ceo

4604
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
as a ceo
 

4605
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,149
as a ceo
i think that's the right thing to say

4606
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159
i think that's the right thing to say
 

4607
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:37,830
i think that's the right thing to say
when like

4608
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
when like
 

4609
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,510
when like
sometimes you have to say things

4610
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:39,520
sometimes you have to say things
 

4611
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,870
sometimes you have to say things
publicly they're different than when you

4612
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
publicly they're different than when you
 

4613
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,669
publicly they're different than when you
actually believe

4614
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:41,679
actually believe
 

4615
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,750
actually believe
because when you're producing a large

4616
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
because when you're producing a large
 

4617
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,350
because when you're producing a large
number of vehicles

4618
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
number of vehicles
 

4619
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,030
number of vehicles
and the decision was made not to include

4620
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,040
and the decision was made not to include
 

4621
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,630
and the decision was made not to include
the camera like what are you supposed to

4622
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:48,640
the camera like what are you supposed to
 

4623
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:48,950

say
 

4625
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,590
say
yeah like our cars don't have the thing

4626
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:51,600
yeah like our cars don't have the thing
 

4627
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,430
yeah like our cars don't have the thing
that i think is right to have

4628
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
that i think is right to have
 

4629
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,550
that i think is right to have
uh it's an interesting thing but like on

yeah i do i think he'll come up with a

4652
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
yeah i do i think he'll come up with a
 

4653
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,870
yeah i do i think he'll come up with a
good way to

4654
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
good way to
 

4655
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,270
good way to
make it psychologically okay for him

4656
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
make it psychologically okay for him
 

4657
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:27,910
make it psychologically okay for him
well

4658
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:27,920
well
 

4659
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,590
well
it's such an important thing man

4660
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
it's such an important thing man
 

4661
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,950
it's such an important thing man
especially for a first principles

4662
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
especially for a first principles
 

4663
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,270
especially for a first principles
thinker because he made a decision

4664
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
thinker because he made a decision
 

4665
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,030
thinker because he made a decision
that uh driver monitoring is not the

4666
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
that uh driver monitoring is not the
 

4667
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,470
that uh driver monitoring is not the
right way to go and i could see that

4668
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
right way to go and i could see that
 

4669
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,510
right way to go and i could see that
decision

4670
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:37,520
decision
 

4671
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,110
decision
and i i could even make that decision

4672
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
and i i could even make that decision
 

4673
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,270
and i i could even make that decision
like i was on the fence

4674
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
like i was on the fence
 

4675
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:45,030
like i was on the fence
too like i'm not driving monitoring

4676
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
too like i'm not driving monitoring
 

4677
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,149
too like i'm not driving monitoring
is such an obvious simple solution to

4678
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:48,159
is such an obvious simple solution to
 

4679
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,910
is such an obvious simple solution to
the problem of attention

4680
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
the problem of attention
 

4681
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,669
the problem of attention
it's not obvious to me that just by

4682
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
it's not obvious to me that just by
 

4683
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,590
it's not obvious to me that just by
putting a camera there you solve

4684
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,600
putting a camera there you solve
 

4685
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,709
putting a camera there you solve
things you have to create an

4686
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
things you have to create an
 

4687
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,110
things you have to create an
incredible compelling experience just

4688
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
incredible compelling experience just
 

4689
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,709
incredible compelling experience just
like you're you're talking about

4690
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
like you're you're talking about
 

4691
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,270
like you're you're talking about
and i don't know if it's easy to do that

4692
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
and i don't know if it's easy to do that
 

4693
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,030
and i don't know if it's easy to do that
it's not at all easy to do that in fact

4694
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,040
it's not at all easy to do that in fact
 

4695
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,910
it's not at all easy to do that in fact
i think

4696
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:05,920
i think
 

4697
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,270
i think
so as a creator of a car that's trying

4698
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,280
so as a creator of a car that's trying
 

4699
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,149
so as a creator of a car that's trying
to

4700
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:10,159
to
 

4701
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,229
to
create a product that people love which

4702
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:12,239
create a product that people love which
 

4703
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,310
create a product that people love which
is what tesla tries to do right

4704
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
is what tesla tries to do right
 

4705
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,189
is what tesla tries to do right
it's not obvious to me that uh you know

4706
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
it's not obvious to me that uh you know
 

4707
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,110
it's not obvious to me that uh you know
as a design decision whether adding a

4708
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,120
as a design decision whether adding a
 

4709
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:19,830
as a design decision whether adding a
camera

4710
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
camera
 

4711
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,229
camera
is a good idea from a safety perspective

4712
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
is a good idea from a safety perspective
 

4713
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,189
is a good idea from a safety perspective
either like

4714
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:23,199
either like
 

4715
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,830
either like
in the human factors community everybody

4716
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:25,840
in the human factors community everybody
 

4717
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,310
in the human factors community everybody
says

4718
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,320
says
 

4719
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,910
says
that like you should obviously have

4720
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
that like you should obviously have
 

4721
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,630
that like you should obviously have
driver sensing driving monitoring

4722
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
driver sensing driving monitoring
 

4723
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,390
driver sensing driving monitoring
but like that

4724
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
but like that
 

4725
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,630
but like that
that's like saying it's obvious as

4726
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
that's like saying it's obvious as
 

4727
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,229
that's like saying it's obvious as
parents you shouldn't let your kids go

4728
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
parents you shouldn't let your kids go
 

4729
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,910
parents you shouldn't let your kids go
out at night

4730
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:39,920
out at night
 

4731
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,590
out at night
but okay but like

4732
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
but okay but like
 

4733
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,030
but okay but like
they're still gonna find ways to do

4734
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
they're still gonna find ways to do
 

4735
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,669
they're still gonna find ways to do
drugs

4736
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:47,679

 

4737
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,070

yeah you have to also be good parents so

4738
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
yeah you have to also be good parents so
 

4739
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,669
yeah you have to also be good parents so
like it's it's much more complicated

4740
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:51,679
like it's it's much more complicated
 

4741
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:52,709
like it's it's much more complicated
than just like

4742
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:52,719
than just like
 

4743
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,709
than just like
you need to have drive and monitoring i

4744
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
you need to have drive and monitoring i
 

4745
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,630
you need to have drive and monitoring i
totally disagree on

4746
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
totally disagree on
 

4747
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,030
totally disagree on
okay if you have a camera there and the

4748
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
okay if you have a camera there and the
 

4749
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,390
okay if you have a camera there and the
camera's watching the person

4750
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:00,400
camera's watching the person
 

4751
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,310
camera's watching the person
but never throws an alert they'll never

4752
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
but never throws an alert they'll never
 

4753
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,590
but never throws an alert they'll never
think about it

4754
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
think about it
 

4755
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,270
think about it
right the the driver monitoring policy

4756
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
right the the driver monitoring policy
 

4757
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,189
right the the driver monitoring policy
that you choose to how you choose to

4758
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:09,199
that you choose to how you choose to
 

4759
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,790
that you choose to how you choose to
communicate with the user is

4760
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:10,800
communicate with the user is
 

4761
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,189
communicate with the user is
entirely separate from the data

4762
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
entirely separate from the data
 

4763
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,110
entirely separate from the data
collection perspective right

4764
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
collection perspective right
 

4765
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,750
collection perspective right
right so you know like

4766
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
right so you know like
 

4767
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,550
right so you know like
there's one thing to say like you know

4768
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
there's one thing to say like you know
 

4769
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,830
there's one thing to say like you know
tell your teenager they can't do

4770
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:23,840
tell your teenager they can't do
 

4771
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,550
tell your teenager they can't do
something

4772
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
something
 

4773
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,149
something
there's another thing to like you know

4774
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
there's another thing to like you know
 

4775
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,669
there's another thing to like you know
gather the data so you can

4776
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
gather the data so you can
 

4777
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,030
gather the data so you can
make informed decisions that's really

4778
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:29,040
make informed decisions that's really
 

4779
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,030
make informed decisions that's really
interesting but you have to make that

4780
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
interesting but you have to make that
 

4781
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,189
interesting but you have to make that
that's the interesting thing about cars

4782
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
that's the interesting thing about cars
 

4783
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,110
that's the interesting thing about cars
uh but even true with com ai

4784
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,120
uh but even true with com ai
 

4785
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,750
uh but even true with com ai
like you don't have to manufacture the

4786
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
like you don't have to manufacture the
 

4787
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,870
like you don't have to manufacture the
thing into the car

4788
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
thing into the car
 

4789
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,310
thing into the car
is you have to make a decision that

4790
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
is you have to make a decision that
 

4791
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,910
is you have to make a decision that
anticipates

4792
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
anticipates
 

4793
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,629
anticipates
the right strategy long term so like you

4794
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:44,639
the right strategy long term so like you
 

4795
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,709
the right strategy long term so like you
have to start collecting the data

4796
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:46,719
have to start collecting the data
 

4797
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,470
have to start collecting the data
and start making decisions starter date

4798
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
and start making decisions starter date
 

4799
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,990
and start making decisions starter date
started it three years ago

4800
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,000
started it three years ago
 

4801
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,070
started it three years ago
i believe that we have the best driver

4802
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,080
i believe that we have the best driver
 

4803
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,070
i believe that we have the best driver
monitoring solution in the world

4804
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:54,080
monitoring solution in the world
 

4805
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,629
monitoring solution in the world
um i think that when you compare it to

4806
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:56,639
um i think that when you compare it to
 

4807
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:57,990
um i think that when you compare it to
well supercruise is the only other one

4808
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
well supercruise is the only other one
 

4809
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,590
well supercruise is the only other one
that i really know that shipped

4810
01:20:59,590 --> 01:20:59,600
that i really know that shipped
 

4811
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,350
that i really know that shipped
and ours is better what uh

4812
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
and ours is better what uh
 

4813
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,870
and ours is better what uh
what do you like and not like about

4814
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
what do you like and not like about
 

4815
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,590
what do you like and not like about
super coos um i mean i had a few

4816
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
super coos um i mean i had a few
 

4817
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,030
super coos um i mean i had a few
super crews uh the sun would be shining

4818
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
super crews uh the sun would be shining
 

4819
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,910
super crews uh the sun would be shining
through the window

4820
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
through the window
 

4821
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,590
through the window
would blind the camera and it would say

4822
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
would blind the camera and it would say
 

4823
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,709
would blind the camera and it would say
i wasn't paying attention when i was

4824
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:14,719
i wasn't paying attention when i was
 

4825
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:15,990
i wasn't paying attention when i was
looking completely straight

4826
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
looking completely straight
 

4827
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,750
looking completely straight
i couldn't reset the attention with a

4828
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
i couldn't reset the attention with a
 

4829
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,669
i couldn't reset the attention with a
steering wheel touch and supercrews

4830
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:19,679
steering wheel touch and supercrews
 

4831
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,870
steering wheel touch and supercrews
would disengage

4832
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
would disengage
 

4833
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,310
would disengage
like i was communicating to the car i'm

4834
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:22,320
like i was communicating to the car i'm
 

4835
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,390
like i was communicating to the car i'm
like look i'm here i'm paying attention

4836
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
like look i'm here i'm paying attention
 

4837
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,669
like look i'm here i'm paying attention
why are you really gonna force me to

4838
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:25,679
why are you really gonna force me to
 

4839
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:26,629
why are you really gonna force me to
disengage and

4840
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:26,639
disengage and
 

4841
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,390
disengage and
it did um so it's it's a constant

4842
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,400
it did um so it's it's a constant
 

4843
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,310
it did um so it's it's a constant
conversation with the user and yeah

4844
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,320
conversation with the user and yeah
 

4845
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,669
conversation with the user and yeah
there's no way to ship a system like

4846
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:33,679
there's no way to ship a system like
 

4847
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:35,350
there's no way to ship a system like
this if you can ota

4848
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
this if you can ota
 

4849
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,550
this if you can ota
right we're shipping a new one every

4850
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:36,560
right we're shipping a new one every
 

4851
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,390
right we're shipping a new one every
month sometimes we we

4852
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,400
month sometimes we we
 

4853
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,070
month sometimes we we
balance it with our users on discord

4854
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:40,080
balance it with our users on discord
 

4855
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,510
balance it with our users on discord
like when sometimes we make the driver

4856
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
like when sometimes we make the driver
 

4857
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,790
like when sometimes we make the driver
monitoring a little more aggressive and

4858
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
monitoring a little more aggressive and
 

4859
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,750
monitoring a little more aggressive and
people complain

4860
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,760
people complain
 

4861
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,750
people complain
sometimes they don't you know we want it

4862
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
sometimes they don't you know we want it
 

4863
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,110
sometimes they don't you know we want it
to be as aggressive as possible where

4864
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,120
to be as aggressive as possible where
 

4865
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:47,510
to be as aggressive as possible where
people

4866
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,520
people
 

4867
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,110
people
don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive

4868
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120
don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive
 

4869
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,629
don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive
so being able to update the system over

4870
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:50,639
so being able to update the system over
 

4871
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,470
so being able to update the system over
the air is an essential component

4872
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:52,480
the air is an essential component
 

4873
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,390
the air is an essential component
i mean that's probably to me you

4874
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
i mean that's probably to me you
 

4875
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,470
i mean that's probably to me you
mentioned uh

4876
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
mentioned uh
 

4877
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,189
mentioned uh
i mean to me that is the biggest

4878
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
i mean to me that is the biggest
 

4879
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,870
i mean to me that is the biggest
innovation of tesla

4880
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
innovation of tesla
 

4881
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,510
innovation of tesla
that it it made it people realize that

4882
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:03,520
that it it made it people realize that
 

4883
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,709
that it it made it people realize that
over-the-air updates

4884
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
over-the-air updates
 

4885
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,830
over-the-air updates
is essential yeah i mean

4886
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
is essential yeah i mean
 

4887
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,510
is essential yeah i mean
yeah was that not obvious from the

4888
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,520
yeah was that not obvious from the
 

4889
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,030
yeah was that not obvious from the
iphone the iphone was the first real

4890
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
iphone the iphone was the first real
 

4891
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,950
iphone the iphone was the first real
product that ota'ed i think

4892
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
product that ota'ed i think
 

4893
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,550
product that ota'ed i think
was it actually that's that's brilliant

4894
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:14,560
was it actually that's that's brilliant
 

4895
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,830
was it actually that's that's brilliant
you're right i mean the game consoles

4896
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
you're right i mean the game consoles
 

4897
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,870
you're right i mean the game consoles
used to not right

4898
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
used to not right
 

4899
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,070
used to not right
the game consoles are maybe the second

4900
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
the game consoles are maybe the second
 

4901
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,910
the game consoles are maybe the second
thing that did well i didn't really

4902
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:19,920
thing that did well i didn't really
 

4903
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,470
thing that did well i didn't really
think about

4904
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:20,480
think about
 

4905
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,830
think about
one of the amazing features of a

4906
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:22,840
one of the amazing features of a
 

4907
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,390
one of the amazing features of a
smartphone

4908
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
smartphone
 

4909
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,470
smartphone
isn't just like the touchscreen isn't

4910
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
isn't just like the touchscreen isn't
 

4911
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,590
isn't just like the touchscreen isn't
the thing

4912
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
the thing
 

4913
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,550
the thing
it's the ability to constantly update

4914
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:30,560
it's the ability to constantly update
 

4915
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:30,950
it's the ability to constantly update
yeah

4916
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:30,960
yeah
 

4917
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,870
yeah
get better it gets better

4918
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880

 

4919
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,629

i love my ios 14. uh

4920
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:38,639
i love my ios 14. uh
 

4921
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,350
i love my ios 14. uh
one thing that i probably disagree with

4922
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
one thing that i probably disagree with
 

4923
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,830
one thing that i probably disagree with
you on on driving monitoring

4924
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
you on on driving monitoring
 

4925
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,629
you on on driving monitoring
is you've said that it's easy like i

4926
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:46,639
is you've said that it's easy like i
 

4927
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,149
is you've said that it's easy like i
mean you you tend to say stuff is easy

4928
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
mean you you tend to say stuff is easy
 

4929
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,629
mean you you tend to say stuff is easy
the uh i guess you said it's easy

4930
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:52,639
the uh i guess you said it's easy
 

4931
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:53,830
the uh i guess you said it's easy
relative to the

4932
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:53,840
relative to the
 

4933
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,070
relative to the

4934
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080

 

4935
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,910

can you elaborate why you think it's

4936
01:22:59,910 --> 01:22:59,920
can you elaborate why you think it's
 

4937
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,229
can you elaborate why you think it's
easy feature engineering works

4938
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
easy feature engineering works
 

4939
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,669
easy feature engineering works
for driver monitoring feature

so human faces are not

4946
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
so human faces are not

is your intuition um yes and there's

4956
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:17,920
is your intuition um yes and there's
 

4957
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,310
is your intuition um yes and there's
another big difference as well um your

01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
another big difference as well um your
 

4959
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,750
another big difference as well um your
reliability of a driver monitoring

doesn't actually need to be that high
the uncertainty

4966
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600
the uncertainty
 

4967
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,110
the uncertainty
if you have something that's detecting

4968
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
if you have something that's detecting
 

4969
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,470
if you have something that's detecting
whether the human is paying attention it

4970
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:28,480
whether the human is paying attention it
 

4971
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,669
whether the human is paying attention it
only works 92

4972
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:29,679
only works 92
 

4973
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,430
only works 92
of the time you're still getting almost

4974
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
of the time you're still getting almost
 

4975
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,030
of the time you're still getting almost
all the benefit of that because

4976
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:33,040
all the benefit of that because
 

4977
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,870
all the benefit of that because
the human like you're training the human

4978
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,880
the human like you're training the human
 

4979
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,550
the human like you're training the human
yeah right you're you're dealing with a

4980
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
yeah right you're you're dealing with a
 

4981
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,510
yeah right you're you're dealing with a
system that's

4982
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
system that's
 

4983
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,270
system that's
really helping you out it's a

4984
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
really helping you out it's a
 

4985
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,790
really helping you out it's a
conversation it's not

4986
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800
conversation it's not
 

4987
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,350
conversation it's not
like the external thing where guess what

4988
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
like the external thing where guess what
 

4989
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,629
like the external thing where guess what
if you swerve into a tree you swerve

4990
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
if you swerve into a tree you swerve
 

4991
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:45,590
if you swerve into a tree you swerve
into a tree

4992
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
into a tree
 

4993
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,229
into a tree
right like you get no margin for error

4994
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
right like you get no margin for error
 

4995
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,750
right like you get no margin for error
yeah i think that's really well put i

4996
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:49,760
yeah i think that's really well put i
 

4997
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,030
yeah i think that's really well put i
i i think that's the right exactly the

4998
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
i i think that's the right exactly the
 

4999
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:53,990
i i think that's the right exactly the
place

5000
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
place
 

5001
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,990
place
where um where comparing to the external

5002
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,000
where um where comparing to the external
 

5003
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,229
where um where comparing to the external
perception the control problem

5004
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
perception the control problem
 

5005
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:01,750
perception the control problem
driver monitoring is easier because you

5006
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:01,760
driver monitoring is easier because you
 

5007
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,189
driver monitoring is easier because you
know the bar for success is much lower

5008
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
know the bar for success is much lower
 

5009
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,510
know the bar for success is much lower
yeah but i i still think like the human

5010
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
yeah but i i still think like the human
 

5011
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,030
yeah but i i still think like the human
face

5012
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
face
 

5013
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,110
face
is more complicated actually than the

5014
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
is more complicated actually than the
 

5015
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,870
is more complicated actually than the
external environment but for driving you

5016
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:12,880
external environment but for driving you
 

5017
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,229
external environment but for driving you
don't give a damn

5018
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
don't give a damn
 

5019
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,510
don't give a damn
i don't need you i don't need something

5020
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
i don't need you i don't need something
 

5021
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,149
i don't need you i don't need something
i don't need something that complicated

5022
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
i don't need something that complicated
 

5023
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,189
i don't need something that complicated
to to to have to communicate the idea

5024
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
to to to have to communicate the idea
 

5025
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,110
to to to have to communicate the idea
to the human that i want to communicate

which is yo
system might mess up here you got to pay

5030
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:26,080
system might mess up here you got to pay
 

5031
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,669
system might mess up here you got to pay
attention

5032
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
attention
 

5033
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,470
attention
yeah see that's that's my love and

5034
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
yeah see that's that's my love and
 

5035
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,590
yeah see that's that's my love and
fascination is the

5036
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:31,600
fascination is the
 

5037
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,790
fascination is the
the human face and it feels like this is

5038
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
the human face and it feels like this is
 

5039
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,390
the human face and it feels like this is
a nice place to um create products that

5040
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:38,400
a nice place to um create products that
 

5041
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,910
a nice place to um create products that
create an experience in the car

5042
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:39,920
create an experience in the car
 

5043
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,830
create an experience in the car
so like it feels like there should be

5044
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:42,840
so like it feels like there should be
 

5045
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,270
so like it feels like there should be
more richer experiences

5046
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:45,280
more richer experiences
 

5047
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,990
more richer experiences
in the car you know like that's an

5048
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,000
in the car you know like that's an
 

5049
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,910
in the car you know like that's an
opportunity for

5050
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
opportunity for
 

5051
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,070
opportunity for
like something like my eye or just any

5052
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,080
like something like my eye or just any
 

5053
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,149
like something like my eye or just any
kind of system like a tesla or any of

5054
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:54,159
kind of system like a tesla or any of
 

5055
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,070
kind of system like a tesla or any of
the autonomous vehicle companies

5056
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
the autonomous vehicle companies
 

5057
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,149
the autonomous vehicle companies
is because software's and there's much

5058
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:58,159
is because software's and there's much
 

5059
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,110
is because software's and there's much
more sensors

5060
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,120
more sensors
 

5061
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,629
more sensors
and so much is running on software and

5062
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
and so much is running on software and
 

5063
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,709
and so much is running on software and
you're doing machine learning anyway

5064
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:02,719
you're doing machine learning anyway
 

5065
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,550
you're doing machine learning anyway
there's an opportunity to create totally

5066
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
there's an opportunity to create totally
 

5067
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,070
there's an opportunity to create totally
new experiences

5068
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
new experiences
 

5069
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,229
new experiences
that we're not even anticipating you

5070
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
that we're not even anticipating you
 

5071
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,070
that we're not even anticipating you
don't think so

5072
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
don't think so
 

5073
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,990
don't think so
no you think it's a box that gets you

5074
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
no you think it's a box that gets you
 

5075
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,750
no you think it's a box that gets you
from a to b and you want to do it

5076
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
from a to b and you want to do it
 

5077
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,149
from a to b and you want to do it
chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we

5078
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:16,159
chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we
 

5079
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,750
chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we
get to level three on highways okay

5080
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:17,760
get to level three on highways okay
 

5081
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,110
get to level three on highways okay
enjoy your candy crush

5082
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,120
enjoy your candy crush
 

5083
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,149
enjoy your candy crush
enjoy your hulu enjoy your

5084
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:22,159
enjoy your hulu enjoy your
 

5085
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,990
enjoy your hulu enjoy your
you know whatever whatever sure you get

5086
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,000
you know whatever whatever sure you get
 

5087
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,149
you know whatever whatever sure you get
this you can look at screens basically

5088
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:26,159
this you can look at screens basically
 

5089
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,830
this you can look at screens basically
versus right now what do you have music

5090
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
versus right now what do you have music
 

5091
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,510
versus right now what do you have music
and audio books so level three is where

5092
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,520
and audio books so level three is where
 

5093
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,870
and audio books so level three is where
you can kind of disengage in

5094
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
you can kind of disengage in
 

5095
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,320
you can kind of disengage in
in stretches of time

5096
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:33,330
in stretches of time
 

5097
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:33,590
in stretches of time
[Music]

5098
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,600
[Music]
 

5099
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,790
[Music]
[Applause]

5100
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
[Applause]
 

5101
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,270
[Applause]
well you think level three is possible

5102
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
well you think level three is possible
 

5103
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,030
well you think level three is possible
like on the highway going for 100 miles

5104
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
like on the highway going for 100 miles
 

5105
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,430
like on the highway going for 100 miles
and you can just go to sleep oh yeah

5106
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:41,440
and you can just go to sleep oh yeah
 

5107
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,550
and you can just go to sleep oh yeah
uh sleep so again

5108
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
uh sleep so again
 

5109
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,350
uh sleep so again
i think it's really all on a spectrum i

5110
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
i think it's really all on a spectrum i
 

5111
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:47,910
i think it's really all on a spectrum i
think that

5112
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:47,920
think that
 

5113
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,149
think that
being able to use your phone while

5114
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
being able to use your phone while
 

5115
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,270
being able to use your phone while
you're on the highway

5116
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
you're on the highway
 

5117
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,830
you're on the highway
and like this all being okay and being

5118
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:53,840
and like this all being okay and being
 

5119
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,350
and like this all being okay and being
aware that the car might alert you and

5120
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
aware that the car might alert you and
 

5121
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,950
aware that the car might alert you and
you have five seconds to basically

5122
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
you have five seconds to basically
 

5123
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,310
you have five seconds to basically
so the five second thing that you think

5124
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
so the five second thing that you think
 

5125
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,229
so the five second thing that you think
is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah

5126
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:00,239
is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah
 

5127
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,229
is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah
not not in all scenarios right some

5128
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:02,239
not not in all scenarios right some
 

5129
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,669
not not in all scenarios right some
scenarios it's not

5130
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:03,679
scenarios it's not
 

5131
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,189
scenarios it's not
it's the whole risk thing that you

5132
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
it's the whole risk thing that you
 

5133
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,790
it's the whole risk thing that you
mentioned is nice is to be able to

5134
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:06,800
mentioned is nice is to be able to
 

5135
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,629
mentioned is nice is to be able to
estimate like

5136
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
estimate like
 

5137
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,550
estimate like
how risky is this situation exactly

5138
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:10,560
how risky is this situation exactly
 

5139
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,790
how risky is this situation exactly
that's really important to understand

5140
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:12,800
that's really important to understand
 

5141
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,790
that's really important to understand
one other thing you mentioned comparing

5142
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:14,800
one other thing you mentioned comparing
 

5143
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,070
one other thing you mentioned comparing
comma and

5144
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
comma and
 

5145
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,910
comma and
autopilot is that um

5146
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
autopilot is that um
 

5147
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,629
autopilot is that um
something about the haptic feel of the

5148
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
something about the haptic feel of the
 

5149
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,310
something about the haptic feel of the
way combo controls the car

5150
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,320
way combo controls the car
 

5151
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,229
way combo controls the car
when things are uncertain like it

5152
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:26,239
when things are uncertain like it
 

5153
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,830
when things are uncertain like it
behaves a little bit more uncertain when

5154
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
behaves a little bit more uncertain when
 

5155
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,510
behaves a little bit more uncertain when
things are uncertain

5156
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
things are uncertain
 

5157
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,110
things are uncertain
that's kind of an interesting point and

5158
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120
that's kind of an interesting point and
 

5159
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,189
that's kind of an interesting point and
then autopilot is much more confident

5160
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:33,199
then autopilot is much more confident
 

5161
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:36,229
then autopilot is much more confident
always even when it's uncertain until it

5162
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
always even when it's uncertain until it
 

5163
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,709
always even when it's uncertain until it
runs into trouble

5164
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:38,719
runs into trouble
 

5165
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:40,950
runs into trouble
yeah that's that's a funny thing i

5166
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:40,960
yeah that's that's a funny thing i
 

5167
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,629
yeah that's that's a funny thing i
actually mentioned that to elon i think

5168
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:42,639
actually mentioned that to elon i think
 

5169
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,030
actually mentioned that to elon i think
and then the first time we talked he

5170
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,040
and then the first time we talked he
 

5171
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,149
and then the first time we talked he
wasn't biting

5172
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
wasn't biting
 

5173
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,870
wasn't biting

um the margins that they are making off

5368
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,120
um the margins that they are making off
 

5369
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,390
um the margins that they are making off
of those high-end chips are

5370
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400
of those high-end chips are
 

5371
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,510
of those high-end chips are
so high that i mean i think they're

5372
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:09,520
so high that i mean i think they're
 

5373
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,629
so high that i mean i think they're
shooting themselves in the foot just

5374
01:30:10,629 --> 01:30:10,639

like me now who are like somebody's got
taken video down

5382
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960

 

5383
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,189

yeah where they could dominate it nvidia

5384
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
yeah where they could dominate it nvidia
 

5385
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,310
yeah where they could dominate it nvidia
could be the new intel

5386
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
could be the new intel
 

5387
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,350
could be the new intel
yeah to be in inside everything

5388
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:25,360
yeah to be in inside everything
 

5389
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,870

and and yet the winners in in certain
 

5393
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,110
and and yet the winners in in certain
spaces like

5394

spaces like
 

5395
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,070
spaces like
autonomous driving the winners only the

chips
 

5467
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,709
chips
well the the interesting thing about

5468
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:38,719
well the the interesting thing about
 

5469
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,870
well the the interesting thing about
jensen is he is

5470
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:40,880
jensen is he is
 

5471
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,229
jensen is he is
a big vision guy so he has

5472
01:31:44,229 --> 01:31:44,239
a big vision guy so he has
 

5473
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:48,629
a big vision guy so he has
a plan like for 50 years down the road

5474
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:48,639
a plan like for 50 years down the road
 

5475
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,629
a plan like for 50 years down the road
so it makes me wonder like how does

5476
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
so it makes me wonder like how does
 

5477
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,470
so it makes me wonder like how does
price gouging fit into it yeah how does

5478
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:52,480
price gouging fit into it yeah how does
 

5479
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,030
price gouging fit into it yeah how does
that

5480
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,040
that
 

5481
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,750
that
like it's it doesn't seem to make sense

01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:56,960
to plan
 

5485
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,790
to plan
i worry that he's listening to the wrong

5486
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
i worry that he's listening to the wrong

question elon musk is
 

5569
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,030
question elon musk is
uh perhaps asking is uh

5570
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
uh perhaps asking is uh
 

5571
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,870
uh perhaps asking is uh
do you want tesla stuff inside other

vehicles in
 

5575
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,590
vehicles in
inside potentially inside like uh irobot

yeah i think you should decide where

5580
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:35,760
yeah i think you should decide where
 

5581
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,189
yeah i think you should decide where
your advantages are

5582
01:33:37,189 --> 01:33:37,199
your advantages are
 

5583
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:38,310
your advantages are
i'm not saying tesla should start

5584
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
i'm not saying tesla should start
 

5585
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,229

selling battery packs to automakers

5586
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:40,239
selling battery packs to automakers
 

5587
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,750
selling battery packs to automakers
because battery packs to automakers they

5588
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
because battery packs to automakers they
 

5589
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,510
because battery packs to automakers they
are straight up in competition with you

5590
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,520
are straight up in competition with you
 

5591
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,790
are straight up in competition with you
if i were tesla i'd keep the battery

5592
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:44,800
if i were tesla i'd keep the battery
 

5593
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,110
if i were tesla i'd keep the battery
technology totally yeah ssr's we make

batteries
 

5597
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,350
batteries
but the thing about the tesla tpu um

5598
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:51,360
but the thing about the tesla tpu um
 

5599
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,510
but the thing about the tesla tpu um
is anybody can build that it's just a

5600
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
is anybody can build that it's just a
 

5601
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,470
is anybody can build that it's just a
question of you know

5602
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
question of you know
 

5603
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,790
question of you know
are you willing to spend the you know

5604
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:56,800
are you willing to spend the you know
 

5605
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,470
are you willing to spend the you know
the money it could be a huge source of

5606
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
the money it could be a huge source of
 

5607
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,990
the money it could be a huge source of
revenue potentially

5608
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
revenue potentially
 

5609
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,030
revenue potentially
are you willing to spend 100 million

5610
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,040
are you willing to spend 100 million
 

5611
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,669
are you willing to spend 100 million
dollars right anyone can build it

5612
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
dollars right anyone can build it
 

5613
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,430
dollars right anyone can build it
and someone will and a bunch of

5614
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,440
and someone will and a bunch of
 

5615
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,790
and someone will and a bunch of
companies now are starting trying to

5616
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
companies now are starting trying to
 

5617
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,470
companies now are starting trying to
build ai accelerators somebody's going

5618
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
build ai accelerators somebody's going
 

5619
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,149
build ai accelerators somebody's going
to get the idea right

5620
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:10,159
to get the idea right
 

5621
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:13,590
to get the idea right
and yeah hopefully they don't get greedy

5622
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
and yeah hopefully they don't get greedy
 

5623
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,950
and yeah hopefully they don't get greedy
because they'll just lose to the next

5624
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:14,960
because they'll just lose to the next
 

5625
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,390
because they'll just lose to the next
guy who finally and then eventually the

5626
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,400
guy who finally and then eventually the
 

5627
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,510
guy who finally and then eventually the
chinese are going to make knock off and

5628
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:17,520
chinese are going to make knock off and
 

5629
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,430
chinese are going to make knock off and
video chips and that's

5630
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
video chips and that's
 

5631
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,629
video chips and that's
from your perspective i don't know if

5632
01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:20,639
from your perspective i don't know if
 

5633
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,470
from your perspective i don't know if
you're also paying attention to stan

5634
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:22,480
you're also paying attention to stan
 

5635
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,830
you're also paying attention to stan
tesla for a moment

5636

all dave elon musk has talked about a

5638
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
all dave elon musk has talked about a
 

5639
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,709
all dave elon musk has talked about a
complete rewrite

5640
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
complete rewrite
 

5641
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,510
complete rewrite
of uh the neural net that they're using

5642
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:31,520
of uh the neural net that they're using
 

5643
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,390
of uh the neural net that they're using
that seems to

5644
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,400
that seems to
 

5645
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,110
that seems to
again i'm half paying attention but it

5646
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:35,120
again i'm half paying attention but it
 

5647
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,629
again i'm half paying attention but it
seems to involve

5648
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:36,639
seems to involve
 

5649
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:39,110
seems to involve
basically a kind of integration of all

5650
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,120
basically a kind of integration of all
 

5651
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,070
basically a kind of integration of all
the sensors to where

5652
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,080
the sensors to where
 

5653
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,310
the sensors to where
it's a four dimensional view you know

5654
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
it's a four dimensional view you know
 

5655
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,510
it's a four dimensional view you know
you have a 3d

5656
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,520
you have a 3d
 

5657
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,830
you have a 3d
model of the world over time and then

5658
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:47,840
model of the world over time and then
 

5659
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,830
model of the world over time and then
you can i think it's done

5660
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
you can i think it's done
 

5661
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,189
you can i think it's done
both for the for actually you know

5662
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:53,199
both for the for actually you know
 

5663
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,669
both for the for actually you know
so the neural network is able to in a

5664
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
so the neural network is able to in a
 

5665
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,669
so the neural network is able to in a
more holistic way deal with the world

5666
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
more holistic way deal with the world
 

5667
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,189
more holistic way deal with the world
and make predictions and so on

5668
01:34:59,189 --> 01:34:59,199
and make predictions and so on
 

5669
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,990
and make predictions and so on
but also to make the annotation task

5670
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,000
but also to make the annotation task
 

5671
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,669
but also to make the annotation task
more uh

5672
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:03,679
more uh
 

5673
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,070
more uh
you know easier like you can annotate

5674
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,080
you know easier like you can annotate
 

5675
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,189
you know easier like you can annotate
the world

5676
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
the world
 

5677
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,109
the world
in one place and then kind of distribute

5678
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:09,119
in one place and then kind of distribute
 

5679
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,870
in one place and then kind of distribute
itself across the sensors and

5680
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,880
itself across the sensors and
 

5681
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,669
itself across the sensors and
across a different like the hundreds of

5682
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:13,679
across a different like the hundreds of
 

5683
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,109
across a different like the hundreds of
tasks that are involved

5684
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
tasks that are involved
 

5685
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:18,070
tasks that are involved
in the hydronet what are your thoughts

5686
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:18,080
in the hydronet what are your thoughts
 

5687
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,910
in the hydronet what are your thoughts
about this rewrite is it just like some

5688
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
about this rewrite is it just like some
 

5689
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,189
about this rewrite is it just like some
details

5690
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
details
 

5691
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,870
details
that are kind of obvious there are steps

5692
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:22,880
that are kind of obvious there are steps
 

5693
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,310
that are kind of obvious there are steps
that should be taken or is there

5694
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
that should be taken or is there
 

5695
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,990
that should be taken or is there
something fundamental

5696
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,000
something fundamental
 

5697
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,750
something fundamental
that could challenge your idea that end

5698
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:27,760
that could challenge your idea that end
 

5699
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,709
that could challenge your idea that end
to end is the right solution

5700
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:30,719
to end is the right solution
 

5701
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,149
to end is the right solution
uh we're in the middle of a bakery right

5702
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
uh we're in the middle of a bakery right
 

5703
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,669
uh we're in the middle of a bakery right
now as well we haven't shipped a new

5704
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:33,679
now as well we haven't shipped a new
 

5705
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:34,790
now as well we haven't shipped a new
model in a bit

5706
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
model in a bit
 

5707
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,189
model in a bit
of what kind uh we're going from 2d to

5708
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199
of what kind uh we're going from 2d to
 

5709
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:38,149
of what kind uh we're going from 2d to
3d

5710
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
3d
 

5711
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,590
3d
right now all our stuff like for example

5712
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
right now all our stuff like for example
 

5713
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,430
right now all our stuff like for example
when the car pitches back the lane lines

5714
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:41,440
when the car pitches back the lane lines
 

5715
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,709
when the car pitches back the lane lines
also pitch back

5716
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
also pitch back
 

5717
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,030
also pitch back
uh because we're assuming the flat ro

5718
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,040
uh because we're assuming the flat ro
 

5719
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,550
uh because we're assuming the flat ro
flat world hypothesis

5720
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:46,560
flat world hypothesis
 

5721
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,550
flat world hypothesis
uh the new models do not do this the new

5722
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:48,560
uh the new models do not do this the new
 

5723
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,470
uh the new models do not do this the new
models output everything in 3d

5724
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,480
models output everything in 3d
 

5725
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,950
models output everything in 3d
um so this but there's still no

5726
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
um so this but there's still no
 

5727
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,629
um so this but there's still no
annotation so the 3d is

5728
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:54,639
annotation so the 3d is
 

5729
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,910
annotation so the 3d is
it's more about the opposite yeah uh

5730
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:57,920
it's more about the opposite yeah uh
 

5731
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,669
it's more about the opposite yeah uh
we have we have disease and everything

5732
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
we have we have disease and everything
 

5733
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,109
we have we have disease and everything
uh we've disease

5734
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
uh we've disease
 

5735
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,350
uh we've disease
yeah we had a disease we had a disease

5736
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,360
yeah we had a disease we had a disease
 

5737
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,950
yeah we had a disease we had a disease
um we unified

5738
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:04,960
um we unified
 

5739
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,870
um we unified
a lot of stuff as well uh we switched

5740
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
a lot of stuff as well uh we switched
 

5741
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,870
a lot of stuff as well uh we switched
from tensorflow to pi torch

5742
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
from tensorflow to pi torch
 

5743
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,910
from tensorflow to pi torch
yes uh my understanding

5744
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:11,920
yes uh my understanding
 

5745
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,229
yes uh my understanding
of what tesla's thing is is that their

5746
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
of what tesla's thing is is that their
 

5747
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,070
of what tesla's thing is is that their
annotator now annotates across the time

5748
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
annotator now annotates across the time
 

5749
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,910
annotator now annotates across the time
dimension

5750
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:17,920
dimension
 

5751
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,830
dimension
uh i mean cute

5752
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
uh i mean cute
 

5753
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,870
uh i mean cute
why are you building an annotator i i

5754
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:24,880
why are you building an annotator i i
 

5755
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,149
why are you building an annotator i i
find their entire pipeline

5756
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,159
find their entire pipeline
 

5757
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:30,870
find their entire pipeline
i find your vision i mean the vision

5758
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
i find your vision i mean the vision
 

5759
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,590
i find your vision i mean the vision
event to end

5760
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
event to end
 

5761
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,910
event to end
very compelling but i also like the

5762
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:33,920
very compelling but i also like the
 

5763
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,910
very compelling but i also like the
engineering of the data engine that

5764
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
engineering of the data engine that
 

5765
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,350
engineering of the data engine that
they've created

5766
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,360
they've created
 

5767
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:40,149
they've created
in terms of supervised learning

5768
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:40,159
in terms of supervised learning
 

5769
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:41,430
in terms of supervised learning
pipelines

5770
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
pipelines
 

5771
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,070
pipelines
that thing is damn impressive you're

5772
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
that thing is damn impressive you're
 

5773
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,950
that thing is damn impressive you're
basically the

5774
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
basically the
 

5775
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,990
basically the
the idea is that you have hundreds of

5776
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000
the idea is that you have hundreds of
 

5777
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,070
the idea is that you have hundreds of
thousands of people that are doing data

5778
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:50,080
thousands of people that are doing data
 

5779
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,669
thousands of people that are doing data
collection for you by doing their

5780
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
collection for you by doing their
 

5781
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,430
collection for you by doing their
experience so that's kind of similar to

5782
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,440
experience so that's kind of similar to
 

5783
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,109
experience so that's kind of similar to
the common ai model

5784
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:55,119
the common ai model
 

5785
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,229
the common ai model
and you're able to

5786
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
and you're able to
 

5787
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,790
and you're able to
mine that data based on the kind of edge

5788
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
mine that data based on the kind of edge
 

5789
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,790
mine that data based on the kind of edge
cases you need

5790
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:02,800
cases you need
 

5791
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,830
cases you need
i i think it's harder to do in the end

5792
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:05,840
i i think it's harder to do in the end
 

5793
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,270
i i think it's harder to do in the end
to end learning

5794
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,280
to end learning
 

5795
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,510
to end learning
the mining of the right edge cases like

5796
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
the mining of the right edge cases like
 

5797
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,350
the mining of the right edge cases like
that's where feature engineering

5798
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
that's where feature engineering
 

5799
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,189
that's where feature engineering
is actually really powerful because

5800
01:37:15,189 --> 01:37:15,199
is actually really powerful because
 

5801
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,590
is actually really powerful because
like us humans are able to do this kind

5802
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:17,600
like us humans are able to do this kind
 

5803
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,990
like us humans are able to do this kind
of mining a little better but but

5804
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
of mining a little better but but
 

5805
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,830
of mining a little better but but
yeah there's obvious as we as we know

5806
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:21,840
yeah there's obvious as we as we know
 

5807
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,030
yeah there's obvious as we as we know
there's obvious constraints and

5808
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
there's obvious constraints and
 

5809
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,149
there's obvious constraints and
limitations to that

5810
01:37:24,149 --> 01:37:24,159
limitations to that
 

5811
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:27,270
limitations to that
idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like

5812
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:27,280
idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like
 

5813
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,070
idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like
um

5814
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
um
 

5815
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,669
um
you get really interesting insights if

5816
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
you get really interesting insights if
 

5817
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:31,990
you get really interesting insights if
you saw if you sort your validation set

5818
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
you saw if you sort your validation set
 

5819
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,510
you saw if you sort your validation set
by loss

5820
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:33,520
by loss
 

5821
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,310
by loss
and look at the highest loss examples

5822
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:36,320
and look at the highest loss examples
 

5823
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,030
and look at the highest loss examples
yeah

5824
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
yeah
 

5825
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,310
yeah
uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have

5826
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have
 

5827
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,830
uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have
we have a little data engine like thing

5828
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:41,840
we have a little data engine like thing
 

5829
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,669
we have a little data engine like thing
we're training a segment uh

5830
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
we're training a segment uh
 

5831
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,870
we're training a segment uh
it's not fancy it's just like okay train

5832
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
it's not fancy it's just like okay train
 

5833
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,149
it's not fancy it's just like okay train
the new segment

5834
01:37:48,149 --> 01:37:48,159
the new segment
 

5835
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:50,390
the new segment
run it on 100 000 images and now take

5836
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
run it on 100 000 images and now take
 

5837
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,990
run it on 100 000 images and now take
the thousand with highest loss

5838
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:52,000
the thousand with highest loss
 

5839
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,470
the thousand with highest loss
select 100 of those by human put those

5840
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:54,480
select 100 of those by human put those
 

5841
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,990
select 100 of those by human put those
get those ones labeled

5842
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:56,000
get those ones labeled
 

5843
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,430
get those ones labeled
retrain do it again right so it's a much

5844
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
retrain do it again right so it's a much
 

5845
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,830
retrain do it again right so it's a much
less well-written data engine and yeah

5846
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,840
less well-written data engine and yeah
 

5847
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,270
less well-written data engine and yeah
you can you can take these things really

5848
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:03,280
you can you can take these things really
 

5849
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,709
you can you can take these things really
far and it is

5850
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:04,719
far and it is
 

5851
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:07,830
far and it is
impressive engineering and if you truly

5852
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840
impressive engineering and if you truly
 

5853
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,750
impressive engineering and if you truly
need supervised data for a problem

5854
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:09,760
need supervised data for a problem
 

5855
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,189
need supervised data for a problem
yeah things like data engine are the

5856
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:11,199
yeah things like data engine are the
 

5857
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,149
yeah things like data engine are the
high end of the

5858
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
high end of the
 

5859
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,430
high end of the
what is attention is a human paying

5860
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:15,440
what is attention is a human paying
 

5861
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,350
what is attention is a human paying
attention i mean we're going to probably

5862
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:17,360
attention i mean we're going to probably
 

5863
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,550
attention i mean we're going to probably
build something that looks like data

5864
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,560
build something that looks like data
 

5865
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,910
build something that looks like data
engine to push our driver monitoring

5866
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
engine to push our driver monitoring
 

5867
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,629
engine to push our driver monitoring
further

5868
01:38:20,629 --> 01:38:20,639
further
 

5869
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,270
further
um but for driving itself you have it

5870
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,280
um but for driving itself you have it
 

5871
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,470
um but for driving itself you have it
all annotated beautifully

5872
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:24,480
all annotated beautifully
 

5873
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,790
all annotated beautifully
by what the human does so yeah that's

5874
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:26,800
by what the human does so yeah that's
 

5875
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,910
by what the human does so yeah that's
interesting i mean that applies to

5876
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
interesting i mean that applies to
 

5877
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,470
interesting i mean that applies to
driver

5878
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:28,480
driver
 

5879
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,709
driver
attention as well do you want to detect

5880
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
attention as well do you want to detect
 

5881
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,149
attention as well do you want to detect
the eyes do you want to detect blinking

5882
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
the eyes do you want to detect blinking
 

5883
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,430
the eyes do you want to detect blinking
and pupil movement

5884
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
and pupil movement
 

5885
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,990
and pupil movement
do you want to detect all the like face

5886
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
do you want to detect all the like face
 

5887
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,910
do you want to detect all the like face
alignments the landmark detection and so

5888
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
alignments the landmark detection and so
 

5889
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,629
alignments the landmark detection and so
on

5890
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
on
 

5891
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,030
on
and then doing kind of reasoning based

5892
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,040
and then doing kind of reasoning based
 

5893
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,229
and then doing kind of reasoning based
on that or do you want to take the

5894
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
on that or do you want to take the
 

5895
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,990
on that or do you want to take the
entirety of the face over time and

5896
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,000
entirety of the face over time and
 

5897
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,030
entirety of the face over time and
do and i mean it's obvious that over

5898
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
do and i mean it's obvious that over
 

5899
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,709
do and i mean it's obvious that over
eventually you have to do end to end

5900
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:48,719
eventually you have to do end to end
 

5901
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,310
eventually you have to do end to end
with some calibration with some fixes

5902
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,320
with some calibration with some fixes
 

5903
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,270
with some calibration with some fixes
and so on

5904
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
and so on
 

5905
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,550
and so on
but it's uh like i don't know when

5906
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,560
but it's uh like i don't know when
 

5907
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,669
but it's uh like i don't know when
that's the right move

5908
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
that's the right move
 

5909
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,149
that's the right move
even if it's end to end there actually

5910
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:58,159
even if it's end to end there actually
 

5911
01:38:58,159 --> 01:38:59,030
even if it's end to end there actually
is there is no

5912
01:38:59,030 --> 01:38:59,040
is there is no
 

5913
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,390
is there is no
kind of um you have to supervise that

5914
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
kind of um you have to supervise that
 

5915
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,270
kind of um you have to supervise that
with humans

5916
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
with humans
 

5917
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,109
with humans
whether a human is paying attention or

5918
01:39:05,109 --> 01:39:05,119
whether a human is paying attention or
 

5919
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:07,750
whether a human is paying attention or
not is a completely subjective judgment

5920
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
not is a completely subjective judgment
 

5921
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,990
not is a completely subjective judgment
um like you can try to like

5922
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,000
um like you can try to like
 

5923
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,590
um like you can try to like
automatically do it with some stuff but

5924
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,600
automatically do it with some stuff but
 

5925
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:11,990
automatically do it with some stuff but
you don't

5926
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
you don't
 

5927
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,109
you don't
have if i record a video of a human i

5928
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:15,119
have if i record a video of a human i
 

5929
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:15,990
have if i record a video of a human i
don't have

5930
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,000
don't have
 

5931
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,310
don't have
true annotations anywhere in that video

5932
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:18,320
true annotations anywhere in that video
 

5933
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,510
true annotations anywhere in that video
the only way to get them

5934
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:19,520
the only way to get them
 

5935
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,070
the only way to get them
is with you know other humans labeling

5936
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
is with you know other humans labeling
 

5937
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:22,709
is with you know other humans labeling
it really

5938
01:39:22,709 --> 01:39:22,719
it really
 

5939
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,990
it really
well i don't know uh you you so

5940
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,000
well i don't know uh you you so
 

5941
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,189
well i don't know uh you you so
if you think deeply about it you could

5942
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
if you think deeply about it you could
 

5943
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,550
if you think deeply about it you could
you might be able to just depending on

5944
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:30,560
you might be able to just depending on
 

5945
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,149
you might be able to just depending on
the task maybe you'll discover

5946
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:32,159
the task maybe you'll discover
 

5947
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,149
the task maybe you'll discover
self-annotating things like

5948
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:34,159
self-annotating things like
 

5949
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,229
self-annotating things like
you know you can look at like steering

5950
01:39:36,229 --> 01:39:36,239
you know you can look at like steering
 

5951
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,590
you know you can look at like steering
wheel reversal or something like that

5952
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:37,600
wheel reversal or something like that
 

5953
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,590
wheel reversal or something like that
you can discover little moments of lapse

5954
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,600
you can discover little moments of lapse
 

5955
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,109
you can discover little moments of lapse
of attention yeah

5956
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:41,119
of attention yeah
 

5957
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:43,990
of attention yeah
i mean that's that's where psychology

5958
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
i mean that's that's where psychology
 

5959
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,550
i mean that's that's where psychology
comes in

5960
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:44,560
comes in
 

5961
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,550
comes in
is there indicate because you have so so

5962
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:46,560
is there indicate because you have so so
 

5963
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,910
is there indicate because you have so so
much data to look at

5964
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920
much data to look at
 

5965
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,390
much data to look at
so you might be able to find moments

5966
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
so you might be able to find moments
 

5967
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,310
so you might be able to find moments
when there's like just

5968
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
when there's like just
 

5969
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,310
when there's like just
inattention that even with smartphone if

5970
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
inattention that even with smartphone if
 

5971
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,070
inattention that even with smartphone if
you want to detect smartphone use

5972
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
you want to detect smartphone use
 

5973
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,990
you want to detect smartphone use
yeah you can start to zoom in i mean

5974
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
yeah you can start to zoom in i mean
 

5975
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,350
yeah you can start to zoom in i mean
that's the gold mine

5976
01:39:59,350 --> 01:39:59,360
that's the gold mine
 

5977
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,990
that's the gold mine
sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's

5978
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's
 

5979
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,510
sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's
doing this too right is there they're

5980
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:03,520
doing this too right is there they're
 

5981
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,430
doing this too right is there they're
doing

5982
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,440
doing
 

5983
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,990
doing
annotation based on it's like uh

5984
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:08,000
annotation based on it's like uh
 

5985
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,590
annotation based on it's like uh
self-supervised

5986
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:09,600
self-supervised
 

5987
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,510
self-supervised
learning too it's just a small part of

5988
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:11,520
learning too it's just a small part of
 

5989
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,109
learning too it's just a small part of
the entire picture

5990
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
the entire picture
 

5991
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:16,149
the entire picture
it's that's kind of the challenge

5992
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:16,159
it's that's kind of the challenge
 

5993
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,629
it's that's kind of the challenge
of solving a problem in machine learning

5994
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
of solving a problem in machine learning
 

5995
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,830

or like a few months ago if i wanted to
 

6135
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,229
or like a few months ago if i wanted to
run my own code

6136
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:38,239
run my own code
 

6137
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:42,629
run my own code
to um so use comma as a

6138
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:42,639
to um so use comma as a
 

6139
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,790
to um so use comma as a
platform and try to run something like

6140
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,800
platform and try to run something like
 

6141
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,910
platform and try to run something like
open pilot

6142
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:45,920
open pilot
 

6143
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,390
open pilot
what does it take to do that um so

6144
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:48,400
what does it take to do that um so
 

6145
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,149
what does it take to do that um so
there's a toggle in the settings called

6146
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
there's a toggle in the settings called
 

6147
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:51,669
there's a toggle in the settings called
enable ssh

6148
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
enable ssh
 

6149
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,990
enable ssh
and if you toggle that you can ssh into

6150
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,000
and if you toggle that you can ssh into
 

6151
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,590
and if you toggle that you can ssh into
your device you can modify the code you

6152
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
your device you can modify the code you
 

6153
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,830
your device you can modify the code you
can upload whatever code you want to it

6154
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:57,840
can upload whatever code you want to it
 

6155
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,510
can upload whatever code you want to it
um there's a whole lot of people so

6156
01:42:59,510 --> 01:42:59,520
um there's a whole lot of people so
 

6157
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,990
um there's a whole lot of people so
about 60 of people are running stock

6158
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
about 60 of people are running stock

got it
 

6201
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,790
got it
so you encourage responsible uh forking

6202
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:42,800
so you encourage responsible uh forking
 

6203
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,950
so you encourage responsible uh forking
yeah yeah some people you know yeah some

6204
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:44,960
yeah yeah some people you know yeah some
 

6205
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,030
yeah yeah some people you know yeah some
people uh like like there's forks that

6206
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,040
people uh like like there's forks that
 

6207
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:47,510
people uh like like there's forks that
will do

6208
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,520
will do
 

6209
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,510
will do
um some people just like having a lot of

6210
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:49,520
um some people just like having a lot of
 

6211
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,470
um some people just like having a lot of
uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like

6212
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:52,480
uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like
 

6213
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,990
uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like
flashing numbers so there's forks that

6214
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:54,000
flashing numbers so there's forks that
 

6215
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,790
flashing numbers so there's forks that
do that

6216
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
do that
 

6217
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,390
do that
uh some people don't like the fact that

6218
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:56,400
uh some people don't like the fact that
 

6219
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,830
uh some people don't like the fact that
it disengages when you press the gas

6220
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
it disengages when you press the gas
 

6221
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,390
it disengages when you press the gas
pedal there's forks that disable that

6222
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
pedal there's forks that disable that
 

6223
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,350
pedal there's forks that disable that
got it now the the stock experience is

6224
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
got it now the the stock experience is
 

6225
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:03,990
got it now the the stock experience is
is what

6226
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
is what
 

6227
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,229
is what
like so it does both lane keeping and

6228
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
like so it does both lane keeping and
 

6229
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,070
like so it does both lane keeping and
longitudinal control

6230
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,080
longitudinal control
 

6231
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,750
longitudinal control
all together so it's not separate like

6232
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:09,760
all together so it's not separate like
 

6233
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,109
all together so it's not separate like
it is an autopilot

6234
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:11,119
it is an autopilot
 

6235
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,990
it is an autopilot
no so okay um some cars we use the stock

6236
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
no so okay um some cars we use the stock
 

6237
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,270
no so okay um some cars we use the stock
longitudinal control we don't do the

6238
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,280
longitudinal control we don't do the
 

6239
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,030
longitudinal control we don't do the
longitudinal control on all the cars

6240
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
longitudinal control on all the cars
 

6241
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,950
longitudinal control on all the cars
uh some cars the acc's are pretty good

6242
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
uh some cars the acc's are pretty good
 

6243
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,310
uh some cars the acc's are pretty good
in the cars it's the lane keep that's

6244
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:20,320
in the cars it's the lane keep that's
 

6245
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,590
in the cars it's the lane keep that's
atrocious in anything except for

6246
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
atrocious in anything except for
 

6247
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,270
atrocious in anything except for
autopilot super cruise

6248
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:23,280
autopilot super cruise
 

6249
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:27,030
autopilot super cruise
but you know you just turn it on and it

6250
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:27,040
but you know you just turn it on and it
 

6251
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,950
but you know you just turn it on and it
it works what does this engagement look

6252
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:28,960
it works what does this engagement look
 

6253
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,270
it works what does this engagement look
like yeah so we have i mean i'm very

6254
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:31,280
like yeah so we have i mean i'm very
 

6255
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,790
like yeah so we have i mean i'm very
concerned about mode confusion

6256
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
concerned about mode confusion
 

6257
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,990
concerned about mode confusion
i've experienced it on supercruise and

6258
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
i've experienced it on supercruise and
 

6259
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,270
i've experienced it on supercruise and
and autopilot where

6260
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,280
and autopilot where
 

6261
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,669
and autopilot where
like autopilot like autopilot disengages

6262
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679
like autopilot like autopilot disengages
 

6263
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,229
like autopilot like autopilot disengages
i don't realize that the acc is still on

6264
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
i don't realize that the acc is still on
 

6265
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,629
i don't realize that the acc is still on
the lead car moves slightly over and

6266
01:44:44,629 --> 01:44:44,639
the lead car moves slightly over and
 

6267
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,310
the lead car moves slightly over and
then the tesla accelerates to like

6268
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
then the tesla accelerates to like
 

6269
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,990
then the tesla accelerates to like
whatever my set speed is super fast and

6270
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,000
whatever my set speed is super fast and
 

6271
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,470
whatever my set speed is super fast and
like

6272
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
like
 

6273
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,830
like
what's going on here um we have

6274
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
what's going on here um we have
 

6275
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,070
what's going on here um we have
engaged and disengaged and this is

6276
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
engaged and disengaged and this is
 

6277
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,830
engaged and disengaged and this is
similar to my understanding i'm not a

6278
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:55,840
similar to my understanding i'm not a
 

6279
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,750
similar to my understanding i'm not a
pilot but my understanding is either the

6280
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:57,760
pilot but my understanding is either the
 

6281
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,870
pilot but my understanding is either the
pilot

6282
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,880
pilot
 

6283
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,109

and we have the same kind of transition

6288
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
and we have the same kind of transition
 

6289
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,870
and we have the same kind of transition
system either open pilot is engaged or

6290
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
system either open pilot is engaged or
 

6291
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,470
system either open pilot is engaged or
open pilot is disengaged

6292

01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
hundred dollars so comma three is in the
 

6339
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,390
hundred dollars so comma three is in the
works

hardware is going to cost a lot more
 

6345
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:02,790
hardware is going to cost a lot more
than the current hardware

6346
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:02,800
than the current hardware
 

6347
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,109
than the current hardware
yeah like i mean the people that use uh

like like it's you know so whatever you
create that's beyond comma two

create that's beyond comma two
 

6381
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,510
create that's beyond comma two
it would be uh it would be potentially a

6382
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
it would be uh it would be potentially a
 

6383
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,629
it would be uh it would be potentially a

phase shift
 

6385
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,629
phase shift
like it's you it's so much better that

6386
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:42,639
like it's you it's so much better that
 

6387
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,550

versus hardware two yeah the comma two
 

6399
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,070
versus hardware two yeah the comma two
is kind of like hardware one got it got

6400
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:54,080
is kind of like hardware one got it got
 

6401
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,030
is kind of like hardware one got it got
it

6402

got it got it i think i heard you talk
about retention rate with the

6406
01:46:58,629 --> 01:46:58,639
about retention rate with the
 

6407
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,629
about retention rate with the
vr headsets that the average is just

6408
01:47:00,629 --> 01:47:00,639
vr headsets that the average is just
 

6409
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,870
vr headsets that the average is just
once yeah which is fast i mean it's such

6410
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
once yeah which is fast i mean it's such
 

6411
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,390
once yeah which is fast i mean it's such
a fascinating way to think about

6412
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:04,400
a fascinating way to think about
 

6413
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,669
a fascinating way to think about
technology

6414
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:05,679
technology
 

6415
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:07,350
technology
and this is a really really good sign

6416
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:07,360
and this is a really really good sign
 

6417

and the other thing that people say
about comm is like they can't believe

6420
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:09,760
about comm is like they can't believe
 

6421
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,030
about comm is like they can't believe
they're getting this for a thousand

6422
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
they're getting this for a thousand
 

6423
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:11,910
they're getting this for a thousand
bucks

6424
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:11,920
bucks
 

6425
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,790
bucks
right it's it seems it seems like a some

6426
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800
right it's it seems it seems like a some
 

6427
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,950
right it's it seems it seems like a some
kind of steal

6428
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:16,960
kind of steal
 

6429
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,030
kind of steal
so but in terms of like long-term

6430
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:19,040
so but in terms of like long-term
 

6431
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,270
so but in terms of like long-term
business strategies it basically to

6432
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:21,280
business strategies it basically to
 

6433
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,990
business strategies it basically to
put so it's currently in like a thousand

6434
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
put so it's currently in like a thousand
 

6435
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,430
put so it's currently in like a thousand
plus cars

6436
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,440

 

6437
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,550

stopped
 

6449
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,390
stopped
is the goal like can we talk crazy for a

6450
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400

autopilot you could argue is in alpha in
 

6469
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,629
autopilot you could argue is in alpha in
terms of

6470
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:04,639
terms of
 

6471
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:06,390

i think open pilot at some point
will cross over autopilot in in users

6492
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
will cross over autopilot in in users
 

6493
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,030

money yeah yeah you know
if you have if you look at a model when

6610
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
if you have if you look at a model when
 

6611
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,149
if you have if you look at a model when
we were just talking about this

6612
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:26,159
we were just talking about this
 

6613
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:27,430
we were just talking about this
yesterday if you look at a model

6614
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,440
yesterday if you look at a model
 

6615
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,709
yesterday if you look at a model
and like you're testing like you're a b

6616
01:50:28,709 --> 01:50:28,719
and like you're testing like you're a b
 

6617
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,629
and like you're testing like you're a b
testing your model and if you're you're

6618
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
testing your model and if you're you're
 

6619
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:31,109
testing your model and if you're you're
you're

6620
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
you're
 

6621
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:32,950
you're
one branch of the a b test the losses go

6622
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
one branch of the a b test the losses go
 

6623
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,790
one branch of the a b test the losses go
down very fast in the first five epochs

6624
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:34,800
down very fast in the first five epochs
 

6625
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,189
down very fast in the first five epochs
yeah

6626
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:35,199
yeah
 

6627
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,510
yeah
that model is probably going to converge

6628
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:37,520
that model is probably going to converge
 

6629
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:38,950
that model is probably going to converge
to something considerably better than

6630
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
to something considerably better than
 

6631
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,149
to something considerably better than
the one where the losses are going down

6632
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
the one where the losses are going down
 

6633
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:41,270
the one where the losses are going down
slower

6634
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
slower
 

6635
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,470
slower
why do people think this is going to

6636
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:42,480
why do people think this is going to
 

6637
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,149
why do people think this is going to
stop why do people think one day there's

6638
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
stop why do people think one day there's
 

6639
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,510
stop why do people think one day there's
going to be a great like

6640
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
going to be a great like
 

6641
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,589
going to be a great like
well waymo's eventually going to surpass

6642
01:50:47,589 --> 01:50:47,599
well waymo's eventually going to surpass
 

6643
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,430
well waymo's eventually going to surpass
you guys

6644
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:49,440
you guys
 

6645
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,950
you guys
no they're not you see like a world

6646
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
no they're not you see like a world
 

6647
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,669
no they're not you see like a world
where like

6648
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
where like
 

6649
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,870
where like
a tesla or a car like a tesla would be

6650
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:56,880
a tesla or a car like a tesla would be
 

6651
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,270
a tesla or a car like a tesla would be
able to

6652
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,280
able to
 

6653
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,750
able to
basically press a button and you like

6654
01:50:59,750 --> 01:50:59,760
basically press a button and you like
 

6655
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,910
basically press a button and you like
switch to open pilot

6656
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:01,920
switch to open pilot
 

6657
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,470
switch to open pilot
you know you know they load in i don't

6658
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:04,480
you know you know they load in i don't
 

6659
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,189
you know you know they load in i don't
know so

6660
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
know so
 

6661
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:07,270
know so
i think so first off i think that we may

6662
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:07,280
i think so first off i think that we may
 

6663
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,550
i think so first off i think that we may
surpass tesla

6664
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,560
surpass tesla
 

6665
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,189
surpass tesla
in terms of users uh i do not think

6666
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:11,199
in terms of users uh i do not think
 

6667
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:12,709
in terms of users uh i do not think
we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms

6668
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms
 

6669
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:13,350
we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms
of revenue

6670
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:13,360
of revenue
 

6671
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,790
of revenue
i think tesla can capture a lot more

6672
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:14,800
i think tesla can capture a lot more
 

6673
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,950
i think tesla can capture a lot more
revenue per user than we can

6674
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:16,960
revenue per user than we can
 

6675
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,669
revenue per user than we can
um but this mimics the android ios model

6676
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
um but this mimics the android ios model
 

6677
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:20,390
um but this mimics the android ios model
exactly

6678
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
exactly
 

6679
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,149
exactly
there may be more android devices but

6680
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:22,159
there may be more android devices but
 

6681
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,270
there may be more android devices but
you know there's a lot more iphones than

6682
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
you know there's a lot more iphones than
 

6683
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,149
you know there's a lot more iphones than
google pixels

6684
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
google pixels
 

6685
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:25,669
google pixels
so i think there'll be a lot more tesla

6686
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679
so i think there'll be a lot more tesla
 

6687
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,629
so i think there'll be a lot more tesla
cars sold than pieces of comma hardware

6688
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:28,639
cars sold than pieces of comma hardware
 

6689
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,870
cars sold than pieces of comma hardware
um and then as far as a

6690
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
um and then as far as a
 

6691
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,270
um and then as far as a
tesla owner being able to switch to open

6692
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
tesla owner being able to switch to open
 

6693
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,149
tesla owner being able to switch to open

6694
01:51:36,149 --> 01:51:36,159

6695
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:40,950
pilot
uh does ios does iphones run android

6696
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:40,960
uh does ios does iphones run android
 

6697
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,270
uh does ios does iphones run android
no but you can if you really want to do

6698
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,280
no but you can if you really want to do
 

6699
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,470
no but you can if you really want to do
it but it doesn't really make sense like

6700
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
it but it doesn't really make sense like
 

6701
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,189

01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:46,800
it doesn't make sense who cares what
 

6705
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,310
it doesn't make sense who cares what

01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,629
after i've written in it to me it's not
zero oh it's not for technology reasons

6932
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
zero oh it's not for technology reasons
 

6933
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,510
zero oh it's not for technology reasons
bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's

6934
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:49,520
bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's
 

6935
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,910
bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's
actually for product reasons i think

6936
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:51,920
actually for product reasons i think
 

6937
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,430
actually for product reasons i think
oh you think they're just not capable of

6938
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:53,440
oh you think they're just not capable of
 

6939
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,669
oh you think they're just not capable of
creating an amazing product uh

6940
01:55:55,669 --> 01:55:55,679
creating an amazing product uh
 

6941
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,109
creating an amazing product uh
no i think that the product that they're

6942
01:55:57,109 --> 01:55:57,119
no i think that the product that they're
 

6943
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:00,390
no i think that the product that they're
building doesn't make sense

6944
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:00,400
building doesn't make sense
 

6945
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,070
building doesn't make sense
um so a few things uh you say the weimos

6946
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:04,080
um so a few things uh you say the weimos
 

6947
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,030
um so a few things uh you say the weimos
are fast

6948
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
are fast
 

6949
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,910
are fast
um benchmark away mo against a competent

6950
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:07,920
um benchmark away mo against a competent
 

6951
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,030
um benchmark away mo against a competent
uber driver

6952
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
uber driver
 

6953
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,030
uber driver
right right the uber driver is faster

6954
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
right right the uber driver is faster
 

6955
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,550
right right the uber driver is faster
it's not even about speed it's the thing

6956
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:12,560
it's not even about speed it's the thing
 

6957
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,030
it's not even about speed it's the thing
you said

6958
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:13,040
you said
 

6959
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,030
you said
it's about the experience of being stuck

6960
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:15,040
it's about the experience of being stuck
 

6961
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,149
it's about the experience of being stuck
at a stop sign

6962
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
at a stop sign
 

6963
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,990
at a stop sign
because pedestrians are crossing

6964
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:18,000
because pedestrians are crossing
 

6965
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,070
because pedestrians are crossing
non-stop

6966
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,080
non-stop
 

6967
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,510
non-stop
i like when my uber driver doesn't come

6968
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:21,520
i like when my uber driver doesn't come
 

6969
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,430
i like when my uber driver doesn't come
to a full stop at the stop sign yeah

6970
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:23,440
to a full stop at the stop sign yeah
 

6971
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:27,350
to a full stop at the stop sign yeah
you know and so

6972
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:27,360
you know and so
 

6973
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,990
you know and so
let's say the waymo's are 20 slower than

6974
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:30,000
let's say the waymo's are 20 slower than
 

6975
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,189
let's say the waymo's are 20 slower than
than an uber

6976
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
than an uber
 

6977
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,750
than an uber
right um you can argue they're going to

6978
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:33,760
right um you can argue they're going to
 

6979
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:34,870
right um you can argue they're going to
be cheaper

6980
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:34,880
be cheaper
 

6981
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,950
be cheaper
and i argue that users already have the

6982
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:36,960
and i argue that users already have the
 

6983
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,189
and i argue that users already have the
choice to trade off money for speed

6984
01:56:39,189 --> 01:56:39,199
choice to trade off money for speed
 

6985
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:42,629
choice to trade off money for speed
it's called uberpool um i think it's

6986
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
it's called uberpool um i think it's
 

6987
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,430
it's called uberpool um i think it's
like 15

6988
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,440
like 15
 

6989
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,470
like 15
of rides or uber pools right users are

6990
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:46,480
of rides or uber pools right users are
 

6991
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:47,910
of rides or uber pools right users are
not willing to trade off

6992
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:47,920
not willing to trade off
 

6993
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,470
not willing to trade off
money for speed so the whole product

6994
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:50,480
money for speed so the whole product
 

6995
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,229
money for speed so the whole product
that they're building

6996
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
that they're building
 

6997
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:55,030
that they're building
is not going to be competitive with

6998
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:55,040
is not going to be competitive with
 

6999
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,709
is not going to be competitive with
traditional ride sharing networks

7000
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:56,719
traditional ride sharing networks
 

7001
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:02,229
traditional ride sharing networks
right um like and also

7002
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:02,239

 

7003
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,229

whether there's profit to be made

7004
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:04,239
whether there's profit to be made
 

7005
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,310
whether there's profit to be made
depends entirely on one company having a

7006
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
depends entirely on one company having a
 

7007
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,270
depends entirely on one company having a
monopoly

7008
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
monopoly
 

7009
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,629
monopoly
i think that the level for autonomous

7010
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
i think that the level for autonomous
 

7011
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,070
i think that the level for autonomous

7012
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
ride sharing vehicles
 

7013
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,510
ride sharing vehicles
market is going to look a lot like the

7014
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:13,520
market is going to look a lot like the
 

7015
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,990
market is going to look a lot like the
scooter market if even the technology

7016
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,000
scooter market if even the technology
 

7017
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,470
scooter market if even the technology
does come to exist which i question

7018
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
does come to exist which i question
 

7019
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,310
does come to exist which i question
who's doing well in that market yeah

7020
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
who's doing well in that market yeah
 

7021
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,750
who's doing well in that market yeah
it's a race to the bottom

7022
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:21,760
it's a race to the bottom
 

7023
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,750
it's a race to the bottom
you know well they could be it could be

7024
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:23,760
you know well they could be it could be
 

7025
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,589
you know well they could be it could be
closer like an uber and a lyft

7026
01:57:25,589 --> 01:57:25,599
closer like an uber and a lyft
 

7027
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:27,910
closer like an uber and a lyft
where it's just a one or two players

7028
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:27,920
where it's just a one or two players
 

7029
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,709
where it's just a one or two players
well

7030
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:28,719
well
 

7031
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:31,510
well
the scooter people have given up trying

7032
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:31,520
the scooter people have given up trying
 

7033
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,950
the scooter people have given up trying
to market scooters

7034
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:32,960
to market scooters
 

7035
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:35,350
to market scooters
as a practical means of transportation

7036
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:35,360
as a practical means of transportation
 

7037
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,149
as a practical means of transportation
and they're just like

7038
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:36,159
and they're just like
 

7039
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,310
and they're just like
they're super fun to ride look at wheels

7040
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:38,320
they're super fun to ride look at wheels
 

7041

about you know end to end versus segnets
 

7091
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,830
about you know end to end versus segnets
like that's just software who cares

7092
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:29,840
like that's just software who cares
 

7093
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:30,470
like that's just software who cares
right

7094
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
right
 

7095
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,550
right
like it's not gonna it's not like you're

7096
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:32,560
like it's not gonna it's not like you're
 

7097
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,310
like it's not gonna it's not like you're
doing something terrible with segnats

7098
01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:34,320
doing something terrible with segnats
 

7099
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,350
doing something terrible with segnats
you're probably building something

7100
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:35,360
you're probably building something
 

7101
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,629
you're probably building something
that's at least going to help you debug

7102
01:58:36,629 --> 01:58:36,639
that's at least going to help you debug
 

7103
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:38,470
that's at least going to help you debug
the end-to-end system a lot

7104
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:38,480
the end-to-end system a lot
 

7105
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:41,030
the end-to-end system a lot
right it's very easy to transition from

7106
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
right it's very easy to transition from
 

7107
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,149
right it's very easy to transition from
what they have

7108
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:42,159
what they have
 

7109
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:45,830
what they have
to like an end-to-end kind of thing

7110
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
to like an end-to-end kind of thing
 

7111
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,189
to like an end-to-end kind of thing
and then i presume you would uh

7112
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:49,199
and then i presume you would uh
 

7113
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:51,510
and then i presume you would uh
in the model y or maybe in the model 3

7114
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
in the model y or maybe in the model 3
 

7115
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,950
in the model y or maybe in the model 3

infrared yes i would add i would

7118
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:54,880
infrared yes i would add i would
 

7119
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,510
infrared yes i would add i would
i would add infrared camera infrared

7120
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:57,520
i would add infrared camera infrared
 

7121

right away to those cars um
 

7125
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:03,910
right away to those cars um
and start collecting that data and do

7126
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:03,920
and start collecting that data and do
 

7127
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,510
and start collecting that data and do
all that kind of stuff yeah

7128

okay so let's try let's like really try
this experiment if you ran

7210
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
this experiment if you ran
 

7211
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,830
this experiment if you ran
way more let's say they're i don't know

7212
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:19,840
way more let's say they're i don't know
 

7213
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:20,870
way more let's say they're i don't know
if you agree but

7214
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:20,880
if you agree but
 

7215
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,470
if you agree but
they seem to be at the head of the pack

7216
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:22,480
they seem to be at the head of the pack
 

7217

they seem to be at the head of the pack
of the kind of

02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:24,800
of the kind of
 

7219
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,950
of the kind of
uh what would you call that approach

7220
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:26,960
uh what would you call that approach
 

7221
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,870
uh what would you call that approach
like it's not necessarily lighter based

7222
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:28,880
like it's not necessarily lighter based
 

7223
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,229
like it's not necessarily lighter based
because it's not about lighter but

7224
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:30,239
because it's not about lighter but
 

7225

um let's try to break that apart
why do you do you want to make do you

7250
02:00:59,910 --> 02:00:59,920
why do you do you want to make do you
 

7251
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,350
why do you do you want to make do you
want to destroy the company by doing

7252
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:01,360
want to destroy the company by doing
 

7253
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:01,910
want to destroy the company by doing
that or

7254
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
that or
 

7255
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,350
that or
do you mean or do you mean uh you like

7256
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,360
do you mean or do you mean uh you like
 

7257
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:09,430
do you mean or do you mean uh you like
renegade style thinking that uh pushes

7258
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
renegade style thinking that uh pushes
 

7259
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,270
renegade style thinking that uh pushes
that that like throws away bureaucracy

7260
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:11,280
that that like throws away bureaucracy
 

7261
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,550
that that like throws away bureaucracy
and goes to first principle thinking

7262
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,560
and goes to first principle thinking
 

7263
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:12,950
and goes to first principle thinking
what

7264
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:12,960
what
 

7265
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,229
what
what do you mean by that um i think

7266
02:01:14,229 --> 02:01:14,239
what do you mean by that um i think
 

7267
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,070
what do you mean by that um i think
anthony lewandowski is a genius

7268
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:16,080
anthony lewandowski is a genius
 

7269
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,550
anthony lewandowski is a genius
and i think he would come up with a much

7270
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:18,560
and i think he would come up with a much
 

7271
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,390
and i think he would come up with a much
better idea of what to do with waymo

7272
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400
better idea of what to do with waymo

02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,589
autonomous driving in and of itself it's
what the technology enables

7566
02:06:09,589 --> 02:06:09,599

 

7567
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:11,350

it's i think it's the coolest applied ai

7568
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:11,360
it's i think it's the coolest applied ai
 

7569
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,069
it's i think it's the coolest applied ai
problem i like it because it has a clear

7570
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
problem i like it because it has a clear
 

7571
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:17,589
problem i like it because it has a clear
path to monetary value um

7572
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:17,599
path to monetary value um
 

7573
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,750
path to monetary value um
but as far as that being the thing that

7574
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:19,760
but as far as that being the thing that
 

7575
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,270
but as far as that being the thing that
changes the world

7576
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:21,280
changes the world
 

7577
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:24,709
changes the world
i mean no like like there's cute things

7578
02:06:24,709 --> 02:06:24,719
i mean no like like there's cute things
 

7579
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:25,830
i mean no like like there's cute things
we're doing in common like who thought

7580
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:25,840
we're doing in common like who thought
 

7581
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:26,550
we're doing in common like who thought
you could stick a

7582
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:26,560
you could stick a
 

7583
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,870
you could stick a
phone on the windshield middle drive um

7584
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:28,880
phone on the windshield middle drive um
 

7585
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,550
phone on the windshield middle drive um
but like really the product that you're

7586
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:30,560
but like really the product that you're
 

7587
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:31,750
but like really the product that you're
building is not

7588
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:31,760
building is not
 

7589
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,750
building is not
something that people were not capable

7590
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:33,760
something that people were not capable
 

7591
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,510
something that people were not capable
of imagining 50 years ago

7592
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
of imagining 50 years ago
 

7593
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,709
of imagining 50 years ago
so no it doesn't change the world in

7594
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
so no it doesn't change the world in
 

7595
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:38,470
so no it doesn't change the world in
that front could people imagine the

7596
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:38,480
that front could people imagine the
 

7597
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,470
that front could people imagine the
internet 50 years ago only true

7598

right
 

7619
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,669
right
and there's different trajectories

7620
02:07:01,669 --> 02:07:01,679
and there's different trajectories
 

7621
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,510
and there's different trajectories
towards that

7622
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:03,520
towards that
 

7623
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,270
towards that
and i've been thinking so i've been

i see autonomous vehicles as a potential
 

7629
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,109
i see autonomous vehicles as a potential
trajectory to that that

7630

trajectory to that that
 

7631
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:15,669
trajectory to that that
i'm that's not where the direction i

7632
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:15,679
i'm that's not where the direction i
 

7633
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:16,790
i'm that's not where the direction i
would like to go but

mean
 

7715
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,270
mean
that's an amazing combination but that

7716
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:37,280
that's an amazing combination but that
 

7717
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,390
that's an amazing combination but that
wasn't really why

7718

wasn't really why
 

7719
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,470
wasn't really why
that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm

7720
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:40,480
that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm
 

7721
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,990
that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm
was an afterthought qualcomm was it was

7722
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
was an afterthought qualcomm was it was
 

7723
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,950
was an afterthought qualcomm was it was

maybe there's ways to spin it like with
 

8535
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,870
maybe there's ways to spin it like with
with uh giving

8536
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:40,880
with uh giving
 

8537
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:42,550
with uh giving
a lot more control to the user and

8538
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:42,560
a lot more control to the user and
 

8539
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:44,309
a lot more control to the user and
transparency to see what is happening to

8540
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
transparency to see what is happening to
 

8541
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:45,429
transparency to see what is happening to
them as opposed to

them as opposed to
 

8543
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:47,510
them as opposed to
in the shadows as possible but that

8544
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:47,520
in the shadows as possible but that
 

8545
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:49,270
in the shadows as possible but that
can't be the primary source of

8546
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:49,280
can't be the primary source of
 

8547
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:50,389
can't be the primary source of
but the users aren't no one's going to

8548
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
but the users aren't no one's going to
 

8549
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:52,469
but the users aren't no one's going to
use that it depends

8550
02:22:52,469 --> 02:22:52,479
use that it depends
 

8551
02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:54,550
use that it depends
it depends it depends i think i think

8552

that the you're
 

8555
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:58,389
that the you're
you're not going to you can't depend on

you're not going to you can't depend on
 

8557
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,070
you're not going to you can't depend on
self-awareness of the users

8558
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,080
self-awareness of the users
 

8559
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,670
self-awareness of the users
it's a it's another it's a longer

8560
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:01,680
it's a it's another it's a longer
 

8561
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:03,110
it's a it's another it's a longer
discussion because uh

8562
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:03,120
discussion because uh
 

8563
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,150
discussion because uh
you can't depend on it but

8564
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,160
you can't depend on it but
 

8565
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,750
you can't depend on it but
you can reward self-awareness

8566
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:09,760
you can reward self-awareness
 

8567
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,510
you can reward self-awareness
like if for the ones who are willing to

8568
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:11,520
like if for the ones who are willing to
 

8569
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,510
like if for the ones who are willing to
put in the work of self-awareness

8570
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:13,520
put in the work of self-awareness
 

8571
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:16,070
put in the work of self-awareness
you can reward them and incentivize and

8572
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:16,080
you can reward them and incentivize and
 

8573
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,150
you can reward them and incentivize and
perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many

and i had to turn my car around i

9012
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:16,800
and i had to turn my car around i
 

9013
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:17,990
and i had to turn my car around i
couldn't i watched

9014

i watched a f-150 go off the road i'm
 

9017
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:23,190
i watched a f-150 go off the road i'm
like i gotta go back and

9018
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:23,200
like i gotta go back and
 

9019
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,710
like i gotta go back and
like that day was meaningful because

9020
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
like that day was meaningful because
 

9021
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,550
like that day was meaningful because
like like it was real like i actually

9022
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
like like it was real like i actually
 

9023
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,469
like like it was real like i actually
had to turn my car around

9024
02:30:28,469 --> 02:30:28,479
had to turn my car around
 

9025
02:30:28,479 --> 02:30:30,070
had to turn my car around
um it's rare that anything even real

9026
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:30,080
um it's rare that anything even real
 

9027
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,750
um it's rare that anything even real
happens in my life even as

9028
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:31,760
happens in my life even as
 

9029
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:34,309
happens in my life even as
you know mundane is the fact that yeah

9030
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
you know mundane is the fact that yeah
 

9031
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,030
you know mundane is the fact that yeah
there was snow

9032
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:35,040
there was snow
 

9033
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:36,710
there was snow
i had to turn around stay in gunnison

9034
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:36,720
i had to turn around stay in gunnison
 

9035
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,070
i had to turn around stay in gunnison
and leave the next day something about

9036
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:38,080
and leave the next day something about
 

9037
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:38,790
and leave the next day something about
that moment for

9038
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:38,800
that moment for
 

9039
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:42,309
that moment for
real okay so actually it's interesting

9040
02:30:42,309 --> 02:30:42,319
real okay so actually it's interesting
 

9041
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:43,830
real okay so actually it's interesting
to break apart the three moments you

9042
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
to break apart the three moments you
 

9043
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,550
to break apart the three moments you
mentioned

9044
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:44,560
mentioned
 

9045
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:47,670
mentioned
if it's okay so uh i always have trouble

9046
02:30:47,670 --> 02:30:47,680
if it's okay so uh i always have trouble
 

9047
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,030
if it's okay so uh i always have trouble
pronouncing his name but

9048
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
pronouncing his name but
 

9049
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:53,190
pronouncing his name but
allows yakowski yeah

9050
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:53,200

 

9051
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:56,389

so what how did your

9052
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:56,399
so what how did your
 

9053
02:30:56,399 --> 02:30:59,349
so what how did your
world view change in starting to

9054
02:30:59,349 --> 02:30:59,359
world view change in starting to
 

9055
02:30:59,359 --> 02:30:59,990
world view change in starting to
consider

9056
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:00,000
consider
 

9057
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,429
consider
the the exponential growth of ai and agi

9058
02:31:03,429 --> 02:31:03,439
the the exponential growth of ai and agi
 

9059
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:03,750
the the exponential growth of ai and agi
that

9060
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:03,760
that
 

9061
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:06,309
that
he thinks about and the the the threats

9062
02:31:06,309 --> 02:31:06,319
he thinks about and the the the threats
 

9063
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,830
he thinks about and the the the threats
of artificial intelligence and all that

9064
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:07,840
of artificial intelligence and all that
 

9065
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,270
of artificial intelligence and all that
kind of ideas like

9066
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280
kind of ideas like
 

9067
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,830
kind of ideas like
can you is it j like can you maybe uh

9068
02:31:11,830 --> 02:31:11,840
can you is it j like can you maybe uh
 

9069
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:13,510
can you is it j like can you maybe uh
break apart like what

9070
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:13,520
break apart like what
 

9071
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,830
break apart like what
exactly was so magical to use a

9072
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:15,840
exactly was so magical to use a
 

9073
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,270
exactly was so magical to use a
transformational experience

9074
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:17,280
transformational experience
 

9075
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:18,950
transformational experience
today everyone knows him for threats and

9076
02:31:18,950 --> 02:31:18,960
today everyone knows him for threats and
 

9077
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:21,270
today everyone knows him for threats and
ai safety um this was pre

9078
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:21,280
ai safety um this was pre
 

9079
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:22,950
ai safety um this was pre
that stuff there was i don't think a

9080
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:22,960
that stuff there was i don't think a
 

9081
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:25,270
that stuff there was i don't think a
mention of ai safety on the page

9082
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:25,280
mention of ai safety on the page
 

9083
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,750
mention of ai safety on the page
um this is this is old yukowski stuff

9084
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:27,760
um this is this is old yukowski stuff
 

9085
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,110
um this is this is old yukowski stuff
he'd probably denounce it all now he'd

9086
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,120
he'd probably denounce it all now he'd
 

9087
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:30,630
he'd probably denounce it all now he'd
probably be like that's exactly what i

9088
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:30,640
probably be like that's exactly what i
 

9089
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:31,910
probably be like that's exactly what i
didn't want to happen

9090
02:31:31,910 --> 02:31:31,920
didn't want to happen
 

9091
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:35,270
didn't want to happen
well sorry man

9092
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280

 

9093
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,710

is there something specific you can take

9094
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:36,720
is there something specific you can take
 

9095
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,630
is there something specific you can take
from his work that you can remember

9096
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640
from his work that you can remember
 

9097
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:42,309
from his work that you can remember
yeah uh it was this realization that

9098
02:31:42,309 --> 02:31:42,319
yeah uh it was this realization that
 

9099
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:45,270
yeah uh it was this realization that
uh computers double in power every 18

9100
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:45,280
uh computers double in power every 18
 

9101
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:45,910
uh computers double in power every 18
months

9102
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:45,920
months
 

9103
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,110
months
and humans do not and they haven't

9104
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:49,120
and humans do not and they haven't
 

9105
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,070
and humans do not and they haven't
crossed yet

9106
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,080
crossed yet
 

9107
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:51,429
crossed yet
but if you have one thing that's

9108
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
but if you have one thing that's
 

9109
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:53,110
but if you have one thing that's
doubling every 18 months and one thing

9110
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:53,120
doubling every 18 months and one thing
 

9111
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,710
doubling every 18 months and one thing
that's staying like this

9112
02:31:54,710 --> 02:31:54,720
that's staying like this
 

9113
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:57,110
that's staying like this
you know here's your log graph here's

9114
02:31:57,110 --> 02:31:57,120
you know here's your log graph here's
 

9115
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:58,070
you know here's your log graph here's
your line

9116
02:31:58,070 --> 02:31:58,080
your line
 

9117
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:01,910
your line
you know you calculate that

9118
02:32:01,910 --> 02:32:01,920

 

9119
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,750

and that did that open the door to the

9120
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:03,760
and that did that open the door to the
 

9121
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:05,110
and that did that open the door to the
exponential thinking

9122
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
exponential thinking
 

9123
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,790
exponential thinking
like thinking that like you know what

9124
02:32:06,790 --> 02:32:06,800
like thinking that like you know what
 

9125
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:09,910
like thinking that like you know what
with technology we can actually

9126
02:32:09,910 --> 02:32:09,920
with technology we can actually
 

9127
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:11,429
with technology we can actually
transformed the world

9128
02:32:11,429 --> 02:32:11,439
transformed the world
 

9129
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:13,670
transformed the world
it opened the door to human obsolescence

9130
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:13,680
it opened the door to human obsolescence
 

9131
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:15,830
it opened the door to human obsolescence
it opened the door to realize that in my

9132
02:32:15,830 --> 02:32:15,840
it opened the door to realize that in my
 

9133
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,110
it opened the door to realize that in my
lifetime

9134
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120
lifetime
 

9135
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:20,550
lifetime
humans are going to be replaced

9136
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:20,560
humans are going to be replaced
 

9137
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:22,550
humans are going to be replaced
and then the matching idea to that of

9138
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:22,560
and then the matching idea to that of
 

9139
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:24,150
and then the matching idea to that of
artificial intelligence with the hutter

9140
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,160
artificial intelligence with the hutter
 

9141
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:26,950
artificial intelligence with the hutter
prize

9142
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:26,960

 

9143
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:29,110

you know i'm torn i go back and forth on

9144
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:29,120
you know i'm torn i go back and forth on
 

9145
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:30,150
you know i'm torn i go back and forth on
what i think about it

9146
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:30,160
what i think about it
 

9147
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:33,510
what i think about it
yeah but the the the basic thesis

9148
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:33,520
yeah but the the the basic thesis
 

9149
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,190
yeah but the the the basic thesis
is it's nice to com it's a nice

9150
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:35,200
is it's nice to com it's a nice
 

9151
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,550
is it's nice to com it's a nice
compelling notion that

9152
02:32:36,550 --> 02:32:36,560
compelling notion that
 

9153
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,309
compelling notion that
we can reduce the task of creating an

9154
02:32:38,309 --> 02:32:38,319
we can reduce the task of creating an
 

9155
02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:40,070
we can reduce the task of creating an
intelligent system a general

02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,389
intelligence system
into the task of compression so you can

9160
02:32:44,389 --> 02:32:44,399
into the task of compression so you can
 

9161
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:45,750
into the task of compression so you can
think of all of intelligence in the

9162
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:45,760
think of all of intelligence in the
 

9163
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:46,790
think of all of intelligence in the
universe in fact

as a kind of compression

9166
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:50,080
as a kind of compression
 

9167
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:52,070
as a kind of compression
do you find that was that just at the

9168
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:52,080
do you find that was that just at the
 

9169
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,830
do you find that was that just at the
time you found that as a compelling idea

9170
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:53,840
time you found that as a compelling idea
 

9171
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:54,870
time you found that as a compelling idea
do you still find that

9172
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:54,880
do you still find that
 

9173
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:57,590
do you still find that
a compelling idea i still find that

9174
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:57,600
a compelling idea i still find that
 

9175
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,790
a compelling idea i still find that

9177
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,190

um i think that it's not that useful day

9178
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:01,200
um i think that it's not that useful day
 

9179

but actually um one of maybe my quests

9182
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
but actually um one of maybe my quests
 

9183
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,110
but actually um one of maybe my quests
before that was a search for the

02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:07,120
before that was a search for the
 

9185
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:09,110
before that was a search for the
definition of the word intelligence

definition of the word intelligence
 

9187
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,230

02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:12,240
and i never had one and i definitely
 

9189
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,190
and i never had one and i definitely
have a definition of the word

9190
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:13,200
have a definition of the word
 

9191
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,550
have a definition of the word

compression
 

9193
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:17,349
compression
it's a very uh simple uh straightforward

9194
02:33:17,349 --> 02:33:17,359
it's a very uh simple uh straightforward
 

9195
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:18,309
it's a very uh simple uh straightforward

9196
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:18,319

and uh you know what confession is you

9198
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:19,680
and uh you know what confession is you
 

9199
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,630
and uh you know what confession is you
know what lossless is lossless

9200
02:33:20,630 --> 02:33:20,640
know what lossless is lossless
 

9201
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:21,830

9205
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:24,950

and that that is equivalent to

9206
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:24,960
and that that is equivalent to
 

9207
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,469
and that that is equivalent to
intelligence which i believe

9208
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:26,479
intelligence which i believe
 

9209
02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:27,910

i'm not sure how useful that definition

9210
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:27,920
i'm not sure how useful that definition
 

9211
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:29,910
i'm not sure how useful that definition
is day to day but like i now have a

9212
02:33:29,910 --> 02:33:29,920
is day to day but like i now have a
 

9213
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,150
is day to day but like i now have a
framework to understand what it is

9214
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,160

02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:39,120
you ever thought of taking a crack at
 

9223
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:40,870
you ever thought of taking a crack at
that oh i did

9224
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:40,880
that oh i did
 

9225
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,830
that oh i did
oh i did i spent i spent the next after

02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:45,840
i found the prize i spent the next
 

9229
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,469
i found the prize i spent the next
six months of my life trying it and uh

9230
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:48,479
six months of my life trying it and uh
 

9231
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:49,670
six months of my life trying it and uh
well that's when i started learning

9232
02:33:49,670 --> 02:33:49,680
well that's when i started learning
 

9233
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,710
well that's when i started learning
everything about

9234
02:33:50,710 --> 02:33:50,720
everything about
 

9235
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:53,190
everything about
ai and then i worked vicarious for a bit

9236
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:53,200
ai and then i worked vicarious for a bit
 

9237
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,150
ai and then i worked vicarious for a bit
and then i learned

9238
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
and then i learned
 

9239
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:55,349
and then i learned
read all the deep learning stuff and i'm

9240
02:33:55,349 --> 02:33:55,359
read all the deep learning stuff and i'm
 

9241
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:57,030
read all the deep learning stuff and i'm
like okay now i like i'm called up to

9242
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,040
like okay now i like i'm called up to
 

9243
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:58,309
like okay now i like i'm called up to
modern ai

9244

modern ai
 

9245
02:33:58,319 --> 02:33:59,910
modern ai
wow and i had i had a really good

9246
02:33:59,910 --> 02:33:59,920
wow and i had i had a really good
 

9247
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,590
wow and i had i had a really good
framework to put it all in from the

02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:01,600
framework to put it all in from the
 

9249
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:03,990

9250
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:04,000
compression stuff
 

9251
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,670
compression stuff
right like some of the first uh some of

9252
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:05,680
right like some of the first uh some of
 

9253
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,030
right like some of the first uh some of
the first deep learning models i played

9254
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:07,040
the first deep learning models i played
 

9255
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:07,750
the first deep learning models i played
with were

9256
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:07,760
with were
 

9257
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:11,349
with were
uh like gpt basically but before

9258
02:34:11,349 --> 02:34:11,359
uh like gpt basically but before
 

9259
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:13,190
uh like gpt basically but before
transformers before it was still

9260
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
transformers before it was still
 

9261
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:16,710
transformers before it was still
uh rnn's to to do uh

9262
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:16,720
uh rnn's to to do uh
 

9263
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:18,790
uh rnn's to to do uh
character prediction but by the way on

9264
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:18,800
character prediction but by the way on
 

9265
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:19,830
character prediction but by the way on
the compression side

9266
02:34:19,830 --> 02:34:19,840
the compression side
 

9267
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:22,790
the compression side
i mean the especially neural networks

9268
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:22,800
i mean the especially neural networks
 

9269
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:24,550
i mean the especially neural networks
what do you make of the lossless

9270
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:24,560
what do you make of the lossless
 

9271
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:27,750
what do you make of the lossless
requirement with the hudder prize so

9272
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:27,760
requirement with the hudder prize so
 

9273
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:30,870
requirement with the hudder prize so
you know human intelligence and neural

9274
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:30,880
you know human intelligence and neural
 

9275
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:32,309
you know human intelligence and neural
networks can probably compress

9276
02:34:32,309 --> 02:34:32,319
networks can probably compress
 

9277
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:35,110
networks can probably compress
stuff pretty well but it would be lossy

9278
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:35,120
stuff pretty well but it would be lossy
 

9279
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,230
stuff pretty well but it would be lossy
it's imperfect

9280
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
it's imperfect
 

9281
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:37,910
it's imperfect
uh you can turn a lossy compressor into

9282
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:37,920
uh you can turn a lossy compressor into
 

9283
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:39,510
uh you can turn a lossy compressor into
a lossless compressor pretty easily

9284
02:34:39,510 --> 02:34:39,520
a lossless compressor pretty easily
 

9285
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:41,110
a lossless compressor pretty easily
using an arithmetic encoder right you

9286
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:41,120
using an arithmetic encoder right you
 

9287
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:42,550
using an arithmetic encoder right you
can take an arithmetic encoder

9288
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:42,560
can take an arithmetic encoder
 

9289
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,630
can take an arithmetic encoder
and you can just encode the noise with

9290
02:34:44,630 --> 02:34:44,640
and you can just encode the noise with
 

9291
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:45,910
and you can just encode the noise with
maximum efficiency

9292
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:45,920
maximum efficiency
 

9293
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:48,309
maximum efficiency
right so even if you can't predict

9294
02:34:48,309 --> 02:34:48,319
right so even if you can't predict
 

9295
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:50,389
right so even if you can't predict
exactly what the next character is

9296
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:50,399
exactly what the next character is
 

9297
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,469
exactly what the next character is
the better a probability distribution

9298
02:34:52,469 --> 02:34:52,479
the better a probability distribution
 

9299
02:34:52,479 --> 02:34:54,150
the better a probability distribution
you can put over the next character

9300
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:54,160
you can put over the next character
 

9301
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,070
you can put over the next character
you can then use an arithmetic encoder

9302
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:56,080
you can then use an arithmetic encoder
 

9303
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,910
you can then use an arithmetic encoder
to uh right you don't have to know

9304
02:34:57,910 --> 02:34:57,920
to uh right you don't have to know
 

9305
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,110
to uh right you don't have to know
whether it's an e or an i

9306
02:34:59,110 --> 02:34:59,120
whether it's an e or an i
 

9307
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:00,710
whether it's an e or an i
you just have to put good probabilities

9308
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,720
you just have to put good probabilities
 

9309
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,870
you just have to put good probabilities
on them and then you know code those

9310
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
on them and then you know code those
 

9311
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,950
on them and then you know code those
and if you have it's a bits of entropy

9312
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:04,960
and if you have it's a bits of entropy
 

9313
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:06,309
and if you have it's a bits of entropy
thing right

9314
02:35:06,309 --> 02:35:06,319
thing right
 

9315
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:07,830
thing right
so let me on that topic could be

9316
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:07,840
so let me on that topic could be
 

9317
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:09,510
so let me on that topic could be
interesting as a little side

9318
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:09,520
interesting as a little side
 

9319
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,670
interesting as a little side

tour what are your thoughts in this year
 

9321
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,429
tour what are your thoughts in this year
about gpt3

9322
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:13,439
about gpt3
 

9323
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:14,950
about gpt3
and these language models and these

9324
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:14,960
and these language models and these
 

9325
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,870
and these language models and these
transformers is there something

9326
02:35:16,870 --> 02:35:16,880
transformers is there something
 

9327
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:17,830
transformers is there something
interesting

9328
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:17,840
interesting
 

9329
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:21,110
interesting
to you as an ai researcher or is there

9330
02:35:21,110 --> 02:35:21,120
to you as an ai researcher or is there
 

9331
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:22,469
to you as an ai researcher or is there
something interesting to you

9332
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:22,479
something interesting to you
 

9333
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:25,270
something interesting to you
as an autonomous vehicle developer nah i

9334
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:25,280
as an autonomous vehicle developer nah i
 

9335
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:26,309
as an autonomous vehicle developer nah i
think uh

9336
02:35:26,309 --> 02:35:26,319
think uh
 

9337
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:27,830
think uh
i think it's overhyped i mean it's not

9338
02:35:27,830 --> 02:35:27,840
i think it's overhyped i mean it's not
 

9339
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,070
i think it's overhyped i mean it's not
like it's cool it's cool for what it is

9340
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:30,080
like it's cool it's cool for what it is
 

9341
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:30,710
like it's cool it's cool for what it is
but no

9342
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:30,720
but no
 

9343
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,230
but no
we're not just going to be able to scale

9344
02:35:32,230 --> 02:35:32,240
we're not just going to be able to scale
 

9345
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,830
we're not just going to be able to scale
up to gpg 12 and get

9346
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:33,840
up to gpg 12 and get
 

9347
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,070
up to gpg 12 and get
general-purpose intelligence like your

9348
02:35:36,070 --> 02:35:36,080
general-purpose intelligence like your
 

9349
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:37,030
general-purpose intelligence like your
loss function

9350
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,040
loss function
 

9351
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,429
loss function
is literally just you know you know

9352
02:35:39,429 --> 02:35:39,439
is literally just you know you know
 

9353
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:41,110
is literally just you know you know
cross-entropy loss on the character

9354
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:41,120
cross-entropy loss on the character
 

9355
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:42,469
cross-entropy loss on the character
right like that's not the loss function

9356
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
right like that's not the loss function
 

9357
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:44,710
right like that's not the loss function
of general intelligence

9358
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:44,720
of general intelligence
 

9359
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:47,750
of general intelligence
is that obvious to you yes can you

9360
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:47,760
is that obvious to you yes can you
 

9361
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,349
is that obvious to you yes can you
imagine

9362
02:35:49,349 --> 02:35:49,359
imagine
 

9363
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:52,790
imagine
that like to play devil's advocate on

9364
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:52,800
that like to play devil's advocate on
 

9365
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:53,750
that like to play devil's advocate on
yourself is it

9366
02:35:53,750 --> 02:35:53,760
yourself is it
 

9367
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:57,030
yourself is it
possible that you can the gpt-12 will

9368
02:35:57,030 --> 02:35:57,040
possible that you can the gpt-12 will
 

9369
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,469
possible that you can the gpt-12 will
achieve general intelligence

9370
02:35:58,469 --> 02:35:58,479
achieve general intelligence
 

9371
02:35:58,479 --> 02:36:00,950
achieve general intelligence
with something as dumb as this kind of

9372
02:36:00,950 --> 02:36:00,960
with something as dumb as this kind of
 

9373
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:01,830
with something as dumb as this kind of
loss function

9374
02:36:01,830 --> 02:36:01,840
loss function
 

9375
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:03,590
loss function
i guess it depends what you mean by

9376
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600
i guess it depends what you mean by
 

9377
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:04,950
i guess it depends what you mean by
general intelligence

9378
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:04,960
general intelligence
 

9379
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:07,830
general intelligence
so there's another problem with the gpts

9380
02:36:07,830 --> 02:36:07,840
so there's another problem with the gpts
 

9381
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,670
so there's another problem with the gpts
and that's that they don't have

9382
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680
and that's that they don't have
 

9383
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,950
and that's that they don't have
a uh they don't have long-term memory

9384
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:12,960
a uh they don't have long-term memory
 

9385
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:16,630
a uh they don't have long-term memory
right right so like just

9386
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:16,640
right right so like just
 

9387
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:20,830
right right so like just
gpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or

9388
02:36:20,830 --> 02:36:20,840
gpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or
 

9389
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:22,389
gpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or
three

9390
02:36:22,389 --> 02:36:22,399
three
 

9391
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:25,910
three
i find it hard to believe

9392
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:25,920
i find it hard to believe
 

9393
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:28,870
i find it hard to believe
well you can scale it in it's yeah so

9394
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:28,880
well you can scale it in it's yeah so
 

9395
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:30,389
well you can scale it in it's yeah so
it's a hardcore

9396
02:36:30,389 --> 02:36:30,399
it's a hardcore
 

9397
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:33,110
it's a hardcore
hard-coded length but you can make it

9398
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:33,120
hard-coded length but you can make it
 

9399
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:36,309
hard-coded length but you can make it
wider and wider and wider yeah

9400
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
wider and wider and wider yeah
 

9401
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,469
wider and wider and wider yeah
you're gonna get you're gonna get cool

9402
02:36:38,469 --> 02:36:38,479
you're gonna get you're gonna get cool
 

9403
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:40,870
you're gonna get you're gonna get cool
things from those systems

9404
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:40,880
things from those systems
 

9405
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:44,150
things from those systems
but i i don't think you're ever gonna

9406
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:44,160
but i i don't think you're ever gonna
 

9407
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:45,670
but i i don't think you're ever gonna
get something that can like

9408
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:45,680
get something that can like
 

9409
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:47,670
get something that can like
you know build me a rocket ship what

9410
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:47,680
you know build me a rocket ship what
 

9411
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:49,429
you know build me a rocket ship what
about solve driving

9412
02:36:49,429 --> 02:36:49,439
about solve driving
 

9413
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:52,710
about solve driving
so you know you can use transformer with

9414
02:36:52,710 --> 02:36:52,720
so you know you can use transformer with
 

9415
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,630
so you know you can use transformer with
video for example

9416
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:54,640
video for example
 

9417
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:57,510
video for example
you think is there something in there no

9418
02:36:57,510 --> 02:36:57,520
you think is there something in there no
 

9419
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:58,309
you think is there something in there no
because

9420
02:36:58,309 --> 02:36:58,319
because
 

9421
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:01,590
because
hey look we use we as a group we use a

9422
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
hey look we use we as a group we use a
 

9423
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:02,870
hey look we use we as a group we use a
group we could change that group out to

9424
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:02,880
group we could change that group out to
 

9425
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:04,870
group we could change that group out to
a transformer

9426
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:04,880
a transformer
 

9427
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:07,349
a transformer
um i think driving is much more

9428
02:37:07,349 --> 02:37:07,359
um i think driving is much more
 

9429
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:09,349
um i think driving is much more
markovian than language

9430
02:37:09,349 --> 02:37:09,359
markovian than language
 

9431
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:11,670
markovian than language
so markov you mean like the memory which

9432
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:11,680
so markov you mean like the memory which
 

9433
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:13,670
so markov you mean like the memory which
which aspect of uh

9434
02:37:13,670 --> 02:37:13,680
which aspect of uh
 

9435
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:16,309
which aspect of uh
i mean that like most of the information

9436
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
i mean that like most of the information
 

9437
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:17,110
i mean that like most of the information
in the state at t

9438
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:17,120
in the state at t
 

9439
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,270
in the state at t
minus one is also in the in is in state

9440
02:37:19,270 --> 02:37:19,280
minus one is also in the in is in state
 

9441
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,429
minus one is also in the in is in state
t yeah right and it kind of like drops

9442
02:37:21,429 --> 02:37:21,439
t yeah right and it kind of like drops
 

9443
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:21,750
t yeah right and it kind of like drops
off

9444
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:21,760
off
 

9445
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:23,510
off
nicely like this where sometime with

9446
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:23,520
nicely like this where sometime with
 

9447
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,110
nicely like this where sometime with
language you have to refer back to the

9448
02:37:25,110 --> 02:37:25,120
language you have to refer back to the
 

9449
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,190
language you have to refer back to the
third paragraph on the second page

9450
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
third paragraph on the second page
 

9451
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,510
third paragraph on the second page
i feel like there's not many like like

9452
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
i feel like there's not many like like
 

9453
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,950
i feel like there's not many like like
you can say like speed limit signs but

9454
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:30,960
you can say like speed limit signs but
 

9455
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:32,469
you can say like speed limit signs but
there's really not many things in

9456
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:32,479
there's really not many things in
 

9457
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:33,830
there's really not many things in
autonomous driving that look like that

9458
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:33,840
autonomous driving that look like that
 

9459
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,309
autonomous driving that look like that
but if you look at uh to play devil's

9460
02:37:36,309 --> 02:37:36,319
but if you look at uh to play devil's
 

9461
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:37,110
but if you look at uh to play devil's
advocate

9462
02:37:37,110 --> 02:37:37,120
advocate
 

9463
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,950
advocate
is uh the risk estimation thing that

9464
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:38,960
is uh the risk estimation thing that
 

9465
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,070
is uh the risk estimation thing that
you've talked about it's kind of

9466
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,080
you've talked about it's kind of
 

9467
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:41,110
you've talked about it's kind of
interesting

9468
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:41,120
interesting
 

9469
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:43,910
interesting
is uh it feels like there might be some

9470
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:43,920
is uh it feels like there might be some
 

9471
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:45,270
is uh it feels like there might be some
longer term

9472
02:37:45,270 --> 02:37:45,280
longer term
 

9473
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:48,070
longer term
uh aggregation of context necessary to

9474
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:48,080
uh aggregation of context necessary to
 

9475
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,230
uh aggregation of context necessary to
be able to figure out like

9476
02:37:50,230 --> 02:37:50,240
be able to figure out like
 

9477
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:53,429
be able to figure out like
the context yeah i'm not even sure i'm

9478
02:37:53,429 --> 02:37:53,439
the context yeah i'm not even sure i'm
 

9479
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:56,070
the context yeah i'm not even sure i'm
i'm believing my my own devil's we have

9480
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
i'm believing my my own devil's we have
 

9481
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,150
i'm believing my my own devil's we have
a nice we have a nice like vision model

9482
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:58,160
a nice we have a nice like vision model
 

9483
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,670
a nice we have a nice like vision model
which outputs like a a

9484
02:37:59,670 --> 02:37:59,680
which outputs like a a
 

9485
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,349
which outputs like a a
one two four dimensional perception

9486
02:38:01,349 --> 02:38:01,359
one two four dimensional perception
 

9487
02:38:01,359 --> 02:38:03,190

space um

9488
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:03,200
space um
 

9489
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,190
space um
can i try transformers on it sure i

9490
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:05,200
can i try transformers on it sure i
 

9491
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:06,469
can i try transformers on it sure i
probably will

9492
02:38:06,469 --> 02:38:06,479
probably will
 

9493
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:08,230
probably will
at some point we'll try transformers and

9494
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:08,240
at some point we'll try transformers and
 

9495
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:09,670
at some point we'll try transformers and
then we'll just see do they do better

9496
02:38:09,670 --> 02:38:09,680
then we'll just see do they do better
 

9497
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:10,070
then we'll just see do they do better
sure

9498
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
sure
 

9499
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:11,990
sure
i'm well it might not be a game changer

9500
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,000
i'm well it might not be a game changer
 

9501
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,510
i'm well it might not be a game changer
no well i'm not like like

9502
02:38:13,510 --> 02:38:13,520
no well i'm not like like
 

9503
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,950
no well i'm not like like
might transformers work better than

9504
02:38:14,950 --> 02:38:14,960
might transformers work better than
 

9505
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:16,630
might transformers work better than
grooves for autonomous driving sure

9506
02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:16,640
grooves for autonomous driving sure
 

9507
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:18,309
grooves for autonomous driving sure
might we switch sure is this some

9508
02:38:18,309 --> 02:38:18,319
might we switch sure is this some
 

9509
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:19,910
might we switch sure is this some
radical change no

9510
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:19,920
radical change no
 

9511
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:21,510
radical change no
okay we use a slightly different you

9512
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:21,520
okay we use a slightly different you
 

9513
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:23,030
okay we use a slightly different you
know we switch from rnns to grooves

9514
02:38:23,030 --> 02:38:23,040
know we switch from rnns to grooves
 

9515
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,389
know we switch from rnns to grooves
like okay maybe it's greased to

9516
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:24,399
like okay maybe it's greased to
 

9517
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:26,469
like okay maybe it's greased to
transformers but no it's not

9518
02:38:26,469 --> 02:38:26,479
transformers but no it's not
 

9519
02:38:26,479 --> 02:38:29,670
transformers but no it's not
yeah i well on the on the topic of

9520
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:29,680
yeah i well on the on the topic of
 

9521
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:30,870
yeah i well on the on the topic of
general intelligence i don't know

9522
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
general intelligence i don't know
 

9523
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:32,150
general intelligence i don't know
how much i've talked to you about it

9524
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,160
how much i've talked to you about it
 

9525
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,790
how much i've talked to you about it
like what um

9526
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
like what um
 

9527
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:37,910
like what um
do you think will actually build an agi

9528
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:37,920
do you think will actually build an agi
 

9529
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:39,830
do you think will actually build an agi
like if if you look at ray kurzweil with

9530
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:39,840
like if if you look at ray kurzweil with
 

9531
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,190
like if if you look at ray kurzweil with
a singularity do

9532
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,200
a singularity do
 

9533
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,510
a singularity do
you have like an intuition about you're

9534
02:38:43,510 --> 02:38:43,520
you have like an intuition about you're
 

9535
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,270
you have like an intuition about you're
kind of saying driving is easy

9536
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:45,280
kind of saying driving is easy
 

9537
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:48,469
kind of saying driving is easy
yeah and i

9538
02:38:48,469 --> 02:38:48,479
yeah and i
 

9539
02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:50,710
yeah and i
i tend to personally believe that

9540
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:50,720
i tend to personally believe that
 

9541
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:52,469
i tend to personally believe that
solving driving

9542
02:38:52,469 --> 02:38:52,479
solving driving
 

9543
02:38:52,479 --> 02:38:55,830
solving driving
will have really deep important

9544
02:38:55,830 --> 02:38:55,840
will have really deep important
 

9545
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,150
will have really deep important
impacts on our ability to solve general

9546
02:38:58,150 --> 02:38:58,160
impacts on our ability to solve general
 

9547
02:38:58,160 --> 02:38:59,190
impacts on our ability to solve general
intelligence

9548
02:38:59,190 --> 02:38:59,200
intelligence
 

9549
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:01,910
intelligence
like i i think driving doesn't require

9550
02:39:01,910 --> 02:39:01,920
like i i think driving doesn't require
 

9551
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:03,270
like i i think driving doesn't require
general intelligence

9552
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:03,280
general intelligence
 

9553
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,550
general intelligence
but i think they're going to be

9554
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:04,560
but i think they're going to be
 

9555
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:07,270
but i think they're going to be
neighbors in a way that it's like deeply

9556
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:07,280
neighbors in a way that it's like deeply
 

9557
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:08,230
neighbors in a way that it's like deeply
tied

9558
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:08,240
tied
 

9559
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,550
tied
because it's so like driving is so

9560
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
because it's so like driving is so
 

9561
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,190
because it's so like driving is so
deeply connected to the human experience

9562
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:13,200
deeply connected to the human experience
 

9563
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:16,550
deeply connected to the human experience
that i think solving one will help solve

9564
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:16,560
that i think solving one will help solve
 

9565
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:17,349
that i think solving one will help solve

the other
 

9567
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:19,750
the other
but but so i don't see i don't see

9568
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:19,760
but but so i don't see i don't see
 

9569
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,469
but but so i don't see i don't see
driving is like

9570
02:39:20,469 --> 02:39:20,479
driving is like
 

9571
02:39:20,479 --> 02:39:22,230
driving is like
easy and almost like separate than

9572
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,240
easy and almost like separate than
 

9573
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,230
easy and almost like separate than
general intelligence but like what's

9574
02:39:24,230 --> 02:39:24,240
general intelligence but like what's
 

9575
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:24,630
general intelligence but like what's
your

9576
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:24,640
your
 

9577
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,710
your
vision of a future with a singular do

9578
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:26,720
vision of a future with a singular do
 

9579
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,230
vision of a future with a singular do
you see there'll be a single moment like

9580
02:39:28,230 --> 02:39:28,240
you see there'll be a single moment like
 

9581
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:29,910
you see there'll be a single moment like
a singularity where it'll be a phase

9582
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:29,920
a singularity where it'll be a phase
 

9583
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:30,469
a singularity where it'll be a phase

are we in the singularity now like what

9586
02:39:32,710 --> 02:39:32,720
are we in the singularity now like what
 

9587
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:34,469
are we in the singularity now like what
do you have crazy ideas about the future

9588
02:39:34,469 --> 02:39:34,479
do you have crazy ideas about the future
 

9589
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:35,030
do you have crazy ideas about the future
in terms of

9590
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,040
in terms of
 

9591
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,950
in terms of
agi we're definitely in the singularity

9592
02:39:36,950 --> 02:39:36,960
agi we're definitely in the singularity
 

9593
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,630
agi we're definitely in the singularity
now um we are

9594
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:38,640
now um we are
 

9595
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,790
now um we are
coolers of course look at the bandwidth

9596
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:40,800
coolers of course look at the bandwidth
 

9597
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,070
coolers of course look at the bandwidth
between people the bandwidth between

9598
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:42,080
between people the bandwidth between
 

9599
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,190
between people the bandwidth between
people goes up

9600
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:43,200
people goes up
 

9601
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:45,910
people goes up
all right um the singularity is just you

9602
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:45,920
all right um the singularity is just you
 

9603
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,110
all right um the singularity is just you
know when the bandwidth but

9604
02:39:47,110 --> 02:39:47,120
know when the bandwidth but
 

9605
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:48,230
know when the bandwidth but
what do you mean by the bandwidth of the

9606
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:48,240
what do you mean by the bandwidth of the
 

9607
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:50,070
what do you mean by the bandwidth of the
people communications tools the whole

9608
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,080
people communications tools the whole
 

9609
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,190
people communications tools the whole
world is networked

9610
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:51,200
world is networked
 

9611
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,389
world is networked
the whole world is networked and we

9612
02:39:52,389 --> 02:39:52,399
the whole world is networked and we
 

9613
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:54,550
the whole world is networked and we
raise the speed of that network right

9614
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:54,560
raise the speed of that network right
 

9615
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,230
raise the speed of that network right
oh so you think the communication of

9616
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:56,240
oh so you think the communication of
 

9617
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:57,750
oh so you think the communication of
information in a

9618
02:39:57,750 --> 02:39:57,760
information in a
 

9619
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:00,870
information in a
distributed way is a empowering thing

9620
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:00,880
distributed way is a empowering thing
 

9621
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:02,230
distributed way is a empowering thing
for collective intelligence

9622
02:40:02,230 --> 02:40:02,240
for collective intelligence
 

9623
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:03,429
for collective intelligence
oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good

9624
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:03,439
oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good
 

9625
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:04,630
oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good
thing but i think that's like when i

9626
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:04,640
thing but i think that's like when i
 

9627
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,590
thing but i think that's like when i
think of the definition of the

9628
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:05,600
think of the definition of the
 

9629
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,990
think of the definition of the
singularity yeah it seems kind of right

9630
02:40:07,990 --> 02:40:08,000
singularity yeah it seems kind of right
 

9631
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,990
singularity yeah it seems kind of right
i see like it's a change in the world

9632
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:12,000
i see like it's a change in the world
 

9633
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,429
i see like it's a change in the world
beyond which

9634
02:40:13,429 --> 02:40:13,439
beyond which
 

9635
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:15,110
beyond which
like the world be transformed in ways

9636
02:40:15,110 --> 02:40:15,120
like the world be transformed in ways
 

9637
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,870
like the world be transformed in ways
that we can't possibly imagine no i mean

9638
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:16,880
that we can't possibly imagine no i mean
 

9639
02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:18,389
that we can't possibly imagine no i mean
i think we're in the singularity now in

9640
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:18,399
i think we're in the singularity now in
 

9641
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:19,830
i think we're in the singularity now in
the sense that there's like you know one

9642
02:40:19,830 --> 02:40:19,840
the sense that there's like you know one
 

9643
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,510
the sense that there's like you know one
world and a monoculture and it's also

9644
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:21,520
world and a monoculture and it's also
 

9645
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:22,309
world and a monoculture and it's also
linked

9646
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:22,319
linked
 

9647
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:24,230
linked
yeah i mean i i kind of shared the

9648
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:24,240
yeah i mean i i kind of shared the
 

9649
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,590
yeah i mean i i kind of shared the
intuition that

9650
02:40:25,590 --> 02:40:25,600
intuition that
 

9651
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,830
intuition that
the the singularity will originate from

9652
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:27,840
the the singularity will originate from
 

9653
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:30,150
the the singularity will originate from
the collective intelligence

9654
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:30,160
the collective intelligence
 

9655
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:33,190
the collective intelligence
of us ants versus the like some single

9656
02:40:33,190 --> 02:40:33,200
of us ants versus the like some single
 

9657
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,309
of us ants versus the like some single
system agi

9658
02:40:34,309 --> 02:40:34,319
system agi
 

9659
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:36,870
system agi
type thing oh i totally agree with that

9660
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
type thing oh i totally agree with that
 

9661
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,630
type thing oh i totally agree with that
yeah i don't i don't really believe in

9662
02:40:38,630 --> 02:40:38,640
yeah i don't i don't really believe in
 

9663
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:40,710
yeah i don't i don't really believe in
like like a hard take off agi kind of

9664
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:40,720
like like a hard take off agi kind of
 

9665
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:43,190
like like a hard take off agi kind of
thing

9666
02:40:43,190 --> 02:40:43,200

 

9667
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:46,790

um yeah i don't think i don't even think

9668
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:46,800
um yeah i don't think i don't even think
 

9669
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:48,150
um yeah i don't think i don't even think
ai is all that different

9670
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:48,160
ai is all that different
 

9671
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,550
ai is all that different
in kind from what we've already been

9672
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:50,560
in kind from what we've already been
 

9673
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:51,510
in kind from what we've already been
building

9674
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:51,520
building
 

9675
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:54,389
building
um with respect to driving i think

9676
02:40:54,389 --> 02:40:54,399
um with respect to driving i think
 

9677
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:55,670
um with respect to driving i think
driving is a subset of general

9678
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:55,680
driving is a subset of general
 

9679
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,950
driving is a subset of general
intelligence and i think it's a pretty

9680
02:40:56,950 --> 02:40:56,960
intelligence and i think it's a pretty
 

9681
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:57,990
intelligence and i think it's a pretty
complete subset

9682
02:40:57,990 --> 02:40:58,000
complete subset
 

9683
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,150
complete subset
i think the tools we develop at comma

9684
02:41:00,150 --> 02:41:00,160
i think the tools we develop at comma
 

9685
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,150
i think the tools we develop at comma
will also be extremely helpful

9686
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,160
will also be extremely helpful
 

9687
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,230
will also be extremely helpful
to solving general intelligence and

9688
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:04,240
to solving general intelligence and
 

9689
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:05,750
to solving general intelligence and
that's i think the real reason why i'm

9690
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:05,760
that's i think the real reason why i'm
 

9691
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:06,389
that's i think the real reason why i'm
doing it

9692
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:06,399
doing it
 

9693
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,230
doing it
i don't care about self-driving cars

9694
02:41:08,230 --> 02:41:08,240
i don't care about self-driving cars
 

9695
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:10,870
i don't care about self-driving cars
it's a cool problem to beat people at

9696
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:10,880
it's a cool problem to beat people at
 

9697
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:12,950
it's a cool problem to beat people at
but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of

9698
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:12,960
but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of
 

9699
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,389
but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of
you're of two minds

9700
02:41:14,389 --> 02:41:14,399
you're of two minds
 

9701
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:16,309
you're of two minds
so one you do have to have a mission and

9702
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:16,319
so one you do have to have a mission and
 

9703
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:17,910
so one you do have to have a mission and
you want to focus and make sure you

9704
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:17,920
you want to focus and make sure you
 

9705
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:20,550
you want to focus and make sure you
get you get there you can't forget that

9706
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:20,560
get you get there you can't forget that
 

9707
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:21,349
get you get there you can't forget that
but

9708
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
but
 

9709
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:23,830
but
at the same time there is a thread

9710
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:23,840
at the same time there is a thread
 

9711
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,510
at the same time there is a thread
that's much

9712
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:25,520
that's much
 

9713
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:27,750
that's much
bigger than uh the connects the entirety

9714
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:27,760
bigger than uh the connects the entirety
 

9715
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,190
bigger than uh the connects the entirety
of your effort that's much bigger than

9716
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
of your effort that's much bigger than
 

9717
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:31,110
of your effort that's much bigger than
just driving

9718
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:31,120
just driving
 

9719
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,429
just driving
with ai and with general intelligence it

9720
02:41:33,429 --> 02:41:33,439
with ai and with general intelligence it
 

9721
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:35,030
with ai and with general intelligence it
is so easy to delude yourself

9722
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
is so easy to delude yourself
 

9723
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:36,230
is so easy to delude yourself
into thinking you've figured something

9724
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:36,240
into thinking you've figured something
 

9725
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:38,389
into thinking you've figured something
out when you haven't if we build a level

9726
02:41:38,389 --> 02:41:38,399
out when you haven't if we build a level
 

9727
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:39,750
out when you haven't if we build a level
5 self-driving car

9728
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:39,760
5 self-driving car
 

9729
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:42,630
5 self-driving car
we have indisputably built something

9730
02:41:42,630 --> 02:41:42,640
we have indisputably built something
 

9731
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:43,269
we have indisputably built something
yeah

9732
02:41:43,269 --> 02:41:43,279
yeah
 

9733
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:45,030
yeah
is it general intelligence i'm not going

9734
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:45,040
is it general intelligence i'm not going
 

9735
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:46,870
is it general intelligence i'm not going
to debate that i will say we've built

9736
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:46,880
to debate that i will say we've built
 

9737
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:47,429
to debate that i will say we've built
something

9738
02:41:47,429 --> 02:41:47,439
something
 

9739
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:49,830
something
that provides huge financial value yeah

9740
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:49,840
that provides huge financial value yeah
 

9741
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:51,349
that provides huge financial value yeah
beautifully put that's the engineering

9742
02:41:51,349 --> 02:41:51,359
beautifully put that's the engineering
 

9743
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:53,590
beautifully put that's the engineering
credo like just just build the thing

9744
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:53,600
credo like just just build the thing
 

9745
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:55,670
credo like just just build the thing
it's like that's why i'm with uh with

9746
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,680
it's like that's why i'm with uh with
 

9747
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:57,670
it's like that's why i'm with uh with
the with elon on uh

9748
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:57,680
the with elon on uh
 

9749
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,830
the with elon on uh
go to mars yeah that's a great one you

9750
02:41:59,830 --> 02:41:59,840
go to mars yeah that's a great one you
 

9751
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:00,710
go to mars yeah that's a great one you
can argue like

9752
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:00,720
can argue like
 

9753
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:03,510
can argue like
who the hell cares about going to mars

9754
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:03,520
who the hell cares about going to mars
 

9755
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:05,110
who the hell cares about going to mars
but the reality is

9756
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:05,120
but the reality is
 

9757
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:07,349
but the reality is
set that as a mission get it done yeah

9758
02:42:07,349 --> 02:42:07,359
set that as a mission get it done yeah
 

9759
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:09,030
set that as a mission get it done yeah
and then you're going to crack some pro

9760
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:09,040
and then you're going to crack some pro
 

9761
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:11,510
and then you're going to crack some pro
problem that you've never even expected

9762
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:11,520
problem that you've never even expected
 

9763
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,750
problem that you've never even expected
in the process of doing that yeah

9764
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:13,760
in the process of doing that yeah
 

9765
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,070
in the process of doing that yeah
yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice

9766
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:16,080
yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice
 

9767
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,429
yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice
between humanity going to mars and

9768
02:42:17,429 --> 02:42:17,439
between humanity going to mars and
 

9769
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:18,790
between humanity going to mars and
solving self-driving cars i think going

9770
02:42:18,790 --> 02:42:18,800
solving self-driving cars i think going
 

9771
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:20,710
solving self-driving cars i think going
to mars is uh

9772
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:20,720
to mars is uh
 

9773
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,309
to mars is uh
better but i don't know i'm more suited

9774
02:42:22,309 --> 02:42:22,319
better but i don't know i'm more suited
 

9775
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:24,070
better but i don't know i'm more suited
for self-driving cars i'm an information

9776
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:24,080
for self-driving cars i'm an information
 

9777
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:25,110
for self-driving cars i'm an information
guy i'm not a modernist i'm a

9778
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,120
guy i'm not a modernist i'm a
 

9779
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:26,389
guy i'm not a modernist i'm a
postmodernist

9780
02:42:26,389 --> 02:42:26,399
postmodernist
 

9781
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:29,510
postmodernist
post modernist all right beautifully put

9782
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:29,520
post modernist all right beautifully put
 

9783
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:30,950
post modernist all right beautifully put
let me let me drag you back to

9784
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:30,960
let me let me drag you back to
 

9785
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:32,790
let me let me drag you back to
programming for a sec what

9786
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:32,800
programming for a sec what
 

9787
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:34,550
programming for a sec what
three maybe three to five programming

9788
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:34,560
three maybe three to five programming
 

9789
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:35,990
three maybe three to five programming
languages should people learn

9790
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000
languages should people learn
 

9791
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,349
languages should people learn
do you think like if you look at

9792
02:42:37,349 --> 02:42:37,359
do you think like if you look at
 

9793
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:39,510
do you think like if you look at
yourself what did you get the most out

9794
02:42:39,510 --> 02:42:39,520
yourself what did you get the most out
 

9795
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:40,950
yourself what did you get the most out
of

9796
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:40,960
of
 

9797
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:44,150
of
from learning uh well so everybody

9798
02:42:44,150 --> 02:42:44,160
from learning uh well so everybody
 

9799
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:44,790
from learning uh well so everybody
should learn

9800
02:42:44,790 --> 02:42:44,800
should learn
 

9801
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:46,469
should learn
c and assembly we'll start with those

9802
02:42:46,469 --> 02:42:46,479
c and assembly we'll start with those
 

9803
02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:48,070
c and assembly we'll start with those
two right assembly

9804
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:48,080
two right assembly
 

9805
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:49,990
two right assembly
yeah if you can't code in assembly you

9806
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:50,000
yeah if you can't code in assembly you
 

9807
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,590
yeah if you can't code in assembly you
don't know what the computer's doing

9808
02:42:51,590 --> 02:42:51,600
don't know what the computer's doing
 

9809
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,670
don't know what the computer's doing
you don't understand like you don't have

9810
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:53,680
you don't understand like you don't have
 

9811
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,590
you don't understand like you don't have
to be great in assembly but you have to

9812
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:55,600
to be great in assembly but you have to
 

9813
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:57,910
to be great in assembly but you have to
code in it and then like you have to

9814
02:42:57,910 --> 02:42:57,920
code in it and then like you have to
 

9815
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:59,190
code in it and then like you have to
appreciate assembly in order to

9816
02:42:59,190 --> 02:42:59,200
appreciate assembly in order to
 

9817
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,790
appreciate assembly in order to
appreciate all the great things c

9818
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:00,800
appreciate all the great things c
 

9819
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:03,030
appreciate all the great things c
gets you and then you have to code and

9820
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,040
gets you and then you have to code and
 

9821
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:04,469
gets you and then you have to code and
see in order to appreciate all the great

9822
02:43:04,469 --> 02:43:04,479
see in order to appreciate all the great
 

9823
02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:06,150
see in order to appreciate all the great
things python gets you

9824
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:06,160
things python gets you
 

9825
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:07,750
things python gets you
so i'll just say assembly c and python

9826
02:43:07,750 --> 02:43:07,760
so i'll just say assembly c and python
 

9827
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:09,750
so i'll just say assembly c and python
we'll start with those three

9828
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:09,760
we'll start with those three
 

9829
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:12,870
we'll start with those three
the memory allocation of of c and the

9830
02:43:12,870 --> 02:43:12,880
the memory allocation of of c and the
 

9831
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:15,910
the memory allocation of of c and the
the the fact that so assemblies give you

9832
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:15,920
the the fact that so assemblies give you
 

9833
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,269
the the fact that so assemblies give you
a sense of just how many levels of

9834
02:43:17,269 --> 02:43:17,279
a sense of just how many levels of
 

9835
02:43:17,279 --> 02:43:18,550
a sense of just how many levels of
abstraction

9836
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:18,560
abstraction
 

9837
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:20,230
abstraction
you get to work on in modern day

9838
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:20,240
you get to work on in modern day
 

9839
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:22,309
you get to work on in modern day
programs yeah yeah graph coloring for

9840
02:43:22,309 --> 02:43:22,319
programs yeah yeah graph coloring for
 

9841
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:23,750
programs yeah yeah graph coloring for
assignment register assignment and

9842
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:23,760
assignment register assignment and
 

9843
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,670
assignment register assignment and
compilers yeah like you know you got to

9844
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:25,680
compilers yeah like you know you got to
 

9845
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:26,870
compilers yeah like you know you got to
do you know the compiler your computer

9846
02:43:26,870 --> 02:43:26,880
do you know the compiler your computer
 

9847
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:28,230
do you know the compiler your computer
only has a certain number of registers

9848
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:28,240
only has a certain number of registers
 

9849
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:29,590
only has a certain number of registers
you can have all the variables you want

9850
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:29,600
you can have all the variables you want
 

9851
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:29,990
you can have all the variables you want
a c

9852
02:43:29,990 --> 02:43:30,000
a c
 

9853
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,670
a c
function you know so you get to start

9854
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:31,680
function you know so you get to start
 

9855
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,510
function you know so you get to start
your build intuition about

9856
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:33,520
your build intuition about
 

9857
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:35,429
your build intuition about
compilation like what a compiler gets

9858
02:43:35,429 --> 02:43:35,439
compilation like what a compiler gets
 

9859
02:43:35,439 --> 02:43:37,269
compilation like what a compiler gets
you

9860
02:43:37,269 --> 02:43:37,279
you
 

9861
02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:39,269
you
what else um well then there's then

9862
02:43:39,269 --> 02:43:39,279
what else um well then there's then
 

9863
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:41,110
what else um well then there's then
there's kind of uh

9864
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
there's kind of uh
 

9865
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:42,870
there's kind of uh
so those are all very imperative

9866
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:42,880
so those are all very imperative
 

9867
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,670
so those are all very imperative
programming languages um

9868
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:45,680
programming languages um
 

9869
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:47,190
programming languages um
then there's two other paradigms for

9870
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:47,200
then there's two other paradigms for
 

9871
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:48,309
then there's two other paradigms for
programming that everybody should be

9872
02:43:48,309 --> 02:43:48,319
programming that everybody should be
 

9873
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:49,030
programming that everybody should be
familiar with

9874
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:49,040
familiar with
 

9875
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:51,269
familiar with
i'm one of them is functional uh you

9876
02:43:51,269 --> 02:43:51,279
i'm one of them is functional uh you
 

9877
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:53,030
i'm one of them is functional uh you
should learn haskell and take that all

9878
02:43:53,030 --> 02:43:53,040
should learn haskell and take that all
 

9879
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:54,070
should learn haskell and take that all
the way through

9880
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:54,080
the way through
 

9881
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:55,429
the way through
learn a language with dependent types

9882
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
learn a language with dependent types
 

9883
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:57,269
learn a language with dependent types
like

9884
02:43:57,269 --> 02:43:57,279
like
 

9885
02:43:57,279 --> 02:43:59,990
like
learn that whole space like the very pl

9886
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:00,000
learn that whole space like the very pl
 

9887
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:00,710
learn that whole space like the very pl
theory

9888
02:44:00,710 --> 02:44:00,720
theory
 

9889
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:03,349
theory
heavy languages and haskell is your

9890
02:44:03,349 --> 02:44:03,359
heavy languages and haskell is your
 

9891
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:04,469
heavy languages and haskell is your
favorite functional

9892
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
favorite functional
 

9893
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:06,389
favorite functional
what is that the go-to you would say

9894
02:44:06,389 --> 02:44:06,399
what is that the go-to you would say
 

9895
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:08,389
what is that the go-to you would say
yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer

9896
02:44:08,389 --> 02:44:08,399
yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer
 

9897
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:08,710
yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer
i

9898
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:08,720
i
 

9899
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,630
i
wrote a compiler in haskell once there's

9900
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:10,640
wrote a compiler in haskell once there's
 

9901
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,750
wrote a compiler in haskell once there's
another paradigm and actually there's

9902
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:11,760
another paradigm and actually there's
 

9903
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:12,950
another paradigm and actually there's
one more paradigm that i'll even talk

9904
02:44:12,950 --> 02:44:12,960
one more paradigm that i'll even talk
 

9905
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:13,590
one more paradigm that i'll even talk
about

9906
02:44:13,590 --> 02:44:13,600
about
 

9907
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,790
about
after that that i never used to talk

9908
02:44:14,790 --> 02:44:14,800
after that that i never used to talk
 

9909
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:16,309
after that that i never used to talk
about when i would think about this but

9910
02:44:16,309 --> 02:44:16,319
about when i would think about this but
 

9911
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:17,750
about when i would think about this but
the next paradigm is learn verilog of

9912
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:17,760
the next paradigm is learn verilog of
 

9913
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:19,269
the next paradigm is learn verilog of
hdl

9914
02:44:19,269 --> 02:44:19,279
hdl
 

9915
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:21,750
hdl
um understand this idea of all of the

9916
02:44:21,750 --> 02:44:21,760
um understand this idea of all of the
 

9917
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:25,349
um understand this idea of all of the
instructions execute at once

9918
02:44:25,349 --> 02:44:25,359

 

9919
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:27,830

if i have a block in verilog and i write

9920
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:27,840
if i have a block in verilog and i write
 

9921
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:28,550
if i have a block in verilog and i write
stuff in it

9922
02:44:28,550 --> 02:44:28,560
stuff in it
 

9923
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:30,830
stuff in it
it's not sequential they all execute it

9924
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:30,840
it's not sequential they all execute it
 

9925
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:33,590
it's not sequential they all execute it
once

9926
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:33,600
once
 

9927
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:34,870
once
and then like think like that that's how

9928
02:44:34,870 --> 02:44:34,880
and then like think like that that's how
 

9929
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:36,630
and then like think like that that's how
hardware works

9930
02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:36,640
hardware works
 

9931
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:39,269
hardware works
to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite

9932
02:44:39,269 --> 02:44:39,279
to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite
 

9933
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:39,910
to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite
get you that

9934
02:44:39,910 --> 02:44:39,920
get you that
 

9935
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:42,230
get you that
assembly's more about compilation and

9936
02:44:42,230 --> 02:44:42,240
assembly's more about compilation and
 

9937
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:44,150
assembly's more about compilation and
verilog is more about the hardware

9938
02:44:44,150 --> 02:44:44,160
verilog is more about the hardware
 

9939
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:46,790
verilog is more about the hardware
like giving a sense of what actually is

9940
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:46,800
like giving a sense of what actually is
 

9941
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,469
like giving a sense of what actually is
the hardware is doing

9942
02:44:48,469 --> 02:44:48,479
the hardware is doing
 

9943
02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:50,950
the hardware is doing
assembly c python are straight like they

9944
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:50,960
assembly c python are straight like they
 

9945
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:53,110
assembly c python are straight like they
sit right on top of each other in fact c

9946
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:53,120
sit right on top of each other in fact c
 

9947
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:55,349
sit right on top of each other in fact c
is well let's see it's kind of coded in

9948
02:44:55,349 --> 02:44:55,359
is well let's see it's kind of coded in
 

9949
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:56,790
is well let's see it's kind of coded in
c but you could imagine the first c was

9950
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:56,800
c but you could imagine the first c was
 

9951
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:58,469
c but you could imagine the first c was
coded in assembly and python is actually

9952
02:44:58,469 --> 02:44:58,479
coded in assembly and python is actually
 

9953
02:44:58,479 --> 02:44:59,510
coded in assembly and python is actually
coded in c

9954
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
coded in c
 

9955
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,070
coded in c
um so you know you can straight up go on

9956
02:45:02,070 --> 02:45:02,080
um so you know you can straight up go on
 

9957
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:03,590
um so you know you can straight up go on
that

9958
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:03,600
that
 

9959
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:05,750
that
got it and then verilog gives you that's

9960
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:05,760
got it and then verilog gives you that's
 

9961
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:06,950
got it and then verilog gives you that's
brilliant

9962
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
brilliant
 

9963
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:08,790
brilliant
okay and then i think there's another

9964
02:45:08,790 --> 02:45:08,800
okay and then i think there's another
 

9965
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,950
okay and then i think there's another
one now everyone should carpathi calls

9966
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:10,960
one now everyone should carpathi calls
 

9967
02:45:10,960 --> 02:45:12,550
one now everyone should carpathi calls
it programming 2.0

9968
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:12,560
it programming 2.0
 

9969
02:45:12,560 --> 02:45:16,389
it programming 2.0
which is learn a i'm not even gonna

9970
02:45:16,389 --> 02:45:16,399
which is learn a i'm not even gonna
 

9971
02:45:16,399 --> 02:45:18,710
which is learn a i'm not even gonna
don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so

9972
02:45:18,710 --> 02:45:18,720
don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so
 

9973
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:19,990
don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so
machine learning

9974
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:20,000
machine learning
 

9975
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,349
machine learning
we've got to come up with a better term

9976
02:45:21,349 --> 02:45:21,359
we've got to come up with a better term
 

9977
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:25,269
we've got to come up with a better term
than programming 2.0 or um

9978
02:45:25,269 --> 02:45:25,279

 

9979
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:29,750

but yeah it's a programming language

9980
02:45:29,750 --> 02:45:29,760

 

9981
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:31,510

i wonder if it could be formalized a

9982
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,520
i wonder if it could be formalized a
 

9983
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:33,030
i wonder if it could be formalized a
little bit better which we feels like

9984
02:45:33,030 --> 02:45:33,040
little bit better which we feels like
 

9985
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:34,630
little bit better which we feels like
we're in the early days

9986
02:45:34,630 --> 02:45:34,640
we're in the early days
 

9987
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:36,950
we're in the early days
of what that actually entails

9988
02:45:36,950 --> 02:45:36,960
of what that actually entails
 

9989
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:39,030
of what that actually entails
data-driven programming

9990
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
data-driven programming
 

9991
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:42,070
data-driven programming
data-driven programming yeah but it's so

9992
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:42,080
data-driven programming yeah but it's so
 

9993
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:43,830
data-driven programming yeah but it's so
fundamentally different as a paradigm

9994
02:45:43,830 --> 02:45:43,840
fundamentally different as a paradigm
 

9995
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:46,550
fundamentally different as a paradigm
than the others uh like it almost

9996
02:45:46,550 --> 02:45:46,560
than the others uh like it almost
 

9997
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:50,230
than the others uh like it almost
requires a different skill set

9998
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:50,240

 

9999
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:53,590

but you think it's still yeah

10000
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:53,600

 

10001
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,429

and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorch

10002
02:45:55,429 --> 02:45:55,439
and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorch
 

10003
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:57,590
and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorch
wins it's the fourth paradigm it's the

10004
02:45:57,590 --> 02:45:57,600
wins it's the fourth paradigm it's the
 

10005
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,269
wins it's the fourth paradigm it's the
fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen

10006
02:45:59,269 --> 02:45:59,279
fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen
 

10007
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:02,389
fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen
there's like this you know imperative

10008
02:46:02,389 --> 02:46:02,399
there's like this you know imperative
 

10009
02:46:02,399 --> 02:46:05,110
there's like this you know imperative
functional hardware i don't know a

10010
02:46:05,110 --> 02:46:05,120
functional hardware i don't know a
 

10011
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,230
functional hardware i don't know a
better word for it

10012
02:46:06,230 --> 02:46:06,240
better word for it
 

10013
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:11,429
better word for it
and then ml do you have advice

10014
02:46:11,429 --> 02:46:11,439
and then ml do you have advice
 

10015
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:14,550
and then ml do you have advice
for people uh that want to you know get

10016
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:14,560
for people uh that want to you know get
 

10017
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,590
for people uh that want to you know get
into programming want to learn

10018
02:46:15,590 --> 02:46:15,600
into programming want to learn
 

10019
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:17,110
into programming want to learn
programming you have a

10020
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:17,120
programming you have a
 

10021
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:21,110
programming you have a
a video uh what is programming new

10022
02:46:21,110 --> 02:46:21,120
a video uh what is programming new
 

10023

how to get into programming you are

10036
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:39,760
how to get into programming you are
 

10037
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,510
how to get into programming you are
never going to learn programming by

10038
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:41,520
never going to learn programming by
 

10039
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:42,870
never going to learn programming by
watching a video

10040
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:42,880
watching a video
 

10041
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:45,349
watching a video
called learn programming the only way to

10042
02:46:45,349 --> 02:46:45,359
called learn programming the only way to
 

10043
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:46,870
called learn programming the only way to
learn programming i think and the only

10044
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:46,880
learn programming i think and the only
 

10045
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:48,070
learn programming i think and the only
one is the only way

10046
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:48,080
one is the only way
 

10047
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:49,590
one is the only way
everyone i've ever met who can program

10048
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:49,600
everyone i've ever met who can program
 

10049
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,990
everyone i've ever met who can program
well learned it all in the same way they

10050
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:52,000
well learned it all in the same way they
 

10051
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,790
well learned it all in the same way they
had something they wanted to do

10052
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:54,800
had something they wanted to do
 

10053
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:56,710
had something they wanted to do
and then they tried to do it and then

10054
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:56,720
and then they tried to do it and then
 

10055
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:58,150
and then they tried to do it and then
they were like

10056
02:46:58,150 --> 02:46:58,160
they were like
 

10057
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:01,030
they were like
oh well okay this is kind of you know be

10058
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
oh well okay this is kind of you know be
 

10059
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:02,389
oh well okay this is kind of you know be
nice if the computer could kind of do

10060
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:02,399
nice if the computer could kind of do
 

10061
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:03,269
nice if the computer could kind of do
this thing and then

10062
02:47:03,269 --> 02:47:03,279
this thing and then
 

10063
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:04,630
this thing and then
you know that's how you learn you just

10064
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:04,640
you know that's how you learn you just
 

10065
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:08,710
you know that's how you learn you just
keep pushing on a project

10066
02:47:08,710 --> 02:47:08,720

 

10067
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:10,150

um so the only advice i have for

10068
02:47:10,150 --> 02:47:10,160
um so the only advice i have for
 

10069
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:11,990
um so the only advice i have for
learning programming is go program

10070
02:47:11,990 --> 02:47:12,000
learning programming is go program
 

10071
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,710
learning programming is go program
somebody wrote to me a question like we

10072
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:14,720
somebody wrote to me a question like we
 

10073
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:15,750
somebody wrote to me a question like we
don't really

10074
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:15,760
don't really
 

10075
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:17,590
don't really

he's saying like my company is thinking
 

10081
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:22,070
he's saying like my company is thinking
of doing recruit using recurring neural

10082
02:47:22,070 --> 02:47:22,080
of doing recruit using recurring neural
 

10083
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:23,990
of doing recruit using recurring neural

networks for time series data
 

10085
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,830

but we don't really have an idea of

10086
02:47:25,830 --> 02:47:25,840
but we don't really have an idea of
 

10087
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:27,269
but we don't really have an idea of
where to use it yet

10088
02:47:27,269 --> 02:47:27,279
where to use it yet
 

10089
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:28,550
where to use it yet
we just want to like do you have any

learning questions and i think

10096
02:47:34,230 --> 02:47:34,240
learning questions and i think
 

10097
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:37,269
learning questions and i think
the answer is like actually

10098
02:47:37,269 --> 02:47:37,279
the answer is like actually
 

10099
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:38,469
the answer is like actually

beginners at some point
 

10127
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:05,030
beginners at some point
so it's not like they're a beginner it's

10128
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,040
so it's not like they're a beginner it's
 

10129
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:05,990
so it's not like they're a beginner it's
it's like

10130
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:06,000
it's like
 

10131
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,190
it's like
my problem is not that they don't know

10132
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:07,200
my problem is not that they don't know
 

10133
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,110
my problem is not that they don't know
about machine learning my problem is

10134
02:48:09,110 --> 02:48:09,120
about machine learning my problem is
 

10135
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:09,910
about machine learning my problem is
that they think that

10136
02:48:09,910 --> 02:48:09,920
that they think that
 

10137
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:11,510
that they think that
machine learning has something to say

10138
02:48:11,510 --> 02:48:11,520
machine learning has something to say
 

10139
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:14,469
machine learning has something to say
about macaroni and cheese production

like i don't know what it is but how can

10146
02:48:21,670 --> 02:48:21,680
like i don't know what it is but how can
 

10147

that's true you have to build up an
 

10151
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:26,630
that's true you have to build up an
intuition of how because you might be

able to figure out a way but
 

10155
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:29,750
able to figure out a way but
like the prerequisites you should have a

enough macaroni in them
 

10185
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:55,830
enough macaroni in them
um can we use machine learning to solve

10186
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:55,840
um can we use machine learning to solve
 

10187

like if you're a neuroscientist go into

10252
02:50:10,150 --> 02:50:10,160
like if you're a neuroscientist go into
 

10253
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:11,990
like if you're a neuroscientist go into
signal processing community if you're an

because it's so much better
 

10265
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:25,670
because it's so much better
to invest in like finding somebody else

10266
02:50:25,670 --> 02:50:25,680
to invest in like finding somebody else
 

10267
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:28,309
to invest in like finding somebody else
who already solved your problem

something to teach
 

10967
03:02:40,319 --> 03:02:43,670

is almost unique to psychedelics right
 

10969

amphetamines and
 

10973
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:49,830
amphetamines and
that's true and i'm not really sure why

03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:49,840
that's true and i'm not really sure why
 

10975

that's true and i'm not really sure why
yeah i think

10976
03:02:51,349 --> 03:02:51,359
yeah i think
 

10977
03:02:51,359 --> 03:02:53,750
yeah i think
all of the drugs have lessons to teach i

10978
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:53,760
all of the drugs have lessons to teach i
 

10979

from amphetamines i think there's things
to learn from psychedelics things to

10986
03:02:58,309 --> 03:02:58,319
to learn from psychedelics things to
 

10987
03:02:58,319 --> 03:03:00,070
to learn from psychedelics things to
learn from marijuana

10988
03:03:00,070 --> 03:03:00,080
learn from marijuana
 

10989
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:04,230
learn from marijuana
um but also at the same time

10990
03:03:04,230 --> 03:03:04,240
um but also at the same time
 

10991
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:06,230
um but also at the same time
recognize that i don't think you're

10992
03:03:06,230 --> 03:03:06,240
recognize that i don't think you're
 

10993
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:07,510
recognize that i don't think you're
learning things about the world i think

10994
03:03:07,510 --> 03:03:07,520
learning things about the world i think
 

10995
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:09,110
learning things about the world i think
you're learning things about yourself

10996
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:09,120
you're learning things about yourself
 

10997
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:12,550
you're learning things about yourself
yes um and you know what's the

10998
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:12,560
yes um and you know what's the
 

10999
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:15,590
yes um and you know what's the
even though it might have even been uh

11000
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:15,600
even though it might have even been uh
 

11001
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:17,349
even though it might have even been uh
might have been a timothy leary quote i

11002
03:03:17,349 --> 03:03:17,359
might have been a timothy leary quote i
 

11003
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:18,550
might have been a timothy leary quote i
don't want to miss about him but the

11004
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:18,560
don't want to miss about him but the
 

11005
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:19,830
don't want to miss about him but the
idea is basically like

11006
03:03:19,830 --> 03:03:19,840
idea is basically like
 

11007
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:21,190
idea is basically like
you know everybody should look behind

11008
03:03:21,190 --> 03:03:21,200
you know everybody should look behind
 

11009
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,150
you know everybody should look behind
the door but then once you've seen

11010
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:22,160
the door but then once you've seen
 

11011
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:23,190
the door but then once you've seen
behind the door you don't need to keep

11012
03:03:23,190 --> 03:03:23,200
behind the door you don't need to keep
 

11013
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:24,830
behind the door you don't need to keep
going back

11014
03:03:24,830 --> 03:03:24,840
going back
 

11015
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:27,590
going back
um so i mean and that's my thoughts on

11016
03:03:27,590 --> 03:03:27,600
um so i mean and that's my thoughts on
 

11017
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:29,750
um so i mean and that's my thoughts on
on all real drug use too

11018
03:03:29,750 --> 03:03:29,760
on all real drug use too
 

11019
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:33,110
on all real drug use too
except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a

11020
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:33,120
except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a
 

11021
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:34,389
except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a
little experience

11022
03:03:34,389 --> 03:03:34,399
little experience
 

11023
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:37,750
little experience
that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no

11024
03:03:37,750 --> 03:03:37,760
that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no
 

11025
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:38,469
that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no
i mean

11026
03:03:38,469 --> 03:03:38,479
i mean
 

11027
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:39,910
i mean
yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are

11028
03:03:39,910 --> 03:03:39,920
yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are
 

11029
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:41,750
yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are
definitely um

11030
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:41,760
definitely um
 

11031
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:43,510
definitely um
so you're a fan of new experiences i

11032
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:43,520
so you're a fan of new experiences i
 

11033
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:44,790
so you're a fan of new experiences i
suppose yes because they all

11034
03:03:44,790 --> 03:03:44,800
suppose yes because they all
 

11035
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:46,389
suppose yes because they all
contain a little especially the first

11036
03:03:46,389 --> 03:03:46,399
contain a little especially the first
 

11037
03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:47,910
contain a little especially the first
few times it contains some lessons that

11038
03:03:47,910 --> 03:03:47,920
few times it contains some lessons that
 

11039
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:49,590
few times it contains some lessons that
could be picked up

11040
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:49,600
could be picked up
 

11041
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:53,030
could be picked up
yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics

11042
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:53,040
yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics
 

11043
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:55,269
yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics
maybe once a year

11044
03:03:55,269 --> 03:03:55,279
maybe once a year
 

11045
03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:58,630
maybe once a year
um usually small smaller doses

11046
03:03:58,630 --> 03:03:58,640
um usually small smaller doses
 

11047
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:59,830
um usually small smaller doses
maybe they turn up the learning rate of

11048
03:03:59,830 --> 03:03:59,840
maybe they turn up the learning rate of
 

11049
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:02,070
maybe they turn up the learning rate of
your brain i've heard that

11050
03:04:02,070 --> 03:04:02,080
your brain i've heard that
 

11051
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:04,389
your brain i've heard that
i like that yeah that's cool big

11052
03:04:04,389 --> 03:04:04,399
i like that yeah that's cool big
 

11053
03:04:04,399 --> 03:04:07,349
i like that yeah that's cool big
learning rates have pros and cons

11054
03:04:07,349 --> 03:04:07,359
learning rates have pros and cons
 

11055
03:04:07,359 --> 03:04:09,349
learning rates have pros and cons
last question this is a little weird one

11056
03:04:09,349 --> 03:04:09,359
last question this is a little weird one
 

11057
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:10,469
last question this is a little weird one
but you've called yourself

11058
03:04:10,469 --> 03:04:10,479
but you've called yourself
 

11059
03:04:10,479 --> 03:04:13,990
but you've called yourself
crazy in the past uh

to uh dissect your
 

11093
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:53,910
to uh dissect your
brain so okay from like a

11094
03:04:53,910 --> 03:04:53,920
brain so okay from like a
 

11095
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:56,950
brain so okay from like a
like mental health lens on crazy

11096
03:04:56,950 --> 03:04:56,960
like mental health lens on crazy
 

11097
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:58,870
like mental health lens on crazy
i'm not sure i really believe in that

11098

a lot of that stuff right this concept
 

11103
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:04,550
a lot of that stuff right this concept
of

11104
03:05:04,550 --> 03:05:04,560
of
 

11105
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:06,630
of
okay you know when you get over to like

11106

like like like
 

11109
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:09,670
like like like
hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia these

11110
03:05:09,670 --> 03:05:09,680
hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia these
 

11111
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:11,349
hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia these
things are clearly

11112
03:05:11,349 --> 03:05:11,359
things are clearly
 

11113
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:13,590
things are clearly
real somewhat biological and then over

11114
03:05:13,590 --> 03:05:13,600
real somewhat biological and then over
 

11115
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:15,429
real somewhat biological and then over
here on the spectrum you have like

11116
03:05:15,429 --> 03:05:15,439
here on the spectrum you have like
 

11117
03:05:15,439 --> 03:05:18,309
here on the spectrum you have like
a dd and oppositional defiance disorder

11118
03:05:18,309 --> 03:05:18,319
a dd and oppositional defiance disorder
 

11119
03:05:18,319 --> 03:05:18,710
a dd and oppositional defiance disorder
and

11120
03:05:18,710 --> 03:05:18,720
and
 

11121
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:21,190
and
these things that are like wait this is

11122
03:05:21,190 --> 03:05:21,200
these things that are like wait this is
 

11123
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:23,190
these things that are like wait this is
normal spectrum human behavior like this

11124
03:05:23,190 --> 03:05:23,200
normal spectrum human behavior like this
 

11125
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:25,910
normal spectrum human behavior like this
isn't

11126
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:25,920

 

11127
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:28,790

you know where's the the line here and

11128
03:05:28,790 --> 03:05:28,800
you know where's the the line here and
 

11129
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:30,309
you know where's the the line here and
why is this like a

11130
03:05:30,309 --> 03:05:30,319
why is this like a
 

11131
03:05:30,319 --> 03:05:32,950
why is this like a
problem so there's this whole this you

11132
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:32,960
problem so there's this whole this you
 

11133
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:35,429
problem so there's this whole this you
know the neurodiversity of humanity is

11134
03:05:35,429 --> 03:05:35,439
know the neurodiversity of humanity is
 

11135
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:37,269
know the neurodiversity of humanity is
huge like people think i'm always on

11136
03:05:37,269 --> 03:05:37,279
huge like people think i'm always on
 

11137
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:38,550
huge like people think i'm always on
drugs people are saying this to me on my

11138
03:05:38,550 --> 03:05:38,560
drugs people are saying this to me on my
 

11139
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:40,070
drugs people are saying this to me on my
streams and like guys you know like i'm

11140
03:05:40,070 --> 03:05:40,080
streams and like guys you know like i'm
 

11141
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:41,910
streams and like guys you know like i'm
real open with my drug use i'd tell you

11142
03:05:41,910 --> 03:05:41,920

morning but other than that this is just
 

11149
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:47,190
morning but other than that this is just
me

11150
03:05:47,190 --> 03:05:47,200
me
 

11151
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:51,429
me
you're witnessing my brain and action

11152
03:05:51,429 --> 03:05:51,439
you're witnessing my brain and action
 

11153
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:54,469
you're witnessing my brain and action
so so the word madness doesn't even uh

11154
03:05:54,469 --> 03:05:54,479
so so the word madness doesn't even uh
 

11155
03:05:54,479 --> 03:05:56,550
so so the word madness doesn't even uh
make sense and then you're in the rich

11156
03:05:56,550 --> 03:05:56,560
make sense and then you're in the rich
 

11157
03:05:56,560 --> 03:05:58,950
make sense and then you're in the rich
neurodiversity of

11158
03:05:58,950 --> 03:05:58,960
neurodiversity of
 

11159
03:05:58,960 --> 03:06:02,950
neurodiversity of
humans i think it makes sense but only

11160
03:06:02,950 --> 03:06:02,960
humans i think it makes sense but only
 

11161
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:04,230
humans i think it makes sense but only
for

11162
03:06:04,230 --> 03:06:04,240
for
 

11163
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:07,670
for
like some insane extremes like if you

11164
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:07,680
like some insane extremes like if you
 

11165
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:07,910
like some insane extremes like if you
are

11166
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:07,920
are
 

11167
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:12,630
are
actually like visibly hallucinating

11168
03:06:12,630 --> 03:06:12,640
actually like visibly hallucinating
 

11169
03:06:12,640 --> 03:06:15,429
actually like visibly hallucinating
um you know that's okay but there is the

11170
03:06:15,429 --> 03:06:15,439
um you know that's okay but there is the
 

11171
03:06:15,439 --> 03:06:17,349
um you know that's okay but there is the
kind of spectrum on which you stand out

11172
03:06:17,349 --> 03:06:17,359
kind of spectrum on which you stand out
 

11173
03:06:17,359 --> 03:06:20,790
kind of spectrum on which you stand out
like that that's uh like if i were to

11174
03:06:20,790 --> 03:06:20,800
like that that's uh like if i were to
 

11175
03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:23,030
like that that's uh like if i were to
look you know at decorations on a

11176
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:23,040
look you know at decorations on a
 

11177
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:24,950
look you know at decorations on a
christmas tree or something like that

11178
03:06:24,950 --> 03:06:24,960
christmas tree or something like that
 

11179
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:27,910
christmas tree or something like that
like if you were a decoration out that

11180
03:06:27,910 --> 03:06:27,920
like if you were a decoration out that
 

11181
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:29,429
like if you were a decoration out that
would catch my eye like

11182
03:06:29,429 --> 03:06:29,439
would catch my eye like
 

11183
03:06:29,439 --> 03:06:32,790
would catch my eye like
that thing is sparkly

11184
03:06:32,790 --> 03:06:32,800

 

11185
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:35,349

whatever the hell that thing is uh

11186
03:06:35,349 --> 03:06:35,359
whatever the hell that thing is uh
 

11187
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:37,269
whatever the hell that thing is uh
there's something to that

11188
03:06:37,269 --> 03:06:37,279
there's something to that
 

11189
03:06:37,279 --> 03:06:41,110
there's something to that
just like refusing to be um

11190
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:41,120
just like refusing to be um
 

11191
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:43,830
just like refusing to be um
boring or maybe boring is the wrong word

11192

boring or maybe boring is the wrong word
 

11193
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:46,630
boring or maybe boring is the wrong word
but to um

11194

yeah i mean be willing to sparkle
 

11197
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,190
yeah i mean be willing to sparkle
you know it's it's like somewhat

11198
03:06:53,190 --> 03:06:53,200
you know it's it's like somewhat
 

11199
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,550
you know it's it's like somewhat
constructed i mean

11200
03:06:54,550 --> 03:06:54,560
constructed i mean
 

11201
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:58,389
constructed i mean
i am who i choose to be uh

11202
03:06:58,389 --> 03:06:58,399
i am who i choose to be uh
 

11203
03:06:58,399 --> 03:06:59,990
i am who i choose to be uh
i'm gonna say things as true as i can

11204
03:06:59,990 --> 03:07:00,000
i'm gonna say things as true as i can
 

11205
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:03,670
i'm gonna say things as true as i can
see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

11206
03:07:03,670 --> 03:07:03,680
see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
 

11207
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:05,670
see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
lie and but that's a really important

11208
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:05,680
lie and but that's a really important
 

11209
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:07,429
lie and but that's a really important
feature in itself so like whatever the

11210
03:07:07,429 --> 03:07:07,439
feature in itself so like whatever the
 

11211
03:07:07,439 --> 03:07:08,950
feature in itself so like whatever the
neurodiversity of your

11212
03:07:08,950 --> 03:07:08,960
neurodiversity of your
 

11213
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:12,630
neurodiversity of your
whatever your brain is not putting um

11214
03:07:12,630 --> 03:07:12,640
whatever your brain is not putting um
 

11215
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:15,510
whatever your brain is not putting um
constraints on it that force it to to

11216
