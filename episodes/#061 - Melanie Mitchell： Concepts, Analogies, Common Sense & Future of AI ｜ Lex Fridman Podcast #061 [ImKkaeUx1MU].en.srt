artificial intelligence and what from

166
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:23,670
artificial intelligence and what from
 

167
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,140
artificial intelligence and what from
what I read he called it that to

168
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,150
what I read he called it that to
 

169
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,910
what I read he called it that to
differentiate it from cybernetics which

170
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
differentiate it from cybernetics which
 

171
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,449
differentiate it from cybernetics which
was another related movement at the time

172
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:32,459
was another related movement at the time
 

173
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,740
was another related movement at the time
and he later regretted calling it

174
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:36,750
and he later regretted calling it
 

175
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,830
and he later regretted calling it
artificial intelligence Herbert Simon

176
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
artificial intelligence Herbert Simon
 

177
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,379
artificial intelligence Herbert Simon
was pushing for calling it complex

178
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:42,389
was pushing for calling it complex
 

179
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,940
was pushing for calling it complex
information processing which got nixed

180
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:46,950
information processing which got nixed
 

181
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,409
information processing which got nixed
but you know probably is equally vague I

182
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:51,419
but you know probably is equally vague I
 

183
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,020
but you know probably is equally vague I
guess is it the intelligence or the

184
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,030
guess is it the intelligence or the
 

185
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,509
guess is it the intelligence or the
artificial in terms of words that it's

186
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:56,519
artificial in terms of words that it's
 

187
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,339
artificial in terms of words that it's
the most problematic you would you say

188
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:58,349
the most problematic you would you say
 

189
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,159
the most problematic you would you say
yeah I think it's a little of both but

190
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,169
yeah I think it's a little of both but
 

191
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,449
yeah I think it's a little of both but
you know it has some good size because I

192
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:04,459
you know it has some good size because I
 

193
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,830
you know it has some good size because I
personally was attracted to the field

194
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:06,840
personally was attracted to the field
 

195
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,659
personally was attracted to the field
because I was interested in phenom

196
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:08,669
because I was interested in phenom
 

197
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,750
because I was interested in phenom
phenomenons of intelligence and if it

198
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
phenomenons of intelligence and if it
 

199
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,979
phenomenons of intelligence and if it
was called complex information

200
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:12,989
was called complex information
 

201
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,809
was called complex information
processing maybe I'd be doing something

202
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
processing maybe I'd be doing something
 

203
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,580
processing maybe I'd be doing something
wholly different now what do you think

204
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:16,590
wholly different now what do you think
 

205
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,159
wholly different now what do you think
of I've heard the term used cognitive

206
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:19,169
of I've heard the term used cognitive
 

207
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,879
of I've heard the term used cognitive
systems for example so using cognitive

208
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:21,889
systems for example so using cognitive
 

209
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,260
systems for example so using cognitive
yeah I mean cognitive has certain

210
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,270
yeah I mean cognitive has certain
 

211
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,879
yeah I mean cognitive has certain
associations with it and people like to

212
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:28,889
associations with it and people like to
 

213
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,100
associations with it and people like to
separate things like cognition and

214
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,110
separate things like cognition and
 

215
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,779
separate things like cognition and
perception which I don't actually think

216
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:32,789
perception which I don't actually think
 

217
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,529
perception which I don't actually think
are separate but often people talk about

218
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:35,539
are separate but often people talk about
 

219
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:38,210
are separate but often people talk about
cognition is being different from sort

220
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,220
cognition is being different from sort
 

221
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,480
cognition is being different from sort
of other aspects of intelligence it's

222
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,490
of other aspects of intelligence it's
 

223
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,640
of other aspects of intelligence it's
sort of higher level so to you cognition

224
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:43,650
sort of higher level so to you cognition
 

225
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,649
sort of higher level so to you cognition
is this broad beautiful mess of things

226
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:45,659
is this broad beautiful mess of things
 

227
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,670
is this broad beautiful mess of things
that's in calm

228
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,680
that's in calm
 

229
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,390
that's in calm
the whole thing memory yeah I I think

230
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
the whole thing memory yeah I I think
 

231
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,270
the whole thing memory yeah I I think
it's hard to draw lines like that when I

232
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
it's hard to draw lines like that when I
 

233
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,219
it's hard to draw lines like that when I
was coming out of grad school in the

234
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:55,229
was coming out of grad school in the
 

235
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,490
was coming out of grad school in the
night in 1990 which is when I graduated

236
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,500
night in 1990 which is when I graduated
 

237
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,400
night in 1990 which is when I graduated
that was during one of the AI winters

238
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,410
that was during one of the AI winters
 

239
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,700
that was during one of the AI winters
and I was advised to not put AI

240
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:04,710
and I was advised to not put AI
 

241
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,890
and I was advised to not put AI
artificial intelligence on my CV but

242
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:06,900
artificial intelligence on my CV but
 

243
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,340
artificial intelligence on my CV but
instead call it intelligent systems so

244
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,350
instead call it intelligent systems so
 

245
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,080
instead call it intelligent systems so
that was kind of a euphemism I guess

246
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,090
that was kind of a euphemism I guess
 

247
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,529
that was kind of a euphemism I guess
what about the stick briefly on on terms

248
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:18,539
what about the stick briefly on on terms
 

249
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,550
what about the stick briefly on on terms
and words the idea of artificial general

250
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
and words the idea of artificial general
 

251
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,710
and words the idea of artificial general

253
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,810

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:29,820
prefers human level intelligence sort of

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,779
prefers human level intelligence sort of
starting to talk about ideas that that

256
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:34,789
starting to talk about ideas that that
 

257
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,010
starting to talk about ideas that that
achieve higher and higher levels of

achieve higher and higher levels of

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,779
achieve higher and higher levels of

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,490
intelligence seems to be a term used
 

263
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,150
intelligence seems to be a term used
more for the narrow very specific

more for the narrow very specific

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:50,940
there's the what set of terms appeal to
 

269
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,420
there's the what set of terms appeal to
you to describe the thing that perhaps

you to describe the thing that perhaps

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,640
exactly what it is that we're talking
about you know John Searle had this

280
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:04,650
about you know John Searle had this
 

281
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,339
about you know John Searle had this
distinction between strong AI and weak

282
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:07,349
distinction between strong AI and weak
 

283
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,580
distinction between strong AI and weak
AI and weak AI could be generally AI but

284
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:10,590
AI and weak AI could be generally AI but
 

285
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,750
AI and weak AI could be generally AI but
his idea was strong AI was the view that

286
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:14,760
his idea was strong AI was the view that
 

287
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,860
his idea was strong AI was the view that
a machine is actually thinking that as

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:18,870
a machine is actually thinking that as
 

289
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,950
a machine is actually thinking that as
opposed to simulating thinking or

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:23,960
opposed to simulating thinking or
 

291
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,100
opposed to simulating thinking or
carrying out intelligent processes that

292
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,110
carrying out intelligent processes that
 

293
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,150
carrying out intelligent processes that
we would call intelligent

294
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,160
we would call intelligent
 

295
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,390
we would call intelligent
high level if you look at the founding

296
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
high level if you look at the founding
 

297
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,580
high level if you look at the founding
of the field of McCarthy in sterlin and

298
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,590
of the field of McCarthy in sterlin and
 

299
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,840
of the field of McCarthy in sterlin and
so on are we closer to having a better

300
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:40,850
so on are we closer to having a better
 

301
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,750
so on are we closer to having a better
sense of that line between narrow weak

302
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:46,760
sense of that line between narrow weak
 

303
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,520
sense of that line between narrow weak
AI and strong AI yes I think we're

304
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,530
AI and strong AI yes I think we're
 

305
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,780
AI and strong AI yes I think we're
closer to having a better idea of what

306
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:55,790
closer to having a better idea of what
 

307
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,970
closer to having a better idea of what
that line is early on for example a lot

308
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:00,980
that line is early on for example a lot
 

309
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,490
that line is early on for example a lot
of people thought that playing chess

310
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:03,500
of people thought that playing chess
 

311
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,030
of people thought that playing chess
would be you couldn't play chess if you

312
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,040
would be you couldn't play chess if you
 

313
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,910
would be you couldn't play chess if you
didn't have sort of general human level

314
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:09,920
didn't have sort of general human level
 

315
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,310
didn't have sort of general human level
intelligence and of course once

316
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,320
intelligence and of course once
 

317
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,110
intelligence and of course once
computers were able to play chess better

318
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,120
computers were able to play chess better
 

319
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,120
computers were able to play chess better
than humans that revised that view and

320
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,130
than humans that revised that view and
 

321
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,610
than humans that revised that view and
people said ok well maybe now we have to

322
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:21,620
people said ok well maybe now we have to
 

323
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,490
people said ok well maybe now we have to
revise what we think of intelligence as

324
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:24,500
revise what we think of intelligence as
 

325
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,540
revise what we think of intelligence as
or and and so that's kind of been a

326
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,550
or and and so that's kind of been a
 

327
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,560
or and and so that's kind of been a
theme throughout the history of the

328
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,570
theme throughout the history of the
 

329
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,530
theme throughout the history of the
field is that once a machine can do some

330
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:32,540
field is that once a machine can do some
 

331
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,340
field is that once a machine can do some
task we then have to look back and say

332
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,350
task we then have to look back and say
 

333
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,800
task we then have to look back and say
oh well that changes my understanding of

334
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,810
oh well that changes my understanding of
 

335
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,270
oh well that changes my understanding of
what intelligence is because I don't

336
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,280
what intelligence is because I don't
 

337
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,060
what intelligence is because I don't
think that machine is intelligent at

338
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,070
think that machine is intelligent at
 

339
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,140
think that machine is intelligent at
least that's not what I want to call

340
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,150
least that's not what I want to call
 

341
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,450
least that's not what I want to call
intelligence do you think that line

342
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,460
intelligence do you think that line
 

343
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,080
intelligence do you think that line
moves forever or will we eventually

344
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,090
moves forever or will we eventually
 

345
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,490
moves forever or will we eventually
really feel as a civilization like we

346
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:51,500
really feel as a civilization like we
 

347
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,130
really feel as a civilization like we
cross the line if it's possible it's

348
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,140
cross the line if it's possible it's
 

349
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
cross the line if it's possible it's
hard to predict but I don't see any

350
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,150
hard to predict but I don't see any
 

351
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,860
hard to predict but I don't see any
reason why we couldn't in principle

352
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:58,870
reason why we couldn't in principle
 

353
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,820
reason why we couldn't in principle
create something that we would consider

354
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:00,830
create something that we would consider
 

355
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,050
create something that we would consider
intelligent I don't know how we will

356
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,060
intelligent I don't know how we will
 

357
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,550
intelligent I don't know how we will
know for sure maybe our own view of what

358
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:09,560
know for sure maybe our own view of what
 

359
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,010
know for sure maybe our own view of what
intelligence is will be refined more and

360
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,020
intelligence is will be refined more and
 

361
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,110
intelligence is will be refined more and
more until we finally figure out what we

362
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,120
more until we finally figure out what we
 

363
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,100
more until we finally figure out what we
mean when we talk about it but I I think

364
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,110
mean when we talk about it but I I think
 

365
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,330
mean when we talk about it but I I think
eventually we will create machines in a

366
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:22,340
eventually we will create machines in a
 

367
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,670
eventually we will create machines in a
sense that have intelligence they may

368
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:24,680
sense that have intelligence they may
 

369
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,740

not be the kinds of machines we have now

370
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:26,750
not be the kinds of machines we have now
 

371
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,310
not be the kinds of machines we have now
and one of the things that that's going

372
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,320
and one of the things that that's going
 

373
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,029
and one of the things that that's going
to produce is is making us sort of

no we we we do have to understand our

no we we we do have to understand our

no we we we do have to understand our

own minds at least to some significant

extent but it I think that's a really
 

423
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,590
extent but it I think that's a really
big open question I've been very

424
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
big open question I've been very
 

425
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,810
big open question I've been very
surprised at how far kind of brute force

426
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:49,820
surprised at how far kind of brute force
 

427
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,770
surprised at how far kind of brute force
approaches based on say big data and

approaches based on say big data and

huge networks can can take us I wouldn't

have expected that and they have nothing

have expected that and they have nothing

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,250

to do with the way our minds work so

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,260
to do with the way our minds work so
 

435
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,530
to do with the way our minds work so
that's been surprising to me so it could

436
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:05,540
that's been surprising to me so it could
 

437
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,630
that's been surprising to me so it could
be wrong to explore the psychological

438
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:07,640
be wrong to explore the psychological
 

439
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,120
be wrong to explore the psychological
and the philosophical do you think we're

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,130
and the philosophical do you think we're
 

441
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,930
and the philosophical do you think we're
okay as a species with something that's

okay as a species with something that's

okay as a species with something that's
more intelligent than us do you think

more intelligent than us do you think
 

445
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,910
more intelligent than us do you think
perhaps the reason we're pushing that

perhaps the reason we're pushing that
 

447
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,460
perhaps the reason we're pushing that
line farther and farther is we're afraid

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,470
line farther and farther is we're afraid
 

449
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,830
line farther and farther is we're afraid
of acknowledging that there's something

well I'm not sure we can define

well I'm not sure we can define

intelligence that way because you know

doesn't bother me at all I guess the

484
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,330
doesn't bother me at all I guess the
 

485
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,960
doesn't bother me at all I guess the
question is you know what which things

486
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:13,970
question is you know what which things
 

487
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,440
question is you know what which things
about our intelligence would we feel

488
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,450
about our intelligence would we feel
 

489
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,600
about our intelligence would we feel
very sad or or upset that machine's had

490
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:22,610
very sad or or upset that machine's had
 

491
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,090
very sad or or upset that machine's had
been able to recreate so in the book I

492
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,100
been able to recreate so in the book I
 

493
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,730
been able to recreate so in the book I

Hofstadter who encountered a music

496
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:30,950
Hofstadter who encountered a music
 

497
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,290
Hofstadter who encountered a music
generation program and that was really

498
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:35,300
generation program and that was really
 

499
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,990
generation program and that was really
the line for him that if a machine could

500
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
the line for him that if a machine could
 

501
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,850
the line for him that if a machine could
create beautiful music that would be

502
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:41,860
create beautiful music that would be
 

503
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,370
create beautiful music that would be
terrifying for him because that is

504
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,380
terrifying for him because that is
 

505
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,010
terrifying for him because that is
something he feels is really at the core

506
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,020
something he feels is really at the core
 

507
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,470
something he feels is really at the core
of what it is to be human creating

508
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
of what it is to be human creating
 

509
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,800
of what it is to be human creating
beautiful music art literature I you

510
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:53,810
beautiful music art literature I you
 

511
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,860
beautiful music art literature I you
know I don't think he doesn't like the

512
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:56,870
know I don't think he doesn't like the
 

513
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,010
know I don't think he doesn't like the
fact that machines can recognize spoken

514
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,020
fact that machines can recognize spoken
 

515
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,530
fact that machines can recognize spoken
language really well like he doesn't he

516
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:05,540
language really well like he doesn't he
 

517
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,440
language really well like he doesn't he
personally doesn't like using speech

518
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,450
personally doesn't like using speech
 

519
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,660
personally doesn't like using speech
recognition I don't think it bothers him

520
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:10,670
recognition I don't think it bothers him
 

521
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,519
recognition I don't think it bothers him
to his core because it's like okay

522
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,529
to his core because it's like okay
 

523
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,910
to his core because it's like okay
that's not at the core of humanity but

524
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
that's not at the core of humanity but
 

525
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
that's not at the core of humanity but
it may be different for every person

526
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,330
it may be different for every person
 

527
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,320
it may be different for every person
what what really they feel would usurp

528
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,330
what what really they feel would usurp
 

529
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,019
what what really they feel would usurp
their humanity and I think maybe it's a

530
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:26,029
their humanity and I think maybe it's a
 

531
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,910
their humanity and I think maybe it's a
generational thing also maybe our

532
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
generational thing also maybe our
 

533
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,170
generational thing also maybe our
children or our children's children will

534
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,180
children or our children's children will
 

535
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,720
children or our children's children will
be adapted they'll adapt to these new

536
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:34,730
be adapted they'll adapt to these new
 

537
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,750
be adapted they'll adapt to these new
devices that can do all these tasks and

538
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
devices that can do all these tasks and
 

539
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,120
devices that can do all these tasks and
and say yes this thing is smarter than

540
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,130
and say yes this thing is smarter than
 

541
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,420
and say yes this thing is smarter than
me in all these areas but that's great

542
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,430
me in all these areas but that's great
 

543
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,710
me in all these areas but that's great
because it helps me looking at the broad

544
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:47,720
because it helps me looking at the broad
 

545
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,040
because it helps me looking at the broad
history of our species why do you think

546
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,050
history of our species why do you think
 

547
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,990
history of our species why do you think
so many humans have dreamed of creating

548
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,000
so many humans have dreamed of creating
 

549
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,610
so many humans have dreamed of creating
artificial life and artificial

550
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:54,620
artificial life and artificial
 

551
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,260

intelligence throughout the history of

552
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,270
intelligence throughout the history of
 

553
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,900
intelligence throughout the history of
our civilization so not just this

554
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:58,910
our civilization so not just this
 

555
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,389
our civilization so not just this
century or the 20th century but really

556
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:01,399
century or the 20th century but really
 

557
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,970
century or the 20th century but really
many throughout many centuries that

558
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:03,980
many throughout many centuries that
 

559
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,269
many throughout many centuries that
preceded it that's a really good

560
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
preceded it that's a really good
 

561
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,390
preceded it that's a really good
question and I have wondered about that

562
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,400
question and I have wondered about that
 

563
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,190
question and I have wondered about that
because I'm I myself

564
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,200
because I'm I myself
 

565
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,700
because I'm I myself
you know was driven by curiosity about

566
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:16,710
you know was driven by curiosity about
 

567
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,580
you know was driven by curiosity about
my own thought processes and thought it

568
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:19,590
my own thought processes and thought it
 

569
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,440
my own thought processes and thought it
would be fantastic to be able to get a

570
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,450
would be fantastic to be able to get a
 

571
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,140
would be fantastic to be able to get a
computer to mimic some of my thought

572
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,150
computer to mimic some of my thought
 

573
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,830
computer to mimic some of my thought
process season I'm not sure why we're so

574
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:27,840
process season I'm not sure why we're so
 

575
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:35,540
process season I'm not sure why we're so
driven I think we want to understand

576
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:35,550
driven I think we want to understand
 

577
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,150
driven I think we want to understand
ourselves better and we also want

578
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
ourselves better and we also want
 

579
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,900
ourselves better and we also want
machines to do things for us but I don't

580
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:44,910
machines to do things for us but I don't
 

581
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,160
machines to do things for us but I don't
know there's something more to it

582
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,170
know there's something more to it
 

583
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,620
know there's something more to it
because it's so deep in in the kind of

584
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:48,630
because it's so deep in in the kind of
 

585
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,120
because it's so deep in in the kind of
Mythology or the dose of our species and

586
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
Mythology or the dose of our species and
 

587
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,010
Mythology or the dose of our species and
I don't think other species have this

588
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,020
I don't think other species have this
 

589
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,070
I don't think other species have this
drive so I don't know if you were to

590
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,080
drive so I don't know if you were to
 

591
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,990
drive so I don't know if you were to
sort of psychoanalyze yourself and

592
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
sort of psychoanalyze yourself and
 

593
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
sort of psychoanalyze yourself and
you're in your own interest in AI are

594
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:02,730
you're in your own interest in AI are
 

595
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,740
you're in your own interest in AI are
you what excites you about creating

596
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:06,750
you what excites you about creating
 

597
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,720
you what excites you about creating
intelligence you said understanding our

598
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:08,730
intelligence you said understanding our
 

599
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,680
intelligence you said understanding our
own selves

600
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:09,690
own selves
 

601
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,560
own selves
yeah I think that's what drives me

602
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:11,570
yeah I think that's what drives me
 

603
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,720
yeah I think that's what drives me
particularly I'm really interested in

604
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:17,730
particularly I'm really interested in
 

605
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:24,200
particularly I'm really interested in
human intelligence but I'm all I'm also

606
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,210
human intelligence but I'm all I'm also
 

607
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,730
human intelligence but I'm all I'm also
interested in the sort of the phenomenon

608
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:25,740
interested in the sort of the phenomenon
 

609
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,580
interested in the sort of the phenomenon
of intelligence more generally and I

610
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:28,590
of intelligence more generally and I
 

611
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,780
of intelligence more generally and I
don't think humans are the only thing

612
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:29,790
don't think humans are the only thing
 

613
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,770
don't think humans are the only thing
with intelligence

614
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:30,780
with intelligence
 

615
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,640
with intelligence
you know I or even animals that I think

616
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:34,650
you know I or even animals that I think
 

617
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,800
you know I or even animals that I think
intelligence is a concept that

618
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:39,810
intelligence is a concept that
 

619
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,220
intelligence is a concept that
encompasses a lot of complex systems and

620
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,230
encompasses a lot of complex systems and
 

621
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,730
encompasses a lot of complex systems and
if you think of things like insect

622
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:46,740
if you think of things like insect
 

623
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,960
if you think of things like insect
colonies or cellular processes or the

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:50,970
colonies or cellular processes or the
 

625
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,790
colonies or cellular processes or the
immune system or all kinds of different

biological or even societal processes

628
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
biological or even societal processes
 

629
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,840
biological or even societal processes
have as an emergent property some

630
00:14:59,840 --> 00:14:59,850
have as an emergent property some
 

631
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,190
have as an emergent property some
aspects of what we would call

632
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,200
aspects of what we would call
 

633
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,410
aspects of what we would call
intelligence you know they have memory

634
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,420
intelligence you know they have memory
 

635
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,450
intelligence you know they have memory
they do in process information they have

636
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,460
they do in process information they have
 

637
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,060
they do in process information they have
goals they accomplish their goals etc

638
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,070
goals they accomplish their goals etc
 

639
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,050
goals they accomplish their goals etc
and to me that the question of what is

640
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,060
and to me that the question of what is
 

641
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,610
and to me that the question of what is
this thing we're talking about here was

642
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:15,620
this thing we're talking about here was
 

643
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,470
this thing we're talking about here was
really fascinating to me and and

644
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
really fascinating to me and and
 

645
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,170
really fascinating to me and and
exploring it using computers seem to be

646
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,180
exploring it using computers seem to be
 

647
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,080
exploring it using computers seem to be
a good way to approach the question so

648
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,090
a good way to approach the question so
 

649
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,129
a good way to approach the question so
do you think kind of

650
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:25,139
do you think kind of
 

651
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,869
do you think kind of
intelligence do you think of our

652
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:26,879
intelligence do you think of our
 

653
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,119
intelligence do you think of our
universes a kind of hierarchy of complex

654
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:29,129
universes a kind of hierarchy of complex
 

655
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,309
universes a kind of hierarchy of complex
systems and then intelligence is just

656
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:31,319
systems and then intelligence is just
 

657
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,340
systems and then intelligence is just
the property of any you can look at any

658
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,350
the property of any you can look at any
 

659
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,749
the property of any you can look at any
level and every level has some aspect of

660
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:38,759
level and every level has some aspect of
 

661
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,129
level and every level has some aspect of
intelligence so we're just like one

662
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:40,139
intelligence so we're just like one
 

663
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,379
intelligence so we're just like one
little speck in that giant hierarchy of

664
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:42,389
little speck in that giant hierarchy of
 

665
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,019
little speck in that giant hierarchy of
complex systems I don't know if I would

666
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:45,029
complex systems I don't know if I would
 

667
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,340
complex systems I don't know if I would
say any system like that has

668
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,350
say any system like that has
 

669
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,379
say any system like that has
intelligence but I guess what I want to

670
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:51,389
intelligence but I guess what I want to
 

671
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,530
intelligence but I guess what I want to
I don't have a good enough definition of

672
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:54,540
I don't have a good enough definition of
 

673
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,319
I don't have a good enough definition of
intelligence to say that so let me let

674
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:57,329
intelligence to say that so let me let
 

675
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,970
intelligence to say that so let me let
me do sort of multiple choice I guess

676
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:58,980
me do sort of multiple choice I guess
 

677
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,979
me do sort of multiple choice I guess
though

678
00:15:59,979 --> 00:15:59,989
though
 

679
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:03,139
though
so you said ant colonies so our ant

680
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:03,149
so you said ant colonies so our ant
 

681
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,039
so you said ant colonies so our ant
colonies intelligent are the bacteria in

682
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:07,049
colonies intelligent are the bacteria in
 

683
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,889
colonies intelligent are the bacteria in
our body in intelligent and then look

684
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:09,899
our body in intelligent and then look
 

685
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,849
our body in intelligent and then look
going to the physics world molecules and

686
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:13,859
going to the physics world molecules and
 

687
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,379
going to the physics world molecules and
the behavior at the quantum level of of

688
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:17,389
the behavior at the quantum level of of
 

689
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,299
the behavior at the quantum level of of
electrons and so on is are those kinds

690
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:20,309
electrons and so on is are those kinds
 

691
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,280
electrons and so on is are those kinds
of systems do they possess intelligence

692
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,290
of systems do they possess intelligence
 

693
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,819
of systems do they possess intelligence
like words where's the line that feels

694
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:25,829
like words where's the line that feels
 

695
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,309
like words where's the line that feels
compelling to you I don't know I mean I

696
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:28,319
compelling to you I don't know I mean I
 

697
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,159
compelling to you I don't know I mean I
think intelligence is a continuum and I

698
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,169
think intelligence is a continuum and I
 

699
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,909
think intelligence is a continuum and I
think that the ability to in some sense

700
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:34,919
think that the ability to in some sense
 

701
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,669
think that the ability to in some sense
have intention have a goal have a some

702
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:40,679
have intention have a goal have a some
 

703
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,720
have intention have a goal have a some
kind of self-awareness is part of it

704
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,730
kind of self-awareness is part of it
 

705
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,199
kind of self-awareness is part of it
so I'm not sure if you know it's hard to

706
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:48,209
so I'm not sure if you know it's hard to
 

707
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,479
so I'm not sure if you know it's hard to
know where to draw that line I think

708
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:50,489
know where to draw that line I think
 

709
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,850
know where to draw that line I think
that's kind of a mystery but I wouldn't

710
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:52,860
that's kind of a mystery but I wouldn't
 

711
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,449
that's kind of a mystery but I wouldn't
say that say that you know this the

712
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:56,459
say that say that you know this the
 

713
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,479
say that say that you know this the
planets orbiting the Sun her is an

714
00:16:59,479 --> 00:16:59,489
planets orbiting the Sun her is an
 

715
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,689
planets orbiting the Sun her is an
intelligent system I mean I would find

716
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:02,699
intelligent system I mean I would find
 

717
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,090
intelligent system I mean I would find
that maybe not the right term to

718
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,100
that maybe not the right term to
 

719
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,250
that maybe not the right term to
describe that and this is you know

720
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,260
describe that and this is you know
 

721
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,199
describe that and this is you know
there's all this debate in the field of

722
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,209
there's all this debate in the field of
 

723
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,329
there's all this debate in the field of
like what's what's the right way to

724
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
like what's what's the right way to
 

725
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,189
like what's what's the right way to
define intelligence what's the right way

726
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
define intelligence what's the right way
 

727
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,710
define intelligence what's the right way
to model intelligence should we think

728
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:15,720
to model intelligence should we think
 

729
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,210
to model intelligence should we think
about computation should we think about

730
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,220
about computation should we think about
 

731
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,389
about computation should we think about
dynamics and should we think about you

732
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:20,399
dynamics and should we think about you
 

733
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,329
dynamics and should we think about you
know free energy and all of that stuff

734
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:23,339
know free energy and all of that stuff
 

735
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,990
know free energy and all of that stuff
and I think that it's it's a fantastic

736
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
and I think that it's it's a fantastic
 

737
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,639
and I think that it's it's a fantastic
time to be in the field because there's

738
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:28,649
time to be in the field because there's
 

739
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,039
time to be in the field because there's
so many questions and so much we don't

740
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,049
so many questions and so much we don't
 

741
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,950
so many questions and so much we don't
understand there's so much work to do so

742
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:33,960
understand there's so much work to do so
 

743
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,100
understand there's so much work to do so
are we are we the most special kind of

744
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,110
are we are we the most special kind of
 

745
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,450
are we are we the most special kind of
intelligence

746
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,460
intelligence
 

747
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,630
intelligence
this kind of you said there's a bunch of

748
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:41,640
this kind of you said there's a bunch of
 

749
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,520
this kind of you said there's a bunch of
different elements and characteristics

750
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,530
different elements and characteristics
 

751
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,940
different elements and characteristics
of intelligent systems and colonies are

752
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:49,950
of intelligent systems and colonies are
 

753
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,190
of intelligent systems and colonies are
his human intelligence the thing in our

754
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,200
his human intelligence the thing in our
 

755
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,260
his human intelligence the thing in our
brain is that the most interesting kind

756
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,270
brain is that the most interesting kind
 

757
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,270
brain is that the most interesting kind
of intelligence in this continuum

758
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,280
of intelligence in this continuum
 

759
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,450
of intelligence in this continuum
well it's interesting to us because

760
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:58,460
well it's interesting to us because
 

761
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,420
well it's interesting to us because
because it is us I mean interesting to

762
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,430
because it is us I mean interesting to
 

763
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,630
because it is us I mean interesting to
me yes and because I'm part of the you

764
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
me yes and because I'm part of the you
 

765
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,610
me yes and because I'm part of the you
know human but to understanding the

766
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:07,620
know human but to understanding the
 

767
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,990
know human but to understanding the
fundamentals of intelligence what I'm

yeah yeah Jerry is studying the human is

770
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,100
yeah yeah Jerry is studying the human is
 

771
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,950
yeah yeah Jerry is studying the human is
sort of if everything we've talked about

772
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
sort of if everything we've talked about
 

773
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,070
sort of if everything we've talked about
will you talk about in your book what

774
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,080
will you talk about in your book what
 

775
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,980
will you talk about in your book what
just the AI field this notion yes it's

776
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:18,990
just the AI field this notion yes it's
 

777
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,350
just the AI field this notion yes it's
hard to define but it's usually talking

778
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
hard to define but it's usually talking
 

779
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,630
hard to define but it's usually talking
about something that's very akin to

780
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,640
about something that's very akin to
 

781
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,970
about something that's very akin to
human intelligence to me it is the most

782
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:25,980
human intelligence to me it is the most
 

783
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,010
human intelligence to me it is the most
interesting because it's the most

784
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,020
interesting because it's the most
 

785
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,210
interesting because it's the most
complex I think it's the most self-aware

786
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,220
complex I think it's the most self-aware
 

787
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,490
complex I think it's the most self-aware
it's the only system at least that I

788
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,500
it's the only system at least that I
 

789
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,710
it's the only system at least that I
know of that reflects on its own

790
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
know of that reflects on its own
 

791
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,650
know of that reflects on its own
intelligence and you talk about the

792
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:39,660
intelligence and you talk about the
 

793
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,340
intelligence and you talk about the
history of AI and us in terms of

794
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,350
history of AI and us in terms of
 

795
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,170
history of AI and us in terms of
creating artificial intelligence being

796
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,180
creating artificial intelligence being
 

797
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,740
creating artificial intelligence being
terrible at predicting the future or the

798
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:48,750
terrible at predicting the future or the
 

799
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,300
terrible at predicting the future or the

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,310
hardware and and data that would be my
that would be my guess

960
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,320
that would be my guess
 

961
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,500
that would be my guess
you know I think that in in the the sort

962
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,510
you know I think that in in the the sort
 

963
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,350
you know I think that in in the the sort
of going along in the narrow AI that

964
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
of going along in the narrow AI that
 

965
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,470
of going along in the narrow AI that
these current the current approaches

966
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
these current the current approaches
 

967
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,170
these current the current approaches
will get better you know I think there's

968
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,180
will get better you know I think there's
 

969
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,720
will get better you know I think there's
some fundamental limits to how far

970
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:57,730
some fundamental limits to how far
 

971
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,090
some fundamental limits to how far
they're gonna get I might be wrong but

972
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,100
they're gonna get I might be wrong but
 

973
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,230
they're gonna get I might be wrong but
that's what I think but and there's some

974
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,240
that's what I think but and there's some
 

975
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,720
that's what I think but and there's some
fundamental weaknesses that they have

976
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:05,730
fundamental weaknesses that they have
 

977
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,110
fundamental weaknesses that they have
that I talked about in the book that

978
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,120
that I talked about in the book that
 

979
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,980
that I talked about in the book that
that just comes from this approach of

980
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:12,990
that just comes from this approach of
 

981
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:21,170
that just comes from this approach of
supervised learning we require requiring

982
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,180

 

983
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,390

sort of feed-forward networks and so on

984
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
sort of feed-forward networks and so on
 

985
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,220
sort of feed-forward networks and so on
it it's just I don't think it's a

986
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,230
it it's just I don't think it's a
 

987
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,000
it it's just I don't think it's a
sustainable approach to understanding

988
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,010
sustainable approach to understanding
 

989
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,880
sustainable approach to understanding
the world yeah I'm I'm personally torn

990
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:35,890
the world yeah I'm I'm personally torn
 

991
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,310
the world yeah I'm I'm personally torn
on it sort of I've everything read about

992
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
on it sort of I've everything read about
 

993
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,650
on it sort of I've everything read about
in the book and sort of we're talking

994
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:40,660
in the book and sort of we're talking
 

995
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,950
in the book and sort of we're talking
about now I agreed I agree with you but

996
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:43,960
about now I agreed I agree with you but
 

997
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,620
about now I agreed I agree with you but
I'm more and more depending on the day

998
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:46,630
I'm more and more depending on the day
 

999
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,530
I'm more and more depending on the day
first of all I'm deeply surprised by the

1000
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,540
first of all I'm deeply surprised by the
 

1001
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,570
first of all I'm deeply surprised by the
successful machine learning and deep

1002
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:51,580
successful machine learning and deep
 

1003
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,160
successful machine learning and deep
learning in general and from the very

1004
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,170
learning in general and from the very
 

1005
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,260
learning in general and from the very
beginning that when I was it's really

1006
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,270
beginning that when I was it's really
 

1007
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,420
beginning that when I was it's really
been many focus of work I'm just

1008
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,430
been many focus of work I'm just
 

1009
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,800
been many focus of work I'm just
surprised how far it gets

1010
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:58,810
surprised how far it gets
 

1011
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,550
surprised how far it gets
and I'm also think we're really early on

1012
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:02,560
and I'm also think we're really early on
 

1013
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,560
and I'm also think we're really early on
in these efforts of these narrow AI so I

1014
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,570
in these efforts of these narrow AI so I
 

1015
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,240
in these efforts of these narrow AI so I
think there will be a lot of surprise

1016
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,250
think there will be a lot of surprise
 

1017
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,330
think there will be a lot of surprise
off how far it gets

1018
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,340
off how far it gets
 

1019
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,480
off how far it gets
I think will be extremely impressed like

1020
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,490
I think will be extremely impressed like
 

1021
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,489
I think will be extremely impressed like
my senses everything I've seen so far

1022
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:16,499
my senses everything I've seen so far
 

1023
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,470
my senses everything I've seen so far
and we'll talk about autonomous driving

1024
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
and we'll talk about autonomous driving
 

1025
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,950
and we'll talk about autonomous driving
and so on I think we can get really far

1026
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
and so on I think we can get really far
 

1027
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,019
and so on I think we can get really far
but I also have a sense that we will

1028
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:24,029
but I also have a sense that we will
 

1029
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,019
but I also have a sense that we will
discover just like you said is that even

1030
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:27,029
discover just like you said is that even
 

1031
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,810
discover just like you said is that even
though we'll get really far in order to

1032
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:29,820
though we'll get really far in order to
 

1033
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,129
though we'll get really far in order to
create something like our own

1034
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:31,139
create something like our own
 

1035
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,690
create something like our own
intelligence is actually much farther

1036
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:32,700
intelligence is actually much farther
 

1037
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,799
intelligence is actually much farther
than we realized

1038
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:33,809
than we realized
 

1039
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,409
than we realized
right I think these methods are a lot

1040
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:36,419
right I think these methods are a lot
 

1041
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:37,789
right I think these methods are a lot
more powerful than people give them

1042
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:37,799
more powerful than people give them
 

1043
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,470
more powerful than people give them
credit for actually so that of course

1044
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
credit for actually so that of course
 

1045
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,659
credit for actually so that of course
there's the media hype but I think

1046
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:41,669
there's the media hype but I think
 

1047
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:43,220
there's the media hype but I think
there's a lot of researchers in the

1048
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,230
there's a lot of researchers in the
 

1049
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,039
there's a lot of researchers in the
community especially like not undergrads

1050
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:46,049
community especially like not undergrads
 

1051
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,169
community especially like not undergrads
right but like people who've been in AI

1052
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:48,179
right but like people who've been in AI
 

1053
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,299
right but like people who've been in AI
they're skeptical about how far deep

1054
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:50,309
they're skeptical about how far deep
 

1055
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,539
they're skeptical about how far deep
learning yet and I'm more and more

1056
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:52,549
learning yet and I'm more and more
 

1057
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,799
learning yet and I'm more and more
thinking that it can actually get

1058
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:54,809
thinking that it can actually get
 

1059
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,379
thinking that it can actually get
farther than I realize it's certainly

1060
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:57,389
farther than I realize it's certainly
 

1061
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,539
farther than I realize it's certainly
possible one thing that surprised me

1062
00:24:59,539 --> 00:24:59,549
possible one thing that surprised me
 

1063
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,549
possible one thing that surprised me
when I was writing the book is how far

1064
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:01,559
when I was writing the book is how far
 

1065
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,409
when I was writing the book is how far
apart different people are in the field

1066
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:03,419
apart different people are in the field
 

1067
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,310
apart different people are in the field
are artisan their opinion of how how far

1068
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
are artisan their opinion of how how far
 

1069
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,810
are artisan their opinion of how how far
the field has come and what is

1070
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:08,820
the field has come and what is
 

1071
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,340
the field has come and what is
accomplished and what's what's gonna

1072
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,350
accomplished and what's what's gonna
 

1073
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,619
accomplished and what's what's gonna
happen next what's your sense of the

1074
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:12,629
happen next what's your sense of the
 

1075
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,739
happen next what's your sense of the
different who are the different people

groups mindsets thoughts in the
 

1079
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:22,909
groups mindsets thoughts in the

1080
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:22,919
community about where AI is today yeah
 

1081
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,560
community about where AI is today yeah
they're all over the place so so there's

1082
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,570
they're all over the place so so there's
 

1083
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,580
they're all over the place so so there's
there's kind of the the singularity

1084
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:27,590
there's kind of the the singularity
 

1085
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,100
there's kind of the the singularity
transhumanism group I don't know exactly

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,110
transhumanism group I don't know exactly
 

1087
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,470
transhumanism group I don't know exactly
how to characterize that approach which

1088
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,480
how to characterize that approach which
 

1089
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,269
how to characterize that approach which
is there as well yeah the sort of

1090
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
is there as well yeah the sort of
 

1091
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,779
is there as well yeah the sort of
exponential exponential progress we're

1092
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:38,789
exponential exponential progress we're
 

1093
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,519
exponential exponential progress we're
on the sort of almost at the the hugely

1094
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:43,529
on the sort of almost at the the hugely
 

1095
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,700
on the sort of almost at the the hugely
accelerating part of the exponential and

1096
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:45,710
accelerating part of the exponential and
 

1097
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,239
accelerating part of the exponential and
by in the next 30 years we're going to

1098
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:50,249
by in the next 30 years we're going to
 

1099
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,899
by in the next 30 years we're going to
see super intelligent AI and all that

1100
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:53,909
see super intelligent AI and all that
 

1101
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,279
see super intelligent AI and all that
and we'll be able to upload our brains

1102
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:55,289
and we'll be able to upload our brains
 

1103
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,539
and we'll be able to upload our brains
and that so there's that kind of extreme

1104
00:25:59,539 --> 00:25:59,549
and that so there's that kind of extreme
 

1105
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,999
and that so there's that kind of extreme
view that most I think most people who

1106
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:02,009
view that most I think most people who
 

1107
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,180
view that most I think most people who
work in AI don't have they disagree with

1108
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,190
work in AI don't have they disagree with
 

1109
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,440
work in AI don't have they disagree with
that but there are people who who are

1110
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,450
that but there are people who who are
 

1111
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,989
that but there are people who who are
maybe don't aren't you know singularity

1112
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:11,999
maybe don't aren't you know singularity
 

1113
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,499
maybe don't aren't you know singularity
people but but they're they do think

1114
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:15,509
people but but they're they do think
 

1115
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,149
people but but they're they do think
that the current approach of deep

1116
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:17,159
that the current approach of deep
 

1117
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,600
that the current approach of deep
learning is going to scale and is going

1118
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:20,610
learning is going to scale and is going
 

1119
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,840
learning is going to scale and is going
to kind of go all the way basically and

1120
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:23,850
to kind of go all the way basically and
 

1121
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,220
to kind of go all the way basically and
take us to

1122
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,230
take us to
 

1123
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,080
take us to
ái or human-level AI or whatever you

1124
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,090
ái or human-level AI or whatever you
 

1125
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,810
ái or human-level AI or whatever you
want to call it and there's quite a few

1126
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:29,820
want to call it and there's quite a few
 

1127
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,009
want to call it and there's quite a few
of them and a lot of them like a lot of

1128
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:34,019
of them and a lot of them like a lot of
 

1129
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,060
of them and a lot of them like a lot of
the people I've met who work at big tech

1130
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,070
the people I've met who work at big tech
 

1131
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,700
the people I've met who work at big tech
companies in AI groups kind of have this

1132
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:40,710
companies in AI groups kind of have this
 

1133
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,680
companies in AI groups kind of have this
view that we're really not that far you

1134
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,690
view that we're really not that far you
 

1135
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,539
view that we're really not that far you
know just to linger on that point sort

1136
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:47,549
know just to linger on that point sort
 

1137
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,879
know just to linger on that point sort
of if I can take as an example like

1138
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:49,889
of if I can take as an example like
 

1139
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,529
of if I can take as an example like
Yannick kun I don't know if you know

1140
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:51,539
Yannick kun I don't know if you know
 

1141
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,810
Yannick kun I don't know if you know
about his work and so a few points

1142
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:53,820
about his work and so a few points
 

1143
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,120
about his work and so a few points
unless I do he believes that there's a

1144
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,130
unless I do he believes that there's a
 

1145
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,430
unless I do he believes that there's a
bunch of breakthroughs like fundamental

1146
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
bunch of breakthroughs like fundamental
 

1147
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,049
bunch of breakthroughs like fundamental
like Nobel Prizes there's yeah he did

1148
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:00,059
like Nobel Prizes there's yeah he did
 

1149
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,930
like Nobel Prizes there's yeah he did
still write but I think he thinks those

1150
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:02,940
still write but I think he thinks those
 

1151
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,549
still write but I think he thinks those
breakthroughs will be built on top of

1152
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
breakthroughs will be built on top of
 

1153
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,950
breakthroughs will be built on top of
deep learning right and then there's

1154
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
deep learning right and then there's
 

1155
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,169
deep learning right and then there's
some people who think we need to kind of

1156
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:09,179
some people who think we need to kind of
 

1157
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,230
some people who think we need to kind of
put deep learning to the side a little

1158
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
put deep learning to the side a little
 

1159
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
put deep learning to the side a little
bit as just one module that's helpful in

1160
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,450
bit as just one module that's helpful in
 

1161
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,259
bit as just one module that's helpful in
the bigger cognitive framework right so

1162
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:18,269
the bigger cognitive framework right so
 

1163
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,470
the bigger cognitive framework right so
so I think some what I understand yan

1164
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:21,480
so I think some what I understand yan
 

1165
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,610
so I think some what I understand yan
laocoön is rightly saying supervised

1166
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:25,620
laocoön is rightly saying supervised
 

1167
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,430
laocoön is rightly saying supervised
learning is not sustainable we have to

1168
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:28,440
learning is not sustainable we have to
 

1169
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
learning is not sustainable we have to
figure out how to do unsupervised

1170
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:29,850
figure out how to do unsupervised
 

1171
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,039
figure out how to do unsupervised
learning that that's going to be the key

1172
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,049
learning that that's going to be the key
 

1173
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,340
learning that that's going to be the key
and you know I think that's probably

1174
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,350
and you know I think that's probably
 

1175
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,940
and you know I think that's probably
true

1176
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:37,950
true
 

1177
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,940
true
I think unsupervised learning is going

1178
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:40,950
I think unsupervised learning is going
 

1179
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,750
I think unsupervised learning is going
to be harder than people think I mean

1180
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:44,760
to be harder than people think I mean
 

1181
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,240
to be harder than people think I mean
the way that we humans do it then

1182
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,250
the way that we humans do it then
 

1183
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,779
the way that we humans do it then
there's the opposing view you know that

1184
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:50,789
there's the opposing view you know that
 

1185
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,430
there's the opposing view you know that
there's a the the Gary Marcus kind of

1186
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:54,440
there's a the the Gary Marcus kind of
 

1187
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,350
there's a the the Gary Marcus kind of
hybrid view or where deep learning is

1188
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
hybrid view or where deep learning is
 

1189
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,269
hybrid view or where deep learning is
one part but we need to bring back kind

1190
00:27:59,269 --> 00:27:59,279
one part but we need to bring back kind
 

1191
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,930
one part but we need to bring back kind
of these symbolic approaches and combine

1192
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:02,940
of these symbolic approaches and combine
 

1193
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,000
of these symbolic approaches and combine
them of course no one knows how to do

1194
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,010
them of course no one knows how to do
 

1195
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,460
them of course no one knows how to do
that very well which is the more

1196
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,470
that very well which is the more
 

1197
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,460
that very well which is the more
important part right to emphasize and

1198
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,470
important part right to emphasize and
 

1199
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,779
important part right to emphasize and
how do they how do they fit together

1200
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:11,789
how do they how do they fit together
 

1201
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:14,029
how do they how do they fit together
what's what's the foundation what's the

1202
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:14,039
what's what's the foundation what's the
 

1203
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,039
what's what's the foundation what's the
thing that's on top yeah the cake was

1204
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,049
thing that's on top yeah the cake was
 

1205
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,940
thing that's on top yeah the cake was
the icing right yeah then there's people

1206
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:19,950
the icing right yeah then there's people
 

1207
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,879
the icing right yeah then there's people
pushing different different things

1208
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:21,889
pushing different different things
 

1209
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:24,620
pushing different different things
there's the people the causality people

1210
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:24,630
there's the people the causality people
 

1211
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,860
there's the people the causality people
who say you know deep learning as its

1212
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:27,870
who say you know deep learning as its
 

1213
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,830
who say you know deep learning as its
formulated a completely lacks any notion

1214
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:30,840
formulated a completely lacks any notion
 

1215
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,119
formulated a completely lacks any notion
of causality and that's dooms it and

1216
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,129
of causality and that's dooms it and
 

1217
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,950
of causality and that's dooms it and
therefore we have to somehow give it

1218
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
therefore we have to somehow give it
 

1219
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,560
therefore we have to somehow give it
some kind of notion of cause

1220
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,570
some kind of notion of cause
 

1221
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:46,350
some kind of notion of cause
there's a lot of push from the more

1222
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,360
there's a lot of push from the more
 

1223
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,690
there's a lot of push from the more
cognitive science crowd saying we have

1224
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:51,700
cognitive science crowd saying we have
 

1225
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,180
cognitive science crowd saying we have
to look at developmental learning we

1226
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,190
to look at developmental learning we
 

1227
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,940
to look at developmental learning we
have to look at how babies learn we have

1228
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:56,950
have to look at how babies learn we have
 

1229
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,259
have to look at how babies learn we have
to look at intuitive physics all these

1230
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:01,269
to look at intuitive physics all these
 

1231
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:03,360
to look at intuitive physics all these
things we know about physics and it's

1232
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,370
things we know about physics and it's
 

1233
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,480
things we know about physics and it's
somebody kind of quipped we also have to

1234
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,490
somebody kind of quipped we also have to
 

1235
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,310
somebody kind of quipped we also have to
teach machines intuitive metaphysics

1236
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
teach machines intuitive metaphysics
 

1237
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,180
teach machines intuitive metaphysics
which means like objects exist causality

1238
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,190
which means like objects exist causality
 

1239
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,149
which means like objects exist causality
exists you know these things that maybe

1240
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
exists you know these things that maybe
 

1241
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,610
exists you know these things that maybe
were born with I don't know that that

1242
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:20,620
were born with I don't know that that
 

1243
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,830
were born with I don't know that that
they don't have the machines don't have

1244
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:22,840
they don't have the machines don't have
 

1245
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,769
they don't have the machines don't have
any of that you know they look at a

1246
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:24,779
any of that you know they look at a
 

1247
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,580
any of that you know they look at a
group of pixels and they maybe they get

1248
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:28,590
group of pixels and they maybe they get
 

1249
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,389
group of pixels and they maybe they get
10 million examples but they they can't

1250
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:33,399
10 million examples but they they can't
 

1251
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,519
10 million examples but they they can't
necessarily learn that there are objects

1252
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:35,529
necessarily learn that there are objects
 

1253
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:39,269
necessarily learn that there are objects
in the world so there's just a lot of

1254
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
in the world so there's just a lot of
 

1255
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,850
in the world so there's just a lot of
pieces of the puzzle that people are

1256
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:41,860
pieces of the puzzle that people are
 

1257
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,629
pieces of the puzzle that people are
promoting and with different opinions of

1258
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:45,639
promoting and with different opinions of
 

1259
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,730
promoting and with different opinions of
like how how how important they are and

1260
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:47,740
like how how how important they are and
 

1261
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,909
like how how how important they are and
how close we are to the you know we'll

1262
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:50,919
how close we are to the you know we'll
 

1263
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,680
how close we are to the you know we'll
put them all together to create general

1264
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:52,690
put them all together to create general
 

1265
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,759
put them all together to create general
intelligence looking at this broad field

1266
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:55,769

1362
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:05,780
you say thirty years ago Wow

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,200
so I started working on it when I
 

1365
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:18,310
so I started working on it when I
started grad school in 1984 Wow and it's

00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
started grad school in 1984 Wow and it's
 

1367

started grad school in 1984 Wow and it's
based on Doug Hofstadter's ideas that

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:21,560
based on Doug Hofstadter's ideas that
 

1369
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,780
based on Doug Hofstadter's ideas that
about that analogy is really a core

about that analogy is really a core

you've seen that book but it's it's

00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,280
you've seen that book but it's it's
 

1381
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,310
you've seen that book but it's it's
about analogy he says without concepts

1382
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,320
about analogy he says without concepts
 

1383
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,430
about analogy he says without concepts
there can be no thought and without

1384
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
there can be no thought and without
 

1385
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,280
there can be no thought and without
analogies there can be no concepts so

1386
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,290
analogies there can be no concepts so
 

1387
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,140
analogies there can be no concepts so
the view is that analogy is not just

1388
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,150
the view is that analogy is not just

as to what you know these kinds of

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,300
as to what you know these kinds of

whatever that but that it's much deeper
 

1399
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,750
whatever that but that it's much deeper
much more pervasive in everything we do

our perception so we so he had a view

1404
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,300
our perception so we so he had a view
 

1405
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,500
our perception so we so he had a view
that was a very active perception idea

1406
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:20,510
that was a very active perception idea
 

1407
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,820
that was a very active perception idea
so the idea was that instead of having

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:24,830
so the idea was that instead of having
 

1409
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,830
so the idea was that instead of having
kind of what a passive network in which

1410
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of what a passive network in which
 

1411
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,890
kind of what a passive network in which
you have input that's being processed

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:32,900
you have input that's being processed

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,560
you have input that's being processed

through these feed-forward layers and
 

1415
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,180
through these feed-forward layers and
then there's an output at the end that

1416
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,190
then there's an output at the end that
 

1417
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,320
then there's an output at the end that

around and they're getting information

1422
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,030
around and they're getting information
 

1423
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,490
around and they're getting information
and that information is feeding back to

1424
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:47,500
and that information is feeding back to
 

1425
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,890
and that information is feeding back to
what we look at next influences what we

1426
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:50,900
what we look at next influences what we
 

1427
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,780
what we look at next influences what we
look at next and how we look at it and

1428
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:52,790
look at next and how we look at it and
 

1429
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,320
look at next and how we look at it and
so copycat was trying to do that kind of

1430
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,330
so copycat was trying to do that kind of
 

1431
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,510
so copycat was trying to do that kind of
simulate that kind of idea where you

1432
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:58,520
simulate that kind of idea where you
 

1433
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,430
simulate that kind of idea where you
have these agents it's kind of an agent

1434
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
have these agents it's kind of an agent
 

1435
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,050
have these agents it's kind of an agent
based system and you have these agents

1436
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:05,060
based system and you have these agents
 

1437
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,610
based system and you have these agents
that are picking things to look at and

1438
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:08,620
that are picking things to look at and
 

1439
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,540
that are picking things to look at and
deciding whether they were interesting

1440
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,550
deciding whether they were interesting
 

1441
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,790
deciding whether they were interesting
or not whether they should be looked at

1442
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
or not whether they should be looked at
 

1443
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,860
or not whether they should be looked at
more and and that would influence other

1444
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:14,870
more and and that would influence other
 

1445
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,740
more and and that would influence other
agents how do they interact so they

1446
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:17,750
agents how do they interact so they
 

1447
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,020
agents how do they interact so they
interacted through this global kind of

1448
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,030
interacted through this global kind of
 

1449
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,480
interacted through this global kind of
what we call the workspace so this

1450
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,490
what we call the workspace so this
 

1451
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,430
what we call the workspace so this
actually inspired by the old blackboard

00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,440
actually inspired by the old blackboard
 

1453
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,070

systems where you'd have agents that

1454
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,080
systems where you'd have agents that
 

1455
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,740
systems where you'd have agents that
post information on a blackboard a

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:29,750
post information on a blackboard a
 

1457
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,990
post information on a blackboard a
common blackboard this is like old very

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
common blackboard this is like old very
 

1459
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,240
common blackboard this is like old very
old fashioned a set is that we're

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,250
old fashioned a set is that we're
 

1461
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,490
old fashioned a set is that we're
talking about like in physical space is

agents posting concepts on a blackboard

1466
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:41,540
agents posting concepts on a blackboard
 

1467
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,610
agents posting concepts on a blackboard
yeah we called it a workspace and it

1468
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:44,620
yeah we called it a workspace and it
 

1469
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,520
yeah we called it a workspace and it
it's the workspace is a data structure

1470
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:47,530
it's the workspace is a data structure
 

1471
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,500
it's the workspace is a data structure
the agents are little pieces of code

1472
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:50,510
the agents are little pieces of code
 

1473
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,990
the agents are little pieces of code
that you can think of them as detect

1474
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,000
that you can think of them as detect
 

1475
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,180
that you can think of them as detect
little detectors or little filters then

1476
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,190
little detectors or little filters then
 

1477
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,310
little detectors or little filters then
say I'm gonna pick this place to look

1478
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,320
say I'm gonna pick this place to look
 

1479
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,990
say I'm gonna pick this place to look
and I'm gonna look for a certain thing

1480
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,000
and I'm gonna look for a certain thing
 

1481
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,300
and I'm gonna look for a certain thing
and it's just the thing I I think is

1482
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,310
and it's just the thing I I think is
 

1483
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,370
and it's just the thing I I think is
important is it there so it's almost

1484
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:03,380
important is it there so it's almost
 

1485
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,580
important is it there so it's almost
like you know a convolution in way

1486
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:06,590
like you know a convolution in way
 

1487
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,730
like you know a convolution in way
except a little bit more general and

1488
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:09,740
except a little bit more general and
 

1489
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,100
except a little bit more general and
saying and then highlighting it on the

1490
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,110
saying and then highlighting it on the
 

1491
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,980
saying and then highlighting it on the
on the work in the workspace wasn't once

1492
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:14,990
on the work in the workspace wasn't once
 

1493
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,170
on the work in the workspace wasn't once
it's in the workspace how do the things

1494
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,180
it's in the workspace how do the things
 

1495
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,670
it's in the workspace how do the things
they're highlighted relate to each other

1496
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:18,680
they're highlighted relate to each other
 

1497
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,380
they're highlighted relate to each other
like what

1498
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:19,390
like what
 

1499
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,509
like what
so there's different kinds of agents

1500
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:21,519
so there's different kinds of agents
 

1501
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,920
so there's different kinds of agents
that can build connections between

1502
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:22,930
that can build connections between
 

1503
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,690
that can build connections between
different things so just to give you a

1504
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:24,700
different things so just to give you a
 

1505
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,180
different things so just to give you a
concrete example what copycat did was it

1506
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,190
concrete example what copycat did was it
 

1507
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,250
concrete example what copycat did was it
made analogies between strings of

1508
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:29,260
made analogies between strings of
 

1509
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,990
made analogies between strings of
letters so here's an example ABC changes

1510
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
letters so here's an example ABC changes
 

1511
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,420
letters so here's an example ABC changes
to a BD what does ijk change to and the

1512
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,430
to a BD what does ijk change to and the
 

1513
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,190
to a BD what does ijk change to and the
program had some prior knowledge about

1514
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
program had some prior knowledge about
 

1515
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
program had some prior knowledge about
the alphabet new the sequence of the

1516
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:43,450
the alphabet new the sequence of the
 

1517
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,579
the alphabet new the sequence of the
alphabet it you know had a concept of

1518
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:47,589
alphabet it you know had a concept of
 

1519
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,500
alphabet it you know had a concept of
letter successor of letter it had

1520
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,510
letter successor of letter it had
 

1521
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,450
letter successor of letter it had
concepts of sameness so it has some

1522
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:51,460
concepts of sameness so it has some
 

1523
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,559
concepts of sameness so it has some
innate things programmed in but then it

1524
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:55,569
innate things programmed in but then it
 

1525
00:35:55,569 --> 00:36:01,370
innate things programmed in but then it
could do things like say discover that

1526
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:01,380
could do things like say discover that
 

1527
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,970
could do things like say discover that
ABC is a group of letters in succession

1528
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:04,980
ABC is a group of letters in succession
 

1529
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,160
ABC is a group of letters in succession
hmm and then it an agent can mark that

1530
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,170
hmm and then it an agent can mark that
 

1531
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,059
hmm and then it an agent can mark that
so the idea that there could be a

1532
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:14,069
so the idea that there could be a
 

1533
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:17,130
so the idea that there could be a
sequence of letters is that a new

1534
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,140
sequence of letters is that a new
 

1535
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,599
sequence of letters is that a new
concept that's formed or if that's a

1536
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:18,609
concept that's formed or if that's a
 

1537
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,690
concept that's formed or if that's a
concept that's a concept that's innate

1538
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:20,700
concept that's a concept that's innate
 

1539
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,289
concept that's a concept that's innate
sort of can you form new concepts or all

1540
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:24,299
sort of can you form new concepts or all
 

1541
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:28,589
sort of can you form new concepts or all
so in this program all the concepts of

1542
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:28,599
so in this program all the concepts of
 

1543
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,839
so in this program all the concepts of
the program were innate so cuz because

1544
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:30,849
the program were innate so cuz because
 

1545
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,690
the program were innate so cuz because
we weren't I mean obviously that limits

1546
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:33,700
we weren't I mean obviously that limits
 

1547
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,299
we weren't I mean obviously that limits
it quite up quite a bit but what we were

1548
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:36,309
it quite up quite a bit but what we were
 

1549
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:37,920
it quite up quite a bit but what we were
trying to do is say suppose you have

1550
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:37,930
trying to do is say suppose you have
 

1551
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,180
trying to do is say suppose you have
some innate concepts how do you flexibly

1552
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,190
some innate concepts how do you flexibly
 

1553
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,120
some innate concepts how do you flexibly
apply them to new situations right and

1554
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,130
apply them to new situations right and
 

1555
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,359
apply them to new situations right and
how do you make analogies let's step

1556
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:48,369
how do you make analogies let's step
 

1557
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,740
how do you make analogies let's step
back for a second so I really like that

1558
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:49,750
back for a second so I really like that
 

1559
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,529
back for a second so I really like that

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:13,750
yes how to form and fluidly use concepts
 

1577
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,740
yes how to form and fluidly use concepts
is the most important open problem in AI

1578
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:16,750
is the most important open problem in AI
 

1579
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,730
is the most important open problem in AI
so let's what is the concept and what is

1580
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:20,740
so let's what is the concept and what is
 

1581
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,950
so let's what is the concept and what is
an analogy a concept is in some sense a

1582
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:24,960
an analogy a concept is in some sense a
 

1583
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,829
an analogy a concept is in some sense a
fundamental unit of thought so say we

1584
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:28,839
fundamental unit of thought so say we
 

1585
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,890
fundamental unit of thought so say we
have a concept

1586
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:31,900
have a concept
 

1587
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:40,950
have a concept
of a dog okay and a concept is embedded

1588
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
of a dog okay and a concept is embedded
 

1589
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,480
of a dog okay and a concept is embedded
in a whole space of concepts so that

1590
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,490
in a whole space of concepts so that
 

1591
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,760
in a whole space of concepts so that
there's certain concepts that are closer

1592
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:47,770
there's certain concepts that are closer
 

1593
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,550
there's certain concepts that are closer
to it or farther away from it are these

1594
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
to it or farther away from it are these
 

1595
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
to it or farther away from it are these
concepts are they really like

1596
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,330
concepts are they really like
 

1597
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,270
concepts are they really like
fundamental like we mention innate look

1598
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:54,280
fundamental like we mention innate look
 

1599
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,000
fundamental like we mention innate look
almost like XE o matic like very basic

1600
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,010
almost like XE o matic like very basic
 

1601
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,290
almost like XE o matic like very basic
and then there's other stuff built on

1602
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:58,300
and then there's other stuff built on
 

1603
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,420
and then there's other stuff built on
top of it or just include everything is

1604
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:00,430
top of it or just include everything is
 

1605
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,560
top of it or just include everything is
are they're complicated like you can

1606
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:04,570
are they're complicated like you can
 

1607
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,170
are they're complicated like you can
certainly have form new concepts right I

1608
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,180
certainly have form new concepts right I
 

1609
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,490
certainly have form new concepts right I
guess that's the question I'm asked yeah

1610
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:08,500
guess that's the question I'm asked yeah
 

1611
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,570
guess that's the question I'm asked yeah
can you form new concepts that our

1612
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:11,580
can you form new concepts that our
 

1613
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,010
can you form new concepts that our
company complex combinations of other

1614
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,020
company complex combinations of other
 

1615
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,500
company complex combinations of other
ago yes absolutely and that's kind of

1616
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:16,510
ago yes absolutely and that's kind of
 

1617
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,280
ago yes absolutely and that's kind of
what we we do you know learning and then

1618
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,290
what we we do you know learning and then
 

1619
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,130
what we we do you know learning and then
what's the role of analogies in that so

1620
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:23,140
what's the role of analogies in that so
 

1621
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,350
what's the role of analogies in that so
analogy is when you recognize that one

1622
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:28,360
analogy is when you recognize that one
 

1623
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,700
analogy is when you recognize that one
situation is essentially the same as

1624
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:32,710
situation is essentially the same as
 

1625
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,230
situation is essentially the same as
another situation and essentially is

1626
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,240
another situation and essentially is
 

1627
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,910
another situation and essentially is
kind of the key word there and because

1628
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:38,920
kind of the key word there and because
 

1629
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,850
kind of the key word there and because
it's not the same so if I say last week

1630
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:44,860
it's not the same so if I say last week
 

1631
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,930
it's not the same so if I say last week
I did a podcast interview in actually

1632
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:48,940
I did a podcast interview in actually
 

1633
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,760
I did a podcast interview in actually
like three days ago in Washington DC and

1634
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:52,770
like three days ago in Washington DC and
 

1635
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,830
like three days ago in Washington DC and
that situation was very similar to this

1636
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:55,840
that situation was very similar to this
 

1637
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,960
that situation was very similar to this
situation although it wasn't exactly the

1638
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:57,970
situation although it wasn't exactly the
 

1639
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,310
situation although it wasn't exactly the
same you know it was a different person

1640
00:38:59,310 --> 00:38:59,320
same you know it was a different person
 

1641
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,170
same you know it was a different person
sitting across from me we had different

1642
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,180
sitting across from me we had different
 

1643
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,870
sitting across from me we had different
kinds of microphones the questions were

1644
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:03,880
kinds of microphones the questions were
 

1645
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,380
kinds of microphones the questions were
different

1646
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,390
different
 

1647
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,330
different
the building was different there's all

1648
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,340
the building was different there's all
 

1649
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,920
the building was different there's all
kinds of different things but really it

1650
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:07,930
kinds of different things but really it
 

1651
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,740
kinds of different things but really it
was analogous or I can say so by doing a

1652
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:13,750
was analogous or I can say so by doing a
 

1653
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,660
was analogous or I can say so by doing a
podcast interview that's kind of a

1654
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:15,670
podcast interview that's kind of a
 

1655
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,460
podcast interview that's kind of a
constant it's a new concept you know I

1656
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:17,470
constant it's a new concept you know I
 

1657
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:24,330
constant it's a new concept you know I
never had that concept before I mean and

1658
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:24,340
never had that concept before I mean and
 

1659
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,630
never had that concept before I mean and
I can make an analogy with it like being

1660
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:27,640
I can make an analogy with it like being
 

1661
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,090
I can make an analogy with it like being
interviewed for a news article in a

1662
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,100
interviewed for a news article in a
 

1663
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,440
interviewed for a news article in a
newspaper and I can say well you kind of

1664
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,450
newspaper and I can say well you kind of
 

1665
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,320
newspaper and I can say well you kind of
play the same role that the the

1666
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,330
play the same role that the the
 

1667
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,320
play the same role that the the
newspaper the reporter played it's not

1668
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,330
newspaper the reporter played it's not
 

1669
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,600
newspaper the reporter played it's not
exactly the same because maybe they

1670
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:42,610
exactly the same because maybe they
 

1671
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,340
exactly the same because maybe they
actually emailed me some written

1672
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,350
actually emailed me some written
 

1673
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,660
actually emailed me some written
questions rather than

1674
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:45,670
questions rather than
 

1675
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,069
questions rather than
and the writing the written questions

1676
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:49,079
and the writing the written questions
 

1677
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,259
and the writing the written questions
play the you know are analogous to your

1678
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:52,269
play the you know are analogous to your
 

1679
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,999
play the you know are analogous to your
spoken questions you know there's just

1680
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:54,009
spoken questions you know there's just
 

1681
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,650
spoken questions you know there's just
all kinds of this somehow probably

1682
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:55,660
all kinds of this somehow probably
 

1683
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,809
all kinds of this somehow probably
connects to conversations you have over

1684
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:57,819
connects to conversations you have over
 

1685
00:39:57,819 --> 00:39:59,279
connects to conversations you have over

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:01,509
conversations you could there's like a
 

1689
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,870
conversations you could there's like a

00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:16,809
and if I go and tell a friend of mine
 

1699
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,529
and if I go and tell a friend of mine
about this podcast interview my friend

1700
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:19,539
about this podcast interview my friend
 

1701
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:21,900
about this podcast interview my friend
might say oh the same thing happened to

1702
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:21,910
might say oh the same thing happened to
 

1703
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,120
might say oh the same thing happened to
me you know let's say you know you ask

1704
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,130
me you know let's say you know you ask
 

1705
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,599
me you know let's say you know you ask
me some really hard question and I have

1706
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:27,609
me some really hard question and I have
 

1707
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,910
me some really hard question and I have
trouble answering it my friend could say

1708
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:29,920
trouble answering it my friend could say
 

1709
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,950
trouble answering it my friend could say
the same thing happened to me but it was

1710
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:31,960
the same thing happened to me but it was
 

1711
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,170
the same thing happened to me but it was
like it wasn't a podcast interview it

1712
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:34,180
like it wasn't a podcast interview it
 

1713
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,569
like it wasn't a podcast interview it
wasn't it was a completely different

1714
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:38,579
wasn't it was a completely different
 

1715
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,210
wasn't it was a completely different
situation and yet my friend is seen

1716
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,220
situation and yet my friend is seen
 

1717
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,370
situation and yet my friend is seen
essentially this the same thing you know

1718
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:44,380
essentially this the same thing you know
 

1719
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,529
essentially this the same thing you know
we say that very fluidly the same thing

1720
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:46,539
we say that very fluidly the same thing
 

1721
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:49,440
we say that very fluidly the same thing
happened to me essentially the same

1722
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,450
happened to me essentially the same
 

1723
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,029
happened to me essentially the same
thing we don't even say that right

1724
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:51,039
thing we don't even say that right
 

1725
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,239
thing we don't even say that right
things they imply it yes yeah and the

1726
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:54,249
things they imply it yes yeah and the
 

1727
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:56,819
things they imply it yes yeah and the
view that kind of what went into say

1728
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:56,829
view that kind of what went into say
 

1729
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,999
view that kind of what went into say
coffee cat that that whole thing is that

1730
00:40:58,999 --> 00:40:59,009
coffee cat that that whole thing is that
 

1731
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:02,039
coffee cat that that whole thing is that
that that that act of saying the same

1732
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:02,049
that that that act of saying the same
 

1733
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,200
that that that act of saying the same
thing happened to me is making an

1734
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,210
thing happened to me is making an
 

1735
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,960
thing happened to me is making an
analogy and in some sense that's what's

1736
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:06,970
analogy and in some sense that's what's
 

1737
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,160
analogy and in some sense that's what's
underlies all of our concepts why do you

1738
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,170
underlies all of our concepts why do you
 

1739
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,809
underlies all of our concepts why do you
think analogy making that you're

1740
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:12,819
think analogy making that you're
 

1741
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:15,720
think analogy making that you're
describing is so fundamental to

1742
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,730
describing is so fundamental to
 

1743
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,180
describing is so fundamental to
cognition like it seems like it's the

1744
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,190
cognition like it seems like it's the
 

1745
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,299
cognition like it seems like it's the
main element action of what we think of

1746
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:21,309
main element action of what we think of
 

1747
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:24,660
main element action of what we think of
us cognition yeah so it can be argued

1748
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:24,670
us cognition yeah so it can be argued
 

1749
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:30,109
us cognition yeah so it can be argued
that all of this generalization we do

1750
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:30,119
that all of this generalization we do
 

1751
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,579
that all of this generalization we do
concepts and recognizing concepts in

1752
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:35,589
concepts and recognizing concepts in
 

1753
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:41,720
concepts and recognizing concepts in
different situations is done by analogy

1754
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:41,730
different situations is done by analogy
 

1755
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,700
different situations is done by analogy
that that's every time I'm recognizing

1756
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:47,710
that that's every time I'm recognizing
 

1757
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,039
that that's every time I'm recognizing
that say you're a person that's by

1758
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:53,049
that say you're a person that's by
 

1759
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:54,960
that say you're a person that's by
analogy because I have this concept of

1760
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:54,970
analogy because I have this concept of
 

1761
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,460
analogy because I have this concept of
what person is and I'm applying it to

1762
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,470
what person is and I'm applying it to
 

1763
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,099
what person is and I'm applying it to
you and every

1764
00:41:59,099 --> 00:41:59,109
you and every
 

1765
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:02,749
you and every
time I recognize a new situation like

1766
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:02,759
time I recognize a new situation like
 

1767
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:06,180
time I recognize a new situation like
one of the things I talked about it in

1768
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,190
one of the things I talked about it in
 

1769
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,430
one of the things I talked about it in
the book was the the concept of walking

1770
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:08,440
the book was the the concept of walking
 

1771
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,160
the book was the the concept of walking
a dog that that's actually making an

1772
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,170
a dog that that's actually making an
 

1773
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,559
a dog that that's actually making an
analogy because all that you know the

1774
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:13,569
analogy because all that you know the
 

1775
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:17,220
analogy because all that you know the
details are very different so it's so

1776
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,230
details are very different so it's so
 

1777
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,529
details are very different so it's so
now--so reasoning could be reduced on to

1778
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:19,539
now--so reasoning could be reduced on to
 

1779
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,229
now--so reasoning could be reduced on to
sense your analogy making so all the

1780
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:22,239
sense your analogy making so all the
 

1781
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,799
sense your analogy making so all the
things we think of as like yeah like you

1782
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:25,809
things we think of as like yeah like you
 

1783
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,930
things we think of as like yeah like you
said perception so what's perception is

1784
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:27,940
said perception so what's perception is
 

1785
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,940
said perception so what's perception is
taking raw sensory input and it's

1786
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:29,950
taking raw sensory input and it's
 

1787
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,999
taking raw sensory input and it's
somehow integrating into our our

1788
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:32,009
somehow integrating into our our
 

1789
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,109
somehow integrating into our our
understanding of the world updating the

1790
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:34,119
understanding of the world updating the
 

1791
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,809
understanding of the world updating the
understanding and all of that has just

1792
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:36,819
understanding and all of that has just
 

1793
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:39,390
understanding and all of that has just
this giant mess of analogies that are

1794
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:39,400
this giant mess of analogies that are
 

1795
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,019
this giant mess of analogies that are
being made I think so yeah if you just

1796
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,029
being made I think so yeah if you just
 

1797
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:45,299
being made I think so yeah if you just
linger on it a little bit like what what

1798
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:45,309
linger on it a little bit like what what
 

1799
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:47,160
linger on it a little bit like what what
do you think it takes to engineer a

1800
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,170
do you think it takes to engineer a
 

1801
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,130
do you think it takes to engineer a
process like that for us in our

1802
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:50,140
process like that for us in our
 

1803
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,049
process like that for us in our
artificial systems we need to understand

1804
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:55,059
artificial systems we need to understand
 

1805
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:59,789
artificial systems we need to understand
better I think how how we do it how

1806
00:42:59,789 --> 00:42:59,799
better I think how how we do it how
 

1807
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:05,180
better I think how how we do it how
humans do it and it comes down to

1808
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,190
humans do it and it comes down to
 

1809
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,099
humans do it and it comes down to
internal models I think you know people

1810
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:08,109
internal models I think you know people
 

1811
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:11,249
internal models I think you know people
talk a lot about mental models that

1812
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:11,259
talk a lot about mental models that
 

1813
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:15,809
talk a lot about mental models that
concepts are mental models that I can in

1814
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:15,819
concepts are mental models that I can in
 

1815
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:19,799
concepts are mental models that I can in
my head I can do a simulation of a

1816
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:19,809
my head I can do a simulation of a
 

1817
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:22,769
my head I can do a simulation of a
situation like walking a dog and that

1818
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:22,779
situation like walking a dog and that
 

1819
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:25,410
situation like walking a dog and that
there there's some work in psychology

1820
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:25,420
there there's some work in psychology
 

1821
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,499
there there's some work in psychology
that promotes this idea that all of

1822
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:28,509
that promotes this idea that all of
 

1823
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,989
that promotes this idea that all of
concepts are really mental simulations

1824
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:30,999
concepts are really mental simulations
 

1825
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:34,700
concepts are really mental simulations
that whenever you encounter a concept or

1826
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:34,710
that whenever you encounter a concept or
 

1827
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,809
that whenever you encounter a concept or
situation in the world or you read about

1828
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:36,819
situation in the world or you read about
 

1829
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,210
situation in the world or you read about
it or whatever you do some kind of

1830
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:39,220
it or whatever you do some kind of
 

1831
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,120
it or whatever you do some kind of
mental simulation that allows you to

1832
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,130
mental simulation that allows you to
 

1833
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,859
mental simulation that allows you to
predict what's going to happen to

1834
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:43,869
predict what's going to happen to
 

1835
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,890
predict what's going to happen to
develop expectations of what's going to

1836
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:46,900
develop expectations of what's going to
 

1837
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,410
develop expectations of what's going to
happen mm-hm so that's the kind of

1838
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:49,420
happen mm-hm so that's the kind of
 

1839
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,259
happen mm-hm so that's the kind of
structure I think we need is that kind

1840
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:52,269
structure I think we need is that kind
 

1841
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,460
structure I think we need is that kind
of mental model that and the in our

1842
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:56,470
of mental model that and the in our
 

1843
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,170
of mental model that and the in our
brain somehow these mental models are

1844
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:58,180
brain somehow these mental models are
 

1845
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,130
brain somehow these mental models are
very much inter connected again so a lot

1846
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:02,140
very much inter connected again so a lot
 

1847
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,809
very much inter connected again so a lot
of stuff we're talking about it they're

1848
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:03,819
of stuff we're talking about it they're
 

1849
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:06,720
of stuff we're talking about it they're
essentially open problems right so if I

1850
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:06,730
essentially open problems right so if I
 

1851
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,999
essentially open problems right so if I
ask a question I don't mean that you

1852
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:09,009
ask a question I don't mean that you
 

1853
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,410
ask a question I don't mean that you
would know the answer already just

1854
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:10,420
would know the answer already just
 

1855
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,130
would know the answer already just
hypothesizing but how big do you think

1856
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,140
hypothesizing but how big do you think
 

1857
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:20,279
hypothesizing but how big do you think
is the the network graph data structure

1858
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:20,289
is the the network graph data structure
 

1859
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:23,519
is the the network graph data structure
of concepts that's in our head like if

1860
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:23,529
of concepts that's in our head like if
 

1861
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:25,609
of concepts that's in our head like if
we're trying to build that ourselves

1862
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:25,619
we're trying to build that ourselves
 

1863
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,529
we're trying to build that ourselves
like it's we take it and that's one of

1864
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:28,539
like it's we take it and that's one of
 

1865
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:29,910
like it's we take it and that's one of
the things we take for granted we think

1866
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
the things we take for granted we think
 

1867
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,979
the things we take for granted we think
I mean that's why we take common sense

1868
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:31,989
I mean that's why we take common sense
 

1869
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,509
I mean that's why we take common sense
for granted within common sense is

1870
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:33,519
for granted within common sense is
 

1871
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,160
for granted within common sense is
trivial but how big of a thing of

1872
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,170
trivial but how big of a thing of
 

1873
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,309
trivial but how big of a thing of
concepts is on that underlies what we

1874
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:41,319
concepts is on that underlies what we
 

1875
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,700
concepts is on that underlies what we
think of as common sense for example

1876
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:43,710
think of as common sense for example
 

1877
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,259
think of as common sense for example
yeah I don't know and I'm not I don't

1878
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:46,269
yeah I don't know and I'm not I don't
 

1879
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,789
yeah I don't know and I'm not I don't
even know what units to measure it in

1880
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:49,799

 

1881
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:53,640

beautifully put right but but you know

1882
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:53,650
beautifully put right but but you know
 

1883
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,470
beautifully put right but but you know
we have you know it's really hard to

1884
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:55,480
we have you know it's really hard to
 

1885
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,339
we have you know it's really hard to
know we have what a hundred billion

1886
00:44:59,339 --> 00:44:59,349
know we have what a hundred billion
 

1887
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:02,370
know we have what a hundred billion
neurons or something I don't know and

1888
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:02,380
neurons or something I don't know and
 

1889
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,109
neurons or something I don't know and
they're connected via trillions of

1890
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:06,119
they're connected via trillions of
 

1891
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,359
they're connected via trillions of
synapses and there's all this chemical

1892
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:09,369
synapses and there's all this chemical
 

1893
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:11,249
synapses and there's all this chemical
processing going on there's just a lot

1894
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:11,259
processing going on there's just a lot
 

1895
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:14,370
processing going on there's just a lot
of capacity for the stuff and their

1896
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:14,380
of capacity for the stuff and their
 

1897
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,440
of capacity for the stuff and their
informations encoded in different ways

1898
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:16,450
informations encoded in different ways
 

1899
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,200
informations encoded in different ways
in the brain it's encoded in chemical

1900
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,210
in the brain it's encoded in chemical
 

1901
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,539
in the brain it's encoded in chemical
interactions it's encoded and electric

1902
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:21,549
interactions it's encoded and electric
 

1903
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:24,180
interactions it's encoded and electric
like firing and firing rates and and

1904
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,190
like firing and firing rates and and
 

1905
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,920
like firing and firing rates and and
nobody really knows how it's encoded but

1906
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:25,930
nobody really knows how it's encoded but
 

1907
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,319
nobody really knows how it's encoded but
it just seems like there's a huge amount

1908
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:28,329
it just seems like there's a huge amount
 

1909
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,630
it just seems like there's a huge amount
of capacity so I think it's it's huge

1910
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
of capacity so I think it's it's huge
 

1911
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,109
of capacity so I think it's it's huge
it's just enormous and it's amazing how

1912
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:34,119
it's just enormous and it's amazing how
 

1913
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:40,229
it's just enormous and it's amazing how
much stuff we know yeah and but we know

1914
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:40,239
much stuff we know yeah and but we know
 

1915
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,019
much stuff we know yeah and but we know
and not just know like facts but it's

1916
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:43,029
and not just know like facts but it's
 

1917
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:45,120
and not just know like facts but it's
all integrated into this thing that we

00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,130
all integrated into this thing that we

I think people have have made some

00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,130
I think people have have made some
 

1937
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,920
I think people have have made some
progress along those lines I mean people

00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:10,930
progress along those lines I mean people
 

1939
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,089
progress along those lines I mean people
have been working on this for a long

1940
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:12,099
have been working on this for a long
 

1941
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,180
have been working on this for a long
time but the problem is and this I think

1942
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,190
time but the problem is and this I think
 

1943
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,160
time but the problem is and this I think
was is is the problem of common sense

1944
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,170
was is is the problem of common sense
 

1945
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,049
was is is the problem of common sense
like people have been trying to get

00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:19,059
like people have been trying to get

there's this concept net project right

1950
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:25,049
there's this concept net project right
 

1951
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:27,559
there's this concept net project right
but the problem is that as I said most

1952
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:27,569
but the problem is that as I said most
 

1953
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:30,529
but the problem is that as I said most

kind of logical representation and it

just never I think could do any of the

just never I think could do any of the

just never I think could do any of the
things that he was hoping it could do

00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,909
things that he was hoping it could do
because that's just the wrong approach

because that's just the wrong approach

00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:15,009
because that's just the wrong approach
of course that's what they always say

of course that's what they always say
 

2019
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,499
of course that's what they always say
you know and then the history books will

2020
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:18,509
you know and then the history books will
 

2021
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,959
you know and then the history books will
say well the psych project finally found

2022
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:20,969
say well the psych project finally found
 

2023
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:24,409
say well the psych project finally found
a breakthrough in 2058 or something and

to take some of those ideas and

00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:28,600
extending it so I think there are some
 

2197
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,270
extending it so I think there are some
really promising approaches that are

2198
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:30,280
really promising approaches that are
 

2199
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,880
really promising approaches that are
going on now that have to do with more

2200
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:34,890
going on now that have to do with more
 

2201
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:40,260
going on now that have to do with more
active generative models so this is the

2202
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:40,270
active generative models so this is the
 

2203
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,630
active generative models so this is the
idea of this simulation in your head a

2204
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
idea of this simulation in your head a
 

2205
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,350
idea of this simulation in your head a
concept when you if you want to when

2206
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:46,360
concept when you if you want to when
 

2207
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,920
concept when you if you want to when
you're perceiving a new a new situation

2208
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:48,930
you're perceiving a new a new situation
 

2209
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,210
you're perceiving a new a new situation
you have some simulations in your head

2210
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:51,220
you have some simulations in your head
 

2211
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,590
you have some simulations in your head
those are generative models they're

2212
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:52,600
those are generative models they're
 

2213
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,660
those are generative models they're
generating your expectations they're

2214
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:54,670
generating your expectations they're
 

2215
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,490
generating your expectations they're
generating predictions that's part of a

2216
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:56,500
generating predictions that's part of a
 

2217
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,830
generating predictions that's part of a
perception you haven't met the model

2218
00:52:58,830 --> 00:52:58,840
perception you haven't met the model
 

2219
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,840
perception you haven't met the model
that generates a prediction then you

2220
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:00,850
that generates a prediction then you
 

2221
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,170
that generates a prediction then you
come

2222
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:01,180
come
 

2223
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,510
come
parrot with ya and then the difference

2224
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
parrot with ya and then the difference
 

2225
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,480
parrot with ya and then the difference
and you also that that generative model

2226
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:06,490
and you also that that generative model
 

2227
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,819
and you also that that generative model
is telling you where to look and what to

2228
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:08,829
is telling you where to look and what to
 

2229
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:11,240
is telling you where to look and what to
look at and what to pay attention to and

2230
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,250
look at and what to pay attention to and
 

2231
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,829
look at and what to pay attention to and
it I think it affects your perception

2232
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
it I think it affects your perception
 

2233
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,540
it I think it affects your perception
it's not that just you compare it with

2234
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:15,550
it's not that just you compare it with
 

2235
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:20,430
it's not that just you compare it with
your perception it it becomes your

2236
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:20,440
your perception it it becomes your
 

2237
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,700
your perception it it becomes your
perception in a way it is kind of a

2238
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:23,710
perception in a way it is kind of a
 

2239
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,230
perception in a way it is kind of a
mixture of that bottom-up information

2240
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
mixture of that bottom-up information
 

2241
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,319
mixture of that bottom-up information
coming from the world and your top-down

2242
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:30,329
coming from the world and your top-down
 

2243
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:34,079
coming from the world and your top-down
model being opposed in the world is what

2244
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,089
model being opposed in the world is what
 

2245
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,750
model being opposed in the world is what
becomes your perception so your hope is

2246
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:36,760
becomes your perception so your hope is
 

2247
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,089
becomes your perception so your hope is
something like that can improve

2248
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:38,099
something like that can improve
 

2249
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,109
something like that can improve
perception systems and that they can

2250
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:40,119
perception systems and that they can
 

2251
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,420
perception systems and that they can
understand things better yes understand

2252
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:42,430
understand things better yes understand
 

2253
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,620
understand things better yes understand
things yes what's the what's the step

2254
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:46,630
things yes what's the what's the step
 

2255
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:49,650
things yes what's the what's the step
was the analogy making step there well

2256
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:49,660
was the analogy making step there well
 

2257
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,559
was the analogy making step there well
there the the the idea is that you have

2258
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:52,569
there the the the idea is that you have
 

2259
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:55,950
there the the the idea is that you have
this pretty complicated conceptual space

2260
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:55,960
this pretty complicated conceptual space
 

2261
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,440
this pretty complicated conceptual space
you know you can talk about a semantic

2262
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,450
you know you can talk about a semantic
 

2263
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,730
you know you can talk about a semantic
network or something like that

2264
00:53:59,730 --> 00:53:59,740
network or something like that
 

2265
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,180
network or something like that
with these different kinds of concept

2266
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,190
with these different kinds of concept
 

2267
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,450
with these different kinds of concept
models in your brain that are connected

2268
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:06,460
models in your brain that are connected
 

2269
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,569
models in your brain that are connected
so so let's let's take the example of

2270
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:09,579
so so let's let's take the example of
 

2271
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,819
so so let's let's take the example of
walking a dog we were talking about that

2272
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:11,829
walking a dog we were talking about that
 

2273
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:14,789
walking a dog we were talking about that
okay let's see I say see someone out on

2274
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:14,799
okay let's see I say see someone out on
 

2275
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:17,010
okay let's see I say see someone out on
the street walking a cat some people

2276
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:17,020
the street walking a cat some people
 

2277
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,809
the street walking a cat some people
walk their cats I guess this seems like

2278
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:18,819
walk their cats I guess this seems like
 

2279
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:22,950
walk their cats I guess this seems like
a bad idea but yeah so my model of my

2280
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
a bad idea but yeah so my model of my
 

2281
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,220
a bad idea but yeah so my model of my
you know there's connections between my

2282
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,230
you know there's connections between my
 

2283
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,460
you know there's connections between my
model of a dog and model of a cat and I

2284
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:29,470
model of a dog and model of a cat and I
 

2285
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:35,640
model of a dog and model of a cat and I
can immediately see the analogy of that

2286
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,650
can immediately see the analogy of that
 

2287
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,569
can immediately see the analogy of that
those are analogous situations but I can

2288
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:39,579
those are analogous situations but I can
 

2289
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,579
those are analogous situations but I can
also see the differences and that tells

2290
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:41,589
also see the differences and that tells
 

2291
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:47,039
also see the differences and that tells
me what to expect so also you know I

2292
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,049
me what to expect so also you know I
 

2293
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:49,470
me what to expect so also you know I
have a new situation so another example

2294
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:49,480
have a new situation so another example
 

2295
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,440
have a new situation so another example
with the walking the dog thing is

2296
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,450
with the walking the dog thing is
 

2297
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,789
with the walking the dog thing is
sometimes people I see people riding

2298
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:53,799
sometimes people I see people riding
 

2299
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:55,559
sometimes people I see people riding
their bikes with Elise holding a leash

2300
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:55,569
their bikes with Elise holding a leash
 

2301
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:58,109
their bikes with Elise holding a leash
and the dogs running alongside okay so I

2302
00:54:58,109 --> 00:54:58,119
and the dogs running alongside okay so I
 

2303
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:01,319
and the dogs running alongside okay so I
know that the I recognize that as kind

2304
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:01,329
know that the I recognize that as kind
 

2305
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,230
know that the I recognize that as kind
of a dog walking situation even though

2306
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
of a dog walking situation even though
 

2307
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,930
of a dog walking situation even though
the person's not walking right and the

2308
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:06,940
the person's not walking right and the
 

2309
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,620
the person's not walking right and the
dogs not walking because I I have the

2310
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:10,630
dogs not walking because I I have the
 

2311
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:13,430
dogs not walking because I I have the
these these models that say okay

2312
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
these these models that say okay
 

2313
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,059
these these models that say okay
riding a bike

2314
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:15,069
riding a bike
 

2315
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:16,739
riding a bike
is sort of similar to walking or it's

2316
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:16,749
is sort of similar to walking or it's
 

2317
00:55:16,749 --> 00:55:19,249
is sort of similar to walking or it's
connected it's a means of transportation

2318
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:19,259
connected it's a means of transportation
 

2319
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:22,559
connected it's a means of transportation
but I because they have their dog there

2320
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:22,569
but I because they have their dog there
 

2321
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,479
but I because they have their dog there
I assume they're not going to work but

2322
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:24,489
I assume they're not going to work but
 

2323
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,519
I assume they're not going to work but
they're going out for exercise and you

2324
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:26,529
they're going out for exercise and you
 

2325
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:29,819
they're going out for exercise and you
know these analogies help me to figure

2326
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:29,829
know these analogies help me to figure
 

2327
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,529
know these analogies help me to figure
out kind of what's going on what's

2328
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:31,539
out kind of what's going on what's
 

2329
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:34,410
out kind of what's going on what's
likely but sort of these analogies are

2330
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:34,420
likely but sort of these analogies are
 

2331
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,380
likely but sort of these analogies are
very human interpreter Bowl mm-hmm so

2332
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:37,390
very human interpreter Bowl mm-hmm so
 

2333
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,509
very human interpreter Bowl mm-hmm so
that's that kind of space and then you

2334
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:39,519
that's that kind of space and then you
 

2335
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,999
that's that kind of space and then you
look at something like the current deep

2336
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:42,009
look at something like the current deep
 

2337
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,979
look at something like the current deep
learning approaches they kind of help

2338
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:43,989
learning approaches they kind of help
 

2339
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,499
learning approaches they kind of help
you to take raw sensory information and

2340
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:46,509
you to take raw sensory information and
 

2341
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,660
you to take raw sensory information and
just to automatically build up

2342
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:48,670
just to automatically build up
 

2343
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:52,140
just to automatically build up
hierarchies of role you can even call

2344
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,150
hierarchies of role you can even call
 

2345
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,789
hierarchies of role you can even call
them concepts they're just not human

2346
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:53,799
them concepts they're just not human
 

2347
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:55,519
them concepts they're just not human
interpretive or concepts

2348
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:55,529
interpretive or concepts
 

2349
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:59,160
interpretive or concepts
what's your what's the link here do you

2350
00:55:59,160 --> 00:55:59,170
what's your what's the link here do you
 

2351
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:04,650
what's your what's the link here do you
hope it's sort of the hybrid system

2352
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:04,660
hope it's sort of the hybrid system
 

2353
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,930
hope it's sort of the hybrid system
question how do you think that two can

2354
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:06,940
question how do you think that two can
 

2355
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,670
question how do you think that two can
start to meet each other what's the

2356
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:08,680
start to meet each other what's the
 

2357
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,779
start to meet each other what's the
value of learning in this systems of

2358
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:12,789
value of learning in this systems of
 

2359
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,859
value of learning in this systems of
forming of analogy making the the goal

2360
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:16,869
forming of analogy making the the goal
 

2361
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:19,709
forming of analogy making the the goal
of I you know the original goal of deep

2362
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:19,719
of I you know the original goal of deep
 

2363
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:22,469
of I you know the original goal of deep
learning in at least visual perception

2364
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:22,479
learning in at least visual perception
 

2365
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,259
learning in at least visual perception
was that you would get the system to

2366
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:25,269
was that you would get the system to
 

2367
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:28,620
was that you would get the system to
learn to extract features that at these

2368
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:28,630
learn to extract features that at these
 

2369
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,569
learn to extract features that at these
different levels of complexities may be

2370
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:30,579
different levels of complexities may be
 

2371
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:32,640
different levels of complexities may be
edge detection and that would lead into

2372
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:32,650
edge detection and that would lead into
 

2373
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,059
edge detection and that would lead into
learning you know simple combinations of

2374
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:36,069
learning you know simple combinations of
 

2375
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:38,219
learning you know simple combinations of
edges and then more complex shapes and

2376
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:38,229
edges and then more complex shapes and
 

2377
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:45,150
edges and then more complex shapes and
then whole objects or faces and this was

2378
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:45,160
then whole objects or faces and this was
 

2379
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,739
then whole objects or faces and this was
based on that the ideas of the

2380
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:48,749
based on that the ideas of the
 

2381
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:51,779
based on that the ideas of the
neuroscientists Hubel and Wiesel who had

2382
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:51,789
neuroscientists Hubel and Wiesel who had
 

2383
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,390
neuroscientists Hubel and Wiesel who had
seen laid out this kind of structure and

2384
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
seen laid out this kind of structure and
 

2385
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:00,599
seen laid out this kind of structure and
brain and I think that is that's right

2386
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:00,609
brain and I think that is that's right
 

2387
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:03,079
brain and I think that is that's right
to some extent of course people have

2388
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:03,089
to some extent of course people have
 

2389
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:05,939
to some extent of course people have
come found that the whole story is a

2390
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:05,949
come found that the whole story is a
 

2391
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:07,439
come found that the whole story is a
little more complex than that and the

2392
00:57:07,439 --> 00:57:07,449
little more complex than that and the
 

2393
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:09,359
little more complex than that and the
brain of course always is and there's a

2394
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:09,369
brain of course always is and there's a
 

2395
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:15,880
brain of course always is and there's a
lot of feedback and so I see that

2396
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:15,890

 

2397
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:21,460

as absolutely a good brain inspired

2398
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:21,470
as absolutely a good brain inspired
 

2399
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,910
as absolutely a good brain inspired
approach to some aspects of perception

2400
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:24,920
approach to some aspects of perception
 

2401
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,930
approach to some aspects of perception
but one thing that it's lacking for

2402
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:28,940
but one thing that it's lacking for
 

2403
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,200
but one thing that it's lacking for
example is all of that feedback which is

2404
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,210
example is all of that feedback which is
 

2405
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,880
example is all of that feedback which is
extremely important the interactive

2406
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:33,890
extremely important the interactive
 

2407
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:37,299
extremely important the interactive
element do you mentioned the expectation

2408
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:37,309
element do you mentioned the expectation
 

2409
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:40,059
element do you mentioned the expectation
the sexual level go back and forth with

2410
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:40,069
the sexual level go back and forth with
 

2411
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:43,029
the sexual level go back and forth with
the the expectation the perception and

2412
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:43,039
the the expectation the perception and
 

2413
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:45,160
the the expectation the perception and
yes going back and forth so right so

2414
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:45,170
yes going back and forth so right so
 

2415
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,480
yes going back and forth so right so
that is extremely important and you know

2416
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:49,490
that is extremely important and you know
 

2417
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,180
that is extremely important and you know
one thing about deep neural networks is

2418
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,190
one thing about deep neural networks is
 

2419
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,299
one thing about deep neural networks is
that in a given situation like you know

2420
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:55,309
that in a given situation like you know
 

2421
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,859
that in a given situation like you know
they they're trained right they get

2422
00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:56,869
they they're trained right they get
 

2423
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:58,870
they they're trained right they get
these weights everything but then now I

2424
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:58,880
these weights everything but then now I
 

2425
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,539
these weights everything but then now I
give them a new a new image let's say

2426
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:01,549
give them a new a new image let's say
 

2427
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:06,609
give them a new a new image let's say
yes they treat every part of the image

2428
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:06,619
yes they treat every part of the image
 

2429
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:10,630
yes they treat every part of the image
in the same way you know they apply the

2430
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
in the same way you know they apply the
 

2431
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,230
in the same way you know they apply the
same filters at each layer to all parts

2432
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
same filters at each layer to all parts
 

2433
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,750
same filters at each layer to all parts
of the image mm-hmm there's no feedback

2434
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:16,760
of the image mm-hmm there's no feedback
 

2435
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,970
of the image mm-hmm there's no feedback
to say like oh this part of the image is

2436
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:18,980
to say like oh this part of the image is
 

2437
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,519
to say like oh this part of the image is
irrelevant right I shouldn't care about

2438
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:21,529
irrelevant right I shouldn't care about
 

2439
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:24,190
irrelevant right I shouldn't care about
this part of the image or this part of

2440
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:24,200
this part of the image or this part of
 

2441
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,279
this part of the image or this part of
the image is the most important part and

2442
00:58:26,279 --> 00:58:26,289
the image is the most important part and
 

2443
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,960
the image is the most important part and
that's kind of what we humans are able

2444
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:28,970
that's kind of what we humans are able
 

2445
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,049
that's kind of what we humans are able
to do because we have these conceptual

2446
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:32,059
to do because we have these conceptual
 

2447
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:35,049
to do because we have these conceptual
expectations there's a little bit work

2448
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:35,059
expectations there's a little bit work
 

2449
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:36,819
expectations there's a little bit work
in that there's certainly a lot more in

2450
00:58:36,819 --> 00:58:36,829
in that there's certainly a lot more in
 

2451
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:39,519
in that there's certainly a lot more in
a tent what's under the called attention

2452
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:39,529
a tent what's under the called attention
 

2453
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:41,950
a tent what's under the called attention
in natural language processing knowledge

2454
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:41,960
in natural language processing knowledge
 

2455
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,970
in natural language processing knowledge
ease it's a that's exceptionally

2456
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:45,980
ease it's a that's exceptionally
 

2457
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,180
ease it's a that's exceptionally
powerful and it's a very just as you say

2458
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,190
powerful and it's a very just as you say
 

2459
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,490
powerful and it's a very just as you say
it's really powerful idea but again in

2460
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:51,500
it's really powerful idea but again in
 

2461
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,920
it's really powerful idea but again in
sort of machine learning it all kind of

2462
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:53,930
sort of machine learning it all kind of
 

2463
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,170
sort of machine learning it all kind of
operates in an automated way that's not

2464
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:56,180
operates in an automated way that's not
 

2465
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,059
operates in an automated way that's not
human it's not it's not also okay so

2466
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:58,069
human it's not it's not also okay so
 

2467
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:00,490
human it's not it's not also okay so
that yeah right it's not dynamic I mean

2468
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:00,500
that yeah right it's not dynamic I mean
 

2469
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,579
that yeah right it's not dynamic I mean
in the sense that as a perception of a

2470
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:03,589
in the sense that as a perception of a
 

2471
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:08,859
in the sense that as a perception of a
new example is being processed those

2472
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:08,869
new example is being processed those
 

2473
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:13,329
new example is being processed those
attentions weights don't change right so

2474
00:59:13,329 --> 00:59:13,339
attentions weights don't change right so
 

2475
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:16,480
attentions weights don't change right so
I mean there's a this

2476
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,490
I mean there's a this
 

2477
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,470
I mean there's a this
kind of notion that there's not a memory

2478
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:19,480
kind of notion that there's not a memory
 

2479
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,380
kind of notion that there's not a memory
so you're not aggregating the idea of

2480
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,390
so you're not aggregating the idea of
 

2481
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,920
so you're not aggregating the idea of
the this mental model yes yeah he that

2482
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:26,930
the this mental model yes yeah he that
 

2483
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,750
the this mental model yes yeah he that
seems to be a fundamental idea there's

2484
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:28,760
seems to be a fundamental idea there's
 

2485
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,329
seems to be a fundamental idea there's
not a really powerful I mean there's

2486
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:31,339
not a really powerful I mean there's
 

2487
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:33,190
not a really powerful I mean there's
some stuff with memory but there's not a

2488
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
some stuff with memory but there's not a
 

2489
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,380
some stuff with memory but there's not a
powerful way to represent the world in

2490
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:37,390
powerful way to represent the world in
 

2491
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:42,310
powerful way to represent the world in
some sort of way that's deeper than and

2492
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:42,320
some sort of way that's deeper than and
 

2493
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,040
some sort of way that's deeper than and
it's it's so difficult because uh you

2494
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,050
it's it's so difficult because uh you
 

2495
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,870
it's it's so difficult because uh you
know neural networks do represent the

2496
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:46,880
know neural networks do represent the
 

2497
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,140
know neural networks do represent the
world they do have a mental model right

2498
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,150
world they do have a mental model right
 

2499
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:54,400
world they do have a mental model right
but it just seems to be shallow I like

2500
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:54,410
but it just seems to be shallow I like
 

2501
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,310
but it just seems to be shallow I like
it it's it's hard to it's it's hard to

2502
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:57,320
it it's it's hard to it's it's hard to
 

2503
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,640
it it's it's hard to it's it's hard to
criticize them at the fundamental level

2504
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,650
criticize them at the fundamental level
 

2505
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:04,030
criticize them at the fundamental level
to me at least it's easy to it's it's

2506
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:04,040
to me at least it's easy to it's it's
 

2507
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,070
to me at least it's easy to it's it's
easy to criticize and we'll look like

2508
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:06,080
easy to criticize and we'll look like
 

2509
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,620
easy to criticize and we'll look like
exactly you're saying mental models sort

2510
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:08,630
exactly you're saying mental models sort
 

2511
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,210
exactly you're saying mental models sort
of almost from a sec I'll put a

2512
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:10,220
of almost from a sec I'll put a
 

2513
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,480
of almost from a sec I'll put a
psychology head on say look these

2514
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,490
psychology head on say look these
 

2515
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,460
psychology head on say look these
networks are clearly not able to achieve

2516
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:15,470
networks are clearly not able to achieve
 

2517
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,530
networks are clearly not able to achieve
what we humans do with forming mental

2518
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:17,540
what we humans do with forming mental
 

2519
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,320
what we humans do with forming mental
models but analogy making so on but that

2520
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:20,330
models but analogy making so on but that
 

2521
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,609
models but analogy making so on but that
doesn't mean that they fundamentally

2522
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:21,619
doesn't mean that they fundamentally
 

2523
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:24,460
doesn't mean that they fundamentally
cannot do that like you can it's very

2524
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:24,470
cannot do that like you can it's very
 

2525
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,320
cannot do that like you can it's very
difficult to say that I mean I used to

2526
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,330
difficult to say that I mean I used to
 

2527
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,609
difficult to say that I mean I used to
me do you have a notion that the

2528
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:27,619
me do you have a notion that the
 

2529
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:30,040
me do you have a notion that the
learning approaches really I mean

2530
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,050
learning approaches really I mean
 

2531
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,770
learning approaches really I mean
they're going to not not only are they

2532
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:32,780
they're going to not not only are they
 

2533
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,520
they're going to not not only are they
limited today but they will forever be

2534
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:36,530
limited today but they will forever be
 

2535
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:40,180
limited today but they will forever be
limited in being able to construct such

2536
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,190
limited in being able to construct such
 

2537
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:45,339
limited in being able to construct such
mental models I think the idea of the

2538
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:45,349
mental models I think the idea of the
 

2539
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:49,780
mental models I think the idea of the
dynamic perception is key here the idea

2540
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:49,790
dynamic perception is key here the idea
 

2541
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:54,130
dynamic perception is key here the idea
that moving your eyes around and getting

2542
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:54,140
that moving your eyes around and getting
 

2543
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,630
that moving your eyes around and getting
feedback and that's something that you

2544
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640
feedback and that's something that you
 

2545
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,190
feedback and that's something that you
know there's been some models like that

2546
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:00,200
know there's been some models like that
 

2547
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,390
know there's been some models like that
there's certainly recurrent neural

2548
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:01,400
there's certainly recurrent neural
 

2549
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,970
there's certainly recurrent neural
networks that operate over several time

2550
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:03,980
networks that operate over several time
 

2551
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,120
networks that operate over several time
steps and but the problem is that it

2552
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,130
steps and but the problem is that it
 

2553
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:12,640
steps and but the problem is that it
that the actual the recurrence is you

2554
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:12,650
that the actual the recurrence is you
 

2555
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:17,260
that the actual the recurrence is you
know basically the the feedback is to

2556
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:17,270
know basically the the feedback is to
 

2557
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,160
know basically the the feedback is to
the next time step is the entire hidden

2558
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,170
the next time step is the entire hidden
 

2559
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:26,600
the next time step is the entire hidden
state yes the network which which is it

2560
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:26,610
state yes the network which which is it
 

2561
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,360
state yes the network which which is it
that it that's that doesn't work very

2562
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:29,370
that it that's that doesn't work very
 

2563
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,160
that it that's that doesn't work very
well does he hit the the thing I'm

2564
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,170
well does he hit the the thing I'm
 

2565
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,700
well does he hit the the thing I'm
saying is mathematically speaking it has

2566
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:34,710
saying is mathematically speaking it has
 

2567
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:38,840
saying is mathematically speaking it has
the information in that recurrence to

2568
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:38,850
the information in that recurrence to
 

2569
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,730
the information in that recurrence to
capture everything it just doesn't seem

2570
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:40,740
capture everything it just doesn't seem
 

2571
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,510
capture everything it just doesn't seem
to work yeah so like my you know it's

2572
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:44,520
to work yeah so like my you know it's
 

2573
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,700
to work yeah so like my you know it's
like it's the same touring machine

2574
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:46,710
like it's the same touring machine
 

2575
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,550
like it's the same touring machine
question right

2576
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:48,560
question right
 

2577
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,780
question right
yeah maybe theoretically it computers

2578
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:53,790
yeah maybe theoretically it computers
 

2579
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,500
yeah maybe theoretically it computers
and anything that's throwing a universal

2580
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:57,510
and anything that's throwing a universal
 

2581
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,690
and anything that's throwing a universal
Turing machine can can be intelligent

2582
01:01:59,690 --> 01:01:59,700
Turing machine can can be intelligent
 

2583
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,270
Turing machine can can be intelligent
but practically the architecture might

2584
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:02,280
but practically the architecture might
 

2585
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,790
but practically the architecture might
be very specific kind of architecture to

2586
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:04,800
be very specific kind of architecture to
 

2587
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,730
be very specific kind of architecture to
be able to create it so just I guess

2588
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:07,740
be able to create it so just I guess
 

2589
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,350
be able to create it so just I guess
it's sort of ask almost the same

2590
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:09,360
it's sort of ask almost the same
 

2591
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,920
it's sort of ask almost the same
question again is how big of a role do

2592
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:12,930
question again is how big of a role do
 

2593
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:15,770
question again is how big of a role do
you think deep learning needs will play

2594
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:15,780
you think deep learning needs will play
 

2595
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,230
you think deep learning needs will play
or needs to play in this in perception I

2596
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
or needs to play in this in perception I
 

2597
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,640
or needs to play in this in perception I
think deep learning as it's currently as

2598
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:25,650
think deep learning as it's currently as
 

2599
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,770
think deep learning as it's currently as
it currently exists you know will place

2600
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:27,780
it currently exists you know will place
 

2601
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,900
it currently exists you know will place
that kind of thing will play some role

2602
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:29,910
that kind of thing will play some role
 

2603
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,830
that kind of thing will play some role
and but I think that there's a lot more

2604
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:33,840
and but I think that there's a lot more
 

2605
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,370
and but I think that there's a lot more
going on in perception but who knows you

2606
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:37,380
going on in perception but who knows you
 

2607
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,930
going on in perception but who knows you
know that the definition of deep

2608
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:38,940
know that the definition of deep
 

2609
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,540
know that the definition of deep
learning I mean it this it's pretty

2610
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:41,550
learning I mean it this it's pretty
 

2611
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,730
learning I mean it this it's pretty
broad it's kind of an umbrella so what I

2612
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:43,740
broad it's kind of an umbrella so what I
 

2613
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,920
broad it's kind of an umbrella so what I
mean is purely sort of neural networks

2614
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:45,930
mean is purely sort of neural networks
 

2615
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,140
mean is purely sort of neural networks
yeah and a feed-forward neural networks

2616
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:48,150
yeah and a feed-forward neural networks
 

2617
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,600
yeah and a feed-forward neural networks
essentially or there could be recurrence

2618
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:50,610
essentially or there could be recurrence
 

2619
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:54,440
essentially or there could be recurrence
but yeah sometimes it feels like for us

2620
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:54,450
but yeah sometimes it feels like for us
 

2621
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,990
but yeah sometimes it feels like for us
I'll talk to Gary Marcus it feels like

2622
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:57,000
I'll talk to Gary Marcus it feels like
 

2623
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,270
I'll talk to Gary Marcus it feels like
the criticism of deep learning is kind

2624
01:02:59,270 --> 01:02:59,280
the criticism of deep learning is kind
 

2625
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,780
the criticism of deep learning is kind
of like us birds criticizing airplanes

2626
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:02,790
of like us birds criticizing airplanes
 

2627
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,870
of like us birds criticizing airplanes
for not flying well or that they're not

2628
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:05,880
for not flying well or that they're not
 

2629
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,190
for not flying well or that they're not
really flying do you think deep learning

2630
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:10,200
really flying do you think deep learning
 

2631
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,380
really flying do you think deep learning
do you think it could go all the way

2632
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:12,390
do you think it could go all the way
 

2633
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,830
do you think it could go all the way
like you're looking things do you think

2634
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:15,840
like you're looking things do you think
 

2635
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,000
like you're looking things do you think
that yeah the brute force learning

2636
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,010
that yeah the brute force learning
 

2637
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,130
that yeah the brute force learning
approach can go all the way I don't

2638
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:22,140
approach can go all the way I don't
 

2639
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,950
approach can go all the way I don't
think so no I mean I think it's an open

2640
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
think so no I mean I think it's an open
 

2641
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,090
think so no I mean I think it's an open
question but I I tend to be on the

2642
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:28,100
question but I I tend to be on the
 

2643
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,070
question but I I tend to be on the
innate Ness side that there has that

2644
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:31,080
innate Ness side that there has that
 

2645
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,090
innate Ness side that there has that
there's some things that we've been

2646
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:35,100
there's some things that we've been
 

2647
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,310
there's some things that we've been
evolved to be able to learn and

2648
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:40,320
evolved to be able to learn and
 

2649
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,000
evolved to be able to learn and
that learning just can't happen without

2650
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,010
that learning just can't happen without
 

2651
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,420
that learning just can't happen without
them so so one example here's an example

2652
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:47,430
them so so one example here's an example
 

2653
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,860
them so so one example here's an example
I had in the book that that I think is

2654
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:48,870
I had in the book that that I think is
 

2655
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,020
I had in the book that that I think is
useful to me at least in thinking about

2656
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,030
useful to me at least in thinking about
 

2657
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,910
useful to me at least in thinking about
this so this has to do with the

2658
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:54,920
this so this has to do with the
 

2659
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,680
this so this has to do with the
deepmind's atari game playing program

2660
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:57,690
deepmind's atari game playing program
 

2661
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,910
deepmind's atari game playing program
okay and learned to play these Atari

2662
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
okay and learned to play these Atari
 

2663
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,360
okay and learned to play these Atari
video games just by getting input from

2664
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:05,370
video games just by getting input from
 

2665
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:10,190
video games just by getting input from
the pixels of the screen and it learned

2666
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:10,200
the pixels of the screen and it learned
 

2667
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,250
the pixels of the screen and it learned
to play the game break out thousand

2668
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:16,260
to play the game break out thousand
 

2669
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,440
to play the game break out thousand
percent better than humans okay that was

2670
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:18,450
percent better than humans okay that was
 

2671
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,420
percent better than humans okay that was
one of the results and it was great and

2672
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:20,430
one of the results and it was great and
 

2673
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,280
one of the results and it was great and
and it learned this thing where it

2674
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:22,290
and it learned this thing where it
 

2675
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,950
and it learned this thing where it
tunneled through the side of the the

2676
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
tunneled through the side of the the
 

2677
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,320
tunneled through the side of the the
bricks in the breakout game and the ball

2678
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:27,330
bricks in the breakout game and the ball
 

2679
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,850
bricks in the breakout game and the ball
could bounce off the ceiling and then

2680
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:28,860
could bounce off the ceiling and then
 

2681
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:34,100
could bounce off the ceiling and then
just wipe out bricks okay so there was a

2682
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:34,110
just wipe out bricks okay so there was a
 

2683
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,750
just wipe out bricks okay so there was a
group who did an experiment where they

2684
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760
group who did an experiment where they
 

2685
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,490
group who did an experiment where they
took the paddle you know that you move

2686
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:40,500
took the paddle you know that you move
 

2687
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,950
took the paddle you know that you move
with the joystick and moved it up to

2688
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
with the joystick and moved it up to
 

2689
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,860
with the joystick and moved it up to
pixels or something like that and then

2690
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:45,870
pixels or something like that and then
 

2691
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:49,760
pixels or something like that and then
they they looked at a deep Q learning

2692
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:49,770
they they looked at a deep Q learning
 

2693
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,740
they they looked at a deep Q learning
system that had been trained on breakout

2694
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:51,750
system that had been trained on breakout
 

2695
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,630
system that had been trained on breakout
and said could it now transfer its

2696
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:53,640
and said could it now transfer its
 

2697
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,430
and said could it now transfer its
learning to this new version of the game

2698
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
learning to this new version of the game
 

2699
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,310
learning to this new version of the game
of course a human could but and it

2700
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:58,320
of course a human could but and it
 

2701
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,650
of course a human could but and it
couldn't maybe that's not surprising but

2702
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:00,660
couldn't maybe that's not surprising but
 

2703
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,240
couldn't maybe that's not surprising but
I guess the point is it hadn't learned

2704
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,250
I guess the point is it hadn't learned
 

2705
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:05,510
I guess the point is it hadn't learned
the concept of a paddle it hadn't

2706
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
the concept of a paddle it hadn't
 

2707
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,010
the concept of a paddle it hadn't
learned that it hadn't learned the

2708
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,020
learned that it hadn't learned the
 

2709
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,870
learned that it hadn't learned the
concept of a ball or the concept of

2710
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
concept of a ball or the concept of
 

2711
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,060
concept of a ball or the concept of
tunneling it was learning something you

2712
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:11,070
tunneling it was learning something you
 

2713
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,800
tunneling it was learning something you
know we caught we looking at it kind of

2714
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:14,810
know we caught we looking at it kind of
 

2715
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,090
know we caught we looking at it kind of
anthropomorphised it and said oh it

2716
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:17,100
anthropomorphised it and said oh it
 

2717
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,620
anthropomorphised it and said oh it
here's what it's doing and the way we

2718
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:18,630
here's what it's doing and the way we
 

2719
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,420
here's what it's doing and the way we
describe it but it actually didn't learn

2720
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:20,430
describe it but it actually didn't learn
 

2721
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,700
describe it but it actually didn't learn
those concepts and so because it didn't

2722
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:22,710
those concepts and so because it didn't
 

2723
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,070
those concepts and so because it didn't
learn those concepts it couldn't make

2724
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:25,080
learn those concepts it couldn't make
 

2725
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,430
learn those concepts it couldn't make
this transfer yes so that's a beautiful

2726
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:28,440
this transfer yes so that's a beautiful
 

2727
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,470
this transfer yes so that's a beautiful
statement but at the same time by moving

2728
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
statement but at the same time by moving
 

2729
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,110
statement but at the same time by moving
the paddle we also anthropomorphize

2730
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:33,120
the paddle we also anthropomorphize
 

2731
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,590
the paddle we also anthropomorphize
flaws to inject into the system that

2732
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:36,600
flaws to inject into the system that
 

2733
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,900
flaws to inject into the system that
will then flip out how impressed we are

2734
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:38,910
will then flip out how impressed we are
 

2735
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:42,590
will then flip out how impressed we are
by it what I mean by that is to me the

2736
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:42,600
by it what I mean by that is to me the
 

2737
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,430
by it what I mean by that is to me the
Atari games were to me deeply impressive

2738
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:46,440
Atari games were to me deeply impressive
 

2739
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,430
Atari games were to me deeply impressive
that that was possible at all so that

2740
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:49,440
that that was possible at all so that
 

2741
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,110
that that was possible at all so that
guy first pause on that and people

2742
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:51,120
guy first pause on that and people
 

2743
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,490
guy first pause on that and people
should look at that just like the game

2744
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:52,500
should look at that just like the game
 

2745
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,750
should look at that just like the game
of Go

2746
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
of Go
 

2747
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,670
of Go
which is fundamentally different to me

2748
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
which is fundamentally different to me
 

2749
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,960
which is fundamentally different to me
then then what deep blue did even though

01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:15,990
trying to say that what they did wasn't
 

2763
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,360
trying to say that what they did wasn't
impressive i think it was incredibly

2764
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:17,370
impressive i think it was incredibly

another thing that needs to be learned
 

2771
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,830
another thing that needs to be learned
so like we've been able to maybe maybe

2772
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:27,840
so like we've been able to maybe maybe
 

2773
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,720
so like we've been able to maybe maybe
been able to through the current neural

01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:29,730
been able to through the current neural
 

2775
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,970
been able to through the current neural
networks learn very basic concepts that

2776
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:31,980
networks learn very basic concepts that
 

2777
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,740
networks learn very basic concepts that
are not enough to do this general

reasoning and it may be with more data i

2780
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:37,710
reasoning and it may be with more data i
 

2781
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,280
reasoning and it may be with more data i
mean the data that you know the

2782
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:40,290
mean the data that you know the
 

2783
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,290
mean the data that you know the
interesting thing about the examples

2784
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:42,300
interesting thing about the examples
 

2785
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,110
interesting thing about the examples
that you talk about and beautifully is

2786
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:45,120
that you talk about and beautifully is
 

2787
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,130
that you talk about and beautifully is
they it's often flaws of the data well

2788
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,140
they it's often flaws of the data well
 

2789
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,750
they it's often flaws of the data well
that's the question i mean i i think

2790
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:50,760
that's the question i mean i i think
 

2791
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,550
that's the question i mean i i think
that is the key question it whether it's

2792
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:52,560
that is the key question it whether it's
 

2793
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,820
that is the key question it whether it's
a flaw of the data or not or the mexico

2794
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:54,830
a flaw of the data or not or the mexico
 

2795
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,200
a flaw of the data or not or the mexico
the reason I brought up this example was

2796
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:57,210
the reason I brought up this example was
 

2797
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,760
the reason I brought up this example was
because you were asking do I think that

2798
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:58,770
because you were asking do I think that
 

2799
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:01,610
because you were asking do I think that
you know learning from data could go all

2800
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:01,620
you know learning from data could go all
 

2801
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,620
you know learning from data could go all
the way yes and that this was why I

2802
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:03,630
the way yes and that this was why I
 

2803
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,560
the way yes and that this was why I
brought up the example because I think

2804
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:05,570
brought up the example because I think
 

2805
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:09,920
brought up the example because I think
and this was is not at all to to take

2806
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:09,930
and this was is not at all to to take
 

2807
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,630
and this was is not at all to to take
away from the impressive work that they

2808
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:11,640
away from the impressive work that they
 

2809
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,360
away from the impressive work that they
did but it's to say that when we look at

2810
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:14,370
did but it's to say that when we look at
 

2811
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:19,730
did but it's to say that when we look at
what these systems learn do they learn

2812
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:19,740
what these systems learn do they learn
 

2813

the human the things that we humans

2814
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:22,830
the human the things that we humans
 

2815
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,110
the human the things that we humans
consider to be the relevant concepts and

2816
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,120
consider to be the relevant concepts and
 

2817
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,340
consider to be the relevant concepts and
in that example

2818
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,350
in that example
 

2819
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:32,140
in that example
it didn't sure if you train it on a

01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:38,280
different places maybe it could deal
 

2825
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,000
different places maybe it could deal
with maybe it would learn that concept

01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,010
with maybe it would learn that concept
 

2827
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,580
with maybe it would learn that concept
I'm not totally sure but the question is

2828
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:43,590
I'm not totally sure but the question is
 

2829
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,560
I'm not totally sure but the question is
you know scaling that up to more

2830
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:45,570
you know scaling that up to more
 

2831
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:50,330
you know scaling that up to more
complicated worlds to what extent could

2837
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,160
data learn to divide up the world into
relevant concepts and I don't know the

2838
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,170
relevant concepts and I don't know the
 

2839
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,000
relevant concepts and I don't know the
answer but I would bet that that

2840
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,010
answer but I would bet that that
 

2841
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,780
answer but I would bet that that
without some innate notion that it can't

agree with you as the deal most experts

2848
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:14,800
agree with you as the deal most experts
 

2849
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,999
agree with you as the deal most experts
in a system but now I have a one but

2850
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:18,009
in a system but now I have a one but
 

2851
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:20,550
in a system but now I have a one but
like I have a glimmer of hope okay

2852
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:20,560
like I have a glimmer of hope okay
 

2853

have you no that's very nice and I think

2854
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:22,330
have you no that's very nice and I think
 

2855
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,730
have you no that's very nice and I think
I think that's what deep learning did in

01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:23,740
I think that's what deep learning did in
 

2857
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,860
I think that's what deep learning did in
the community is no no I still if I had

2858
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:25,870
the community is no no I still if I had

to bet all my money it's a hundred
 

2861
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,579
to bet all my money it's a hundred
percent deep learning will not takes all

2862
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:29,589
percent deep learning will not takes all
 

2863
01:08:29,589 --> 01:08:31,829
percent deep learning will not takes all
the way but there's still other it still

the power of self play of just yeah I'm

2870
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:40,930
the power of self play of just yeah I'm
 

2871
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:44,430
the power of self play of just yeah I'm
playing against you that I was like many

2872
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:44,440
playing against you that I was like many
 

2873
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,530

other times just humbled of how little I

2874
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:46,540
other times just humbled of how little I
 

2875
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,920
other times just humbled of how little I
know about what's possible you know yeah

2876
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:49,930
know about what's possible you know yeah
 

2877
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,499
know about what's possible you know yeah
I think fair enough self play is

2878
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:52,509
I think fair enough self play is
 

2879
01:08:52,509 --> 01:08:54,930
I think fair enough self play is
amazingly powerful and you know that's

2880
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:54,940
amazingly powerful and you know that's

01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,050

for fun let me ask you a topic of

that I work at least these days most
 

2895
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,269
that I work at least these days most
closely on and it's also area that I

01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,340
closely on and it's also area that I
think is a good example that you use a

01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:20,350
think is a good example that you use a
 

2899
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,720
think is a good example that you use a

we think are easy when we first try them
 

2909
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,510
we think are easy when we first try them

01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:38,520
and then realize how hard it is okay so
 

2911
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,970

right it's the old the paddle moved yeah

2960
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:54,910
right it's the old the paddle moved yeah
 

2961
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:57,810
right it's the old the paddle moved yeah
it's the paddle moved problem right and

2962
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:57,820
it's the paddle moved problem right and

01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,970
it's the paddle moved problem right and
so my understanding and you probably are

2964
01:10:59,970 --> 01:10:59,980
so my understanding and you probably are
 

2965
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,620
so my understanding and you probably are
more of an expert than I am on this is

more of an expert than I am on this is

01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:07,530
more of an expert than I am on this is
that current self driving car vision

2968
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:07,540
that current self driving car vision
 

2969
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,770
that current self driving car vision
systems have problems with obstacles

2970
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:09,780
systems have problems with obstacles
 

2971
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,840
systems have problems with obstacles
meaning that they don't know which

2972
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:12,850
meaning that they don't know which
 

2973
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,480
meaning that they don't know which
obstacles which quote unquote obstacles

2974
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:15,490
obstacles which quote unquote obstacles
 

2975
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,190
obstacles which quote unquote obstacles
they should stop for and which ones they

2976
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:17,200
they should stop for and which ones they
 

2977
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,040
they should stop for and which ones they
shouldn't stop for and so a lot of times

2978
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,050
shouldn't stop for and so a lot of times
 

2979
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,410
shouldn't stop for and so a lot of times
I read that they tend to slam on the

2980
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:22,420
I read that they tend to slam on the
 

2981
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:26,010
I read that they tend to slam on the
brakes quite a bit and the most common

2982
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:26,020
brakes quite a bit and the most common
 

2983
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,230
brakes quite a bit and the most common
accidents with self-driving cars are

2984
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:28,240
accidents with self-driving cars are
 

2985
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,780
accidents with self-driving cars are
people rear-ending them because they

2986
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:30,790
people rear-ending them because they
 

2987
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,120
people rear-ending them because they
were surprised they've warned expecting

2988
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:33,130
were surprised they've warned expecting
 

2989
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:36,150
were surprised they've warned expecting
the machine the car to stop yeah so

2990
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:36,160
the machine the car to stop yeah so
 

2991
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,590
the machine the car to stop yeah so
there's there's a lot of interesting

2992
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
there's there's a lot of interesting
 

2993
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,760
there's there's a lot of interesting
questions there whether because because

2994
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:41,770
questions there whether because because
 

2995
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,530
questions there whether because because
you mentioned kind of two things so one

2996
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:43,540
you mentioned kind of two things so one
 

2997
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,210
you mentioned kind of two things so one
is the the problem of perception of

2998
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:45,220
is the the problem of perception of
 

2999
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:48,900
is the the problem of perception of
understanding of interpreting the

3000
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:48,910
understanding of interpreting the
 

3001
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,850
understanding of interpreting the
objects that are detected right

3002
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:50,860
objects that are detected right
 

3003
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,100
objects that are detected right
correctly and the other one is more like

3004
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,110
correctly and the other one is more like
 

3005
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:56,550
correctly and the other one is more like
the policy the action that you take how

3006
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,560
the policy the action that you take how
 

3007
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,310
the policy the action that you take how
you respond to it so a lot of the cars

3008
01:11:59,310 --> 01:11:59,320
you respond to it so a lot of the cars
 

3009
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,540
you respond to it so a lot of the cars
braking is a kind of notion of to

3010
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:03,550
braking is a kind of notion of to
 

3011
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,580
braking is a kind of notion of to
clarify there's a lot of different kind

3012
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:05,590
clarify there's a lot of different kind
 

3013
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,960
clarify there's a lot of different kind
of things that are people calling

3014
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:06,970
of things that are people calling
 

3015
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:09,960
of things that are people calling
autonomous vehicles but a lot the L for

3016
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:09,970
autonomous vehicles but a lot the L for
 

3017
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:12,030
autonomous vehicles but a lot the L for
vehicles with a safety driver are the

3018
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:12,040
vehicles with a safety driver are the
 

3019
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,610
vehicles with a safety driver are the
ones like way moe and cruise and those

3020
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:14,620
ones like way moe and cruise and those
 

3021
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,490
ones like way moe and cruise and those
companies they tend to be very

3022
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:16,500
companies they tend to be very
 

3023
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,350
companies they tend to be very
conservative and cautious so they tend

3024
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:19,360
conservative and cautious so they tend
 

3025
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,570
conservative and cautious so they tend
to be very very afraid of hurting

3026
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:21,580
to be very very afraid of hurting
 

3027
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,670
to be very very afraid of hurting
anything or anyone and getting in any

3028
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:23,680
anything or anyone and getting in any
 

3029
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,070
anything or anyone and getting in any
kind of accidents so their policy is

3030
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
kind of accidents so their policy is
 

3031
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,770
kind of accidents so their policy is
very kind of that it that results in

3032
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:28,780
very kind of that it that results in
 

3033
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,170
very kind of that it that results in
being exceptionally responsive to

3034
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:31,180
being exceptionally responsive to
 

3035
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,760
being exceptionally responsive to
anything that could possibly be an

3036
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:32,770
anything that could possibly be an
 

3037
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,660
anything that could possibly be an
obstacle right

3038
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:33,670
obstacle right
 

3039
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,939
obstacle right
right which which which the human

3040
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:35,949
right which which which the human
 

3041
01:12:35,949 --> 01:12:41,340
right which which which the human
drivers around it it's unpredictably

3042
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:41,350
drivers around it it's unpredictably
 

3043
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,320
drivers around it it's unpredictably
yeah that's not a very human thing to do

3044
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:43,330
yeah that's not a very human thing to do
 

3045
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:45,390
yeah that's not a very human thing to do
caution that's not the thing we're good

3046
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:45,400
caution that's not the thing we're good
 

3047
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,490
caution that's not the thing we're good
at specially in driving we're in a hurry

3048
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:47,500
at specially in driving we're in a hurry
 

3049
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,640
at specially in driving we're in a hurry
often angry and etc especially in Boston

3050
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:50,650
often angry and etc especially in Boston
 

3051
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:54,660
often angry and etc especially in Boston
so and then there's of another and a lot

3052
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:54,670
so and then there's of another and a lot
 

3053
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,910
so and then there's of another and a lot
of times that's machine learning is not

3054
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:56,920
of times that's machine learning is not
 

3055
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,040
of times that's machine learning is not
a huge part of that it's becoming more

3056
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,050
a huge part of that it's becoming more
 

3057
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,680
a huge part of that it's becoming more
and more unclear to me how much you you

3058
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:01,690
and more unclear to me how much you you
 

3059
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,140
and more unclear to me how much you you
know sort of speaking to public

3060
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,150
know sort of speaking to public
 

3061
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:07,979
know sort of speaking to public
information because a lot of companies

3062
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:07,989
information because a lot of companies
 

3063
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,300
information because a lot of companies
say they're doing deep learning and

3064
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,310
say they're doing deep learning and
 

3065
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,890
say they're doing deep learning and
machine learning just attract good

3066
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:10,900
machine learning just attract good
 

3067
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,400
machine learning just attract good
candidates the reality is in many cases

3068
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:14,410
candidates the reality is in many cases
 

3069
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:17,790
candidates the reality is in many cases
it's still not a huge part of the the

3070
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:17,800
it's still not a huge part of the the
 

3071
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,770
it's still not a huge part of the the
perception this is this lidar there's

3072
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:19,780
perception this is this lidar there's
 

3073
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,939
perception this is this lidar there's
other sensors that are much more

3074
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:20,949
other sensors that are much more
 

3075
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:24,090
other sensors that are much more
reliable for obstacle detection and then

3076
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:24,100
reliable for obstacle detection and then
 

3077
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,550
reliable for obstacle detection and then
there's Tesla approach which is vision

3078
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
there's Tesla approach which is vision
 

3079
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,060
there's Tesla approach which is vision
only and there's I think a few companies

3080
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,070
only and there's I think a few companies
 

3081
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,709
only and there's I think a few companies
doing that protest the most sort of

3082
01:13:31,709 --> 01:13:31,719
doing that protest the most sort of
 

3083
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:33,570
doing that protest the most sort of
famously pushing that forward and that's

3084
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:33,580
famously pushing that forward and that's
 

3085
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,669
famously pushing that forward and that's
because the lidar is too expensive right

3086
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
because the lidar is too expensive right
 

3087
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:41,910
because the lidar is too expensive right
well I mean yes but I would say if you

3088
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
well I mean yes but I would say if you
 

3089
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,189
well I mean yes but I would say if you
were to for free give to every test

3090
01:13:44,189 --> 01:13:44,199
were to for free give to every test
 

3091
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:47,310
were to for free give to every test
vehicle I mean Elon Musk fundamentally

3092
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:47,320
vehicle I mean Elon Musk fundamentally
 

3093
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,870
vehicle I mean Elon Musk fundamentally
believes that lidar is a crutch right

3094
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:48,880
believes that lidar is a crutch right
 

3095
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,310
believes that lidar is a crutch right
fantasy said that that if you want to

3096
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:53,320
fantasy said that that if you want to
 

3097
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,950
fantasy said that that if you want to
solve the problem of machine learning

3098
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
solve the problem of machine learning
 

3099
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,770
solve the problem of machine learning
lidar is not should not be the primary

3100
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:58,780
lidar is not should not be the primary
 

3101
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,280
lidar is not should not be the primary
sensor is the belief okay the camera

3102
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:02,290
sensor is the belief okay the camera
 

3103
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,709
sensor is the belief okay the camera
contains a lot more information mm-hmm

3104
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:04,719
contains a lot more information mm-hmm
 

3105
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,590
contains a lot more information mm-hmm
so if you want to learn you want that

3106
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
so if you want to learn you want that
 

3107
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,560
so if you want to learn you want that
information but if you want to not to

3108
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:10,570
information but if you want to not to
 

3109
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:13,860
information but if you want to not to
hit obstacles you want like are it's

3110
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:13,870
hit obstacles you want like are it's
 

3111
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,229
hit obstacles you want like are it's
sort of it's this weird trade-off

3112
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:16,239
sort of it's this weird trade-off
 

3113
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,740
sort of it's this weird trade-off
because yeah it's sort of what Tesla

3114
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:19,750
because yeah it's sort of what Tesla
 

3115
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,500
because yeah it's sort of what Tesla
vehicles have a lot of which is really

3116
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:22,510
vehicles have a lot of which is really
 

3117
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:26,970
vehicles have a lot of which is really
the thing the price of the fallback the

3118
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:26,980
the thing the price of the fallback the
 

3119
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,910
the thing the price of the fallback the
primary fallback sensor is radar which

3120
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:29,920
primary fallback sensor is radar which
 

3121
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,550
primary fallback sensor is radar which
is a very crude version of lighter it's

01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,819
they're always paying attention so it's
a it's a trade off you know and I think

a it's a trade off you know and I think

01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:32,850
a it's a trade off you know and I think

that it's a very fair thing to say that

autonomous vehicles will be ultimately
 

3257
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,370
autonomous vehicles will be ultimately
safer than humans because humans are

safer than humans because humans are
 

3259
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,699
safer than humans because humans are
very unsafe it's kind of a low bar but

3260
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:43,709
very unsafe it's kind of a low bar but
 

3261
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,479
very unsafe it's kind of a low bar but
just like you said

3262

just like you said

3277
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:00,859
is kind of boring and we have these
phones to play with and everything but I

3278
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:00,869
phones to play with and everything but I
 

3279
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:06,449
phones to play with and everything but I
think what what's gonna happen is that

3280
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:06,459
think what what's gonna happen is that
 

3281
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:10,469
think what what's gonna happen is that
for many reasons not just AI reasons but

3282
01:18:10,469 --> 01:18:10,479
for many reasons not just AI reasons but
 

3283
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,239
for many reasons not just AI reasons but
also like legal and other reasons that

3284
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:14,249
also like legal and other reasons that
 

3285
01:18:14,249 --> 01:18:17,279
also like legal and other reasons that
the the definition of self-driving is

3286
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:17,289
the the definition of self-driving is
 

3287
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:19,529
the the definition of self-driving is
going to change or autonomous is going

3288
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:19,539
going to change or autonomous is going
 

3289
01:18:19,539 --> 01:18:24,270
going to change or autonomous is going
to change it's not going to be just I'm

3290
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:24,280
to change it's not going to be just I'm
 

3291
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,620
to change it's not going to be just I'm
gonna go to sleep in the back and you

3292
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:25,630
gonna go to sleep in the back and you
 

3293
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,330
gonna go to sleep in the back and you
just drive me anywhere

3294
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:27,340
just drive me anywhere
 

3295
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:32,459
just drive me anywhere
it's gonna be more certain areas are

3296
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:32,469
it's gonna be more certain areas are
 

3297
01:18:32,469 --> 01:18:36,270
it's gonna be more certain areas are
going to be instrumented to have the

3298
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:36,280
going to be instrumented to have the
 

3299
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,250
going to be instrumented to have the
sensors and the mapping and all the

3300
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:38,260
sensors and the mapping and all the
 

3301
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,259
sensors and the mapping and all the
stuff you need for that that the

3302
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:40,269
stuff you need for that that the
 

3303
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:42,149
stuff you need for that that the
autonomous cars won't have to have full

3304
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
autonomous cars won't have to have full
 

3305
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,569
autonomous cars won't have to have full
common sense and they'll do just fine in

3306
01:18:45,569 --> 01:18:45,579
common sense and they'll do just fine in
 

3307
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:48,449
common sense and they'll do just fine in
those areas as long as pedestrians don't

3308
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:48,459
those areas as long as pedestrians don't
 

3309
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:50,669
those areas as long as pedestrians don't
mess with them too much that's another

3310
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:50,679
mess with them too much that's another
 

3311
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:57,679
mess with them too much that's another
question I don't think we will have

3312
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:57,689
question I don't think we will have
 

3313
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:00,330
question I don't think we will have
fully autonomous self-driving in the way

3314
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:00,340
fully autonomous self-driving in the way
 

3315
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,699
fully autonomous self-driving in the way
that like most the average person thinks

3316
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:02,709
that like most the average person thinks
 

3317
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:06,359
that like most the average person thinks
of it for a very long time and just to

3318
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:06,369
of it for a very long time and just to
 

3319
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:08,729
of it for a very long time and just to
reiterate this is the interesting open

3320
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:08,739
reiterate this is the interesting open
 

3321
01:19:08,739 --> 01:19:11,250
reiterate this is the interesting open
question that I think I agree with you

3322
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:11,260
question that I think I agree with you
 

3323
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,800
question that I think I agree with you
on is to solve fully

3324
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:13,810
on is to solve fully
 

3325
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:16,200
on is to solve fully
Thomas driving you have to be able to

3326
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,210
Thomas driving you have to be able to
 

3327
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:20,190
Thomas driving you have to be able to
engineer in common sense yes I think

3328
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:20,200
engineer in common sense yes I think
 

3329
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,590
engineer in common sense yes I think
it's an important thing to hear and

3330
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:22,600
it's an important thing to hear and
 

3331
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,230
it's an important thing to hear and
think about I hope that's wrong but I

3332
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:25,240
think about I hope that's wrong but I
 

3333
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,010
think about I hope that's wrong but I
currently I could agree with you that

3334
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:28,020
currently I could agree with you that
 

3335
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:32,040
currently I could agree with you that
unfortunately you do have to have to be

3336
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,050
unfortunately you do have to have to be
 

3337
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:33,930
unfortunately you do have to have to be
more specific sort of these deep

3338
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:33,940
more specific sort of these deep
 

3339
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,450
more specific sort of these deep
understandings of physics and yeah of

3340
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:36,460
understandings of physics and yeah of
 

3341
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,030
understandings of physics and yeah of
the way this world works and also the

3342
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
the way this world works and also the
 

3343
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,380
the way this world works and also the
human dynamics like you mentioned

3344
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:40,390
human dynamics like you mentioned
 

3345
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:42,810
human dynamics like you mentioned
pedestrians and cyclists actually that's

3346
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:42,820
pedestrians and cyclists actually that's
 

3347
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,540
pedestrians and cyclists actually that's
whatever that nonverbal communication is

3348
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:45,550
whatever that nonverbal communication is
 

3349
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,970
whatever that nonverbal communication is
some people call it there's that dynamic

3350
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:47,980
some people call it there's that dynamic
 

3351
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:51,030
some people call it there's that dynamic
that is also part of this common sense

3352
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,040
that is also part of this common sense
 

3353
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,180
that is also part of this common sense
right and we're pretty we humans are

3354
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:54,190
right and we're pretty we humans are
 

3355
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,340
right and we're pretty we humans are
pretty good at predicting what other

3356
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:56,350
pretty good at predicting what other
 

3357
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,710
pretty good at predicting what other
humans are gonna do and how are our

3358
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:58,720
humans are gonna do and how are our
 

3359
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,350
humans are gonna do and how are our
actions impacts the behaviors of yes

3360
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
actions impacts the behaviors of yes
 

3361
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,840

this is weird game theoretic dance that

3362
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:03,850
this is weird game theoretic dance that
 

3363
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:06,570
this is weird game theoretic dance that
we're good at somehow and work well the

3364
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:06,580
we're good at somehow and work well the
 

3365
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,750
we're good at somehow and work well the
funny thing is is because I've watched

3366
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:08,760
funny thing is is because I've watched
 

3367
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,490
funny thing is is because I've watched
countless hours of pedestrian video and

3368
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:11,500
countless hours of pedestrian video and
 

3369
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,840
countless hours of pedestrian video and
talked to people

3370
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:12,850
talked to people
 

3371
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,910
talked to people
we humans are also really bad at

3372
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:14,920
we humans are also really bad at
 

3373
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,610
we humans are also really bad at
articulating the knowledge we have right

3374
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:17,620
articulating the knowledge we have right
 

3375
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,180
articulating the knowledge we have right
which is a been a huge challenge yes so

3376
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:21,190
which is a been a huge challenge yes so
 

3377
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,880
which is a been a huge challenge yes so
you've mentioned embodied intelligence

3378
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:23,890
you've mentioned embodied intelligence
 

3379
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,740
you've mentioned embodied intelligence
what do you think it takes to build a

3380
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:25,750
what do you think it takes to build a
 

3381
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,750
what do you think it takes to build a
system of human level intelligence does

3382
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:27,760
system of human level intelligence does
 

3383
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,380
system of human level intelligence does
he need to have a body I'm not sure but

3384
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:31,390
he need to have a body I'm not sure but
 

3385
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:34,470
he need to have a body I'm not sure but
I I'm coming around to that more and

3386
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
I I'm coming around to that more and
 

3387
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,890
I I'm coming around to that more and
more and what does it mean to be I don't

3388
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:37,900
more and what does it mean to be I don't
 

3389
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,610
more and what does it mean to be I don't
mean to keep breaking on up yeah Laocoon

3390
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:40,620
mean to keep breaking on up yeah Laocoon
 

3391
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:44,580
mean to keep breaking on up yeah Laocoon
he looms very large yeah well he

3392
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:44,590
he looms very large yeah well he
 

3393
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,130
he looms very large yeah well he
certainly has a large personality yes he

3394
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,140
certainly has a large personality yes he
 

3395
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,900
certainly has a large personality yes he
thinks that the system needs to be

3396
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:48,910
thinks that the system needs to be
 

3397
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,990
thinks that the system needs to be
grounded meaning he needs to sort of be

3398
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
grounded meaning he needs to sort of be
 

3399
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,540
grounded meaning he needs to sort of be
able to interact with reality but it

3400
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:54,550
able to interact with reality but it
 

3401
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,800
able to interact with reality but it
doesn't think it necessarily need to

3402
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:55,810
doesn't think it necessarily need to
 

3403
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:56,700
doesn't think it necessarily need to
have a body

3404
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:56,710
have a body
 

3405
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:57,780
have a body
so when you think of what's the

3406
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:57,790
so when you think of what's the
 

3407
01:20:57,790 --> 01:21:01,410
so when you think of what's the
difference I guess I want to ask when

3408
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:01,420
difference I guess I want to ask when
 

3409
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,480
difference I guess I want to ask when
you mean body do you mean you have to be

3410
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:03,490
you mean body do you mean you have to be
 

3411
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:05,610
you mean body do you mean you have to be
able to play with the world or do you

3412
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:05,620
able to play with the world or do you
 

3413
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,680
able to play with the world or do you
also mean like there's a body that you

3414
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:07,690
also mean like there's a body that you
 

3415
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,310
also mean like there's a body that you
that you have to preserve oh that's a

3416
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:11,320
that you have to preserve oh that's a
 

3417
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,050
that you have to preserve oh that's a
good question I haven't really thought

3418
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,060
good question I haven't really thought
 

3419
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:15,450
good question I haven't really thought
about that but I think both I would

3420
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:15,460
about that but I think both I would
 

3421
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:20,720
about that but I think both I would
guess because it's because I think you I

3422
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:20,730
guess because it's because I think you I
 

3423
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:24,960
guess because it's because I think you I
think intelligence it's so hard to

3424
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:24,970
think intelligence it's so hard to
 

3425
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,620
think intelligence it's so hard to
separate it from

3426
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:27,630
separate it from
 

3427
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:30,740
separate it from
self our desire for self-preservation

3428
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:30,750
self our desire for self-preservation
 

3429
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:36,740
self our desire for self-preservation
our emotions are all that non rational

3430
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:36,750
our emotions are all that non rational
 

3431
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:41,200
our emotions are all that non rational
stuff that kind of gets in the way of

3432
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,210

 

3433
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:46,700

logical thinking because we the way you

3434
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:46,710
logical thinking because we the way you
 

3435
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,780
logical thinking because we the way you
know if we're talking about human

3436
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:47,790
know if we're talking about human
 

3437
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,640
know if we're talking about human
intelligence or human level intelligence

3438
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:49,650
intelligence or human level intelligence
 

3439
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,920
intelligence or human level intelligence
whatever that means

3440
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:51,930
whatever that means
 

3441
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,330
whatever that means
a huge part of it is social that you

3442
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:56,340
a huge part of it is social that you
 

3443
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,380
a huge part of it is social that you
know we were evolved to be social and to

3444
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:00,390
know we were evolved to be social and to
 

3445
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,990
know we were evolved to be social and to
deal with other people and that's just

3446
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:03,000
deal with other people and that's just
 

3447
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,860
deal with other people and that's just
so ingrained in us that it's hard to

3448
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:06,870
so ingrained in us that it's hard to
 

3449
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,130
so ingrained in us that it's hard to
separate intelligence from that I I

3450
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:10,140
separate intelligence from that I I
 

3451
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:15,080
separate intelligence from that I I
think you know AI for the last 70 years

3452
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:15,090
think you know AI for the last 70 years
 

3453
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,120
think you know AI for the last 70 years
or however long has been around it it

3454
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:17,130
or however long has been around it it
 

3455
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,920
or however long has been around it it
has largely been separated there's this

3456
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:18,930
has largely been separated there's this
 

3457
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,720
has largely been separated there's this
idea that there's like it's kind of very

3458
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:22,730
idea that there's like it's kind of very
 

3459
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:25,100
idea that there's like it's kind of very
Cartesian there's this you know thinking

3460
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:25,110
Cartesian there's this you know thinking
 

3461
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,980
Cartesian there's this you know thinking
thing that we're trying to create but we

3462
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:27,990
thing that we're trying to create but we
 

3463
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,360
thing that we're trying to create but we
don't care about all this other stuff

3464
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:29,370
don't care about all this other stuff
 

3465
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:34,010
don't care about all this other stuff
and I think the other stuff is very

3466
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,020
and I think the other stuff is very
 

3467
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,740
and I think the other stuff is very
fundamental so there's idea that things

3468
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:36,750
fundamental so there's idea that things
 

3469
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,510
fundamental so there's idea that things
like emotion get in the way of

3470
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:38,520
like emotion get in the way of
 

3471
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,570
like emotion get in the way of
intelligence as opposed to being an

3472
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:41,580
intelligence as opposed to being an
 

3473
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,300
intelligence as opposed to being an
integral part and part of it so I mean

3474
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:44,310
integral part and part of it so I mean
 

3475
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,120
integral part and part of it so I mean
I'm Russian so romanticize the notions

3476
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,130
I'm Russian so romanticize the notions
 

3477
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,830
I'm Russian so romanticize the notions
of emotion and suffering and all that

3478
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:48,840
of emotion and suffering and all that
 

3479
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,620
of emotion and suffering and all that
kind of fear of mortality those kinds of

3480
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:51,630
kind of fear of mortality those kinds of
 

3481
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:56,840
kind of fear of mortality those kinds of
things so I I especially sort of by the

3482
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:56,850
things so I I especially sort of by the
 

3483
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,220
things so I I especially sort of by the
way did you see that there was this

3484
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:58,230
way did you see that there was this
 

3485
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,450
way did you see that there was this
recent thing going around the internet

3486
01:22:59,450 --> 01:22:59,460
recent thing going around the internet
 

3487
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,270
recent thing going around the internet
of this so some I think he's a Russian

3488
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:02,280
of this so some I think he's a Russian
 

3489
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,580
of this so some I think he's a Russian
or some Slavic head had written this

3490
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:04,590
or some Slavic head had written this
 

3491
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:07,040
or some Slavic head had written this
thing a sort of anti the idea of super

3492
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,050
thing a sort of anti the idea of super
 

3493
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,320
thing a sort of anti the idea of super
intelligence mmm-hmm I forgot maybes

3494
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:09,330
intelligence mmm-hmm I forgot maybes
 

3495
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:11,720
intelligence mmm-hmm I forgot maybes
polish anyway so at all these arguments

3496
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:11,730
polish anyway so at all these arguments
 

3497
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,750
polish anyway so at all these arguments
and one one was the argument from Slavic

3498
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:14,760
and one one was the argument from Slavic
 

3499
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:21,020
and one one was the argument from Slavic
pessimism do you remember what the

3500
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:21,030
pessimism do you remember what the
 

3501
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:27,010
pessimism do you remember what the
argument is it's like nothing ever works

3502
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:27,020

 

3503
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,480

so what what do you think is the role

3504
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:29,490
so what what do you think is the role
 

3505
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:32,180
so what what do you think is the role
like that's such a fascinating idea that

3506
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:32,190
like that's such a fascinating idea that
 

3507
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:35,300
like that's such a fascinating idea that
the what we perceive as serve the limits

3508
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:35,310
the what we perceive as serve the limits
 

3509
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,929
the what we perceive as serve the limits
of human

3510
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:36,939
of human
 

3511
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:40,319
of human
of the human mind which is emotion and

01:23:42,929 --> 01:23:42,939
fear and all those kinds of things are
 

3515
01:23:42,939 --> 01:23:46,819
fear and all those kinds of things are
integral to intelligence could could you

3516
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:46,829
integral to intelligence could could you
 

3517
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:50,959
integral to intelligence could could you
elaborate on that like what why is that

3518
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:50,969
elaborate on that like what why is that
 

3519
01:23:50,969 --> 01:23:52,169
elaborate on that like what why is that
important

do you think for human level

3522
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:56,380
do you think for human level
 

3523
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,239
do you think for human level
intelligence at least the way the humans

3524
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:00,249
intelligence at least the way the humans

to learn about what we really want and
he gave this example what if we have a

3588
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:47,530
he gave this example what if we have a
 

3589
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:50,100
he gave this example what if we have a
super intelligent AI and we give it the

3590
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,110
super intelligent AI and we give it the
 

3591
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:50,459
super intelligent AI and we give it the
prob

3592
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:50,469
prob
 

3593
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:54,720
prob
of solving climate change and it decides

3594
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:54,730
of solving climate change and it decides
 

3595
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:57,150
of solving climate change and it decides
that the best way to lower the carbon in

3596
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:57,160
that the best way to lower the carbon in
 

3597
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,180
that the best way to lower the carbon in
the atmosphere is to kill all the humans

3598
01:25:59,180 --> 01:25:59,190
the atmosphere is to kill all the humans
 

3599
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:02,370
the atmosphere is to kill all the humans
okay so to me that just made no sense at

3600
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:02,380
okay so to me that just made no sense at
 

3601
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:08,910
okay so to me that just made no sense at
all because a super intelligent AI first

3602
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:08,920
all because a super intelligent AI first
 

3603
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,709
all because a super intelligent AI first
of all thinking what trying to figure

3604
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:10,719
of all thinking what trying to figure
 

3605
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,100
of all thinking what trying to figure
out what what super intelligence means

3606
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:13,110
out what what super intelligence means
 

3607
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:18,450
out what what super intelligence means
and it doesn't it seems that something

3608
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:18,460
and it doesn't it seems that something
 

3609
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:22,560
and it doesn't it seems that something
that super intelligent can't just be

3610
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:22,570
that super intelligent can't just be
 

3611
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:24,600
that super intelligent can't just be
intelligent along this one dimension of

3612
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:24,610
intelligent along this one dimension of
 

3613
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,880
intelligent along this one dimension of
okay I'm gonna figure out all the steps

3614
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:26,890
okay I'm gonna figure out all the steps
 

3615
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,610
okay I'm gonna figure out all the steps
the best optimal path to solving climate

3616
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:29,620
the best optimal path to solving climate
 

3617
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:32,430
the best optimal path to solving climate
change and not be intelligent enough to

3618
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:32,440
change and not be intelligent enough to
 

3619
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,250
change and not be intelligent enough to
figure out that humans don't want to be

3620
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:35,260
figure out that humans don't want to be
 

3621
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,979
figure out that humans don't want to be
killed that you could get to one without

3622
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:37,989
killed that you could get to one without
 

3623
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:41,310
killed that you could get to one without
having the other and you know

3624
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:41,320
having the other and you know
 

3625
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,340
having the other and you know
boström in his book talks about the

3626
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:44,350
boström in his book talks about the
 

3627
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,010
boström in his book talks about the
orthogonality hypothesis where he says

3628
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:47,020
orthogonality hypothesis where he says
 

3629
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:52,050
orthogonality hypothesis where he says
he thinks that systems I can't remember

3630
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:52,060
he thinks that systems I can't remember
 

3631
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,400
he thinks that systems I can't remember
exactly what it is but it like a systems

3632
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:53,410
exactly what it is but it like a systems
 

3633
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:57,450
exactly what it is but it like a systems
goals and it's uh values don't have to

3634
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:57,460
goals and it's uh values don't have to
 

3635
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,640
goals and it's uh values don't have to
be aligned there's some orthogonal 'ti

3636
01:26:59,640 --> 01:26:59,650
be aligned there's some orthogonal 'ti
 

3637
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:02,010
be aligned there's some orthogonal 'ti
there which didn't make any sense to me

3638
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:02,020
there which didn't make any sense to me
 

3639
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:05,510
there which didn't make any sense to me
so you're saying it in any system that's

3640
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:05,520
so you're saying it in any system that's
 

3641
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,680
so you're saying it in any system that's
sufficiently not even super intelligent

3642
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:07,690
sufficiently not even super intelligent
 

3643
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,910
sufficiently not even super intelligent
but is it approach greater greater

3644
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:08,920
but is it approach greater greater
 

3645
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,250
but is it approach greater greater
intelligence there's a holistic nature

3646
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:11,260
intelligence there's a holistic nature
 

3647
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,350
intelligence there's a holistic nature
that will sort of attention that will

3648
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:13,360
that will sort of attention that will
 

3649
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,060
that will sort of attention that will
naturally emerge

3650
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:15,070
naturally emerge
 

3651
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,979
naturally emerge
yes events it from sort of any one

3652
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:16,989
yes events it from sort of any one
 

3653
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:19,620
yes events it from sort of any one
dimension running away yeah yeah exactly

3654
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:19,630
dimension running away yeah yeah exactly
 

3655
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:22,650
dimension running away yeah yeah exactly
so so you know

3656
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:22,660
so so you know
 

3657
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,439
so so you know
boström had this example of the the

3658
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:25,449
boström had this example of the the
 

3659
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:28,950
boström had this example of the the
super intelligent AI that that makes

3660
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
super intelligent AI that that makes
 

3661
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,689
super intelligent AI that that makes
that turns the world into paperclips

3662
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:30,699
that turns the world into paperclips
 

3663
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:33,180
that turns the world into paperclips
because its job is to make paper clips

3664
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:33,190
because its job is to make paper clips
 

3665
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:35,820
because its job is to make paper clips
or something and that just as a thought

3666
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:35,830
or something and that just as a thought
 

3667
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,700
or something and that just as a thought
experiment didn't make any sense to me

3668
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:37,710
experiment didn't make any sense to me
 

3669
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,950
experiment didn't make any sense to me
well as a thought experiment or the

3670
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:40,960
well as a thought experiment or the
 

3671
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,050
well as a thought experiment or the
thing that could possibly be realized

3672
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,060
thing that could possibly be realized
 

3673
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,920
thing that could possibly be realized
either so so I think that you know what

3674
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:46,930
either so so I think that you know what
 

3675
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:48,810
either so so I think that you know what
my op ed was trying to do was say that

3676
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:48,820
my op ed was trying to do was say that
 

3677
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,330
my op ed was trying to do was say that
that intelligence is more complex than

3678
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:51,340
that intelligence is more complex than
 

3679
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:56,400
that intelligence is more complex than
these people are presenting it that it's

3680
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:56,410
these people are presenting it that it's
 

3681
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:59,400
these people are presenting it that it's
not like it's not so separable the

3682
01:27:59,400 --> 01:27:59,410
not like it's not so separable the
 

3683
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:04,229
not like it's not so separable the
rationality the the values the emotions

3684
01:28:04,229 --> 01:28:04,239
rationality the the values the emotions
 

3685
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:08,010
rationality the the values the emotions
all of that that it's the the view that

3686
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:08,020
all of that that it's the the view that
 

3687
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,020
all of that that it's the the view that
you could separate all these dimensions

3688
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:10,030
you could separate all these dimensions
 

3689
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:12,180
you could separate all these dimensions
and build the machine that has one of

3690
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:12,190
and build the machine that has one of
 

3691
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:13,590
and build the machine that has one of
these dimensions and it's super

3692
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
these dimensions and it's super
 

3693
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,630
these dimensions and it's super
intelligent in one dimension but it

3694
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:15,640
intelligent in one dimension but it
 

3695
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,250
intelligent in one dimension but it
doesn't have any of the other dimensions

3696
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:17,260
doesn't have any of the other dimensions
 

3697
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:22,890
doesn't have any of the other dimensions
that's what I was trying to criticize

3698
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:22,900
that's what I was trying to criticize
 

3699
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,020
that's what I was trying to criticize
that that that I don't believe that

3700
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:25,030
that that that I don't believe that
 

3701
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:29,790
that that that I don't believe that
so can I read a few sentences from

3702
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:29,800
so can I read a few sentences from
 

3703
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,380
so can I read a few sentences from
yoshua bengio who is always super

01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,360
you know the orthogonality and those
kinds of things the concerns of just

3744
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:30,370
kinds of things the concerns of just
 

3745
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:34,440
kinds of things the concerns of just
aligning values with the capabilities of

3746
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:34,450
aligning values with the capabilities of
 

3747
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:36,500
aligning values with the capabilities of
the system is something that might come

3748
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:36,510
the system is something that might come
 

3749
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:39,330
the system is something that might come
long before we reach anything like in

3750
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:39,340
long before we reach anything like in
 

3751
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,640
long before we reach anything like in
super intelligence so your criticism

3752
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:41,650
super intelligence so your criticism
 

3753
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,520
super intelligence so your criticism
it's kind of really nice as saying this

3754
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:44,530
it's kind of really nice as saying this
 

3755
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:47,130
it's kind of really nice as saying this
idea of super intelligence systems seem

3756
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:47,140
idea of super intelligence systems seem
 

3757
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,140
idea of super intelligence systems seem
to be dismissing fundamental parts of

3758
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:49,150
to be dismissing fundamental parts of
 

3759
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,000
to be dismissing fundamental parts of
what intelligence would take and then

3760
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,010
what intelligence would take and then
 

3761
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:55,770
what intelligence would take and then
you know kind of says yes but if we look

3762
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:55,780
you know kind of says yes but if we look
 

3763
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:56,790
you know kind of says yes but if we look
at systems that are much less

3764
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:56,800
at systems that are much less
 

3765
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,790
at systems that are much less
intelligent there might be these same

3766
01:29:59,790 --> 01:29:59,800
intelligent there might be these same
 

3767
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:04,140
intelligent there might be these same
kinds of problems that emerge sure but I

3768
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,150
kinds of problems that emerge sure but I
 

3769
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,750
kinds of problems that emerge sure but I
guess the example that he gives there of

3770
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:06,760
guess the example that he gives there of
 

3771
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,930
guess the example that he gives there of
these corporations that's people right

3772
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:09,940
these corporations that's people right
 

3773
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,450
these corporations that's people right
those are people's values I mean we're

3774
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:12,460
those are people's values I mean we're
 

3775
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,090
those are people's values I mean we're
talking about people the corporations

3776
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:15,100
talking about people the corporations
 

3777
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,100
talking about people the corporations
are their value

3778
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,110
are their value
 

3779
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,890
are their value
are the values of the people who run

3780
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:20,900
are the values of the people who run
 

3781
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,839
are the values of the people who run
those corporations but the idea is the

3782
01:30:22,839 --> 01:30:22,849
those corporations but the idea is the
 

3783
01:30:22,849 --> 01:30:25,240
those corporations but the idea is the
algorithm that's right so does the

3784
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:25,250
algorithm that's right so does the
 

3785
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,939
algorithm that's right so does the
fundamental person that the fundamental

3786
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:27,949
fundamental person that the fundamental
 

3787
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:30,729
fundamental person that the fundamental
element of what does the bad thing as a

3788
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:30,739
element of what does the bad thing as a
 

3789
01:30:30,739 --> 01:30:31,689
element of what does the bad thing as a
human being

3790
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:31,699
human being
 

3791
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:35,379
human being
yeah but the the algorithm kind of

3792
01:30:35,379 --> 01:30:35,389
yeah but the the algorithm kind of
 

3793
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:38,140
yeah but the the algorithm kind of
controls the behavior this mass of human

3794
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:38,150
controls the behavior this mass of human
 

3795
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:41,589
controls the behavior this mass of human
beings which help whatever for a company

3796
01:30:41,589 --> 01:30:41,599
beings which help whatever for a company
 

3797
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:43,839
beings which help whatever for a company
that's the outs of for example if it's

3798
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:43,849
that's the outs of for example if it's
 

3799
01:30:43,849 --> 01:30:45,459
that's the outs of for example if it's
advertisement driving company that

3800
01:30:45,459 --> 01:30:45,469
advertisement driving company that
 

3801
01:30:45,469 --> 01:30:49,810
advertisement driving company that
recommends certain things and encourages

3802
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:49,820
recommends certain things and encourages
 

3803
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,660
recommends certain things and encourages
engagement so it gets money by

3804
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:52,670
engagement so it gets money by
 

3805
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:55,689
engagement so it gets money by
encouraging engagement and therefore the

3806
01:30:55,689 --> 01:30:55,699
encouraging engagement and therefore the
 

3807
01:30:55,699 --> 01:30:59,200
encouraging engagement and therefore the
company more and more it's like the

3808
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,210
company more and more it's like the
 

3809
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,100
company more and more it's like the
cycle that builds an algorithm that

3810
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:02,110
cycle that builds an algorithm that
 

3811
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:04,419
cycle that builds an algorithm that
enforces more engagement and made

3812
01:31:04,419 --> 01:31:04,429
enforces more engagement and made
 

3813
01:31:04,429 --> 01:31:06,250
enforces more engagement and made
perhaps more division in the culture and

3814
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:06,260
perhaps more division in the culture and
 

3815
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,589
perhaps more division in the culture and
so on so on again I guess the question

3816
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:08,599
so on so on again I guess the question
 

3817
01:31:08,599 --> 01:31:13,569
so on so on again I guess the question
here is sort of who has the agency so

3818
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:13,579
here is sort of who has the agency so
 

3819
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:15,490
here is sort of who has the agency so
you might say for instance we don't want

3820
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:15,500
you might say for instance we don't want
 

3821
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,470
you might say for instance we don't want
our algorithms to be racist right and

3822
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:19,480
our algorithms to be racist right and
 

3823
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,209
our algorithms to be racist right and
facial recognition you know some people

3824
01:31:22,209 --> 01:31:22,219
facial recognition you know some people
 

3825
01:31:22,219 --> 01:31:23,770
facial recognition you know some people
have criticized some facial recognition

3826
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:23,780
have criticized some facial recognition
 

3827
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,569
have criticized some facial recognition
systems as being racist because they're

3828
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:25,579
systems as being racist because they're
 

3829
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:30,010
systems as being racist because they're
not as good on darker skin and lighter

3830
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,020
not as good on darker skin and lighter
 

3831
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:33,459
not as good on darker skin and lighter
skin okay but the agency there the the

3832
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:33,469
skin okay but the agency there the the
 

3833
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:36,220
skin okay but the agency there the the
the the actual algal recognition

3834
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:36,230
the the actual algal recognition
 

3835
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:38,919
the the actual algal recognition
algorithm isn't what has the agency it's

3836
01:31:38,919 --> 01:31:38,929
algorithm isn't what has the agency it's
 

3837
01:31:38,929 --> 01:31:41,649
algorithm isn't what has the agency it's
it's not the racist thing right it's

3838
01:31:41,649 --> 01:31:41,659
it's not the racist thing right it's
 

3839
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:46,479
it's not the racist thing right it's
it's the that the I don't know the the

3840
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:46,489
it's the that the I don't know the the
 

3841
01:31:46,489 --> 01:31:49,419
it's the that the I don't know the the
combination of the training data the

3842
01:31:49,419 --> 01:31:49,429
combination of the training data the
 

3843
01:31:49,429 --> 01:31:52,479
combination of the training data the
cameras being used I whatever but my

3844
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:52,489
cameras being used I whatever but my
 

3845
01:31:52,489 --> 01:31:55,240
cameras being used I whatever but my
understanding of and I'll say I told

3846
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:55,250
understanding of and I'll say I told
 

3847
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,189
understanding of and I'll say I told
agree with Benjy oh there that he you

3848
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:57,199
agree with Benjy oh there that he you
 

3849
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,649
agree with Benjy oh there that he you
know I think there are these value

3850
01:31:59,649 --> 01:31:59,659
know I think there are these value
 

3851
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:05,290
know I think there are these value
issues with our use of algorithms but my

3852
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:05,300
issues with our use of algorithms but my
 

3853
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:09,040
issues with our use of algorithms but my
understanding of what Russell's argument

3854
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:09,050
understanding of what Russell's argument
 

3855
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:13,149
understanding of what Russell's argument
was is more that the algorithm itself

3856
01:32:13,149 --> 01:32:13,159
was is more that the algorithm itself
 

3857
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:16,209
was is more that the algorithm itself
has the agency now it's the thing that's

3858
01:32:16,209 --> 01:32:16,219
has the agency now it's the thing that's
 

3859
01:32:16,219 --> 01:32:18,520
has the agency now it's the thing that's
making the decisions and it's the thing

3860
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:18,530
making the decisions and it's the thing
 

3861
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:22,479
making the decisions and it's the thing
that has what we would call values yes

3862
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:22,489
that has what we would call values yes
 

3863
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:25,000
that has what we would call values yes
so whether that's just a matter of

3864
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,010
so whether that's just a matter of
 

3865
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,740
so whether that's just a matter of
degree you know it's hard it's hard to

3866
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:26,750
degree you know it's hard it's hard to
 

3867
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,569
degree you know it's hard it's hard to
say right because but I would say that's

3868
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:28,579
say right because but I would say that's
 

3869
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:31,179
say right because but I would say that's
sort of qualitatively different than a

3870
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:31,189
sort of qualitatively different than a
 

3871
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:36,310
sort of qualitatively different than a
face recognition neural network and to

3872
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
face recognition neural network and to
 

3873
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,100
face recognition neural network and to
broadly linger on that point if you look

3874
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:39,110
broadly linger on that point if you look
 

3875
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:42,429
broadly linger on that point if you look

do you share any of those concerns and

01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:56,360
do you share any of those concerns and

01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,020
do you share any of those concerns and

like existential threat to humanity so I

3894
01:33:07,149 --> 01:33:07,159
like existential threat to humanity so I
 

3895
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:11,799
like existential threat to humanity so I
would say yes it's possible but I think

3896
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:11,809
would say yes it's possible but I think
 

3897
01:33:11,809 --> 01:33:15,100
would say yes it's possible but I think
there's a lot more closer in existential

01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:16,540
there's a lot more closer in existential
threats you had as you said like a

3900
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:16,550
threats you had as you said like a
 

3901
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:19,330
threats you had as you said like a
hundred years for so your times more

3902
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:19,340
hundred years for so your times more
 

3903
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,830
hundred years for so your times more
more than a hundred more than a hundred

3904
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:20,840
more than a hundred more than a hundred
 

3905
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,839
more than a hundred more than a hundred
years and so that maybe even more than

3906
01:33:22,839 --> 01:33:22,849
years and so that maybe even more than
 

3907
01:33:22,849 --> 01:33:25,000
years and so that maybe even more than
500 years I don't I don't know I mean

3908
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,010
500 years I don't I don't know I mean
 

3909
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:27,520
500 years I don't I don't know I mean
it's so the existential threats are so

3910
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:27,530
it's so the existential threats are so
 

3911
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:30,939
it's so the existential threats are so
far out that the future is the immune

3912
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:30,949
far out that the future is the immune
 

3913
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:32,350
far out that the future is the immune
there'll be a million different

3914
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:32,360
there'll be a million different
 

3915
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,149
there'll be a million different
technologies that we can't even predict

3916
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:34,159
technologies that we can't even predict
 

3917
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:35,739
technologies that we can't even predict
now that will fundamentally change the

3918
01:33:35,739 --> 01:33:35,749
now that will fundamentally change the
 

3919
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:38,679
now that will fundamentally change the
nature of our behavior reality society

3920
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:38,689
nature of our behavior reality society
 

3921
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:41,080
nature of our behavior reality society
and so on before then I think so I think

3922
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:41,090
and so on before then I think so I think
 

3923
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:43,709
and so on before then I think so I think
so and you know we have so many other

3924
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:43,719
so and you know we have so many other
 

3925
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:46,239
so and you know we have so many other
pressing existential threats going on

3926
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:46,249
pressing existential threats going on
 

3927
01:33:46,249 --> 01:33:48,779
pressing existential threats going on
new hangouts even their nuclear weapons

3928
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:48,789
new hangouts even their nuclear weapons
 

3929
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:52,650
new hangouts even their nuclear weapons
climate problems you know

3930
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:52,660
climate problems you know
 

3931
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:58,450
climate problems you know
poverty possible pandemics that you can

01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:58,460
poverty possible pandemics that you can
 

3933
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:00,940
poverty possible pandemics that you can
go on and on and I think though you know

3934
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:00,950
go on and on and I think though you know
 

3935
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:04,420
go on and on and I think though you know
worrying about existential threat from

3936
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:04,430
worrying about existential threat from
 

3937
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:12,730
worrying about existential threat from
AI is it's not the best priority for

3938
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:12,740
AI is it's not the best priority for
 

3939
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:14,080
AI is it's not the best priority for
what we should be worried about that

3940
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,090
what we should be worried about that
 

3941
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,250
what we should be worried about that
that's kind of my view because we're so

3942
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,260
that's kind of my view because we're so
 

3943
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:19,930
that's kind of my view because we're so
far away but I you know I I'm not I'm

3944
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:19,940
far away but I you know I I'm not I'm
 

3945
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:23,730
far away but I you know I I'm not I'm
not necessarily criticizing Russell or

3946
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:23,740
not necessarily criticizing Russell or
 

3947
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,410
not necessarily criticizing Russell or
boström or whoever for worrying about

3948
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:26,420
boström or whoever for worrying about
 

3949
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,570
boström or whoever for worrying about
that and I'm I think it's some some

3950
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:28,580
that and I'm I think it's some some
 

3951
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,070
that and I'm I think it's some some
people should be worried about it it's

01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
people should be worried about it it's
 

3953
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,650
people should be worried about it it's
it's certainly fine but I I was more

3954
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:32,660
it's certainly fine but I I was more
 

3955
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:36,040
it's certainly fine but I I was more
sort of getting at their their view of

3956
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:36,050
sort of getting at their their view of
 

3957
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:39,190
sort of getting at their their view of
intelligible intelligence is mmm-hmm so

3958
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:39,200
intelligible intelligence is mmm-hmm so
 

3959
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,780
intelligible intelligence is mmm-hmm so
I was more focusing on like their view

3960
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:40,790
I was more focusing on like their view
 

3961
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:48,460
I was more focusing on like their view
of the super intelligence then uh just

3962
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:48,470
of the super intelligence then uh just
 

3963
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:51,400
of the super intelligence then uh just
the fact of them worrying and the title

3964
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:51,410
the fact of them worrying and the title
 

3965
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:53,860
the fact of them worrying and the title
of the article was written by the the

3966
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:53,870
of the article was written by the the
 

3967
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:55,360
of the article was written by the the
New York Times editors I wouldn't have

3968
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:55,370
New York Times editors I wouldn't have
 

3969
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:58,480
New York Times editors I wouldn't have
called it that we shouldn't be scared by

3970
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:58,490
called it that we shouldn't be scared by
 

3971
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,700
called it that we shouldn't be scared by
super intelligent and no if you wrote it

3972
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:00,710
super intelligent and no if you wrote it
 

3973
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:02,650
super intelligent and no if you wrote it
be like we should redefine what you mean

3974
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:02,660
be like we should redefine what you mean
 

3975
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:05,650
be like we should redefine what you mean
by super in I actually said it said you

3976
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:05,660
by super in I actually said it said you
 

3977
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,270
by super in I actually said it said you
know something like super intelligence

3978
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,280
know something like super intelligence
 

3979
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:16,080
know something like super intelligence
is not is is not a sort of coherent idea

3980
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,090

 

3981
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,730

that's not like it's only New York Times

3982
01:35:18,730 --> 01:35:18,740
that's not like it's only New York Times
 

3983
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,790
that's not like it's only New York Times
would put in and the follow-up argument

3984
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:21,800
would put in and the follow-up argument
 

3985
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,160
would put in and the follow-up argument
that Yoshio makes also not argument but

3986
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,170
that Yoshio makes also not argument but
 

3987
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,080
that Yoshio makes also not argument but
a statement and I've heard him say it

3988
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:26,090
a statement and I've heard him say it
 

3989
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:28,960
a statement and I've heard him say it
before and I think I agree he's kind of

3990
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:28,970
before and I think I agree he's kind of
 

3991
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,760
before and I think I agree he's kind of
has a very friendly way of phrasing it

3992
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:30,770
has a very friendly way of phrasing it
 

3993
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:33,100
has a very friendly way of phrasing it
is it's good for a lot of people to

3994
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:33,110
is it's good for a lot of people to
 

3995
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:37,540
is it's good for a lot of people to
believe different things yeah well no

3996
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:37,550
believe different things yeah well no
 

3997
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,430
believe different things yeah well no
but he's it's also practically speaking

3998
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
but he's it's also practically speaking
 

3999
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,300
but he's it's also practically speaking
like we shouldn't be like while your

4000
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:43,310
like we shouldn't be like while your
 

4001
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:46,450
like we shouldn't be like while your
article stands like Stuart Russell does

4002
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:46,460
article stands like Stuart Russell does
 

4003
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,580
article stands like Stuart Russell does
amazing work boström does amazing work

4004
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:48,590
amazing work boström does amazing work
 

4005
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,340
amazing work boström does amazing work
you do amazing work and even when you

4006
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:51,350
you do amazing work and even when you
 

4007
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:53,530
you do amazing work and even when you
disagree about the definition of super

disagree about the definition of super
 

4009

disagree about the definition of super
intelligence or the usefulness of even

4010
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:55,430
intelligence or the usefulness of even
 

4011
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,910
intelligence or the usefulness of even
the term it's still useful to have

4012
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:57,920
the term it's still useful to have
 

4013
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,870
the term it's still useful to have
people that like use that term all right

4014
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:01,880
people that like use that term all right
 

4015
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,030
people that like use that term all right
and then argue it sir I

4016
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:04,040
and then argue it sir I
 

4017
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,640
and then argue it sir I
I absolutely agree with video there and

4018
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:06,650
I absolutely agree with video there and
 

4019
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:08,710
I absolutely agree with video there and
I think it's great that you know and

4020
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:08,720
I think it's great that you know and
 

4021
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,880
I think it's great that you know and
it's great that New York Times will

4022
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:09,890
it's great that New York Times will
 

4023
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,610
it's great that New York Times will
publish all this stuff that's right it's

4024
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:12,620
publish all this stuff that's right it's
 

4025
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,160
publish all this stuff that's right it's
an exciting time to be here what what do

4026
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:15,170
an exciting time to be here what what do
 

4027
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,660
an exciting time to be here what what do
you think is a good test of intelligence

4028
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:16,670
you think is a good test of intelligence
 

4029
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:20,110
you think is a good test of intelligence
IQ is is natural language ultimately a

4030
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:20,120
IQ is is natural language ultimately a
 

4031
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,940
IQ is is natural language ultimately a
test that you find the most compelling

4032
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:21,950
test that you find the most compelling
 

4033
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:25,630
test that you find the most compelling
like the the original or the what you

4034
01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:25,640
like the the original or the what you
 

4035
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,430
like the the original or the what you
know the higher levels of the Turing

4036
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
know the higher levels of the Turing
 

4037
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:32,500
know the higher levels of the Turing
test kind of yeah yeah I still think the

4038
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:32,510
test kind of yeah yeah I still think the
 

4039
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,630
test kind of yeah yeah I still think the
original idea of the Turing test is a

4040
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:34,640
original idea of the Turing test is a
 

4041
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,960
original idea of the Turing test is a
good test for intelligence I mean I

4042
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:37,970
good test for intelligence I mean I
 

4043
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:39,370
good test for intelligence I mean I
can't think of anything better

4044
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:39,380
can't think of anything better
 

4045
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:42,010
can't think of anything better
you know the Turing tests the way that

4046
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:42,020
you know the Turing tests the way that
 

4047
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,890
you know the Turing tests the way that
it's been carried out so far has been

4048
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:43,900
it's been carried out so far has been
 

4049
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:49,060
it's been carried out so far has been
very impoverished if you will but I

4050
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:49,070
very impoverished if you will but I
 

4051
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:51,700
very impoverished if you will but I
think a real Turing test that really

4052
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:51,710
think a real Turing test that really
 

4053
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:53,440
think a real Turing test that really
goes into depth like the one that I

4054
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:53,450
goes into depth like the one that I
 

4055
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:54,760
goes into depth like the one that I
mentioned I talk about in the book I

4056
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:54,770
mentioned I talk about in the book I
 

4057
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,490
mentioned I talk about in the book I
talk about Ray Kurzweil and Mitchell

4058
01:36:57,490 --> 01:36:57,500
talk about Ray Kurzweil and Mitchell
 

4059
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,230
talk about Ray Kurzweil and Mitchell
Kapoor have this bet right that that in

4060
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:01,240
Kapoor have this bet right that that in
 

4061
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:06,190
Kapoor have this bet right that that in
2029 I think is the date there a machine

4062
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:06,200
2029 I think is the date there a machine
 

4063
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,990
2029 I think is the date there a machine
will pass the Turing test and turn says

4064
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
will pass the Turing test and turn says
 

4065
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,300
will pass the Turing test and turn says
and they have a very specific like how

4066
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:10,310
and they have a very specific like how
 

4067
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:14,050
and they have a very specific like how
many hours many expert judges and all of

01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:14,060
many hours many expert judges and all of
 

4069
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,720
many hours many expert judges and all of
that and you know Kurzweil says yes

4070
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:16,730
that and you know Kurzweil says yes
 

4071
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:19,090
that and you know Kurzweil says yes
Kapoor says no we can't we only have

4072
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:19,100
Kapoor says no we can't we only have
 

4073
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:24,070
Kapoor says no we can't we only have
like nine more years to go to see I you

4074
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,080
like nine more years to go to see I you
 

4075
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,500
like nine more years to go to see I you
know if something a machine could pass

4076
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:26,510
know if something a machine could pass
 

4077
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:29,470
know if something a machine could pass
that I would be willing to call it

4078
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:29,480
that I would be willing to call it
 

4079
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:33,880
that I would be willing to call it
intelligent of course nobody will they

4080
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:33,890
intelligent of course nobody will they
 

4081
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,090
intelligent of course nobody will they
will say that's just a language model if

4082
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:37,100
will say that's just a language model if
 

4083
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,820
will say that's just a language model if
it does so you would be comfortable it's

4084
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:39,830
it does so you would be comfortable it's
 

4085
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:44,470
it does so you would be comfortable it's
a language a long conversation that well

think probably to carry out that long
 

4091
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,020

4093
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,150

let me ask the basic question what is
 

4105
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:14,890
let me ask the basic question what is
complexity so complexity is another one

4106

of what and then most of science to date
 

4161
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:42,279

can you talk about what what is

can you talk about what what is

4165
01:39:45,519 --> 01:39:48,609

well reductionism is when you try and

4166
01:39:48,609 --> 01:39:48,619
well reductionism is when you try and
 

4167
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:52,919
well reductionism is when you try and
take a system and divide it up into its

01:39:52,919 --> 01:39:52,929
take a system and divide it up into its
 

4169
01:39:52,929 --> 01:39:57,399
take a system and divide it up into its
elements whether those be cells or atoms

or subatomic particles whatever your

01:40:01,689 --> 01:40:01,699
or subatomic particles whatever your
 

4173
01:40:01,699 --> 01:40:04,139
or subatomic particles whatever your
field is and then try and understand

4174
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:04,149
field is and then try and understand
 

4175
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:08,589
field is and then try and understand
those elements and then try and build up

4176
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:08,599
those elements and then try and build up
 

4177
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:10,629
those elements and then try and build up
an understanding of the whole system by

4178
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:10,639
an understanding of the whole system by
 

4179
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,790
an understanding of the whole system by
looking at sort of the sum of all the

4180
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:12,800
looking at sort of the sum of all the
 

4181
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,270
looking at sort of the sum of all the
elements so what's your sense whether

4182
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:16,280
elements so what's your sense whether
 

4183
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,979
elements so what's your sense whether
we're talking about intelligence or

4184
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:17,989
we're talking about intelligence or
 

4185
01:40:17,989 --> 01:40:20,020
we're talking about intelligence or
these kinds of interesting complex

4186

these kinds of interesting complex
 

4187
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:22,479
these kinds of interesting complex
systems is it possible to understand

4188
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:22,489
systems is it possible to understand
 

4189
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:25,419
systems is it possible to understand
them in in a reductionist way it's just

4190
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:25,429
them in in a reductionist way it's just
 

4191
01:40:25,429 --> 01:40:28,149
them in in a reductionist way it's just
probably the approach of most of science

4192
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
probably the approach of most of science
 

4193
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,740
probably the approach of most of science
today right

4194
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:29,750
today right
 

4195
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,920
today right
I don't think it's always possible to

4196
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:32,930
I don't think it's always possible to
 

4197
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,120
I don't think it's always possible to
understand the things we want to

4198
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:34,130
understand the things we want to
 

4199
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:36,730
understand the things we want to
understand the most so I don't think

4200
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:36,740
understand the most so I don't think
 

4201
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,430
understand the most so I don't think
it's possible to look at single neurons

4202
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:39,440
it's possible to look at single neurons
 

4203
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:45,430
it's possible to look at single neurons
and understand what we call intelligence

4204
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
and understand what we call intelligence
 

4205
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,220
and understand what we call intelligence
you know just look at sort of summing up

4206
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:48,230
you know just look at sort of summing up
 

4207
01:40:48,230 --> 01:40:51,790
you know just look at sort of summing up
and the sort of the summing up is the

4208
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:51,800
and the sort of the summing up is the
 

4209
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,540
and the sort of the summing up is the
issue here that were you know that one

4210
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:55,550
issue here that were you know that one
 

4211
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,000
issue here that were you know that one
example is that the human genome alright

4212
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,010
example is that the human genome alright
 

4213
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,840
example is that the human genome alright
so there was a lot of work on excitement

4214
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:01,850
so there was a lot of work on excitement
 

4215
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:03,460
so there was a lot of work on excitement
about sequencing the human genome

4216
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:03,470
about sequencing the human genome
 

4217
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:07,180
about sequencing the human genome
because the idea would be that we'd be

4218
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:07,190
because the idea would be that we'd be
 

4219
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:09,570
because the idea would be that we'd be
able to find genes that underlies

4220
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:09,580
able to find genes that underlies
 

4221
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:14,230
able to find genes that underlies
diseases but it turns out that and I was

4222
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:14,240
diseases but it turns out that and I was
 

4223
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,180
diseases but it turns out that and I was
a very reductionist idea you know we

4224
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:16,190
a very reductionist idea you know we
 

4225
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:18,730
a very reductionist idea you know we
figure out what all the the parts are

4226
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:18,740
figure out what all the the parts are
 

4227
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,860
figure out what all the the parts are
and then we would be able to figure out

4228
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:20,870
and then we would be able to figure out
 

4229
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:23,290
and then we would be able to figure out
which parts cause which things but it

4230
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:23,300
which parts cause which things but it
 

4231
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,150
which parts cause which things but it
turns out that the parts don't cause the

4232
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:25,160
turns out that the parts don't cause the
 

4233
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,380
turns out that the parts don't cause the
things that we're interested in it's

4234
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:26,390
things that we're interested in it's
 

4235
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,630
things that we're interested in it's
like the interactions it's the networks

4236
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:28,640
like the interactions it's the networks
 

4237
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:32,470
like the interactions it's the networks
of these parts and so that kind of

4238
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
of these parts and so that kind of
 

4239
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,500
of these parts and so that kind of
reductionist approach didn't yield the

4240
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:35,510
reductionist approach didn't yield the
 

4241
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:38,560
reductionist approach didn't yield the
the explanation that we wanted would he

4242
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:38,570
the explanation that we wanted would he
 

4243
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:42,250
the explanation that we wanted would he
would use the most beautiful complex

4244
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:42,260
would use the most beautiful complex
 

4245
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:44,530
would use the most beautiful complex
system that you've encountered most

4246
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:44,540
system that you've encountered most
 

4247
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,380
system that you've encountered most
beautiful that you've been captivated by

4248
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:47,390
beautiful that you've been captivated by
 

4249
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:52,600
beautiful that you've been captivated by
is it sort of I mean for me that is the

4250
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:52,610
is it sort of I mean for me that is the
 

4251
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:55,750
is it sort of I mean for me that is the
simplest to be cellular automata oh yeah

4252
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:55,760
simplest to be cellular automata oh yeah
 

4253
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,520
simplest to be cellular automata oh yeah
so I was very captivated by cellular

4254
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:57,530
so I was very captivated by cellular
 

4255
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:59,980
so I was very captivated by cellular
automata and worked on cellular automata

4256
01:41:59,980 --> 01:41:59,990
automata and worked on cellular automata
 

4257
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,580
automata and worked on cellular automata
for several years do you find it amazing

4258
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:03,590
for several years do you find it amazing
 

4259
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:06,910
for several years do you find it amazing
or is it surprising that such simple

4260
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:06,920
or is it surprising that such simple
 

4261
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,920
or is it surprising that such simple
systems such simple rules and cellular

4262
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:08,930
systems such simple rules and cellular
 

4263
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:12,420
systems such simple rules and cellular
Domino can create sort of seemingly

01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:15,310
Domino can create sort of seemingly
unlimited complexity yeah that was very

4266
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,320
unlimited complexity yeah that was very
 

4267
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,560
unlimited complexity yeah that was very
surprising to me I didn't make sense of

4268
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:17,570
surprising to me I didn't make sense of
 

4269
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,420
surprising to me I didn't make sense of
it how does that make you feel this is

4270
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:19,430
it how does that make you feel this is
 

4271
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:22,090
it how does that make you feel this is
just ultimately humbling or is there

4272
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:22,100
just ultimately humbling or is there
 

4273
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,520
just ultimately humbling or is there
hope to somehow leverage this into a

01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:24,530
hope to somehow leverage this into a

it's definitely humbling how humbling in

4280
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:34,310
it's definitely humbling how humbling in
 

4281
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:39,360
it's definitely humbling how humbling in
that also kind of awe-inspiring that

exactly so the Santa Fe Institute was

4314
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:30,170
exactly so the Santa Fe Institute was
 

4315
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:35,680
exactly so the Santa Fe Institute was
started in 1984 and it was created by a

started in 1984 and it was created by a
 

4317
01:43:35,690 --> 01:43:38,020
started in 1984 and it was created by a
group of scientists a lot of them from

group of scientists a lot of them from
Los Alamos National Lab which is about a

they were mostly physicists and chemists

4326
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:49,180
they were mostly physicists and chemists
 

4327
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:53,010
they were mostly physicists and chemists
but they were frustrated in their field

but they were frustrated in their field
 

4329
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:56,980
but they were frustrated in their field
because they felt so that their field

01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,050
because they felt so that their field
wasn't approaching kind of big

interdisciplinary questions like the
kinds we've been talking about and they

kinds we've been talking about and they
wanted to have a place where people from

they have this much larger on the order
 

4409
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,349
they have this much larger on the order
of a hundred external faculty or people

4410
01:45:56,349 --> 01:45:56,359
of a hundred external faculty or people
 

4411
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:58,389

various periods of time so what do you

4414
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:00,289
various periods of time so what do you
 

4415
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:01,569
various periods of time so what do you
think this is the future of the Santa Fe

4416
01:46:01,569 --> 01:46:01,579
think this is the future of the Santa Fe
 

4417
01:46:01,579 --> 01:46:03,909
think this is the future of the Santa Fe
Institute like what and if people are

4418
01:46:03,909 --> 01:46:03,919
Institute like what and if people are
 

4419
01:46:03,919 --> 01:46:07,239
Institute like what and if people are
interested like what what's there in

4420

interested like what what's there in
 

4421
01:46:07,249 --> 01:46:09,429
interested like what what's there in
terms of the public interaction or

4422
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:09,439
terms of the public interaction or
 

4423
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:12,429
terms of the public interaction or
students or so on that's that could be a

4424
01:46:12,429 --> 01:46:12,439
students or so on that's that could be a
 

4425
01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:13,869
students or so on that's that could be a
possible interaction on the Santa Fe

4426
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:13,879
possible interaction on the Santa Fe
 

4427
01:46:13,879 --> 01:46:16,299
possible interaction on the Santa Fe
Institute or its ideas yeah so there's a

4428
01:46:16,299 --> 01:46:16,309
Institute or its ideas yeah so there's a
 

4429

through throughout your time working
 

4501
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:56,880
through throughout your time working
with him so one of the things he taught

4502
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:56,890
with him so one of the things he taught
 

4503
01:47:56,890 --> 01:48:00,950
with him so one of the things he taught
me was that when you're looking at a

4504
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
me was that when you're looking at a
 

4505
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:06,720
me was that when you're looking at a
complex problem to to idealize it as

4506
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:06,730
complex problem to to idealize it as
 

4507
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,460
complex problem to to idealize it as
much as possible to try and figure out

4508
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:08,470
much as possible to try and figure out
 

4509
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:10,500
much as possible to try and figure out
what are really what is the essence of

4510
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:10,510
what are really what is the essence of
 

4511
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:13,020
what are really what is the essence of
this problem and this is how like the

4512
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:13,030
this problem and this is how like the
 

4513
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:16,860
this problem and this is how like the
copycat program came into being was by

4514
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:16,870
copycat program came into being was by
 

4515
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:19,170
copycat program came into being was by
taking an analogy making and saying how

4516
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:19,180
taking an analogy making and saying how
 

4517
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,790
taking an analogy making and saying how
can we make this as idealized as

4518
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:20,800
can we make this as idealized as
 

4519
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,280
can we make this as idealized as
possible but still retain really the

4520
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:23,290
possible but still retain really the
 

4521
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:25,460
possible but still retain really the
important things we want to study and

4522
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:25,470
important things we want to study and
 

4523
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:30,440
important things we want to study and
that's really kept you know been a core

4524
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:30,450
that's really kept you know been a core
 

4525
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:34,560
that's really kept you know been a core
theme of my research I think and I

4526
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:34,570
theme of my research I think and I
 

4527
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:36,720
theme of my research I think and I
continue to try and do that and it's

4528
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:36,730
continue to try and do that and it's
 

4529
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:38,960
continue to try and do that and it's
really very much kind of physics

4530
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:38,970
really very much kind of physics
 

4531
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:42,330
really very much kind of physics
inspired Hofstadter was a PhD in physics

4532
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:42,340
inspired Hofstadter was a PhD in physics
 

4533
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:44,700
inspired Hofstadter was a PhD in physics
that was his background it's like first

4534
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:44,710
that was his background it's like first
 

4535
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:46,080
that was his background it's like first
principles kind of thinking like you

4536
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,090
principles kind of thinking like you
 

4537
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:48,480
principles kind of thinking like you
reduced to the the most fundamental

4538
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:48,490
reduced to the the most fundamental
 

4539
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:50,370
reduced to the the most fundamental
aspect of the problem yeah so there you

4540
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:50,380
aspect of the problem yeah so there you
 

4541
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,960
aspect of the problem yeah so there you
can focus on solving that fun than I

4542
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:51,970
can focus on solving that fun than I
 

4543
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:54,030
can focus on solving that fun than I
thought yeah and in AI you know that was

4544
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:54,040
thought yeah and in AI you know that was
 

4545
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,550
thought yeah and in AI you know that was
people used to work in these micro

4546
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
people used to work in these micro
 

4547
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,980
people used to work in these micro
worlds right like the blocks world was

4548
01:48:58,980 --> 01:48:58,990
worlds right like the blocks world was
 

4549
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:03,300
worlds right like the blocks world was
very early important area in AI and then

4550
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:03,310
very early important area in AI and then
 

4551
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:06,180
very early important area in AI and then
that got criticized because they said oh

4552
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,190
that got criticized because they said oh
 

4553
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:07,740
that got criticized because they said oh
you know you can't scale that to the

4554
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:07,750
you know you can't scale that to the
 

4555
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:10,950
you know you can't scale that to the
real world and so people started working

4556
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
real world and so people started working
 

4557
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,810
real world and so people started working
on much like more real world like

4558
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:12,820
on much like more real world like
 

4559
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:16,440
on much like more real world like
problems but now there's been kind of a

4560
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:16,450
problems but now there's been kind of a
 

4561
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:19,410
problems but now there's been kind of a
return even to the blocks world itself

4562
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:19,420
return even to the blocks world itself
 

4563
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,270
return even to the blocks world itself
you know we've seen a lot of people who

4564
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,280
you know we've seen a lot of people who
 

4565
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,540
you know we've seen a lot of people who
are trying to work on

4566
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:22,550
are trying to work on
 

4567
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:24,700
are trying to work on
more of these very idealized problems or

4568
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:24,710
more of these very idealized problems or
 

4569
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:27,910
more of these very idealized problems or
things like natural language and common

4570
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:27,920
things like natural language and common
 

4571
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,310
things like natural language and common
sense so that's an interesting evolution

4572
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,320
sense so that's an interesting evolution
 

4573
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,220
sense so that's an interesting evolution
of those ideas so the perhaps the

4574
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:33,230
of those ideas so the perhaps the
 

4575
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:34,750
of those ideas so the perhaps the
block's world's represents the

4576
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:34,760
block's world's represents the
 

4577
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,940
block's world's represents the
fundamental challenges of the problem of

4578
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:36,950
fundamental challenges of the problem of
 

4579
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:38,800
fundamental challenges of the problem of
intelligence more than people realized

4580
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:38,810
intelligence more than people realized
 

4581
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:42,970
intelligence more than people realized
it might yeah is there sort of when you

4582
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:42,980
it might yeah is there sort of when you
 

4583
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:44,680
it might yeah is there sort of when you
look back at your body of work and your

4584
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:44,690
look back at your body of work and your
 

4585
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,060
look back at your body of work and your
life you've worked in so many different

4586
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:46,070
life you've worked in so many different
 

4587
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:48,220
life you've worked in so many different
fields is there something that you're

4588
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:48,230
fields is there something that you're
 

4589
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:51,310
fields is there something that you're
just really proud of in terms of ideas

4590
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:51,320
just really proud of in terms of ideas
 

4591
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,900
just really proud of in terms of ideas
that you've gotten chance to explore

4592
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:52,910
that you've gotten chance to explore
 

4593
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:56,830
that you've gotten chance to explore
create yourself so I am really proud of

4594
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:56,840
create yourself so I am really proud of
 

4595
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,770
create yourself so I am really proud of
my work on the copycat project I think

4596
01:49:59,770 --> 01:49:59,780
my work on the copycat project I think
 

4597
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,220
my work on the copycat project I think
it's really different from what almost

4598
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:03,230
it's really different from what almost
 

4599
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:05,470
it's really different from what almost
everyone is done in AI I think there's a

4600
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:05,480
everyone is done in AI I think there's a
 

4601
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:09,460
everyone is done in AI I think there's a
lot of ideas there to be explored and I

4602
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:09,470
lot of ideas there to be explored and I
 

4603
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:12,250
lot of ideas there to be explored and I
guess one of the happiest days of my

4604
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:12,260
guess one of the happiest days of my
 

4605
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:16,150
guess one of the happiest days of my
life you know aside from like the births

4606
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:16,160
life you know aside from like the births
 

4607
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:19,990
life you know aside from like the births
of my children was the birth of copycat

4608
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:20,000
of my children was the birth of copycat
 

4609
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,520
of my children was the birth of copycat
when it actually started to be able to

4610
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:21,530
when it actually started to be able to
 

4611
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:25,630
when it actually started to be able to
make really interesting analogies and I

4612
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:25,640
make really interesting analogies and I
 

4613
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,940
make really interesting analogies and I
remember that very clearly you know it

4614
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:27,950
remember that very clearly you know it
 

4615
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:31,630
remember that very clearly you know it
was very exciting time well you kind of

4616
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:31,640
was very exciting time well you kind of
 

4617
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,740
was very exciting time well you kind of
gave life yes artificial so that's right

4618
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:34,750
gave life yes artificial so that's right
 

4619
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,850
gave life yes artificial so that's right
what in terms of what people can

4620
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:36,860
what in terms of what people can
 

4621
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,460
what in terms of what people can
interact I saw there's like a I think

4622
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:39,470
interact I saw there's like a I think
 

4623
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:41,800
interact I saw there's like a I think
it's called meta copy kinetic hat mad

4624
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:41,810
it's called meta copy kinetic hat mad
 

4625
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:44,110
it's called meta copy kinetic hat mad
cat and there's a Python three

4626
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:44,120
cat and there's a Python three
 

4627
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,120
cat and there's a Python three
implementation at if people actually

4628
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:46,130
implementation at if people actually
 

4629
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:47,740
implementation at if people actually
want to play around with it and actually

4630
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:47,750
want to play around with it and actually
 

4631
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,920
want to play around with it and actually
get into it and study it maybe integrate

4632
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:49,930
get into it and study it maybe integrate
 

4633
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:52,540
get into it and study it maybe integrate
into whether it's with deep learning or

4634
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:52,550
into whether it's with deep learning or
 

4635
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,980
into whether it's with deep learning or
any other kind of work they're doing

4636
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:53,990
any other kind of work they're doing
 

4637
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:57,280
any other kind of work they're doing
what what would you suggest they do to

4638
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,290
what what would you suggest they do to
 

4639
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:59,350
what what would you suggest they do to
learn more about it and to take it

4640
01:50:59,350 --> 01:50:59,360
learn more about it and to take it
 

4641
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,970
learn more about it and to take it
forward in different kinds of directions

4642
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:00,980
forward in different kinds of directions
 

4643
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:03,490
forward in different kinds of directions
yeah so that there's a Douglas

4644
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:03,500
yeah so that there's a Douglas
 

4645
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,100
yeah so that there's a Douglas
Hofstadter's book called fluid concepts

4646
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:06,110
Hofstadter's book called fluid concepts
 

4647
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:08,590
Hofstadter's book called fluid concepts
and creative analogies talks in great

4648
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:08,600
and creative analogies talks in great
 

4649
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,810
and creative analogies talks in great
detail about copycat I have a book

4650
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:10,820
detail about copycat I have a book
 

4651
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:13,300
detail about copycat I have a book
called analogy making as perception

4652
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:13,310
called analogy making as perception
 

4653
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:16,030
called analogy making as perception
which is a version of my PhD thesis on

4654
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:16,040
which is a version of my PhD thesis on
 

4655
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,270
which is a version of my PhD thesis on
it

4656
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:16,280
it
 

4657
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,330
it
there's also code that's available that

4658
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:19,340
there's also code that's available that
 

4659
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,820
there's also code that's available that
you can get it to run I have some links

4660
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:21,830
you can get it to run I have some links
 

4661
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:24,280
you can get it to run I have some links
on my web page to where people can get

4662
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:24,290
on my web page to where people can get
 

4663
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:27,640
on my web page to where people can get
the code for it and I think that that

4664
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:27,650
the code for it and I think that that
 

4665
01:51:27,650 --> 01:51:29,080
the code for it and I think that that
would really be the best way I get into

4666
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:29,090
would really be the best way I get into
 

4667
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:32,590
would really be the best way I get into
it yeah play with it well Melanie is a

4668
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:32,600
it yeah play with it well Melanie is a
 

4669
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,570
it yeah play with it well Melanie is a
honor talking to you I really enjoyed it
