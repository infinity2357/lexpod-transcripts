with threats of violence these things

500
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
with threats of violence these things
 

501
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,870
with threats of violence these things
are different for me

502
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
are different for me
 

503
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,630
are different for me
that violence is a fundamental

504
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
that violence is a fundamental
 

505
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,310
that violence is a fundamental
difference

506
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
difference
 

507
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,870
difference
i don't know i i um i've gotten a chance

508
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
i don't know i i um i've gotten a chance
 

509
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,509
i don't know i i um i've gotten a chance
to have dinner with alex jones

510
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
to have dinner with alex jones
 

511
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,070
to have dinner with alex jones
and uh i've talked to him a few times

512
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
and uh i've talked to him a few times
 

513
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,110
and uh i've talked to him a few times
offline

514
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
offline
 

515
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,590
offline
and it does i understand why people are

516
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
and it does i understand why people are
 

517
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,509
and it does i understand why people are
so off-put by him

518
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
so off-put by him
 

519
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,430
so off-put by him
but it does bother me that he's

520
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
but it does bother me that he's
 

521
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,990
but it does bother me that he's
universally removed from every platform

522
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
universally removed from every platform
 

523
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,949
universally removed from every platform
it feels like there's many more

524
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
it feels like there's many more
 

525
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,630
it feels like there's many more
evil people

526
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
evil people
 

527
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,829
evil people
bad people

528
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
bad people
 

529
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,590
bad people
compared to alex jones who still

530
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
compared to alex jones who still
 

531
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,470
compared to alex jones who still
are given a voice on these platforms

532
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
are given a voice on these platforms
 

533
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,350
are given a voice on these platforms
and so i'm uncomfortable

534
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
and so i'm uncomfortable
 

535
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,750
and so i'm uncomfortable
with the universality of the application

536
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
with the universality of the application
 

537
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,350
with the universality of the application
of the censorship

538
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
of the censorship
 

539
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,790
of the censorship
by uh

540
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
by uh
 

541
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,110
by uh
by these platforms but on the flip side

542
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
by these platforms but on the flip side
 

543
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,190
by these platforms but on the flip side
you're right there's not a violence

544
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
you're right there's not a violence
 

545
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,790
you're right there's not a violence
there's not tanks

546
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
there's not tanks
 

547
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,350
there's not tanks
there's not guns behind that censorship

548
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
there's not guns behind that censorship
 

549
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,430
there's not guns behind that censorship
yeah it's a bit of a generalization but

550
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
yeah it's a bit of a generalization but
 

551
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,389
yeah it's a bit of a generalization but
alex jones would be in prison or dead if

552
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
alex jones would be in prison or dead if
 

553
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,269
alex jones would be in prison or dead if
he were in north korea or in cuba or in

554
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
he were in north korea or in cuba or in
 

555
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,670
he were in north korea or in cuba or in
russia or in china the the authorities

556
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
russia or in china the the authorities
 

557
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,150
russia or in china the the authorities
would not tolerate him to do what he did

558
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
would not tolerate him to do what he did
 

559
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,949
would not tolerate him to do what he did
and here he can kind of do what he wants

560
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
and here he can kind of do what he wants
 

561
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,790
and here he can kind of do what he wants
he's encountering some resistance in the

562
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
he's encountering some resistance in the
 

563
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,110
he's encountering some resistance in the
marketplace of ideas

564
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
marketplace of ideas
 

565
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,670
marketplace of ideas
large organizations corporations

566
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
large organizations corporations
 

567
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,230
large organizations corporations
and a lot of public sentiment

568
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
and a lot of public sentiment
 

569
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,190
and a lot of public sentiment
uh in different parts of our country

570
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
uh in different parts of our country
 

571
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,949
uh in different parts of our country
don't like him and they're doing their

572
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
don't like him and they're doing their
 

573
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,110
don't like him and they're doing their
best to drown out his voice but that's

574
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
best to drown out his voice but that's
 

575
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,750
best to drown out his voice but that's
very different from a violent threat of

576
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
very different from a violent threat of
 

577
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,430
very different from a violent threat of
censorship from the state and that's

578
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
censorship from the state and that's
 

579
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,190
censorship from the state and that's
what we study that's what i study are

580
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
what we study that's what i study are
 

581
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,350
what we study that's what i study are
these you know what is the state doing

582
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
these you know what is the state doing
 

583
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,670
these you know what is the state doing
that's kind of paramount for for me yeah

584
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
that's kind of paramount for for me yeah
 

585
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,030
that's kind of paramount for for me yeah
and that's true because in the

586
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
and that's true because in the
 

587
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,550
and that's true because in the
marketplace of ideas there could be a

588
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
marketplace of ideas there could be a
 

589
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,389
marketplace of ideas there could be a
company that springs up that gives alex

590
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
company that springs up that gives alex
 

591
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,630
company that springs up that gives alex
jones a platform and

592
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
jones a platform and
 

593
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,389
jones a platform and
the united states is not going to

594
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
the united states is not going to
 

595
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,190
the united states is not going to
prevent those companies from functioning

596
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
prevent those companies from functioning
 

597
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,870
prevent those companies from functioning
of course there's uh from a

598
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
of course there's uh from a
 

599
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,190
of course there's uh from a
technological tech from a technology

600
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
technological tech from a technology
 

601
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,310
technological tech from a technology
perspective

602
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
perspective
 

603
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,350
perspective
there is uh aws removing parlor from the

604
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
there is uh aws removing parlor from the
 

605
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,670
there is uh aws removing parlor from the
platform and gets a little weird

606
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
platform and gets a little weird
 

607
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,829
platform and gets a little weird
you know as you get closer and closer to

608
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
you know as you get closer and closer to
 

609
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,509
you know as you get closer and closer to
the computer infrastructure because then

610
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
the computer infrastructure because then
 

611
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,110
the computer infrastructure because then
you get closer and closer to the state

612
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
you get closer and closer to the state
 

613
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,069
you get closer and closer to the state
actually

614
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
actually
 

615
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,949
actually
the

616
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
the
 

617
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,269
the
the more you get to the infrastructure

618
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
the more you get to the infrastructure
 

619
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,350
the more you get to the infrastructure
that's usually managed by the state the

620
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
that's usually managed by the state the
 

621
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,350
that's usually managed by the state the
closer it gets to the control of the

622
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
closer it gets to the control of the
 

623
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,230
closer it gets to the control of the
state

624
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
state
 

625
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,710
state
i would argue aws is pretty damn close

626
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
i would argue aws is pretty damn close
 

627
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,470
i would argue aws is pretty damn close
to infrastructure that's kind of

628
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
to infrastructure that's kind of
 

629
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,910
to infrastructure that's kind of
controlled by the state if you

630
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
controlled by the state if you
 

631
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,310
controlled by the state if you
especially look at other nations

632
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
especially look at other nations
 

633
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,949
especially look at other nations
uh china russia

634
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
uh china russia
 

635
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,750
uh china russia
there's uh i don't know who runs the

636
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
there's uh i don't know who runs the
 

637
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,269
there's uh i don't know who runs the
compute infrastructure for russia and

638
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
compute infrastructure for russia and
 

639
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,509
compute infrastructure for russia and
china but i bet the state has complete

640
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
china but i bet the state has complete
 

641
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,110
china but i bet the state has complete
oversight over that

642
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
oversight over that
 

643
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,470
oversight over that
and so

644
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
and so
 

645
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,470
and so
that level of compute infrastructure

646
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
that level of compute infrastructure
 

647
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
that level of compute infrastructure
having control

648
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
having control
 

649
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,630
having control
about which social networks can and

650
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
about which social networks can and
 

651
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,030
about which social networks can and
cannot operate is very uncomfortable to

652
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
cannot operate is very uncomfortable to
 

653
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,030
cannot operate is very uncomfortable to
me but you're right i think

654
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
me but you're right i think
 

655
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,269
me but you're right i think
it's good to focus on the obvious

656
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
it's good to focus on the obvious
 

657
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,870
it's good to focus on the obvious
violations of these principles as

658
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
violations of these principles as
 

659
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,430
violations of these principles as
opposed to the the gray areas of course

660
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
opposed to the the gray areas of course
 

661
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,150
opposed to the the gray areas of course
the gray areas are fascinating

662
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
the gray areas are fascinating
 

663
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,829
the gray areas are fascinating

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
look i think that at the end of the day
 

827
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,629
look i think that at the end of the day
like

828
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
like
 

829
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,910
like
free trade

830
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
free trade
 

831
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,949
free trade
is actually really good um and you can

832
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
is actually really good um and you can
 

833
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,710
is actually really good um and you can
just look at france and germany as an

834
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
just look at france and germany as an
 

835
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,629
just look at france and germany as an
example of of how like a capitalist

836
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
example of of how like a capitalist
 

837
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,710
example of of how like a capitalist
structure would develop if you have two

838
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
structure would develop if you have two
 

839
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,629
structure would develop if you have two
capitalist actors they're very unlikely

840
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
capitalist actors they're very unlikely
 

841
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,670
capitalist actors they're very unlikely
to fight each other there's very

842
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
to fight each other there's very
 

843
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,509
to fight each other there's very
unlikely to be violence right these are

844
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
unlikely to be violence right these are
 

845
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,189
unlikely to be violence right these are
two countries which

846
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
two countries which
 

847
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,750
two countries which
basically murdered some large percentage

848
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
basically murdered some large percentage
 

849
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,430
basically murdered some large percentage
of each other's male population three

850
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
of each other's male population three
 

851
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,710
of each other's male population three
times in a hundred years in three

852
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
times in a hundred years in three
 

853
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,269
times in a hundred years in three
different wars right and now today war

854
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
different wars right and now today war
 

855
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,389
different wars right and now today war
is like unthinkable

856
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
is like unthinkable
 

857
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,990
is like unthinkable
and a lot of that is because of

858
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
and a lot of that is because of
 

859
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,629
and a lot of that is because of
increased collaboration increased trade

860
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
increased collaboration increased trade
 

861
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,269
increased collaboration increased trade
so when you have two capitalist actors

862
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
so when you have two capitalist actors
 

863
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,550
so when you have two capitalist actors
they act

864
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
they act
 

865
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,710
they act
in a very productive way with each other

866
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
in a very productive way with each other
 

867
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,310
in a very productive way with each other
um but as soon as you introduce an

868
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
um but as soon as you introduce an
 

869
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,790
um but as soon as you introduce an
authoritarian actor you know all bets

870
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
authoritarian actor you know all bets
 

871
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,110
authoritarian actor you know all bets
are off so i think what you have is a

872
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
are off so i think what you have is a
 

873
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,509
are off so i think what you have is a
conflict between capitalist actors and

874
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
conflict between capitalist actors and
 

875
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,350
conflict between capitalist actors and
authoritarian actors

876
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
authoritarian actors
 

877
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,750
authoritarian actors
and at the end of the day people

878
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
and at the end of the day people
 

879
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,790
and at the end of the day people
need to

880
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
need to

is
 

1323
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,590
is
what kind of systems protect

1324
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:27,600
what kind of systems protect
 

1325
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,549
what kind of systems protect
us from our own human nature

and they started to implement it
 

1355
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,149
and they started to implement it
although as most know we didn't have

it really like for me
 

1373
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,549
it really like for me
the ideas behind this um i think

1374
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
the ideas behind this um i think
 

1375
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,630
the ideas behind this um i think
unlocked a lot of the industrial

1376
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
unlocked a lot of the industrial
 

1377
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,390
unlocked a lot of the industrial
revolution these small personal freedoms

1378
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
revolution these small personal freedoms
 

1379
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,750
revolution these small personal freedoms
that were allowed in some countries but

1380
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
that were allowed in some countries but
 

1381
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,590
that were allowed in some countries but
not others and they unlocked a lot of

1382
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
not others and they unlocked a lot of
 

1383
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,029
not others and they unlocked a lot of
the scientific innovation over the last

1384
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
the scientific innovation over the last
 

1385
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,390
the scientific innovation over the last
few hundred years

1386
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
few hundred years
 

1387
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,230
few hundred years
um and to me there's like a really

1388
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
um and to me there's like a really
 

1389
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,830
um and to me there's like a really
straight line between like scientific

1390
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
straight line between like scientific
 

1391
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,149
straight line between like scientific
inquiry free speech freedoms and then

1392
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
inquiry free speech freedoms and then
 

1393
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,269
inquiry free speech freedoms and then
more prosperity and more effectiveness

1394
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
more prosperity and more effectiveness
 

1395
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,470
more prosperity and more effectiveness
as a civilization so i i think that

1396
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
as a civilization so i i think that
 

1397
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,950
as a civilization so i i think that
democracy you know ruled by the people

1398
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
democracy you know ruled by the people
 

1399
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,590
democracy you know ruled by the people
is definitely an upgrade from autocracy

1400
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
is definitely an upgrade from autocracy
 

1401
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,590
is definitely an upgrade from autocracy
or oligarchy you know which would be

1402
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
or oligarchy you know which would be
 

1403
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,149
or oligarchy you know which would be
rule by by one or a rule by a small

rule by by one or a rule by a small
group

1406
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
group
 

1407
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,950
group
and i think that the the democratic

1408
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
and i think that the the democratic
 

1409
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,310
and i think that the the democratic
revolution

1410
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
revolution
 

1411
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,909

and it's it's you know you could do half
 

1417
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,630
and it's it's you know you could do half
class full half class empty the half

1418
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
class full half class empty the half
 

1419
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,230
class full half class empty the half
class full is that almost half the world

1420
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
class full is that almost half the world
 

1421
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,909
class full is that almost half the world
lives under democracy like that that's

1422
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
lives under democracy like that that's
 

1423
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,630
lives under democracy like that that's
an incredible achievement

but just under half
 

1427
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,470
but just under half
yeah just under half so

1428
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
yeah just under half so
 

1429
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,549

the acceleration kind of
 

1457
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,149
the acceleration kind of
came to a standstill a little bit um

1458

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,669
commit genocide a lot faster and it's
really scary so

1786
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
really scary so
 

1787
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,909
really scary so
i do agree and i've seen personally how

1788
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
i do agree and i've seen personally how
 

1789
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,310
i do agree and i've seen personally how
powerful technology can be as a force

1790
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
powerful technology can be as a force
 

1791
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,029
powerful technology can be as a force
for freedom um but i'm i'm very very

1792
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
for freedom um but i'm i'm very very
 

1793
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,950
for freedom um but i'm i'm very very
worried about big data analysis in the

1794
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
worried about big data analysis in the
 

1795
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,630
worried about big data analysis in the
hands of governments see that's funny

1796
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
hands of governments see that's funny
 

1797
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,029
hands of governments see that's funny
because i i tend to see governments as

1798
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
because i i tend to see governments as
 

1799
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,190
because i i tend to see governments as
ultimately incompetent in the space of

1800
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
ultimately incompetent in the space of
 

1801
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,950
ultimately incompetent in the space of
technology to where there will always be

1802
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
technology to where there will always be
 

1803
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,590
technology to where there will always be
lagging behind so you look at what the

1804
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
lagging behind so you look at what the
 

1805
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,909
lagging behind so you look at what the
chinese surveillance systems are doing

1806
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
chinese surveillance systems are doing
 

1807
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,149
chinese surveillance systems are doing
i i believe when once you start getting

1808
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
i i believe when once you start getting
 

1809
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:02,830
i i believe when once you start getting
bad

1810
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840
bad
 

1811
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,750
bad
enough that

1812
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
enough that
 

1813
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,549
enough that
like

1814
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
like
 

1815
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,230
like
technologies would be created to resist

1816
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
technologies would be created to resist
 

1817
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,029
technologies would be created to resist
that so to mess with it from from the

1818
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
that so to mess with it from from the
 

1819
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,269
that so to mess with it from from the
hacker community but also from the

1820
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
hacker community but also from the
 

1821
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,430
hacker community but also from the
individual community so surveillance is

1822
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
individual community so surveillance is
 

1823
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,630
individual community so surveillance is
actually very difficult from a

1824
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
actually very difficult from a
 

1825
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,990
actually very difficult from a
centralized perspective to detect uh you

1826
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
centralized perspective to detect uh you
 

1827
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,590
centralized perspective to detect uh you
know to collect data about you to detect

1828
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
know to collect data about you to detect
 

1829
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,110
know to collect data about you to detect
everything you are because you can spoof

1830
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
everything you are because you can spoof
 

1831
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,190
everything you are because you can spoof
a lot of that information so i believe

1832
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
a lot of that information so i believe
 

1833
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,870
a lot of that information so i believe
you can put power in the hands of the

1834
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
you can put power in the hands of the
 

1835
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,029
you can put power in the hands of the
citizens to sort of

1836
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
citizens to sort of
 

1837
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,590
citizens to sort of
feed the government fake data to confuse

1838
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
feed the government fake data to confuse
 

1839
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,149
feed the government fake data to confuse
it at a mass scale to where

1840
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
it at a mass scale to where
 

1841
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,830
it at a mass scale to where
it will make their surveillance less

1842
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
it will make their surveillance less
 

1843
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,230
it will make their surveillance less
effective but that okay that could be

1844
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
effective but that okay that could be
 

1845
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,389
effective but that okay that could be
very sort of hopeful yeah i mean the

1846
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
very sort of hopeful yeah i mean the
 

1847
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,310
very sort of hopeful yeah i mean the
practical application in xinjiang which

1848
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
practical application in xinjiang which
 

1849
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,470
practical application in xinjiang which
is a territory the size of alaska

1850
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
is a territory the size of alaska
 

1851
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,909
is a territory the size of alaska
where a large percentage of the

1852
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
where a large percentage of the
 

1853
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,269
where a large percentage of the
population has been put into prison

1854
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
population has been put into prison

camps
 

1857
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,990
camps
um the current issue of the new yorker

1858
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
um the current issue of the new yorker
 

1859
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,389
um the current issue of the new yorker
has an absolutely harrowing uh essay

1860
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
has an absolutely harrowing uh essay
 

1861
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,230
has an absolutely harrowing uh essay
that that tells the story of one such

who in i believe 20 2017 got sucked into
 

1867
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,710

one of these camps and it took her a

1868
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
one of these camps and it took her a
 

1869
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,630
one of these camps and it took her a
year or more to get out um and and she's

year or more to get out um and and she's
talking about how

1872
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
talking about how
 

1873
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,549
talking about how
in each home in xinjiang each home has a

1874
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
in each home in xinjiang each home has a
 

1875
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,389
in each home in xinjiang each home has a
qr code on it that the police can scan

1876
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
qr code on it that the police can scan
 

1877
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,830
qr code on it that the police can scan
and get like a quick instant download of

1878
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
and get like a quick instant download of
 

1879
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,190
and get like a quick instant download of
who lives there

1880
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
who lives there
 

1881
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,669
who lives there
each car has you know like a scannable

1882
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
each car has you know like a scannable
 

1883
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,190
each car has you know like a scannable
code

1884
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
code
 

1885
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,590
code
every every single person has their dna

1886
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600
every every single person has their dna
 

1887
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,750
every every single person has their dna
taken and the dna is being sifted

1888
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
taken and the dna is being sifted
 

1889
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
taken and the dna is being sifted
through and analyzed by algorithms so

1890
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
through and analyzed by algorithms so
 

1891
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,430
through and analyzed by algorithms so
this is like the chinese government's

1892
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
this is like the chinese government's
 

1893
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,070
this is like the chinese government's
laboratory for how can we use technology

1894
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
laboratory for how can we use technology
 

1895
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,029
laboratory for how can we use technology
to

1896
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
to
 

1897
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,110
to
oppress a sort of like digital leninism

1898
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
oppress a sort of like digital leninism
 

1899
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,310
oppress a sort of like digital leninism
and that to me is one of the biggest uh

1900
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
and that to me is one of the biggest uh
 

1901
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,909
and that to me is one of the biggest uh
risks in our world today and it's not

1902
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
risks in our world today and it's not
 

1903
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,909
risks in our world today and it's not
talked about enough that's interesting

1904
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
talked about enough that's interesting
 

1905
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,149
talked about enough that's interesting
so technologies basically

1906
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
so technologies basically
 

1907
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,310
so technologies basically
enables the automation of oppression

1908
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
enables the automation of oppression
 

1909
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,310
enables the automation of oppression
absolutely so like

1910
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
absolutely so like
 

1911
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,870
absolutely so like
but to define technology

1912
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
but to define technology
 

1913
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,430
but to define technology
big data analysis and you know maybe

1914
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
big data analysis and you know maybe
 

1915
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,389
big data analysis and you know maybe
specific ai etc does but encryption

1916
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:52,399
specific ai etc does but encryption
 

1917
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,990
specific ai etc does but encryption
allows us to fight back it's very

1918
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
allows us to fight back it's very
 

1919
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,110
allows us to fight back it's very
important people understand we have

1920
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
important people understand we have
 

1921
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,029
important people understand we have
tools to fight back

1922
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
tools to fight back
 

1923
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,870
tools to fight back
you know big brother

1924
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
you know big brother
 

1925
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,230
you know big brother
can only grow

1926
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
can only grow
 

1927
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,549
can only grow
if it can feed on your data if it can't

1928
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
if it can feed on your data if it can't
 

1929
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,029
if it can feed on your data if it can't
get your data it can't grow so you have

1930
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039
get your data it can't grow so you have
 

1931
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,070
get your data it can't grow so you have
to willingly give up stuff to the cloud

1932
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
to willingly give up stuff to the cloud
 

1933
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,549
to willingly give up stuff to the cloud
um for this monster to grow we can we

1934
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
um for this monster to grow we can we
 

1935
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,630
um for this monster to grow we can we
can we can like make the monster hungry

1936
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
can we can like make the monster hungry
 

1937
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,950
can we can like make the monster hungry
and shrink it if we give it less data

1938
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
and shrink it if we give it less data
 

1939
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,070
and shrink it if we give it less data
and i think that's where i would agree

1940
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
and i think that's where i would agree
 

1941
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,590
and i think that's where i would agree
with you in terms of like wanting to

1942
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,600
with you in terms of like wanting to
 

1943
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,909
with you in terms of like wanting to
empower people to be able to do stuff on

back door right there's this national

2010
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
back door right there's this national
 

2011
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,389
back door right there's this national
security law in china which states that

back to beijing right so they're
 

2019
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,990
back to beijing right so they're
building this like huge global

2020

building this like huge global
surveillance state and again not talked

2022
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:36,399
surveillance state and again not talked
 

2023
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,310
surveillance state and again not talked
about enough you should go google and

2024
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
about enough you should go google and
 

2025
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,310
about enough you should go google and
research the belt and road i think it's

2026
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
research the belt and road i think it's
 

2027
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,750
research the belt and road i think it's
very important that we confront this

2028
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760

 

2029
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,270

yeah i'm really glad you're talking

2030
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,280
yeah i'm really glad you're talking
 

2031
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,109
yeah i'm really glad you're talking
about it because it's probably important

2032
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:47,119
about it because it's probably important
 

2033
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,629
about it because it's probably important
to understand i'm also hopeful that

2034
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
to understand i'm also hopeful that
 

2035
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,829
to understand i'm also hopeful that
as people get educated about

2036
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
as people get educated about
 

2037
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,149
as people get educated about
how much their data when collected

2038
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
how much their data when collected
 

2039
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,870
how much their data when collected
unencrypted but in general

2040
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
unencrypted but in general
 

2041
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,870
unencrypted but in general
can be used to harm them

2042
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
can be used to harm them
 

2043
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,870
can be used to harm them
i mean it's almost like an education i

2044
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
i mean it's almost like an education i
 

2045
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,670
i mean it's almost like an education i
feel like

2046
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680

 

2047
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,589

if you know

2048
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
if you know
 

2049
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,030
if you know
it's a double-edged sword because i feel

2050
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
it's a double-edged sword because i feel
 

2051
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,030
it's a double-edged sword because i feel
like people become fearful too easily

2052
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
like people become fearful too easily
 

2053
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,470
like people become fearful too easily
and that actually has a very negative

2054
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
and that actually has a very negative
 

2055
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,470
and that actually has a very negative
effect on the quality of life

2056
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
effect on the quality of life
 

2057
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,470
effect on the quality of life
in some sense you want to have tools

2058
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
in some sense you want to have tools
 

2059
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,150
in some sense you want to have tools
that allow you to live freely as opposed

2061
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,630
that allow you to live freely as opposed
to living fear if you live in fear

2062
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
to living fear if you live in fear
 

2063
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,790
to living fear if you live in fear
it's not a good way to live so it's a

2064

it's not a good way to live so it's a
 

2065
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,950
it's not a good way to live so it's a
it's a balance um it's a free society

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
it's a balance um it's a free society
 

2067
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,950

sort of

2262
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
sort of
 

2263
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,910
sort of

centralized institutions so much power

2266
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
centralized institutions so much power
 

2267
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,670

like why why do citizens have to use

2268
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
like why why do citizens have to use
 

2269
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,109

signal

2270
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
signal
 

2271
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,950

why because that's an effort you have to

2272
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
why because that's an effort you have to
 

2273
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,109
why because that's an effort you have to
be because you have to like understand

2274
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
be because you have to like understand
 

2275
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,630
be because you have to like understand
exactly why so that's a nice little

2276
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
exactly why so that's a nice little
 

2277
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,990
exactly why so that's a nice little
solution for a particular set of

2278
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
solution for a particular set of
 

2279
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,349
solution for a particular set of
problems but like there's a million

2280
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:07,359
problems but like there's a million
 

2281
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,190
problems but like there's a million
other ways that data i'm sure

2282
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,200
other ways that data i'm sure
 

2283
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,750
other ways that data i'm sure
is being collected constantly if we

2284
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760
is being collected constantly if we
 

2285
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,109
is being collected constantly if we
don't create

2286
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:13,119
don't create
 

2287
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,750
don't create
a system that

2288
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
a system that
 

2289
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,589
a system that
prevents the establishments of these

2290
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
prevents the establishments of these
 

2291
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,670
prevents the establishments of these
centralized powers then we'll always

2292
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
centralized powers then we'll always
 

2293
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,270
centralized powers then we'll always
have this problem yeah i think we can

2294
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,280
have this problem yeah i think we can
 

2295
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,790
have this problem yeah i think we can
keep it simple for the purposes of this

2296
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
keep it simple for the purposes of this
 

2297
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,550
keep it simple for the purposes of this
conversation you have politics

2298
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
conversation you have politics
 

2299
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,150
conversation you have politics
information and money those are the

2300
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
information and money those are the
 

2301
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,750
information and money those are the
three things i would encourage us to

2302
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
three things i would encourage us to
 

2303
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,550
three things i would encourage us to
focus on in politics yes someone

2304
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
focus on in politics yes someone
 

2305
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,710
focus on in politics yes someone
invented democracy i mean whether it was

2306
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
invented democracy i mean whether it was
 

2307
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,349
invented democracy i mean whether it was
the greeks um the west africans or many

2308
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
the greeks um the west africans or many
 

2309
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,190
the greeks um the west africans or many
others around the world around the same

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
others around the world around the same
 

2311
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,630
others around the world around the same
time invented this idea that we should

2312
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,640
time invented this idea that we should
 

2313
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,109
time invented this idea that we should
be ruled by uh rules and not by rulers

2314
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
be ruled by uh rules and not by rulers
 

2315
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,630
be ruled by uh rules and not by rulers
right um

2316
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:42,640
right um
 

2317
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,750
right um
and that has

2318
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
and that has
 

2319
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,750
and that has
evolved dramatically right and now you

2320
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
evolved dramatically right and now you
 

2321
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,790
evolved dramatically right and now you
and then you have information

2322
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
and then you have information
 

2323
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,150
and then you have information
information also used to be highly

2324
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,160
information also used to be highly
 

2325
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,710
information also used to be highly
centralized right you know think about

2326
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
centralized right you know think about
 

2327
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,790
centralized right you know think about
how rich you had to be to gain access to

2328

a library before the printing press or
 

2331
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,710
a library before the printing press or
you know how much money you had to have

2332
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
you know how much money you had to have
 

2333
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,870
you know how much money you had to have
or how close to the king or the you know

feudal lord you had to be to be able to
 

2337
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,430
feudal lord you had to be to be able to
have that ability but now

2338
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
have that ability but now
 

2339
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,790
have that ability but now
you know

2340
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:04,800
you know
 

2341
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,230
you know
the majority of the world billions of

2342
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240
the majority of the world billions of
 

2343
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,910
the majority of the world billions of
people have access to all information in

2344
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
people have access to all information in
 

2345
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,109
people have access to all information in
their pocket and they can set up an

2346
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
their pocket and they can set up an
 

2347
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,470
their pocket and they can set up an
account on social media and get their

2348
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
account on social media and get their
 

2349
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,430
account on social media and get their
word out so not only politics but

2350
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
word out so not only politics but
 

2351
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,270
word out so not only politics but
information has been dramatically

2352
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
information has been dramatically

and i would say that encrypted messaging

2356
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
and i would say that encrypted messaging
 

2357
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,150
and i would say that encrypted messaging
is kind of a corollary to that second

2358
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
is kind of a corollary to that second
 

2359
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,470
is kind of a corollary to that second
innovation and as much as now people are

i've talked to senior ethereum engineers

3434
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,040
i've talked to senior ethereum engineers
 

3435
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,230
i've talked to senior ethereum engineers
over the last couple weeks trying to

3436
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
over the last couple weeks trying to
 

3437
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,349
over the last couple weeks trying to
figure out

3438
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
figure out
 

3439
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,750
figure out
what is the monetary policy of ethereum

3440
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
what is the monetary policy of ethereum
 

3441
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,069
what is the monetary policy of ethereum
no one can tell me no one knows how much

3442
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
no one can tell me no one knows how much
 

3443

eath is going to be minted in 2022 and

3444
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
eath is going to be minted in 2022 and
 

3445
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,109
eath is going to be minted in 2022 and
2023 after they shift to proof of stake

3446
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
2023 after they shift to proof of stake
 

3447
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,270
2023 after they shift to proof of stake
it i've seen estimates that range from

3448
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
it i've seen estimates that range from
 

3449
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,589
it i've seen estimates that range from
100 000 to 2 million so at the end of

3450
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
100 000 to 2 million so at the end of
 

3451
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,789
100 000 to 2 million so at the end of
the day you're going to be trusting a

3452
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
the day you're going to be trusting a
 

3453
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:35,990
the day you're going to be trusting a
small group of people to make those

3454
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
small group of people to make those
 

3455
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,150
small group of people to make those
decisions that is what we are escaping

3456
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
decisions that is what we are escaping
 

3457
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,069
decisions that is what we are escaping
with bitcoin so all these other

3458
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
with bitcoin so all these other
 

3459
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,910
with bitcoin so all these other
cryptocurrencies they might have their

3460
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:41,920
cryptocurrencies they might have their
 

3461
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,390
cryptocurrencies they might have their
use cases virtually all of them are not

3462
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
use cases virtually all of them are not
 

3463
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,829
use cases virtually all of them are not
it's very important for people to know

3464
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839
it's very important for people to know
 

3465
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,589
it's very important for people to know
that if you take like the 4 500

3466
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
that if you take like the 4 500
 

3467
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,990
that if you take like the 4 500
cryptocurrencies on coin market cap

3468
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,000
cryptocurrencies on coin market cap
 

3469
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,630
cryptocurrencies on coin market cap
almost all of them are scams straight up

3470
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:52,640
almost all of them are scams straight up
 

3471
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,309
almost all of them are scams straight up
even the ones that have like noble

3472
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
even the ones that have like noble
 

3473
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,589
even the ones that have like noble
intentions

3474
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
intentions
 

3475
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,270
intentions
i just don't think are gonna add that

3476
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,280
i just don't think are gonna add that
 

3477
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,309
i just don't think are gonna add that
much value um ultimately i think bitcoin

3478
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
much value um ultimately i think bitcoin
 

3479
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,950
much value um ultimately i think bitcoin
to me is the innovation and and you know

3480
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
to me is the innovation and and you know
 

3481
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,109
to me is the innovation and and you know
that's because it has a monetary policy

3482
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
that's because it has a monetary policy
 

3483
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,430
that's because it has a monetary policy
and an issuance schedule that cannot be

3484
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
and an issuance schedule that cannot be
 

3485
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,950
and an issuance schedule that cannot be
changed and that's what gets me so

3486
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
changed and that's what gets me so
 

3487
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,309
changed and that's what gets me so
excited about i mean that's why it's

3488
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
excited about i mean that's why it's
 

3489
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,150
excited about i mean that's why it's
such an important tool for human rights

3490
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
such an important tool for human rights
 

3491
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,670
such an important tool for human rights
yeah it's it's interesting because when

3492
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
yeah it's it's interesting because when
 

3493
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,829
yeah it's it's interesting because when
you grow from two percent when you grow

3494
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
you grow from two percent when you grow
 

3495
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,549
you grow from two percent when you grow
in

3496
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
in
 

3497
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,549
in
the number of people using it at the

3498
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
the number of people using it at the
 

3499
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,190
the number of people using it at the
scale they're using it

3500
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
scale they're using it
 

3501
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,549
scale they're using it
it it's going to need to be resistant to

3502
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
it it's going to need to be resistant to
 

3503
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,549
it it's going to need to be resistant to
governments and institutions messing

3504
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
governments and institutions messing
 

3505
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:27,430
governments and institutions messing
with it

3506
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
with it
 

3507
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,069
with it
so it's interesting to see what kind of

3508
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
so it's interesting to see what kind of
 

3509
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,309
so it's interesting to see what kind of
um what kind of cryptocurrency would be

3510
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
um what kind of cryptocurrency would be
 

3511
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,710
um what kind of cryptocurrency would be
resistant to that obviously dogecoin is

3512
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
resistant to that obviously dogecoin is
 

3513
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,069
resistant to that obviously dogecoin is
going to win let's be honest

3514
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:38,079
going to win let's be honest
 

3515
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,190
going to win let's be honest
well i mean looking forward to the

3516
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
well i mean looking forward to the
 

3517
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,829
well i mean looking forward to the
number two cryptocurrency in the world

3518
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
number two cryptocurrency in the world
 

3519
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,990
number two cryptocurrency in the world
probably by like how useful it is to

3520
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,000
probably by like how useful it is to
 

3521
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,390
probably by like how useful it is to
people is tether which is totally

3522
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
people is tether which is totally
 

3523
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,430
people is tether which is totally
centralized has blacklists so i'm not

3524
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
centralized has blacklists so i'm not
 

3525
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,270
centralized has blacklists so i'm not
saying there won't be like new digital

3526
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
saying there won't be like new digital
 

3527
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,670
saying there won't be like new digital
assets that are lumped into this

3528
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:53,680
assets that are lumped into this
 

3529
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,230
assets that are lumped into this
category that have usage but they're not

3530
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
category that have usage but they're not
 

3531
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,069
category that have usage but they're not
they're not it's not the same innovation

3532
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
they're not it's not the same innovation
 

3533
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,630
they're not it's not the same innovation
as bitcoin it's just sort of building on

3534
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,640

difficult
 

3633
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,349
difficult
and i think to me the the the best way

3634
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
and i think to me the the the best way
 

3635
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,950
and i think to me the the the best way
to think about it is that bitcoin's like

moral reasons they're going to do it
 

4177
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,550
moral reasons they're going to do it
because it's going to save them money

4178
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
because it's going to save them money
 

4179
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,390
because it's going to save them money
and improve their bottom line can you

4180
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
and improve their bottom line can you
 

4181
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,750
and improve their bottom line can you
speak to that kind of collaborative so

4182
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:29,760
speak to that kind of collaborative so
 

4183
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,830
speak to that kind of collaborative so
you can have multiple parties in a

4184
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:31,840
you can have multiple parties in a
 

4185
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,350
you can have multiple parties in a
single transaction kind of thing yeah

4186
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
single transaction kind of thing yeah
 

4187
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,470
single transaction kind of thing yeah
like

4188
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
like
 

4189
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,390
like
you could do that today absolutely it's

4190
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:36,400
you could do that today absolutely it's
 

4191
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,070
you could do that today absolutely it's
called the coin join for example but

4192
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
called the coin join for example but
 

4193
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,270
called the coin join for example but
right now it's more expensive to

4194
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
right now it's more expensive to
 

4195
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,550
right now it's more expensive to
coinjoin a bitcoin you have to pay a

4196
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:40,560
coinjoin a bitcoin you have to pay a
 

4197
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,709
coinjoin a bitcoin you have to pay a
premium for your privacy this would flip

4198
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:42,719
premium for your privacy this would flip
 

4199
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,390
premium for your privacy this would flip
that on its head and would basically say

4200
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
that on its head and would basically say
 

4201
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,630
that on its head and would basically say
if you have one transaction hey pile

4202
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
if you have one transaction hey pile
 

4203
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,149
if you have one transaction hey pile
them all in have as many parties as you

4204
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
them all in have as many parties as you
 

4205
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,430
them all in have as many parties as you
want the more parties you get in the

4206
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
want the more parties you get in the
 

4207
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,590
want the more parties you get in the
cheaper it's going to be per party okay

4208
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
cheaper it's going to be per party okay
 

4209
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,270
cheaper it's going to be per party okay
and and that's not possible in bitcoin

4210
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
and and that's not possible in bitcoin
 

4211
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,110
and and that's not possible in bitcoin
today but it might be in the future but

4212
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
today but it might be in the future but
 

4213
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,110
today but it might be in the future but
again the beauty the beauty in bitcoin

4214
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,120
again the beauty the beauty in bitcoin
 

4215
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,470
again the beauty the beauty in bitcoin
are these like

4216
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
are these like
 

4217
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,070
are these like
these ways that it just aligns human

4218
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,080
these ways that it just aligns human
 

4219
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,750
these ways that it just aligns human
incentives and it aligns our like most

the bitcoin blockchain is ultimately a
settlement layer it's kind of like

4288
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:07,440
settlement layer it's kind of like
 

4289
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,030
settlement layer it's kind of like
something like

4290
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
something like
 

4291
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,790
something like
fedwire in the united states it's a way

4292
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
fedwire in the united states it's a way
 

4293
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,070
fedwire in the united states it's a way
for like

4294

institutions to settle with each other
 

4297
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,950

that's what i think it's going to be

4298
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
that's what i think it's going to be
 

4299
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,350
that's what i think it's going to be
like in 20 30 years from now the average

4300
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
like in 20 30 years from now the average
 

4301
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,790
like in 20 30 years from now the average

4303
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,709
person is never going to touch the
bitcoin blockchain probably they're

4304
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
bitcoin blockchain probably they're
 

4305
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,950
bitcoin blockchain probably they're
going to use things like lightning or

4306
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:22,960
going to use things like lightning or
 

4307
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,709
going to use things like lightning or
unfortunately they may use bitcoin banks

4308
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
unfortunately they may use bitcoin banks
 

4309
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,630
unfortunately they may use bitcoin banks
but they'll either use custodians or

4310
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:26,640
but they'll either use custodians or
 

4311
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,790
but they'll either use custodians or
they'll use second layer non-custodial

4312
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
they'll use second layer non-custodial
 

4313
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,790
they'll use second layer non-custodial
solutions to interact the main chain is

going to get very expensive it's going
 

4317
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,070
going to get very expensive it's going
to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

4318

4321
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,270
of dollars or even more if the dollar
starts to weaken

4322
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
starts to weaken
 

4323
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,950
starts to weaken
uh to make a transaction on the main

4324
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
uh to make a transaction on the main
 

4325
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,189
uh to make a transaction on the main
chain and that will be reserved for like

4326
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:41,199
chain and that will be reserved for like
 

4327
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,830
chain and that will be reserved for like
very large transactions or transactions

4328
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
very large transactions or transactions
 

4329
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,709
very large transactions or transactions
that need final final settlement etc etc

4330
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
that need final final settlement etc etc
 

4331
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:47,910
that need final final settlement etc etc
um

4332
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
um
 

4333
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,750
um
and i think that that's

4334
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:49,760
and i think that that's
 

4335
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,270
and i think that that's
that's fine

4336
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
that's fine
 

4337
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,950
that's fine
and and that's okay

4338
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
and and that's okay
 

4339
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,310
and and that's okay
and it's very important that that ledger

4340
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,320
and it's very important that that ledger
 

4341
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,229
and it's very important that that ledger
that settlement layer

4342
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
that settlement layer
 

4343
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,390
that settlement layer
be kept by thousands of people around

4344
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
be kept by thousands of people around
 

4345
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,310
be kept by thousands of people around
the world the bitcoin blockchain is not

4346
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
the world the bitcoin blockchain is not
 

4347
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,709
the world the bitcoin blockchain is not
centralized it is it is decentralized it

4348
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
centralized it is it is decentralized it
 

4349
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,390
centralized it is it is decentralized it
is run by people like me who run a node

4350
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400
is run by people like me who run a node
 

4351
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,390
is run by people like me who run a node
at home i run a personal server i run

4352
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
at home i run a personal server i run
 

4353
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,709
at home i run a personal server i run
the bitcoin blockchain no one else you

4354
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
the bitcoin blockchain no one else you
 

4355
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,630
the bitcoin blockchain no one else you
run it that person runs it there's no

4356
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640
run it that person runs it there's no
 

4357
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,990
run it that person runs it there's no
there's no one in where you have a full

4358
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,000
there's no one in where you have a full
 

4359
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,229
there's no one in where you have a full
node yeah i run a full node

4360
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:16,239
node yeah i run a full node
 

4361
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:17,830
node yeah i run a full node
it's great i mean it's pretty easy man

4362
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
it's great i mean it's pretty easy man
 

4363
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,669
it's great i mean it's pretty easy man
you run it and that way you can be

4364
01:13:19,669 --> 01:13:19,679
you run it and that way you can be
 

4365
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,830
you run it and that way you can be
sovereign over all of your usage right

4366
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
sovereign over all of your usage right
 

4367
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,590
sovereign over all of your usage right
and you can run it on a raspberry pi

4368
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:23,600
and you can run it on a raspberry pi
 

4369
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,830
and you can run it on a raspberry pi
with less than 150 bucks of equipment

4370
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:25,840
with less than 150 bucks of equipment
 

4371
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,430
with less than 150 bucks of equipment
and that's so important because again

4372
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:27,440
and that's so important because again
 

4373
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,189
and that's so important because again
there is no amazon web service

4374
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:29,199
there is no amazon web service
 

4375
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,110
there is no amazon web service
vulnerability here that is a problem and

4376
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,120
vulnerability here that is a problem and
 

4377
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,790
vulnerability here that is a problem and
i agree with you we're trending in a bad

4378
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:32,800
i agree with you we're trending in a bad
 

4379
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,310
i agree with you we're trending in a bad
direction where like the government

4380
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
direction where like the government
 

4381
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,070
direction where like the government
could just turn off you know a big

4382
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:36,080
could just turn off you know a big
 

4383
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,750
could just turn off you know a big
important website or a news source well

4384
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:37,760
important website or a news source well
 

4385
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,030
important website or a news source well
they can't turn off bitcoin because it

4386
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
they can't turn off bitcoin because it
 

4387
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,270
they can't turn off bitcoin because it
doesn't live on aws it lives with us we

4388
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
doesn't live on aws it lives with us we
 

4389
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,030
doesn't live on aws it lives with us we
are bitcoin and i think that that's

4390
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
are bitcoin and i think that that's
 

4391
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,350
are bitcoin and i think that that's
that's very very powerful um and then

4392
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
that's very very powerful um and then
 

4393
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,590
that's very very powerful um and then
you can have this the something like a

4394
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
you can have this the something like a
 

4395
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,750
you can have this the something like a
lightning network where you can

4396
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:49,760
lightning network where you can
 

4397
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,270
lightning network where you can
escape some of the constraints of the

4398
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
escape some of the constraints of the
 

4399
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,550
escape some of the constraints of the
blockchain

4400
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
blockchain
 

4401
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,630
blockchain
depending on your needs of the privacy

4402
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:54,640
depending on your needs of the privacy
 

4403
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,910
depending on your needs of the privacy
and all those kinds of things

4404
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
and all those kinds of things
 

4405
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,350
and all those kinds of things
everything's an engineering tradeoff but

4406
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
everything's an engineering tradeoff but
 

4407
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,630
everything's an engineering tradeoff but
yeah you can trade off some of the

4408
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
yeah you can trade off some of the
 

4409
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,950
yeah you can trade off some of the
assurances of the base layer to go into

4410
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
assurances of the base layer to go into
 

4411
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,950
assurances of the base layer to go into
lightning for example and and there you

4412
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:02,960
lightning for example and and there you
 

4413
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,470
lightning for example and and there you
can get more speed and more privacy and

4414
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
can get more speed and more privacy and
 

4415
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,990
can get more speed and more privacy and
the things that bitcoin

4416
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
the things that bitcoin
 

4417
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,950
the things that bitcoin
lacks speed and privacy for example um

4418
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
lacks speed and privacy for example um
 

4419
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,550
lacks speed and privacy for example um
you can get on these second layers so

4420
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,560
you can get on these second layers so
 

4421
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,149
you can get on these second layers so
there's all kinds of cool engineering

4422
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
there's all kinds of cool engineering
 

4423
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,310
there's all kinds of cool engineering
things that people are coming up with um

4424
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
things that people are coming up with um
 

4425
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,910
things that people are coming up with um
but i also would just say

4426
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
but i also would just say
 

4427
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,990
but i also would just say
anyone who says the blockchain like

4428
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
anyone who says the blockchain like
 

4429
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,590
anyone who says the blockchain like
that's a red flag for that person

4430
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
that's a red flag for that person
 

4431
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,709
that's a red flag for that person
doesn't really know what they're talking

4432
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
doesn't really know what they're talking
 

4433
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,229
doesn't really know what they're talking
about like satoshi didn't use the

4434
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
about like satoshi didn't use the
 

4435
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,870
about like satoshi didn't use the
blockchain in the the white paper

4436
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
blockchain in the the white paper
 

4437
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,950
blockchain in the the white paper
blockchain was a marketing term com that

4438
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
blockchain was a marketing term com that
 

4439
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,390
blockchain was a marketing term com that
people came up with later

4440
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
people came up with later
 

4441
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,070
people came up with later
to try and do this thing

4442
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
to try and do this thing
 

4443
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,870
to try and do this thing
that was kind of like it peaked in 2015

4444
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
that was kind of like it peaked in 2015
 

4445
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,669
that was kind of like it peaked in 2015
and it continues to be an issue today of

4446
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:35,679
and it continues to be an issue today of
 

4447
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,990
and it continues to be an issue today of
it's blockchain not bitcoin and that was

4448
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,000
it's blockchain not bitcoin and that was
 

4449
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,630
it's blockchain not bitcoin and that was
like a very corporate um kind of social

4450
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,640
like a very corporate um kind of social
 

4451
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,030
like a very corporate um kind of social
attack on bitcoin to say we could take

4452
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,040
attack on bitcoin to say we could take
 

4453
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,870
attack on bitcoin to say we could take
this like ledger part of this radical

4454
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
this like ledger part of this radical
 

4455
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,470
this like ledger part of this radical
thing that's for criminals and all these

4456
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
thing that's for criminals and all these
 

4457
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,229
thing that's for criminals and all these
bad people but we could take one part of

4458
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
bad people but we could take one part of
 

4459
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,070
bad people but we could take one part of
it out and we could bring it over here

4460
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
it out and we could bring it over here
 

4461
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,790
it out and we could bring it over here
and we could make it safe for everybody

4462
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:52,800
and we could make it safe for everybody
 

4463
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,790
and we could make it safe for everybody
the real mccoy's bitcoin

4464
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:54,800
the real mccoy's bitcoin
 

4465
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,390
the real mccoy's bitcoin
i mean satoshi referred to it as the

4466
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
i mean satoshi referred to it as the
 

4467
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,669
i mean satoshi referred to it as the
time chain i mean really what they're

4468
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
time chain i mean really what they're
 

4469
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,270
time chain i mean really what they're
talking about is just these like blocks

4470
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280
talking about is just these like blocks
 

4471
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,870
talking about is just these like blocks
that are connected chronologically of

4472
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880
that are connected chronologically of
 

4473
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,550
that are connected chronologically of
transactions it's really not that

4474
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
transactions it's really not that
 

4475
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,790
transactions it's really not that
exciting the exciting part of bitcoin is

right and ethereum's about to leave
 

4547
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,110
right and ethereum's about to leave
proof of work so

4548

proof of work so
 

4549
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,790
proof of work so
it's about to go to proof of stake

dictatorship and that's why i find it's
so compelling that

because i was first introduced to
 

4915

me four years to actually get into it to
 

4921
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,870
me four years to actually get into it to
go down the rabbit hole i didn't really

not even censorship but
uh incentivization and

uh incentivization and
 

5909
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,629
uh incentivization and
de-incentivization

5910
01:38:28,629 --> 01:38:28,639
de-incentivization
 

5911
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:29,590
de-incentivization
of

low effort content
 

5917
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,550
low effort content
uh then

5918
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
uh then
 

5919
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,310
uh then
i feel like that's going to create a

5920
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320
i feel like that's going to create a
 

5921
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,149
i feel like that's going to create a
system where there's going to be a much

5922
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:40,159
system where there's going to be a much
 

5923
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,310
system where there's going to be a much
more open discourse of ideas dangerous

5924
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,320
more open discourse of ideas dangerous
 

5925
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,870
more open discourse of ideas dangerous

in a decentralized way will be able to
 

5931
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,790
in a decentralized way will be able to
use their own intelligence to select

let's keep it simple um let's look at

5936
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
let's keep it simple um let's look at
 

5937
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,390
let's keep it simple um let's look at
one example uh twitter and jack dorsey

5938
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
one example uh twitter and jack dorsey
 

5939
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,030
one example uh twitter and jack dorsey
and i think it's quite clear that what

5940
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:01,040
and i think it's quite clear that what
 

5941
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,669
and i think it's quite clear that what
he believes is the solution is as you're

5942
01:39:03,669 --> 01:39:03,679
he believes is the solution is as you're
 

5943
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,910
he believes is the solution is as you're
kind of hinting at a more kind of like

5944
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:06,920
kind of hinting at a more kind of like
 

5945
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,070
kind of hinting at a more kind of like
regionalized uh system which is not have

5946
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080
regionalized uh system which is not have
 

5947
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,470
regionalized uh system which is not have
one we call federated system right which

5948
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,480
one we call federated system right which
 

5949
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,830
one we call federated system right which
does not just have like one company in

5950
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:13,840
does not just have like one company in
 

5951
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,669
does not just have like one company in
charge of everything but there's an open

5952
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:15,679
charge of everything but there's an open
 

5953
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,189
charge of everything but there's an open
protocol and then there's like different

5954
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
protocol and then there's like different
 

5955
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:20,390
protocol and then there's like different
instances right so twitter make you know

5956
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:20,400
instances right so twitter make you know
 

5957
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,470
instances right so twitter make you know
jack's dream for twitter is that twitter

5958
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480
jack's dream for twitter is that twitter
 

5959
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,870
jack's dream for twitter is that twitter
is this open protocol that the russian

5960
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:24,880
is this open protocol that the russian
 

5961
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,070
is this open protocol that the russian
government can use and the chinese

5962
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
government can use and the chinese
 

5963
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,270
government can use and the chinese
government can use and the iranian

5964
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,280
government can use and the iranian
 

5965
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,310
government can use and the iranian
government can use and the american

5966
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
government can use and the american
 

5967
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,990
government can use and the american
government can use and then twitter as a

5968
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
government can use and then twitter as a
 

5969
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,830
government can use and then twitter as a
company is going to use two and you as

5970
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
company is going to use two and you as
 

5971
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,669
company is going to use two and you as
the customer decide which implementation

5972
01:39:33,669 --> 01:39:33,679
the customer decide which implementation
 

5973
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,510
the customer decide which implementation
you want to join and there's going to be

5974
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
you want to join and there's going to be
 

5975
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,310
you want to join and there's going to be
different censorship on each instance or

5976
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
different censorship on each instance or
 

5977
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,189
different censorship on each instance or
each federation but uh the protocol

5978
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:41,199
each federation but uh the protocol
 

5979
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,669
each federation but uh the protocol
itself would be like untouchable this is

5980
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
itself would be like untouchable this is
 

5981
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,189
itself would be like untouchable this is
kind of like the idea behind the

5982
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
kind of like the idea behind the
 

5983
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,870
kind of like the idea behind the
internet right there's like

5984
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:46,880
internet right there's like
 

5985
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,229
internet right there's like
different parts of the internet that are

5986
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:48,239
different parts of the internet that are
 

5987
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,950
different parts of the internet that are
censored but like at the very bottom of

5988
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
censored but like at the very bottom of
 

5989
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,950
censored but like at the very bottom of
the very bottom of the backbone of it

5990
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960
the very bottom of the backbone of it
 

5991
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,750
the very bottom of the backbone of it
it's like this this globally connected

5992
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760
it's like this this globally connected
 

5993
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,629
it's like this this globally connected
um relatively unstoppable thing right

5994
01:39:58,629 --> 01:39:58,639
um relatively unstoppable thing right
 

5995
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,229
um relatively unstoppable thing right
so i think that's a pretty good vision

5996
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:00,239
so i think that's a pretty good vision
 

5997
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:01,590
so i think that's a pretty good vision
and twitter's working towards that with

5998
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:01,600
and twitter's working towards that with
 

5999
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,149
and twitter's working towards that with
the blue blue sky like initiative we'll

6000
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:04,159
the blue blue sky like initiative we'll
 

6001
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,750
the blue blue sky like initiative we'll
see i'm a little skeptical that it like

6002
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:05,760
see i'm a little skeptical that it like
 

6003
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,270
see i'm a little skeptical that it like
works out because i've used i use

6004
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:07,280
works out because i've used i use
 

6005
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,510
works out because i've used i use
mastodon for example mastodon is an

6006
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
mastodon for example mastodon is an
 

6007
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,030
mastodon for example mastodon is an
example of a um federated social media

6008
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
example of a um federated social media
 

6009
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,350
example of a um federated social media
now it's it's ruled by a benevolent each

6010
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:15,360
now it's it's ruled by a benevolent each
 

6011
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,870
now it's it's ruled by a benevolent each
instance is ruled by a benevolent

6012
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
instance is ruled by a benevolent
 

6013
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,709

dictator it's just like i happen to like

6014
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:18,719
dictator it's just like i happen to like
 

6015
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,910
dictator it's just like i happen to like
this one so i know so rather than trust

6016
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:21,920
this one so i know so rather than trust
 

6017
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,870
this one so i know so rather than trust
one dictator twitter you could you could

6018
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
one dictator twitter you could you could
 

6019
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,390
one dictator twitter you could you could
you could choose which dictator you want

6020
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:26,400
you could choose which dictator you want
 

6021
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,510
you could choose which dictator you want
to trust and that's kind of the

6022
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:27,520
to trust and that's kind of the
 

6023
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,510
to trust and that's kind of the
federated model and maybe we head that

6024
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
federated model and maybe we head that
 

6025
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,030
federated model and maybe we head that
way but you lose things when it's

6026
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
way but you lose things when it's
 

6027
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,149
way but you lose things when it's
federated you lose the ux you lose the

6028
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:34,159
federated you lose the ux you lose the
 

6029
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,229
federated you lose the ux you lose the
slickness and the feel and all the

6030
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
slickness and the feel and all the
 

6031
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,750
slickness and the feel and all the
millions of dollars they spend on

6032
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:37,760
millions of dollars they spend on
 

6033
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,310
millions of dollars they spend on
developers like mastodon is like not

6034
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
developers like mastodon is like not
 

6035
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,310
developers like mastodon is like not
anywhere close to as nice to use as

6036
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
anywhere close to as nice to use as
 

6037
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,790
anywhere close to as nice to use as
twitter so i feel like it's again it's

6038
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:44,800
twitter so i feel like it's again it's
 

6039
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,990
twitter so i feel like it's again it's
this trade-off that we make with

6040
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
this trade-off that we make with
 

6041
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,270
this trade-off that we make with
everything where it's convenience

6042
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
everything where it's convenience
 

6043
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,350
everything where it's convenience
comfort speed versus privacy and freedom

6044
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
comfort speed versus privacy and freedom
 

6045
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,430
comfort speed versus privacy and freedom
right it's very hard to have something

6046
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:51,440
right it's very hard to have something
 

6047
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,590
right it's very hard to have something
that gives you both i don't know i think

6048
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:53,600
that gives you both i don't know i think
 

6049
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,270
that gives you both i don't know i think
i think uh yeah it is a trade-off have

6050
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
i think uh yeah it is a trade-off have
 

6051
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,629
i think uh yeah it is a trade-off have
you used one of these things that i have

6052
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:56,639
you used one of these things that i have
 

6053
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,950
you used one of these things that i have
not as good as the federator

6054
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
not as good as the federator
 

6055
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,229
not as good as the federator
they're not they're not but the

6056
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
they're not they're not but the
 

6057
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,990
they're not they're not but the

that trade-off and i honestly think
there's

6074
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,600
there's
 

6075
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,750
there's
the ux

6076
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:19,760
the ux
 

6077
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,990
the ux
the experience

6078
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
the experience
 

6079
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,470
the experience
should be centralized should be designed

6080
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:24,480
should be centralized should be designed
 

6081
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,470
should be centralized should be designed
by the company but the data yeah and

6082
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
by the company but the data yeah and
 

6083
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,109
by the company but the data yeah and
like a lot of stuff that could be used

6084
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:31,119
like a lot of stuff that could be used

01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,790
owned by the individual and i think
there's a way to decouple those that

6090
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:36,800
there's a way to decouple those that
 

6091
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,550
there's a way to decouple those that
create an incredible experience to where

there's a lot of basic ux ideas like

6102
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:52,159
there's a lot of basic ux ideas like
 

6103
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,750
there's a lot of basic ux ideas like
just as an example

just as an example
 

6105
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,629
just as an example
i think there should always be

6106
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
i think there should always be
 

6107
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,470
i think there should always be
in everything you design

6108
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:58,480
in everything you design
 

6109
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,390
in everything you design
a one button that's always there that

6110
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
a one button that's always there that
 

6111
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,669
a one button that's always there that

all most of them don't allow you to do
that they don't make it transparent how

6130
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
that they don't make it transparent how
 

6131
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,470
that they don't make it transparent how
much data they had who they shared it

6132

difficult to delete accounts so like
that's a very basic starting point

6138
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:33,199
that's a very basic starting point
 

6139
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,470
that's a very basic starting point
but that that having that button means

6140

that you have control but that's step
 

6143
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,070
that you have control but that's step
one of the control there's a

6144
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
one of the control there's a
 

6145
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,030
one of the control there's a
transparency of knowing exactly when

6146

yeah so it's all sort of built on
lightning but the idea you can think

6252
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:32,239
lightning but the idea you can think
 

6253
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:33,590
lightning but the idea you can think
about it is like

6254
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
about it is like
 

6255
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,510
about it is like
you're slowly starting to build up the

6256
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,520
you're slowly starting to build up the

all that data to the big brother and the
 

6267
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,590
all that data to the big brother and the
surveillance state um and then we have

6268
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:45,600
surveillance state um and then we have
 

6269
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,030
surveillance state um and then we have
like our own versions over here in

6270
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
like our own versions over here in
 

6271
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,030
like our own versions over here in
america that are not quite as convenient

6272

it i think you avoid answering the
 

7981
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:32,310
it i think you avoid answering the
question if we're going to destroy

7982
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,320
question if we're going to destroy
 

7983
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,629
question if we're going to destroy
ourselves

7984
02:13:34,629 --> 02:13:34,639
ourselves
 

7985
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,870
ourselves

you're okay fine if we do not
 

7989
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:40,550
you're okay fine if we do not
decentralize properly

7990
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,560
decentralize properly
 

7991
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,709
decentralize properly
out into different

7992
02:13:42,709 --> 02:13:42,719
out into different
 

7993
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:45,589
out into different
physical spaces probably i guess yeah

7994
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
physical spaces probably i guess yeah
 

7995

that's full of
 

8079
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,709
that's full of
injustice but also full of opportunity

8080

8085
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:21,270
upbringing i went to a public school
here and um we never learned about money

8086
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:21,280
here and um we never learned about money
 

8087
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:24,550
here and um we never learned about money
it was never part of our curriculum um

8088
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:24,560
it was never part of our curriculum um
 

8089
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,470
it was never part of our curriculum um
even personal finances was not part of

8090
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
even personal finances was not part of
 

8091
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,229
even personal finances was not part of
our curriculum you could take like an

8092
02:15:28,229 --> 02:15:28,239
our curriculum you could take like an
 

8093
02:15:28,239 --> 02:15:29,350
our curriculum you could take like an
optional course to learn about like

8094
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:29,360
optional course to learn about like
 

8095
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,030
optional course to learn about like
business or something

business or something
 

8097
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,030
business or something
um and i think that that would be really

8098
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:33,040
um and i think that that would be really
 

8099
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,229
um and i think that that would be really
valuable

8100
02:15:34,229 --> 02:15:34,239
valuable
 

8101
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:36,950
valuable
as a young person or as a teenager

8102
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:36,960
as a young person or as a teenager
 

8103
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,149
as a young person or as a teenager
to start

8104
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
to start

incorporating into your children's lives
 

8107
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,870
incorporating into your children's lives
is like a curiosity about what is money

8108
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,880
is like a curiosity about what is money
 

8109

i think would be very health healthy

8110
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:44,320
i think would be very health healthy
 

8111
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:45,990
i think would be very health healthy
regardless of what path that takes them

8112
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:46,000
regardless of what path that takes them
 

8113
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,069
regardless of what path that takes them
down um because we don't think about it

8114
02:15:48,069 --> 02:15:48,079
down um because we don't think about it
 

8115
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:49,990
down um because we don't think about it
enough either from an administrative

8116
02:15:49,990 --> 02:15:50,000
enough either from an administrative
 

8117
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,510
enough either from an administrative
sort of personal finance thing about

8118
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:51,520

like responsibility uh or
 

8121
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,629
like responsibility uh or
more fundamentally like what is it and

8122
02:15:56,629 --> 02:15:56,639
more fundamentally like what is it and
 

8123
02:15:56,639 --> 02:15:58,629
more fundamentally like what is it and
who creates it where did it come from

8124
02:15:58,629 --> 02:15:58,639
who creates it where did it come from
 

8125
02:15:58,639 --> 02:15:59,990
who creates it where did it come from
both of those things are very important

8126
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:00,000
both of those things are very important
 

8127
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,669
both of those things are very important
so my advice to a young person would be

8128
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
so my advice to a young person would be
 

8129
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:03,430
so my advice to a young person would be
to get to the point where you feel like

8130
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:03,440
to get to the point where you feel like
 

8131
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,470
to get to the point where you feel like
you can

8132
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,480
you can
 

8133
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:05,860
you can
answer the question what is money

8134
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:05,870
answer the question what is money
 

8135
02:16:05,870 --> 02:16:07,350
answer the question what is money
[Laughter]

8136
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:07,360
[Laughter]
 

8137
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:09,270
[Laughter]
so you ultimately see money as a as kind

8138
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,280
so you ultimately see money as a as kind
 

8139
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,149
so you ultimately see money as a as kind
of power and freedom and um

8140
02:16:12,149 --> 02:16:12,159
of power and freedom and um
 

8141
02:16:12,159 --> 02:16:14,149
of power and freedom and um
a mechanism is suffering so core to

8522
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:29,600
look back it seems kind of obvious that
 

8523
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,830

euros
it seems really obvious when you go back

8530
02:22:36,469 --> 02:22:36,479
it seems really obvious when you go back
 

8531
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:38,710
it seems really obvious when you go back
and look at the chronology of it um and

8532
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:38,720
and look at the chronology of it um and
 

8533
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:39,990
and look at the chronology of it um and
we were like no we actually don't want

that would threaten the dollar so we're
 

8539
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:44,790
that would threaten the dollar so we're
going to invade you and then you're not

and then and then from there we'll see
um you know i you know i think it's

8926
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:17,280
um you know i you know i think it's
 

8927
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:18,950
um you know i you know i think it's
important that we have design choices

8928
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
important that we have design choices
 

8929
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:20,309
important that we have design choices
where we can like

8930
02:29:20,309 --> 02:29:20,319
where we can like
 

8931
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:21,590
where we can like
um

8932
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:21,600

have a little more say and that not
 

8935
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:26,150
have a little more say and that not
everything be pre-programmed for us that

8936
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:26,160
everything be pre-programmed for us that
 

8937
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:28,309
everything be pre-programmed for us that
that would be very disappointing

8938
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
that would be very disappointing
 

8939

someone in north korea doesn't have the
 

9013
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:40,550
someone in north korea doesn't have the
opposite they don't have the option

access the internet so there's kind of
 

9019
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:45,190
access the internet so there's kind of
like um

9020

that philosophers have warned about
 

9025
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:50,630
that philosophers have warned about
forever that we basically become sheep

9026
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:50,640
forever that we basically become sheep
 

9027
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:51,510
forever that we basically become sheep
okay

9028
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:51,520
okay
 

9029
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:53,750
okay
and then there's actual like

9030
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:53,760
and then there's actual like
 

9031
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:55,590
and then there's actual like
brainwashing and censorship that's

9032
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:55,600
brainwashing and censorship that's
 

9033
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:57,830
brainwashing and censorship that's
possible like by closing off your

9034
02:30:57,830 --> 02:30:57,840
possible like by closing off your
 

9035
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,590
possible like by closing off your
population and keeping them off like the

9036
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
population and keeping them off like the
 

9037
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:00,870
population and keeping them off like the
internet right

9038
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:00,880
internet right
 

9039
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:02,630
internet right
um so i think these are two very

9040
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640
um so i think these are two very
 

9041
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,389
um so i think these are two very
different concepts absolutely but i also

9042
02:31:04,389 --> 02:31:04,399
different concepts absolutely but i also
 

9043
02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:06,150
different concepts absolutely but i also
mean just like

9044
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:06,160
mean just like
 

9045
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,150
mean just like
not even laziness but cognitive

9046
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,160
not even laziness but cognitive
 

9047
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:10,469

have happened on the scale of decades
 

9059
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,630
have happened on the scale of decades
