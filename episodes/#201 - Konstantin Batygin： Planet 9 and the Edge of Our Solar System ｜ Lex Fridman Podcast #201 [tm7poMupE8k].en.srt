what is planet nine planet nine
 

79
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,190
what is planet nine planet nine
is an object that we believe

80
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
is an object that we believe
 

81
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,109
is an object that we believe
lives in the solar system beyond the

82
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
lives in the solar system beyond the

orbit of neptune it orbits the sun

84
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
orbit of neptune it orbits the sun
 

85
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,030
orbit of neptune it orbits the sun
with a period of about 10 000 years

86
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
with a period of about 10 000 years
 

87
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,230
with a period of about 10 000 years
and uh is about five earth masses

88
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
and uh is about five earth masses
 

89
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,789
and uh is about five earth masses
so that's a hypothesized object there's

90
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
so that's a hypothesized object there's
 

91
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,149
so that's a hypothesized object there's
some evidence

92
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
some evidence
 

93
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,910
some evidence
uh for this kind of object there's a

94
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
uh for this kind of object there's a
 

95
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,910
uh for this kind of object there's a
bunch of different explanations

96
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
bunch of different explanations
 

97
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,870
bunch of different explanations
can you give like an overview of the

98
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
can you give like an overview of the
 

99
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,030
can you give like an overview of the
planets in our solar system how many are

100
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
planets in our solar system how many are
 

101
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,910
planets in our solar system how many are
there

102
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
there
 

103
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,710
there
what do we know and not know about them

104
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
what do we know and not know about them
 

105
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,590
what do we know and not know about them
at a high level

106
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
at a high level
 

107
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,429
at a high level
all right that sounds like a good plan

108
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
all right that sounds like a good plan
 

109
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,510
all right that sounds like a good plan
so look the solar system

110
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
so look the solar system
 

111
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,389
so look the solar system
basically is comprised of two parts the

112
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
basically is comprised of two parts the
 

113
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,990
basically is comprised of two parts the
inner and the outer solar system

114
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
inner and the outer solar system
 

115
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,270
inner and the outer solar system
the inner solar system has the planets

116
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
the inner solar system has the planets
 

117
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,389
the inner solar system has the planets

40 percent of the orbital separation
 

123
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,830
40 percent of the orbital separation
of where the earth is is closer to the

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
of where the earth is is closer to the
 

125
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,710
of where the earth is is closer to the

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
about 70 percent uh then mars is about
 

129
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,830
about 70 percent uh then mars is about
160 further away from the sun than is

130
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
160 further away from the sun than is

these planets that we uh one of them
 

135
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,430
these planets that we uh one of them
we occupy right are pretty small okay

136
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
we occupy right are pretty small okay
 

137
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,550
we occupy right are pretty small okay
they're

they're
 

139
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,949
they're
too leading order sort of heavily

further
 

149
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,790
further
in the solar system and encounter

150

in the solar system and encounter
 

151
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,949
in the solar system and encounter
jupiter which is 316

00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
uh the separation from the sun this is
 

161
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,670
uh the separation from the sun this is
the earth and then you have uranus and

you know why is pluto not a planet

220
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
you know why is pluto not a planet
 

221
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,830
you know why is pluto not a planet

i mean it's tiny were you used to size

224
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
i mean it's tiny were you used to size

when pluto was discovered in 1930
 

233
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,349
when pluto was discovered in 1930
the the reason it was discovered in the

234
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
the the reason it was discovered in the
 

235
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,430
the the reason it was discovered in the
first place because astronomers at the

236
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
first place because astronomers at the
 

237
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,670
first place because astronomers at the
time were looking for a seven earth mass

238
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
time were looking for a seven earth mass
 

239

planet
somewhere beyond neptune it was

242
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
somewhere beyond neptune it was
 

243
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,830
somewhere beyond neptune it was
hypothesized that such an object exists

244
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
hypothesized that such an object exists
 

245
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,990
hypothesized that such an object exists
when they found something they

246
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
when they found something they
 

247
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,030
when they found something they
interpreted that

248
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
interpreted that
 

249
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,350
interpreted that
as a seven earth mass planet and

250
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
as a seven earth mass planet and
 

251
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,990
as a seven earth mass planet and
immediately revised its mass downward

252
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
immediately revised its mass downward
 

253
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,070
immediately revised its mass downward
because they couldn't resolve the object

254
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
because they couldn't resolve the object
 

255
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,830
because they couldn't resolve the object
with the telescope so it looked like a

256
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
with the telescope so it looked like a
 

257
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,350
with the telescope so it looked like a
just a point mass you know

258
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
just a point mass you know
 

259
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,070
just a point mass you know
star rather than a physical disk they

260
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
star rather than a physical disk they
 

261
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,350
star rather than a physical disk they
said well maybe it's not seven maybe

262
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
said well maybe it's not seven maybe
 

263
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,230
said well maybe it's not seven maybe
it's one

264
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
it's one
 

265
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,270
it's one
right and then so over the next um you

266
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
right and then so over the next um you
 

267
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,950
right and then so over the next um you
know i guess 40 years

268
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
know i guess 40 years
 

269
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,670
know i guess 40 years
pluto's mass kept getting revised down

270
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
pluto's mass kept getting revised down
 

271
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,150
pluto's mass kept getting revised down
downwards downwards downwards until

272
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
downwards downwards downwards until
 

273
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,749
downwards downwards downwards until
uh it was realized that's like 500 times

274
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
uh it was realized that's like 500 times
 

275
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,230
uh it was realized that's like 500 times
less massive than the earth i mean like

276
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
less massive than the earth i mean like
 

277
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,430
less massive than the earth i mean like
pluto's

278
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
pluto's
 

279
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,029
pluto's
surface area is almost perfectly equal

280
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
surface area is almost perfectly equal
 

281
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,990
surface area is almost perfectly equal
to the surface area of russia actually

282
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
to the surface area of russia actually
 

283
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,510
to the surface area of russia actually
and you know russia is big but it's not

284
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
and you know russia is big but it's not
 

285
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,590
and you know russia is big but it's not
a planet

286
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
a planet
 

287
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,510
a planet
well i mean actually we can we can touch

288
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
well i mean actually we can we can touch
 

289
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,189
well i mean actually we can we can touch
more on that that's that's another

290
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
more on that that's that's another
 

291
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,070
more on that that's that's another
discussion

292
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
discussion
 

293
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,350
discussion
uh so in some sense earlier in the

294
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
uh so in some sense earlier in the
 

295
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,189
uh so in some sense earlier in the
century pluto represented

296
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
century pluto represented
 

297
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,510
century pluto represented
kind of our ignorance about the edges of

298
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
kind of our ignorance about the edges of
 

299
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,110
kind of our ignorance about the edges of
the solar system

300
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
the solar system
 

301
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,430
the solar system
and perhaps planet nine is the thing

302
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
and perhaps planet nine is the thing
 

303
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,430
and perhaps planet nine is the thing
that represents our ignorance

304
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
that represents our ignorance
 

305
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,430
that represents our ignorance
about now the modern set of ignorances

306
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
about now the modern set of ignorances
 

307
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,029
about now the modern set of ignorances
about the edges of our solar system

308
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
about the edges of our solar system
 

309
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,790
about the edges of our solar system
that's a good way to put it by the way

310
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
that's a good way to put it by the way
 

311
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,110
that's a good way to put it by the way
just

312
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
just
 

313
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,870
just
imagining this belt of astero of debris

314
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
imagining this belt of astero of debris
 

315
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,870
imagining this belt of astero of debris
at the edge of our solar system is

316
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
at the edge of our solar system is
 

317
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,230
at the edge of our solar system is
incredible

318
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
incredible
 

319
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,670
incredible
can you talk about it a little bit what

320
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
can you talk about it a little bit what
 

321
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,670
can you talk about it a little bit what
is the kuiper belt and

322
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
is the kuiper belt and
 

323
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,790
is the kuiper belt and
what it what is the oort cloud yeah

324
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
what it what is the oort cloud yeah
 

325
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,430
what it what is the oort cloud yeah
okay so look the simple way to think

326
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
okay so look the simple way to think
 

327
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,590
okay so look the simple way to think
about it is that if you imagine

328
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
about it is that if you imagine
 

329
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,390
about it is that if you imagine
you know neptune's orbit like a circle

330
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
you know neptune's orbit like a circle
 

331
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,029
you know neptune's orbit like a circle

501
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,630
brightness
that means somebody looked over there

502
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
that means somebody looked over there
 

503
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,230
that means somebody looked over there
and discovered an object

504
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
and discovered an object
 

505
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,790
and discovered an object
of was able to discover an object of

506
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
of was able to discover an object of
 

507
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,990
of was able to discover an object of
that brightness or

508
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
that brightness or
 

509
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,949
that brightness or
brighter through that analysis you can

510
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
brighter through that analysis you can
 

511
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,310
brighter through that analysis you can
construct a whole map

512
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
construct a whole map
 

513
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,550
construct a whole map
on the sky of kind of where all of the

514
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
on the sky of kind of where all of the
 

515
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,550
on the sky of kind of where all of the
surveys that have ever been done

516
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
surveys that have ever been done
 

517
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,630
surveys that have ever been done
have collectively looked so if you do

518
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
have collectively looked so if you do
 

519
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,870
have collectively looked so if you do
the exercise this way

520
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
the exercise this way
 

521
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,070
the exercise this way
the false alarm probability of

522
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
the false alarm probability of
 

523
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,389
the false alarm probability of
the clustering on which the planet nine

524
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
the clustering on which the planet nine
 

525
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,670
the clustering on which the planet nine
hypothesis is built is about 0.4

526
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
hypothesis is built is about 0.4
 

527
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,670
hypothesis is built is about 0.4
wow okay so there's a million questions

528
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
wow okay so there's a million questions
 

529
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,470
wow okay so there's a million questions
here one when you say bright objects

530
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
here one when you say bright objects
 

531
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,150
here one when you say bright objects
why are they bright are we talking about

532
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
why are they bright are we talking about
 

533
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,910
why are they bright are we talking about
actual objects within the kuiper belt or

534
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
actual objects within the kuiper belt or
 

535
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,590
actual objects within the kuiper belt or
the stuff we see through the kupper belt

536
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
the stuff we see through the kupper belt
 

537
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,750
the stuff we see through the kupper belt
this is the actual stuff we see in the

538
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
this is the actual stuff we see in the
 

539
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,030
this is the actual stuff we see in the
kuiper belt the way

540
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
kuiper belt the way
 

541
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,870
kuiper belt the way
you go about discovering kuiper belt

542
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
you go about discovering kuiper belt
 

543
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,230
you go about discovering kuiper belt
objects pretty easy

544
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
objects pretty easy
 

545
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,509
objects pretty easy
i mean it's easy in theory right hard in

546
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
i mean it's easy in theory right hard in
 

547
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,070
i mean it's easy in theory right hard in
practice

548
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
practice
 

549
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,190
practice
yeah all you do is you take snapshots of

550
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
yeah all you do is you take snapshots of
 

551
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,990
yeah all you do is you take snapshots of
the sky

552
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
the sky
 

553
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,230
the sky
right choose that direction say and take

554
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
right choose that direction say and take
 

555
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,110
right choose that direction say and take
you know

556
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
you know
 

557
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,670
you know
the high exposure snapshot then you wait

558
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
the high exposure snapshot then you wait
 

559
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,630
the high exposure snapshot then you wait
a night

560
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
a night
 

561
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,230
a night
and you do it again and then you wait

562
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
and you do it again and then you wait
 

563
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,310
and you do it again and then you wait
another night and you do it again

564
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
another night and you do it again
 

565
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,630
another night and you do it again
objects that are just random stars in

566
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
objects that are just random stars in
 

567
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,389
objects that are just random stars in
the galaxy don't move

568
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
the galaxy don't move
 

569
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,389
the galaxy don't move
on the sky whereas objects in the solar

570
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
on the sky whereas objects in the solar
 

571
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,750
on the sky whereas objects in the solar
system will slowly move

572
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
system will slowly move
 

573
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,310
system will slowly move
this is no different than if you're

574
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
this is no different than if you're
 

575
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,910
this is no different than if you're
driving down the freeway

576
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
driving down the freeway
 

577
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,990
driving down the freeway
it looks like you know trees are going

578
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
it looks like you know trees are going
 

579
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,910
it looks like you know trees are going
by you faster than the clouds right this

580
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
by you faster than the clouds right this
 

581
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,269
by you faster than the clouds right this
is parallax

582
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
is parallax
 

583
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,509
is parallax
that's it it's just they're reflecting

584
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
that's it it's just they're reflecting
 

585
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,310
that's it it's just they're reflecting
light off

586
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
light off
 

587
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,389
light off
of the sun and it's going back and

588
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
of the sun and it's going back and
 

589
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,069
of the sun and it's going back and
hitting this there's a little bit of a

590
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
hitting this there's a little bit of a
 

591
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,710
hitting this there's a little bit of a
glimmer

592
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
glimmer
 

593
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,150
glimmer
from the different objects that you can

594
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
from the different objects that you can
 

595
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,550
from the different objects that you can
see based on the reflection from the sun

596
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
see based on the reflection from the sun
 

597
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,350
see based on the reflection from the sun
so like

598
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
so like
 

599
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,030
so like
there's actual light yeah it's not

600
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
there's actual light yeah it's not
 

601
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,190
there's actual light yeah it's not
darkness that's right these are just

602
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
darkness that's right these are just
 

603
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,670
darkness that's right these are just
big icicles basically that are just

604
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
big icicles basically that are just
 

605
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,590
big icicles basically that are just
reflecting sunlight back at you

606
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
reflecting sunlight back at you
 

607
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,790
reflecting sunlight back at you
it's then easy to understand why it's so

608
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
it's then easy to understand why it's so
 

609
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,470
it's then easy to understand why it's so
hard to discover them because

610
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
hard to discover them because
 

611
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,630
hard to discover them because
light has to travel to you know

612
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
light has to travel to you know
 

613
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,190
light has to travel to you know
something like 40 times the distance

614
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
something like 40 times the distance
 

615
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,990
something like 40 times the distance
um between the earth and the sun and

616
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
um between the earth and the sun and
 

617
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,069
um between the earth and the sun and
then get reflected back was it like an

618
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
then get reflected back was it like an
 

619
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,949
then get reflected back was it like an
hour

620
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
hour
 

621
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,790
hour
travel or yeah that's right that's

622
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
travel or yeah that's right that's
 

623
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,069
travel or yeah that's right that's
something like that because the

624
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
something like that because the
 

625
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,389
something like that because the
the earth to the sun is eight minutes i

626
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
the earth to the sun is eight minutes i
 

627
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,670
the earth to the sun is eight minutes i
believe um

628
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
believe um
 

629
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,389
believe um
and so something you know yeah yeah in

630
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
and so something you know yeah yeah in
 

631
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,870
and so something you know yeah yeah in
that

632
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
that
 

633
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,310
that
in that order magnitude so that's

634
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
in that order magnitude so that's
 

635
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,230
in that order magnitude so that's
interesting so you have to

636
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
interesting so you have to
 

637
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,389
interesting so you have to
like account for all of that and then

638
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
like account for all of that and then
 

639
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,470
like account for all of that and then
there's this huge amount of

640
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
there's this huge amount of
 

641
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,630
there's this huge amount of
data pixels that are coming from the

642
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
data pixels that are coming from the
 

643
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,990
data pixels that are coming from the
pictures

644
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
pictures
 

645
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,230
pictures
and you have to uh integrate all that

646
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
and you have to uh integrate all that
 

647
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,190
and you have to uh integrate all that
together

648
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
together
 

649
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,550
together
to paint a sort of like a high estimate

650
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
to paint a sort of like a high estimate
 

651
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,590
to paint a sort of like a high estimate
of the different objects

652
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
of the different objects
 

653
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,030
of the different objects
can you track them can you be like

654
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
can you track them can you be like
 

655
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,870
can you track them can you be like
that's bob like can you like

656
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
that's bob like can you like
 

657
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,150
that's bob like can you like
yes exactly in fact uh one of them is

658
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
yes exactly in fact uh one of them is
 

659
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,350
yes exactly in fact uh one of them is
is named joe biden i mean i'm not like

660
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
is named joe biden i mean i'm not like
 

661
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,389
is named joe biden i mean i'm not like
this is not even a joke

662
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
this is not even a joke
 

663
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,190
this is not even a joke
right is there a trump one or no no no

664
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
right is there a trump one or no no no
 

665
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,750
right is there a trump one or no no no
no

666
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
no
 

667
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,750
no
i don't know i haven't checked for for

668
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
i don't know i haven't checked for for
 

669
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,030
i don't know i haven't checked for for
for that but

670
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
for that but
 

671
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,990
for that but
uh like the way it works is if you

672
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
uh like the way it works is if you
 

673
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,430
uh like the way it works is if you
discover one

674
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
discover one
 

675
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,829
discover one
you right away get a license plate for

676
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
you right away get a license plate for
 

677
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,870
you right away get a license plate for
it okay

678
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
it okay
 

679
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,509
it okay
so like the first four numbers is the

680
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
so like the first four numbers is the
 

681
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:53,910
so like the first four numbers is the
first

682
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
first
 

683
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,629
first
year that this object has appeared on

684
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
year that this object has appeared on
 

685
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,829
year that this object has appeared on
you know

686
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
you know
 

687
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,110
you know
in the data set if you will and then um

688
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
in the data set if you will and then um
 

689
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,389
in the data set if you will and then um
there's like this code that follows it

690
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
there's like this code that follows it
 

691
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,870
there's like this code that follows it
which basically tells you where in the

692
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
which basically tells you where in the
 

693
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,750
which basically tells you where in the
sky it is

694
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
sky it is
 

695
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,550
sky it is
right so one of the really interesting

696
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
right so one of the really interesting
 

697
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,629
right so one of the really interesting
kuiper belt objects which is very much

698
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
kuiper belt objects which is very much
 

699
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,470
kuiper belt objects which is very much
part of the planet 9 story is called

700
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
part of the planet 9 story is called
 

701
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,949
part of the planet 9 story is called
vp113

702
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
vp113
 

703
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,430
vp113
because joe biden was vice president at

704
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
because joe biden was vice president at
 

705
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,150
because joe biden was vice president at
the time

706
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
the time
 

707
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,790
the time
you know got nicknamed biden

708
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:23,800
you know got nicknamed biden
 

709
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,190
you know got nicknamed biden
vp113 said yeah you got nickname button

710
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
vp113 said yeah you got nickname button
 

711
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,230
vp113 said yeah you got nickname button
beautiful

712
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
beautiful
 

713
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,190
beautiful
what's the fingerprint for any

714
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
what's the fingerprint for any
 

715
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,150
what's the fingerprint for any
particular

716
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
particular
 

717
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,350
particular
object like how do you know it's the

718
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
object like how do you know it's the
 

719
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,750
object like how do you know it's the
same one okay just kind of like

720
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
same one okay just kind of like
 

721
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,350
same one okay just kind of like
yeah from night to night you take a

722
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
yeah from night to night you take a
 

723
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,870
yeah from night to night you take a
picture how do you know it's the same

724
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
picture how do you know it's the same
 

725
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,509
picture how do you know it's the same
object

726
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
object
 

727
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,670
object
yeah so the way you know is it appears

728
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
yeah so the way you know is it appears
 

729
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,069
yeah so the way you know is it appears
in almost exactly the same part of the

730
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
in almost exactly the same part of the
 

731
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,310
in almost exactly the same part of the
sky except for the move but it moves but

732
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
sky except for the move but it moves but
 

733
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,710
sky except for the move but it moves but
this is why actually you need at least

734
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
this is why actually you need at least
 

735
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,910
this is why actually you need at least
three nights

736
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
three nights
 

737
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,430
three nights
because oftentimes asteroids

738
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
because oftentimes asteroids
 

739
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,590
because oftentimes asteroids
which are much closer to the earth like

740
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
which are much closer to the earth like
 

741
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,269
which are much closer to the earth like
will um

742
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
will um
 

743
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,710
will um
appear to move only

744
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
appear to move only
 

745
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,790
appear to move only
slightly but then on the third night

746
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
slightly but then on the third night
 

747
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,470
slightly but then on the third night
will move away so that third knight

748
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
will move away so that third knight
 

749
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,269
will move away so that third knight
is really there to detect acceleration

750
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
is really there to detect acceleration
 

751
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,550
is really there to detect acceleration
now

752
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
now
 

753
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,710
now
the the thing that i didn't really

754
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
the the thing that i didn't really
 

755
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,629
the the thing that i didn't really
realize until

756
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
realize until
 

757
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,030
realize until
you know i started observing together

758
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
you know i started observing together
 

759
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,629
you know i started observing together
with my partner in crime and all this

760
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
with my partner in crime and all this
 

761
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,750
with my partner in crime and all this
mike brown

762
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
mike brown
 

763
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,269
mike brown
is just the fact that for the first year

764
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
is just the fact that for the first year
 

765
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,110
is just the fact that for the first year
when you make these detections

766
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
when you make these detections
 

767
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,110
when you make these detections
the only thing you really know is

768
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
the only thing you really know is
 

769
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,110
the only thing you really know is
confidence is where it is on the night

770
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
confidence is where it is on the night
 

771
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,829
confidence is where it is on the night
sky

772
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
sky
 

773
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,710
sky
and how far away it is okay that's it

774
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
and how far away it is okay that's it
 

775
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,829
and how far away it is okay that's it
you don't know anything about the orbit

776
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
you don't know anything about the orbit
 

777
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,150
you don't know anything about the orbit
because over three days the object just

778
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
because over three days the object just
 

779
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,790
because over three days the object just
moves so little right the that whole

780
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
moves so little right the that whole
 

781
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,110
moves so little right the that whole
motion on the sky is entirely coming

782
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
motion on the sky is entirely coming
 

783
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,430
motion on the sky is entirely coming
from

784
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
from
 

785
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,590
from
motion of the earth right so the earth

786
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
motion of the earth right so the earth
 

787
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,629
motion of the earth right so the earth
is kind of the car

788
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
is kind of the car
 

789
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,550
is kind of the car
the object is the tree and you see it

790
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
the object is the tree and you see it
 

791
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,310
the object is the tree and you see it
moving so then

792
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
moving so then
 

793
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,189
moving so then
to get some confident information about

794
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
to get some confident information about
 

795
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,790
to get some confident information about
what its orbit looks like you have to

796
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
what its orbit looks like you have to
 

797
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,350
what its orbit looks like you have to
come back

798
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
come back
 

799
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,150
come back
a year later um and then measure it

800
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
a year later um and then measure it
 

801
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,629
a year later um and then measure it
again

802
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
again
 

803
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,230
again
interesting to do three nights then come

804
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
interesting to do three nights then come
 

805
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,230
interesting to do three nights then come
back a year later and do another three

806
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
back a year later and do another three
 

807
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,110
back a year later and do another three
nights

808
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
nights
 

809
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,870
nights
so you get the velocity the acceleration

810
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
so you get the velocity the acceleration
 

811
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,310
so you get the velocity the acceleration
from the three nights and then you have

812
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
from the three nights and then you have
 

813
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,110
from the three nights and then you have
the

814
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
the
 

815
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,509
the
maybe the additional the additional

816
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
maybe the additional the additional
 

817
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,150
maybe the additional the additional
formation

818
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
formation
 

819
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,990
formation
because an orbit is basically described

820
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
because an orbit is basically described
 

821
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,350
because an orbit is basically described
by six parameters

822
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
by six parameters
 

823
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,189
by six parameters
so you at least need six independent

824
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
so you at least need six independent
 

825
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,269
so you at least need six independent
points but in reality you need

826
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
points but in reality you need
 

827
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,949
points but in reality you need
many more observations to to really

828
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
many more observations to to really
 

829
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,949
many more observations to to really
pin down the orbit well and from that

830
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
pin down the orbit well and from that
 

831
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,389
pin down the orbit well and from that
you're able to construct for that one

832
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
you're able to construct for that one
 

833
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,069
you're able to construct for that one
particular object in orbit and then

834
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
particular object in orbit and then
 

835
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,550
particular object in orbit and then
there's

836
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
there's
 

837
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,269
there's
of course like how many objects are

838
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
of course like how many objects are
 

839
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:27,590
of course like how many objects are
there

840
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
there
 

841
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,189
there
there's like four-ish thousand now

842
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
there's like four-ish thousand now
 

843
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,310
there's like four-ish thousand now
but like the

844
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
but like the
 

845
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,230
but like the
in the future that could be like

846
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
in the future that could be like
 

847
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,430
in the future that could be like
millions

848
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
millions
 

849
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,150
millions
oh sure oh sure so in fact these things

850
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
oh sure oh sure so in fact these things
 

851
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,829
oh sure oh sure so in fact these things
are hard to predict but there's a

852
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
are hard to predict but there's a
 

853
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,150
are hard to predict but there's a
new observatory called the vera rubin

854
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
new observatory called the vera rubin
 

855
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,030
new observatory called the vera rubin
observatory which is coming online

856
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
observatory which is coming online
 

857
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,189
observatory which is coming online
maybe next year i mean with covet these

858
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
maybe next year i mean with covet these
 

859
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,310
maybe next year i mean with covet these
things are

860
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
things are
 

861
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,550
things are
a little bit more uncertain but they've

862
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
a little bit more uncertain but they've
 

863
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,470
a little bit more uncertain but they've
actually been making great progress

864
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
actually been making great progress
 

865
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,389
actually been making great progress
uh with construction and so that

866
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
uh with construction and so that
 

867
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,189
uh with construction and so that
uh telescope is gonna sort of scan the

868
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
uh telescope is gonna sort of scan the
 

869
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,470
uh telescope is gonna sort of scan the
night sky

870
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
night sky
 

871
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,269
night sky
uh every day automatically and it's just

872
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
uh every day automatically and it's just
 

873
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,670
uh every day automatically and it's just
it's such an efficient survey that it

874
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
it's such an efficient survey that it
 

875
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,710
it's such an efficient survey that it
might uh increase the census

876
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
might uh increase the census
 

877
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,710
might uh increase the census
of the distant kuiper belt the things

878
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
of the distant kuiper belt the things
 

879
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,230
of the distant kuiper belt the things
that i'm interested in

880
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
that i'm interested in
 

881
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,870
that i'm interested in
by a factor of 100 i mean that would be

882
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
by a factor of 100 i mean that would be
 

883
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,910
by a factor of 100 i mean that would be
that would be really cool

884
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
that would be really cool
 

885
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,790
that would be really cool
and yeah that's a that's an incredible

886
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
and yeah that's a that's an incredible
 

887
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,590
and yeah that's a that's an incredible
uh

888
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
uh
 

889
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,030
uh
maybe i mean they might just find planet

890
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
maybe i mean they might just find planet
 

891
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,389
maybe i mean they might just find planet
nine

892
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
nine
 

893
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,069
nine
i mean that's like almost like literally

894
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
i mean that's like almost like literally
 

895
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,670
i mean that's like almost like literally
pictures like visually

896
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
pictures like visually
 

897
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,110
pictures like visually
i mean sure yeah like the first

898
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
i mean sure yeah like the first
 

899
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,030
i mean sure yeah like the first
detection you make all you know is where

900
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
detection you make all you know is where
 

901
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,509
detection you make all you know is where
it is in the sky and how far away it is

902
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
it is in the sky and how far away it is
 

903
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,069
it is in the sky and how far away it is
if something is you know 500 times away

904
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
if something is you know 500 times away
 

905
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,710
if something is you know 500 times away
from the sun

906
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
from the sun
 

907
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,710
from the sun
as far away from the sun as is the earth

908
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
as far away from the sun as is the earth
 

909
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,310
as far away from the sun as is the earth
you know that's planet nine that's when

910
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
you know that's planet nine that's when
 

911
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,389
you know that's planet nine that's when
the story concludes

912
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
the story concludes
 

913
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,990
the story concludes
and then you can study it right now you

914
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
and then you can study it right now you
 

915
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,670
and then you can study it right now you
can study yeah by the way

916
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
can study yeah by the way
 

917
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,590
can study yeah by the way
i'm going to use that as like i don't

918
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
i'm going to use that as like i don't
 

919
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,590
i'm going to use that as like i don't
know a pickup line or a dating strategy

920
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
know a pickup line or a dating strategy
 

921
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,069
know a pickup line or a dating strategy
like see the person for three days and

922
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
like see the person for three days and
 

923
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,430
like see the person for three days and
then don't see them at all and then see

924
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
then don't see them at all and then see
 

925
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,550
then don't see them at all and then see
them again in

926
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
them again in
 

927
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,030
them again in
in a year to determine the orbit and

928
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
in a year to determine the orbit and
 

929
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,150
in a year to determine the orbit and
over time

930
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
over time
 

931
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,350
over time
you figure out if sort of uh

932
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
you figure out if sort of uh
 

933
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,590
you figure out if sort of uh
from a cosmic perspective this this

934
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
from a cosmic perspective this this
 

935
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,749
from a cosmic perspective this this
whole thing

936
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
whole thing
 

937
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,749
whole thing
i have no dating advice to give i was

938
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
i have no dating advice to give i was
 

939
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,189
i have no dating advice to give i was
good i was going to use this as a

940
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
good i was going to use this as a
 

941
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,590
good i was going to use this as a
metaphor to uh to somehow

942
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
metaphor to uh to somehow
 

943
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,310
metaphor to uh to somehow
uh map it on to the human condition okay

944
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
uh map it on to the human condition okay
 

945
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,910
uh map it on to the human condition okay
you mentioned the kuiper belt what's the

946
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
you mentioned the kuiper belt what's the
 

947
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,790
you mentioned the kuiper belt what's the
oor cloud

948
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
oor cloud
 

949
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,069
oor cloud
if you look at the neptune orbit as uh

950
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
if you look at the neptune orbit as uh
 

951
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,269
if you look at the neptune orbit as uh
one then the kuiper bell is like 1.3 out

952
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
one then the kuiper bell is like 1.3 out
 

953
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,749
one then the kuiper bell is like 1.3 out
there

954
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
there
 

955
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,590
there
and then we get farther and farther into

956
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
and then we get farther and farther into
 

957
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,790
and then we get farther and farther into
the darkness what

958
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
the darkness what
 

959
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,949
the darkness what
so okay you've got the kind of main

960
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
so okay you've got the kind of main
 

961
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,230
so okay you've got the kind of main
kuiper belt was about

962
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
kuiper belt was about
 

963
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,269
kuiper belt was about
say 1.3 1.5

964
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
say 1.3 1.5
 

965
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,829
say 1.3 1.5
um then you have something called the

966
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
um then you have something called the
 

967
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,030
um then you have something called the
scattered disc

968
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
scattered disc
 

969
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,870
scattered disc
which is kind of an extension of the

970
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
which is kind of an extension of the
 

971
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,949
which is kind of an extension of the
kuiper belt it's a bunch of these

972
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
kuiper belt it's a bunch of these
 

973
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,189
kuiper belt it's a bunch of these
long very elliptical orbits that hug

974
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
long very elliptical orbits that hug
 

975
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,110
long very elliptical orbits that hug
the orbit of neptune but come out very

976
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
the orbit of neptune but come out very
 

977
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,470
the orbit of neptune but come out very
far so

978
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,480
far so
 

979
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,829
far so
that the scattered disc

980
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
that the scattered disc
 

981
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,470
that the scattered disc
with the current senses like the some of

982
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
with the current senses like the some of
 

983
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,870
with the current senses like the some of
the

984
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
the
 

985
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,069
the
longest orbits we know of

986
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
longest orbits we know of
 

987
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,269
longest orbits we know of
um have a

988
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
um have a
 

989
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,710
um have a
semi-major axis so half the orbit length

990
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
semi-major axis so half the orbit length
 

991
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,870
semi-major axis so half the orbit length
roughly speaking of about a thousand

992
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
roughly speaking of about a thousand
 

993
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,710
roughly speaking of about a thousand
thousand times the distance between the

994
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
thousand times the distance between the

wow now if you keep moving out okay

998
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
wow now if you keep moving out okay
 

999
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,309
wow now if you keep moving out okay
eventually once you're sort of you know

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
eventually once you're sort of you know

ten thousand to a hundred thousand
roughly that's where the oort cloud is

1004
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
roughly that's where the oort cloud is
 

1005
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,150
roughly that's where the oort cloud is
now the oort cloud is a distinct

1006
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
now the oort cloud is a distinct
 

1007
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,510
now the oort cloud is a distinct
population of

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
population of
 

1009
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,590
population of
icy bodies and it's distinct from the

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
icy bodies and it's distinct from the
 

1011
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,190
icy bodies and it's distinct from the
kuiper belt it's in fact it's so

1012
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
kuiper belt it's in fact it's so
 

1013
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,549

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
that it ends roughly halfway between
 

1017
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,510
that it ends roughly halfway between
us and the next star um it's it's edge

1018
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520

1019
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,470
us and the next star um it's it's edge
is just

1020
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
is just
 

1021
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,750
is just
dictated by to what extent does the

solar gravity reaches that far yeah so
 

1027
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,110

it has to
 

1029
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,310
it has to
wow yeah so in fact

1030
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
wow yeah so in fact
 

1031
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,590
wow yeah so in fact

comet will come in
 

1059
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,630

then we discover them as comets because

1100
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
then we discover them as comets because
 

1101
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,150
then we discover them as comets because
then the ice comes off of them

1102

then the ice comes off of them
 

1103
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,789
then the ice comes off of them
they look beautiful on the night sky etc

they look beautiful on the night sky etc
 

1105
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,630
they look beautiful on the night sky etc
but they're all coming from

but they're all coming from
 

1107
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,029
but they're all coming from
you know really really far away so is

00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
you know really really far away so is
 

1109
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,750
you know really really far away so is
there

1110
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
there
 

1111
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,310
there
are any of them coming our way from

1112
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
are any of them coming our way from
 

1113
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,150
are any of them coming our way from

1117
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,150
there
or is there a bunch of space for them to

or is there a bunch of space for them to
 

1119
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,150
or is there a bunch of space for them to

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
move around yeah there's zero it's
 

1121

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,669
out there the physical radii of objects
are so small compared to the distance

from
 

1159
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,750
from
out there oh sure oh sure yeah join the

1160
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
out there oh sure oh sure yeah join the
 

1161
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,310
out there oh sure oh sure yeah join the
party

1162
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
party
 

1163
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,310
party
yeah absolutely uh we've seen a couple

1164
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
yeah absolutely uh we've seen a couple
 

1165
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,590
yeah absolutely uh we've seen a couple
of them um

1166
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
of them um
 

1167
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,310
of them um
in the last three or f or so years uh

1168
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
in the last three or f or so years uh
 

1169
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,909
in the last three or f or so years uh
maybe four years now

1170
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
maybe four years now
 

1171
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,590
maybe four years now
uh one the first one uh was

1172
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
uh one the first one uh was
 

1173
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,870
uh one the first one uh was
the one called it's been

1174
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
the one called it's been
 

1175
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,190
the one called it's been
all over the news the second one was

1176
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
all over the news the second one was
 

1177
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,270
all over the news the second one was
comet borisov

1178
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
comet borisov
 

1179
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,230
comet borisov
discovered by a guy named borisov

1180
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240

 

1181
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,990

yeah so the way you know they're coming

1182
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
yeah so the way you know they're coming
 

1183
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,510
yeah so the way you know they're coming
from elsewhere is

1184
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
from elsewhere is
 

1185
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,310
from elsewhere is
unlike solar system objects which travel

1186
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
unlike solar system objects which travel
 

1187
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,750
unlike solar system objects which travel
on elliptical paths

1188
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
on elliptical paths
 

1189
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,310
on elliptical paths
around the sun these guys travel on

1190
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
around the sun these guys travel on
 

1191
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,909
around the sun these guys travel on
hyperbolic paths

1192
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
hyperbolic paths
 

1193
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,070
hyperbolic paths
so they come in say hello and then

1194
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
so they come in say hello and then
 

1195
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,950
so they come in say hello and then
they're gone

1196
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
they're gone
 

1197
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,029
they're gone
and the fact that they exist

1198
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
and the fact that they exist
 

1199
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,310
and the fact that they exist
is totally like not surprising

1200
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
is totally like not surprising
 

1201
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,830
is totally like not surprising
right the neptune is con constantly

1202
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
right the neptune is con constantly
 

1203
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,710
right the neptune is con constantly

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,590
kuiper belt objects into interstellar
space our solar system itself

1208
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
space our solar system itself
 

1209
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,870
space our solar system itself
is sort of leaking icy debris and

1210
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
is sort of leaking icy debris and
 

1211
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,870
is sort of leaking icy debris and
injecting it so

1212
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
injecting it so
 

1213
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,710
injecting it so
presumably every you know planetary

1214
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
presumably every you know planetary
 

1215
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,630
presumably every you know planetary
systems around other stars do exactly

1216
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
systems around other stars do exactly
 

1217
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,669
systems around other stars do exactly
the same thing

1218
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
the same thing
 

1219
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,549
the same thing
let me ask you about the the millions of

1220
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
let me ask you about the the millions of
 

1221
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,510
let me ask you about the the millions of
objects that are

1222
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
objects that are
 

1223
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,029
objects that are
part of the kuiper belt and the part of

1224
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
part of the kuiper belt and the part of
 

1225
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,789
part of the kuiper belt and the part of
the ore cloud do you think some of them

1226
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
the ore cloud do you think some of them
 

1227
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,190
the ore cloud do you think some of them
have

1228
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
have
 

1229
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,789
have
primitive life it kind of makes you sad

1230
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
primitive life it kind of makes you sad
 

1231
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,230
primitive life it kind of makes you sad
if there's like primitive life there and

1232
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
if there's like primitive life there and
 

1233
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,590
if there's like primitive life there and
they're just kind of like lonely out

1234
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
they're just kind of like lonely out
 

1235
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,549
they're just kind of like lonely out
there in space

1236
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
there in space
 

1237
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,070
there in space
like how many of them do you think have

1238
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
like how many of them do you think have
 

1239
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,230
like how many of them do you think have
life like bacterial life probably a

1240
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
life like bacterial life probably a
 

1241
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,590
life like bacterial life probably a
negligible amount

1242
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
negligible amount
 

1243
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,310
negligible amount
zero you know like zero was like a plus

1244
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
zero you know like zero was like a plus
 

1245
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,110
zero you know like zero was like a plus
on top

1246
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
on top
 

1247
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,870
on top
uh right yeah

1248
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
uh right yeah
 

1249
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,710
uh right yeah
um if so you know if you and i

1250
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
um if so you know if you and i
 

1251
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,710
um if so you know if you and i
took a little trip to the interstellar

1252
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
took a little trip to the interstellar
 

1253
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,029
took a little trip to the interstellar
medium i think we would develop cancer

1254
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
medium i think we would develop cancer
 

1255
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,230
medium i think we would develop cancer
and die uh real fast right that's rough

1256
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
and die uh real fast right that's rough
 

1257
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,029
and die uh real fast right that's rough
yeah it's a pretty hostile radiation

1258
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
yeah it's a pretty hostile radiation
 

1259
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,710
yeah it's a pretty hostile radiation
environment

1260
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
environment
 

1261
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,909
environment
you don't actually have to go to the

1262
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
you don't actually have to go to the
 

1263
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,110
you don't actually have to go to the
interstellar medium you just have to

1264
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
interstellar medium you just have to
 

1265
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,070
interstellar medium you just have to
leave the earth's magnetic field too

1266
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
leave the earth's magnetic field too
 

1267
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,470
leave the earth's magnetic field too
and then you're not doing so well

1268
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
and then you're not doing so well
 

1269
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,270
and then you're not doing so well
suddenly

1270
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
suddenly
 

1271
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,190
suddenly
so you know this this idea of

1272
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
so you know this this idea of
 

1273
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,710
so you know this this idea of
you know life kind of traveling between

1274
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
you know life kind of traveling between
 

1275
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,149
you know life kind of traveling between
places it's not

1276
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
places it's not
 

1277
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,950
places it's not
it's not entirely implausible but you

1278
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
it's not entirely implausible but you
 

1279
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,710
it's not entirely implausible but you
you really have to

1280
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
you really have to
 

1281
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,549
you really have to
twist i think a lot of parameters one of

1282
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
twist i think a lot of parameters one of
 

1283
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,230
twist i think a lot of parameters one of
the problems we have is we don't

1284
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
the problems we have is we don't
 

1285
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,310
the problems we have is we don't
actually know how life originates

1286
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
actually know how life originates
 

1287
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,510
actually know how life originates
right so it's kind of a second order

1288
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
right so it's kind of a second order
 

1289
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,630
right so it's kind of a second order
question of survival in the interstellar

1290
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
question of survival in the interstellar
 

1291
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,110
question of survival in the interstellar
medium and how resilient it is because

1292
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
medium and how resilient it is because
 

1293
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,390
medium and how resilient it is because
we we think you require

1294
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
we we think you require
 

1295
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,750
we we think you require
water but and that's certainly the case

1296
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
water but and that's certainly the case
 

1297
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,110
water but and that's certainly the case
for the earth but you know we uh

1298
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
for the earth but you know we uh
 

1299
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,230
for the earth but you know we uh
we really don't know for sure that said

1300
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
we really don't know for sure that said
 

1301
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,470
we really don't know for sure that said
i will argue that the question of like

1302
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
i will argue that the question of like
 

1303
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,230
i will argue that the question of like
are there aliens out there

1304
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
are there aliens out there
 

1305
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,270
are there aliens out there
is a very boring question because

1306
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
is a very boring question because
 

1307
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,510
is a very boring question because
the answer is of course there are right

1308
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
the answer is of course there are right
 

1309
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,430
the answer is of course there are right
i mean like

1310
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
i mean like
 

1311
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,870
i mean like
we know that there are planets around

1312
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
we know that there are planets around
 

1313
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,710
we know that there are planets around
almost every star um

1314
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
almost every star um
 

1315
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,310
almost every star um
of course there of course there are

1316
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
of course there of course there are
 

1317
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,950
of course there of course there are
other life forms life is not some

1318
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
other life forms life is not some
 

1319
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,190
other life forms life is not some
specific thing that happened on the

1320
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
specific thing that happened on the
 

1321
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,310
specific thing that happened on the
earth and that's it

1322
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
earth and that's it
 

1323
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,990
earth and that's it
right just that's a statistical

1324
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
right just that's a statistical
 

1325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,310
right just that's a statistical
impossibility yeah um

1326
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
impossibility yeah um
 

1327
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,870
impossibility yeah um
yeah but the the difficult question is

1328
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
yeah but the the difficult question is
 

1329
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,909
yeah but the the difficult question is
before even

1330
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
before even
 

1331
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,510
before even
the fact that we don't know how life

1332
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
the fact that we don't know how life
 

1333
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,590
the fact that we don't know how life
originates i don't think we even know

1334
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
originates i don't think we even know
 

1335
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,310
originates i don't think we even know
what life

1336
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
what life
 

1337
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,390
what life
is like definitionally yeah like

1338
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
is like definitionally yeah like
 

1339
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,149
is like definitionally yeah like
formalizing a kind of picture

1340
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
formalizing a kind of picture
 

1341
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,110
formalizing a kind of picture
of in terms of the mechanism we would

1342
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
of in terms of the mechanism we would
 

1343
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,510
of in terms of the mechanism we would
use

1344
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
use
 

1345
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,789
use
to to search for life out there or even

1346
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
to to search for life out there or even
 

1347
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,909
to to search for life out there or even
when we're on a planet

1348
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
when we're on a planet
 

1349
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,190
when we're on a planet
to say is this life is this rock that

1350
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
to say is this life is this rock that
 

1351
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,310
to say is this life is this rock that
just moved

1352
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
just moved
 

1353
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,110
just moved
from where it was yesterday life or or

1354
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
from where it was yesterday life or or
 

1355
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,830
from where it was yesterday life or or
maybe not even

1356
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
maybe not even
 

1357
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,070
maybe not even
rock something else i got to tell you i

1358
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
rock something else i got to tell you i
 

1359
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,110
rock something else i got to tell you i
want to know what life

1360
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
want to know what life
 

1361
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,990
want to know what life
is okay and i want you to show me

1362
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
is okay and i want you to show me
 

1363
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,350
is okay and i want you to show me
uh i think there's a song to basically

1364
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
uh i think there's a song to basically
 

1365
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,269
uh i think there's a song to basically
accompany every single

1366
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
accompany every single
 

1367
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,750
accompany every single
thing we talk about today and probably

1368
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
thing we talk about today and probably
 

1369
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,590
thing we talk about today and probably
uh half of them are love songs

1370
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
uh half of them are love songs
 

1371
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,350
uh half of them are love songs
um and somehow we'll integrate george

1372
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
um and somehow we'll integrate george
 

1373
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,789
um and somehow we'll integrate george
michael into the whole thing okay

1374
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
michael into the whole thing okay
 

1375
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,789
michael into the whole thing okay
so your intuition is there's life

1376
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
so your intuition is there's life
 

1377
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,909
so your intuition is there's life
everywhere in our universe

1378
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
everywhere in our universe
 

1379
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,590
everywhere in our universe
do you think there's intelligent life

1380
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
do you think there's intelligent life
 

1381
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,350
do you think there's intelligent life
out there i think it's entirely

1382
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
out there i think it's entirely
 

1383
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,909
out there i think it's entirely
plausible

1384
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
plausible
 

1385
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,789
plausible
i mean i it's entirely plausible um

1386
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
i mean i it's entirely plausible um
 

1387
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,789
i mean i it's entirely plausible um
i think i think there's intelligent life

1388
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
i think i think there's intelligent life
 

1389
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,830
i think i think there's intelligent life
on earth

1390
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
on earth
 

1391
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,190
on earth
um and so yeah taking that like say

1392
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
um and so yeah taking that like say
 

1393
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,830
um and so yeah taking that like say
whatever this thing we got on earth

1394
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
whatever this thing we got on earth
 

1395
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,750
whatever this thing we got on earth
whether it's dolphins or humans

1396
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
whether it's dolphins or humans
 

1397
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,909
whether it's dolphins or humans
say that's intelligent definitely

1398
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
say that's intelligent definitely
 

1399
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,950
say that's intelligent definitely
dolphins

1400
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
dolphins
 

1401
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,789
dolphins
i mean have you seen the dolphins

1402
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
i mean have you seen the dolphins
 

1403
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,630
i mean have you seen the dolphins
well they do some cruel stuff to each

1404
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
well they do some cruel stuff to each
 

1405
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,190
well they do some cruel stuff to each
other so if cruelty

1406
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
other so if cruelty
 

1407
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,029
other so if cruelty
is uh is the definition of intelligence

1408
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
is uh is the definition of intelligence
 

1409
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,789
is uh is the definition of intelligence
that they're pretty good yeah and then

1410
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
that they're pretty good yeah and then
 

1411
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,230
that they're pretty good yeah and then
humans are pretty good on that

1412
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
humans are pretty good on that
 

1413
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,830
humans are pretty good on that
regard then there's like uh uh pigs

1414
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
regard then there's like uh uh pigs
 

1415
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,750
regard then there's like uh uh pigs
are very intelligent i got actually a

1416
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
are very intelligent i got actually a
 

1417
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,830
are very intelligent i got actually a
chance to hang out with pigs recently

1418
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
chance to hang out with pigs recently
 

1419
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,990
chance to hang out with pigs recently
and they're um aside from the fact

1420
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
and they're um aside from the fact
 

1421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,110
and they're um aside from the fact
they're trying to

1422
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
they're trying to
 

1423
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,630
they're trying to
eat me they're very uh

1424
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
eat me they're very uh
 

1425
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,630
eat me they're very uh
they're very they love food they love

1426
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
they're very they love food they love
 

1427
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,990
they're very they love food they love
food but there's an intelligence to

1428
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
food but there's an intelligence to
 

1429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,590
food but there's an intelligence to
their eyes that was kind of

1430
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
their eyes that was kind of
 

1431
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,710
their eyes that was kind of
uh like haunts me because i also

1432
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
uh like haunts me because i also
 

1433
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,669
uh like haunts me because i also
love to eat meat and then to to me the

1434
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
love to eat meat and then to to me the
 

1435
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,310
love to eat meat and then to to me the
thing

1436
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
thing
 

1437
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,070
thing
i later ate and i was very intelligent

1438
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
i later ate and i was very intelligent
 

1439
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,070
i later ate and i was very intelligent
and uh almost charismatic with the way

1440
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
and uh almost charismatic with the way
 

1441
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,430
and uh almost charismatic with the way
it was expressing its uh

1442
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
it was expressing its uh
 

1443
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,390
it was expressing its uh
himself herself itself was uh was quite

1444
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
himself herself itself was uh was quite
 

1445
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,269
himself herself itself was uh was quite
incredible

1446
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
incredible
 

1447
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,350
incredible
so and all that to say is if we have

1448
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
so and all that to say is if we have
 

1449
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,870
so and all that to say is if we have
intelligent life here on earth if we

1450
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
intelligent life here on earth if we
 

1451
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,390
intelligent life here on earth if we
take dolphins pigs

1452
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
take dolphins pigs
 

1453
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,549
take dolphins pigs

how unique is earth okay so earth is not

um it's probably a

1466
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
um it's probably a
 

1467
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,630
um it's probably a
something on the order of maybe a one

1468
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
something on the order of maybe a one

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
and by earth i mean it's not just an
 

1473

earth mass planet
 

1475
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,830

okay i mean the architecture of the

1476
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
okay i mean the architecture of the
 

1477
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,950
okay i mean the architecture of the
solar system

1478
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960

1479
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,149

uh and this is this is pretty crucial uh
 

1489
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,430
uh and this is this is pretty crucial uh
right it's that the

right it's that the
 

1491
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,950
right it's that the
earth itself formed well after

1492

earth itself formed well after
 

1493

start out
 

1501
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,669
start out
with you know the star and then a disc

with you know the star and then a disc
 

1503
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,510
with you know the star and then a disc

of gas and dust that encircles it
 

1505
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,830

that
 

1529

1531
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,110
earth took about 100 million years to

form so we missed that
 

1533
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,750

you know train so to speak to get that

1534
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760

that's why actually we can see the sky

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
that's why actually we can see the sky
 

1539
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,510
that's why actually we can see the sky
right that's why the

right that's why the
 

1541
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,789
right that's why the
sky is uh well at least in most places

1542
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
sky is uh well at least in most places

that's why the
 

1545
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,830
that's why the

um
 

1549
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,549
um
with that you know kind of thinking in

mind i
 

1553
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,630
mind i
i would argue that we're getting the

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
i would argue that we're getting the
 

1555
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,470
i would argue that we're getting the

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
right we there's sort of the sci-fi view
 

1563
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,870
right we there's sort of the sci-fi view

and we just land on random planets and
 

1567
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,710
and we just land on random planets and
they're all earth-like that's totally

is is that the same processes of planet

1646
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
is is that the same processes of planet
 

1647
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,389
is is that the same processes of planet
formation that occurred

1648
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
formation that occurred
 

1649
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,710
formation that occurred
everywhere else also occurred in the

1650
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
everywhere else also occurred in the
 

1651
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,630
everywhere else also occurred in the
solar system

1652
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
solar system
 

1653
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,470
solar system
following this logic it's not

1654
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
following this logic it's not
 

1655
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,310
following this logic it's not
implausible to imagine that the solar

1656
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
implausible to imagine that the solar
 

1657
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,070
implausible to imagine that the solar
system once possessed

1658
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
system once possessed
 

1659
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,149
system once possessed
a system of intra mercurian

1660
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
a system of intra mercurian
 

1661
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,669
a system of intra mercurian
like you know compact system of

1662
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
like you know compact system of
 

1663
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,389
like you know compact system of
of planets so then we asked ourselves

1664
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
of planets so then we asked ourselves
 

1665
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:30,789
of planets so then we asked ourselves
would

1666
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
would
 

1667
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,510
would
such a system survive to this day and

1668
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
such a system survive to this day and
 

1669
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,950
such a system survive to this day and
the answer is no

1670
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
the answer is no
 

1671
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,830
the answer is no
uh at least our calculations um suggest

1672
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
uh at least our calculations um suggest
 

1673
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,149
uh at least our calculations um suggest
it's highly unlikely because of the

00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
it's highly unlikely because of the
 

1675
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,510
it's highly unlikely because of the
formation of jupiter

1676
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
formation of jupiter
 

1677
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,190
formation of jupiter
and jupiter's primordial kind of

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
and jupiter's primordial kind of
 

1679
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,870
and jupiter's primordial kind of
wandering through the solar system

1680
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
wandering through the solar system
 

1681
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,350
wandering through the solar system
would have sent this collisional field

1682
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
would have sent this collisional field
 

1683
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,110
would have sent this collisional field
of debris that would have pushed

of debris that would have pushed
 

1685
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,590
of debris that would have pushed
that system of planets onto the sun so

1686
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
that system of planets onto the sun so
 

1687
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,470
that system of planets onto the sun so
was jupiter

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
this primordial wandering what did what
 

1691
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,389
this primordial wandering what did what
did jupiter look like

did jupiter look like
 

1693
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,470
did jupiter look like
like why was it wandering it didn't have

1694
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
like why was it wandering it didn't have
 

1695
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,149

the reason they migrate is you know on a
 

1705
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,590
the reason they migrate is you know on a
detailed level perhaps

difficult to explain but you know if
 

1709
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,549
difficult to explain but you know if
just in a qualitative sense

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,149
just in a qualitative sense
they form in this fluid disk

they form in this fluid disk
of gas and dust so it's kind of like if

really a good analogy because it's not
like jupiter is being

like jupiter is being
 

1729

here complicates things a lot right
 

1747
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,669
here complicates things a lot right
because it's you have to

jupiter forms its orbit shrinks and then

1766
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
jupiter forms its orbit shrinks and then
 

1767
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,990
jupiter forms its orbit shrinks and then
once saturn forms

1768
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
once saturn forms
 

1769
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,310
once saturn forms
its orbit catches up basically to the

1770
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
its orbit catches up basically to the
 

1771
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,630
its orbit catches up basically to the
orbit of jupiter and then both come out

1772
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
orbit of jupiter and then both come out
 

1773
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,630
orbit of jupiter and then both come out
so there's this inward outward pattern

1774
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
so there's this inward outward pattern
 

1775
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,990
so there's this inward outward pattern
of jupiter's

you form the terrestrial planets where

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,230
you form the terrestrial planets where

would they come from in that case so
 

1805
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,509
would they come from in that case so
so jupiter clears out the space and then

1806

so jupiter clears out the space and then
 

1807
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,430
so jupiter clears out the space and then
there's a a few terrestrial planets that

there's a a few terrestrial planets that
 

1809
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,669
there's a a few terrestrial planets that
come in and those coming from

1810
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
come in and those coming from
 

1811
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,470
come in and those coming from
the from the disk somewhere like one of

1812
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
the from the disk somewhere like one of
 

1813
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,350
the from the disk somewhere like one of
the larger

1814
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
the larger
 

1815
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,269
the larger
yeah what actually happens in these

1816
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
yeah what actually happens in these
 

1817
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,669
yeah what actually happens in these
calculations is you leave behind

1818
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
calculations is you leave behind
 

1819
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,029
calculations is you leave behind
a rather mass depleted like

1820
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
a rather mass depleted like
 

1821
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,310
a rather mass depleted like
remnant remnant disk only a couple earth

1822
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
remnant remnant disk only a couple earth
 

1823
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,269
remnant remnant disk only a couple earth
masses

1824
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:23,279
masses
 

1825
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,630
masses
so then from that

1826
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
so then from that
 

1827
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,070
so then from that
remnant population annulus of material

1828
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
remnant population annulus of material
 

1829
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,950
remnant population annulus of material
over 100 or about 100 million years by

1830
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:32,960
over 100 or about 100 million years by
 

1831
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,149
over 100 or about 100 million years by
just collisions

1832
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
just collisions
 

1833
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,389
just collisions
you grow the earth and the moon and

1834
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
you grow the earth and the moon and
 

1835
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,389
you grow the earth and the moon and
everything else you said amulous

1836
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
everything else you said amulous
 

1837
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,870
everything else you said amulous
annulus and yours annulus yeah that's a

1838
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
annulus and yours annulus yeah that's a
 

1839
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,230
annulus and yours annulus yeah that's a
beautiful word what does that mean

1840
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,240
beautiful word what does that mean
 

1841
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,830
beautiful word what does that mean
well it's like it's like a disc that's

1842
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
well it's like it's like a disc that's
 

1843
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,669
well it's like it's like a disc that's
kind of thin it's like a

1844
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679
kind of thin it's like a
 

1845
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,789
kind of thin it's like a
yeah it's something that is you know a

1846
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
yeah it's something that is you know a
 

1847
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,630
yeah it's something that is you know a
disc that's so thin it's almost

1848
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
disc that's so thin it's almost
 

1849

00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
i was gonna say this reminds me lord of
 

1853
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,669
i was gonna say this reminds me lord of
the rings so like this the word just

1854
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
the rings so like this the word just
 

1855
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,590
the rings so like this the word just
feels like it belongs in a toll canal

1856
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
feels like it belongs in a toll canal
 

1857
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,870

okay uh

1858
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
okay uh
 

1859
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,430
okay uh
so that that's incredible and so that in

1860
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
so that that's incredible and so that in
 

1861
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,190
so that that's incredible and so that in
your senses you said like one percent

1862
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
your senses you said like one percent
 

1863
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,389
your senses you said like one percent
that's a rare

1864

that's a rare
 

1865
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,070
that's a rare
the way jupiter and saturn danced and

1866
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
the way jupiter and saturn danced and
 

1867
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,830
the way jupiter and saturn danced and
cleared out and you know cleared out the

1868
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
cleared out and you know cleared out the
 

1869
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,110
cleared out and you know cleared out the
the the short period debris and then

1870
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
the the short period debris and then
 

1871
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,549
the the short period debris and then
changed the gravitational landscape

1872
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
changed the gravitational landscape
 

1873
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,149
changed the gravitational landscape
that's a pretty rare thing too

1874
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
that's a pretty rare thing too
 

1875
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,950
that's a pretty rare thing too
it's rare and moreover like you don't

1876
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
it's rare and moreover like you don't
 

1877
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,950
it's rare and moreover like you don't
have to go to our calculations you can

1878
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
have to go to our calculations you can
 

1879
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,269
have to go to our calculations you can
just

1880
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
just
 

1881
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,549
just
ask the night sky how many stars

1882
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
ask the night sky how many stars
 

1883

around only 10

1890
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:35,039
around only 10
 

1891
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,029
around only 10
of sun-mic stars so they are they

1892
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
of sun-mic stars so they are they
 

1893
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,389
of sun-mic stars so they are they
themselves like you kind of have to

then earth pops up
 

1967
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,109
then earth pops up
like that whole thing and then be able

to do that

1970
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,320
to do that
 

1971
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,670
to do that
for every other system

1972
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
for every other system
 

1973
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,150
for every other system
in the uh every other star in the galaxy

1974
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
in the uh every other star in the galaxy
 

1975
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,030
in the uh every other star in the galaxy
and then

1976
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,040
and then
 

1977
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,750
and then
be able to do that for other galaxies as

1978
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
be able to do that for other galaxies as
 

1979
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,430
be able to do that for other galaxies as
well

1980
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
well
 

1981
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,910
well
um yeah so look maybe start from the

1982
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
um yeah so look maybe start from the
 

1983
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,270
um yeah so look maybe start from the
smallest simulation

1984
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
smallest simulation
 

1985
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,349
smallest simulation
like what is actually being done today i

1986
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
like what is actually being done today i
 

1987
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,870
like what is actually being done today i
mean even the smallest simulation is

1988
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
mean even the smallest simulation is
 

1989
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,230
mean even the smallest simulation is
probably super super difficult

1990
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
probably super super difficult
 

1991
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,150
probably super super difficult
even just like one object in the kuiper

1992
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
even just like one object in the kuiper
 

1993
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,510
even just like one object in the kuiper
belt is probably super difficult to

1994
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
belt is probably super difficult to
 

1995
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,230
belt is probably super difficult to
simulate

1996
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
simulate
 

1997
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,630
simulate
i mean i think it's super easy i mean

1998
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
i mean i think it's super easy i mean
 

1999
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,589
i mean i think it's super easy i mean
like it's

2000
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
like it's
 

2001
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,349
like it's
it's just not that hard um but um

2002
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
it's just not that hard um but um
 

2003
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,910
it's just not that hard um but um
you know let's let's ask the most kind

2004
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
you know let's let's ask the most kind
 

2005
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,470
you know let's let's ask the most kind
of

2006
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,480
of
 

2007
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,030
of
basic problem okay so the problem of

2008
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
basic problem okay so the problem of
 

2009
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,990
basic problem okay so the problem of
having a star

2010
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
having a star
 

2011
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,190
having a star
and something in orbit of it that you

2012
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
and something in orbit of it that you
 

2013
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,550
and something in orbit of it that you
don't need a simulation for like

2014
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
don't need a simulation for like
 

2015
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,069
don't need a simulation for like
you can just write that down on a piece

2016
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
you can just write that down on a piece
 

2017
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,470
you can just write that down on a piece
of paper this gravity

2018
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
of paper this gravity
 

2019
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,230
of paper this gravity
would like yeah i guess i guess it's

2020
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
would like yeah i guess i guess it's
 

2021
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,390
would like yeah i guess i guess it's
important to try to

2022
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
important to try to
 

2023
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,670
important to try to
uh you know one way to simulate objects

2024
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
uh you know one way to simulate objects
 

2025
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,190
uh you know one way to simulate objects
in our solar system is to build the

2026
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
in our solar system is to build the
 

2027
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,030
in our solar system is to build the
universe from scratch okay

2028
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
universe from scratch okay
 

2029
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,630
universe from scratch okay
we'll get to building the universe from

2030
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
we'll get to building the universe from
 

2031
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,790
we'll get to building the universe from
scratch in a sec um but let me just kind

2032
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:54,800
scratch in a sec um but let me just kind
 

2033
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,630
scratch in a sec um but let me just kind
of go through the hierarchy of

2034
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
of go through the hierarchy of
 

2035
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,430
of go through the hierarchy of
what you know what we do two objects two

2036
00:35:59,430 --> 00:35:59,440
what you know what we do two objects two
 

2037
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,470
what you know what we do two objects two
objects

2038
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
objects
 

2039
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,270
objects
analytically solvable like we can figure

2040
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,280
analytically solvable like we can figure
 

2041
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,670
analytically solvable like we can figure
it out

2042
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
it out
 

2043
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,750
it out
very easily if you just you don't i

2044
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
very easily if you just you don't i
 

2045
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,270
very easily if you just you don't i
don't think you yeah you don't need to

2046
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
don't think you yeah you don't need to
 

2047
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,310
don't think you yeah you don't need to
know calculus

2048
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
know calculus
 

2049
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,069
know calculus
uh it helps to know calculus but you

2050
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
uh it helps to know calculus but you
 

2051
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,470
uh it helps to know calculus but you
don't necessarily need to know calculus

2052
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
don't necessarily need to know calculus
 

2053
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,470
don't necessarily need to know calculus
um three objects that are

2054
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
um three objects that are
 

2055
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,589
um three objects that are

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,069
doesn't matter
how many simulations you do you the

2062
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:22,079
how many simulations you do you the
 

2063
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,910
how many simulations you do you the
answer loses meaning after

2064
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
answer loses meaning after
 

2065
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,310
answer loses meaning after
um after some time i feel like that is a

2066
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
um after some time i feel like that is a
 

2067
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,150
um after some time i feel like that is a
metaphor for dating as well but go on

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160

 

2069
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,430

now look yes yeah so so

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
now look yes yeah so so

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,150
now look yes yeah so so

actually like literally simulating the

2106
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
actually like literally simulating the
 

2107
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,950
actually like literally simulating the
objects as a hopeless pursuit

2108
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
objects as a hopeless pursuit
 

2109

once it increases beyond three the

2110
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
once it increases beyond three the
 

2111
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,230
once it increases beyond three the
simulating them is not a hopeless

2112
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
simulating them is not a hopeless
 

2113
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,670
simulating them is not a hopeless
pursuit but the

2114
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
pursuit but the
 

2115
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,069
pursuit but the
outcome becomes a statistical one

2116
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,079
outcome becomes a statistical one
 

2117
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,750

and what's actually quite interesting is

2118
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
and what's actually quite interesting is
 

2119
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,670
and what's actually quite interesting is
i think we have

2120
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
i think we have
 

2121
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,950
i think we have
all the equations uh figured out

2122
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:32,960
all the equations uh figured out
 

2123
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,750
all the equations uh figured out
right like you know in order to really

2124
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
right like you know in order to really
 

2125
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,870
right like you know in order to really
understand this

2126
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:36,880
understand this

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,950
understand this
the formation of the the solar system it

like

2134
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,480
like
 

2135
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,710
like
the combination of uh maxwell's

2136
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
the combination of uh maxwell's
 

2137
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,510
the combination of uh maxwell's
equations and

2138
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
equations and
 

2139
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,510
equations and
you know navier-stokes equations for the

2140
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
you know navier-stokes equations for the
 

2141
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,270
you know navier-stokes equations for the
fluids you need to know quantum

2142
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
fluids you need to know quantum
 

2143
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,109
fluids you need to know quantum
mechanics to understand

2144
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
mechanics to understand
 

2145
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,030
mechanics to understand
opacities and and so on but we have

2146
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
opacities and and so on but we have
 

2147
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,670
opacities and and so on but we have
those equations in hand it's not that we

2148
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
those equations in hand it's not that we
 

2149
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,069
those equations in hand it's not that we
don't

2150
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
don't
 

2151
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,750
don't
have that understanding it's that

2152
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
have that understanding it's that
 

2153
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,150
have that understanding it's that
putting it all together

2154
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,160
putting it all together
 

2155
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,349
putting it all together
is a very very difficult and b if you

2156
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
is a very very difficult and b if you
 

2157
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,630
is a very very difficult and b if you
were to run

2158
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
were to run
 

2159
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,750
were to run

00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
why planetary systems are so diverse you
 

2177
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,630
why planetary systems are so diverse you
don't

path

2182
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:33,920
path
 

2183
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,710
path
for you start with a disk of this mass

2184
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
for you start with a disk of this mass
 

2185
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,670
for you start with a disk of this mass
and

2186
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
and
 

2187
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,829
and
it's around this star therefore you're

2188
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:39,839
it's around this star therefore you're
 

2189
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,750
it's around this star therefore you're
going to form the solar system

2190
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
going to form the solar system
 

2191
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,670
going to form the solar system
right you start with this and therefore

2192
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
right you start with this and therefore
 

2193
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,270
right you start with this and therefore
you will conform this huge

2194
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280
you will conform this huge
 

2195
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,910
you will conform this huge
outcome a huge set of outcomes and some

2196
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
outcome a huge set of outcomes and some
 

2197
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,190
outcome a huge set of outcomes and some
percentage of it

2198
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,200
percentage of it
 

2199
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,790
percentage of it
will resemble the solar system you

2200
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
will resemble the solar system you
 

2201
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,470
will resemble the solar system you
mentioned quantum mechanics and

2202
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
mentioned quantum mechanics and
 

2203
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,390
mentioned quantum mechanics and
we're talking about cosmic scale

2204
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
we're talking about cosmic scale
 

2205
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,870
we're talking about cosmic scale
objects you've talked about that the

2206
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:58,880
objects you've talked about that the
 

2207
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,030
objects you've talked about that the
evolution of astrophysical disks can be

2208
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
evolution of astrophysical disks can be
 

2209
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,829
evolution of astrophysical disks can be
modeled with

2210
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
modeled with
 

2211
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,069
modeled with
uh schroedinger's equation i sure did

2212
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:06,079
uh schroedinger's equation i sure did
 

2213
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,349
uh schroedinger's equation i sure did
why it's like how does quantum mechanics

2214
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
why it's like how does quantum mechanics
 

2215
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,630
why it's like how does quantum mechanics
uh become relevant at when you

2216
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
uh become relevant at when you
 

2217
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,630
uh become relevant at when you
consider the evolution of objects in the

2218
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
consider the evolution of objects in the
 

2219
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,150
consider the evolution of objects in the
solar system yeah

2220
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
solar system yeah
 

2221
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,990
solar system yeah
well let me take a take a step back and

2222
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
well let me take a take a step back and
 

2223
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,829
well let me take a take a step back and
just say like i remember

2224
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
just say like i remember
 

2225
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,750
just say like i remember
being you know utterly confused

2226
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
being you know utterly confused
 

2227
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,510
being you know utterly confused
by quantum mechanics when i first

2228
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
by quantum mechanics when i first
 

2229
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,030
by quantum mechanics when i first
learned it and

2230
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,040
learned it and
 

2231
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,190
learned it and
the schrodinger equation which is kind

2232
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,200
the schrodinger equation which is kind
 

2233
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,630
the schrodinger equation which is kind
of the parent equation

2234
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
of the parent equation
 

2235
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,589
of the parent equation
of of that whole field you know seems to

2236
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:33,599
of of that whole field you know seems to
 

2237
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,790
of of that whole field you know seems to
come out of nowhere

2238
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
come out of nowhere
 

2239
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,510
come out of nowhere
right the way that the way that i was

2240
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
right the way that the way that i was
 

2241
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,990
right the way that the way that i was
sort of explaining it i remember asking

2242
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
sort of explaining it i remember asking
 

2243
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,829
sort of explaining it i remember asking
you know my professor is like but where

2244
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
you know my professor is like but where
 

2245
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,910
you know my professor is like but where
does it come from is that like well just

2246
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
does it come from is that like well just
 

2247
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,150
does it come from is that like well just
just like don't worry about it and just

2248
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
just like don't worry about it and just
 

2249
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,510
just like don't worry about it and just
like calculate the

2250
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
like calculate the
 

2251
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,630
like calculate the
hydrogen you know energy levels right so

2252
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
hydrogen you know energy levels right so
 

2253
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,310
hydrogen you know energy levels right so
it's like i could do all the problems i

2254
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
it's like i could do all the problems i
 

2255
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,270
it's like i could do all the problems i
just did not have any intuition for

2256
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
just did not have any intuition for
 

2257
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,829
just did not have any intuition for
for where this parent you know super

2258
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
for where this parent you know super
 

2259
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,750
for where this parent you know super
important equation came from

2260
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
important equation came from
 

2261
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,430
important equation came from
now down the line i was remember i was

2262
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
now down the line i was remember i was
 

2263
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,510
now down the line i was remember i was
preparing for my own

2264
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
preparing for my own
 

2265
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,430
preparing for my own
lecture and i was trying to understand

2266
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
lecture and i was trying to understand
 

2267
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,510
lecture and i was trying to understand
how waves

2268
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,520
how waves
 

2269
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,750
how waves
travel in self-gravitating discs so

2270
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
travel in self-gravitating discs so
 

2271
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,109
travel in self-gravitating discs so
you know again there's a very broad

2272
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:15,119
you know again there's a very broad
 

2273
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,790
you know again there's a very broad
theory that's already developed but i

2274
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
theory that's already developed but i
 

2275
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,630
theory that's already developed but i
was looking for some simpler

2276
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,640
was looking for some simpler
 

2277
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,630
was looking for some simpler
way to explain it really for the

2278
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
way to explain it really for the
 

2279
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,470
way to explain it really for the
purposes of teaching class

2280
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
purposes of teaching class
 

2281
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,510
purposes of teaching class
and so i i thought okay what if i just

2282
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
and so i i thought okay what if i just
 

2283
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,030
and so i i thought okay what if i just
imagine a disc as an infinite uh

2284
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
imagine a disc as an infinite uh
 

2285
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,510
imagine a disc as an infinite uh
number of concentric circles right that

2286
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
number of concentric circles right that
 

2287
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,870
number of concentric circles right that
interact with

2288
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
interact with
 

2289
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,150
interact with
the with each other gravitationally

2290
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
the with each other gravitationally
 

2291
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,589
the with each other gravitationally
that's a problem in some sense that um

2292
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
that's a problem in some sense that um
 

2293
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,790
that's a problem in some sense that um
i can solve using methods from like the

2294
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
i can solve using methods from like the
 

2295
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,230
i can solve using methods from like the
late 1700s right so i can write down

2296
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,240
late 1700s right so i can write down
 

2297
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,069
late 1700s right so i can write down
hamiltonian well i can write down the

2298
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
hamiltonian well i can write down the
 

2299
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,829
hamiltonian well i can write down the
energy function basically of their

2300
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839
energy function basically of their
 

2301
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,790
energy function basically of their
their interactions and what i

2302
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
their interactions and what i
 

2303
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,230
their interactions and what i
found is that when you take the

2304
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
found is that when you take the
 

2305
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,150
found is that when you take the
continuum limit when you

2306
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
continuum limit when you
 

2307
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,309
continuum limit when you
go from discrete circles that are

2308
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:00,319
go from discrete circles that are
 

2309
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,230
go from discrete circles that are
talking to each other gravitationally to

2310
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,240
talking to each other gravitationally to
 

2311
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,950
talking to each other gravitationally to
a

2312
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
a
 

2313
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,990
a
continuum disk suddenly

2314
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
continuum disk suddenly
 

2315
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,950
continuum disk suddenly
this gravitational interaction among

2316
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
this gravitational interaction among
 

2317
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,910
this gravitational interaction among
them

2318
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:09,920
them
 

2319
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,069
them
right the the governing equation becomes

2320
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
right the the governing equation becomes
 

2321
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,829
right the the governing equation becomes
the schrodinger equation

2322
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:13,839
the schrodinger equation
 

2323
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,349
the schrodinger equation
and i had to think about that for a

2324
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
and i had to think about that for a
 

2325
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,750
and i had to think about that for a
little bit did you just unify

2326
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
little bit did you just unify
 

2327
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,309
little bit did you just unify
quantum mechanics and gravity no this is

2328
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
quantum mechanics and gravity no this is
 

2329
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,230
quantum mechanics and gravity no this is
not the same thing as like

2330
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
not the same thing as like
 

2331
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,230
not the same thing as like
you know fusing relativity and quantum

2332
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,240
you know fusing relativity and quantum
 

2333
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,430
you know fusing relativity and quantum
mechanics

2334
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
mechanics
 

2335
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,790
mechanics
but it did uh it did get me thinking a

2336
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
but it did uh it did get me thinking a
 

2337
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,349
but it did uh it did get me thinking a
little bit

2338
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
little bit
 

2339
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,790
little bit
so the fact that waves in astrophysical

2340
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:32,800
so the fact that waves in astrophysical
 

2341
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,829
so the fact that waves in astrophysical
disks

2342
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:33,839
disks
 

2343
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,030
disks
behave just like wave functions of

2344
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
behave just like wave functions of
 

2345
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,270
behave just like wave functions of
of particles kind of like an interesting

2346
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
of particles kind of like an interesting
 

2347
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,589
of particles kind of like an interesting
analogy because for me it's easier to

2348
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:41,599
analogy because for me it's easier to
 

2349
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,190
analogy because for me it's easier to
imagine waves traveling through you know

2350
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
imagine waves traveling through you know
 

2351
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,790
imagine waves traveling through you know
astrophysical disks or really just

2352
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
astrophysical disks or really just
 

2353
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,950
astrophysical disks or really just
sheets of paper and

2354
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
sheets of paper and
 

2355
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,950
sheets of paper and
the reason this is that analogy exists

2356
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
the reason this is that analogy exists
 

2357
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,390
the reason this is that analogy exists
is because there's actually nothing

2358
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
is because there's actually nothing
 

2359
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,030
is because there's actually nothing
quantum about the schrodinger equation

2360
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
quantum about the schrodinger equation
 

2361
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,309
quantum about the schrodinger equation
the schrodinger equation

2362
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
the schrodinger equation
 

2363
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,430
the schrodinger equation
is just a wave equation

2364
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
is just a wave equation
 

2365
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,069
is just a wave equation
and all of the interpretation that comes

2366
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
and all of the interpretation that comes
 

2367
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,109
and all of the interpretation that comes
from it

2368
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,119
from it
 

2369
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,550
from it
is quantum but the equation itself

2370
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
is quantum but the equation itself
 

2371
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,910
is quantum but the equation itself
is not a quantum being so you can use it

2372
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
is not a quantum being so you can use it
 

2373
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,550
is not a quantum being so you can use it
to model

2374
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
to model
 

2375
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,030
to model
waves it's way it's not turtles it's

2376
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
waves it's way it's not turtles it's
 

2377
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,990
waves it's way it's not turtles it's
waves all the way down

2378
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
waves all the way down
 

2379
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,990
waves all the way down
you can pick which level you pick the

2380
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
you can pick which level you pick the
 

2381
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,069
you can pick which level you pick the
wave at and so it could be at the solar

2382
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:20,079
wave at and so it could be at the solar
 

2383
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,910
wave at and so it could be at the solar
system level that you can use right

2384
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
system level that you can use right
 

2385
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,990
system level that you can use right
and also it actually provides a pretty

2386
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
and also it actually provides a pretty
 

2387
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,430
and also it actually provides a pretty
neat calculational tool

2388
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
neat calculational tool
 

2389
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,190
neat calculational tool
because um it's it's difficult so we

2390
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
because um it's it's difficult so we
 

2391
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,710
because um it's it's difficult so we
just talked about simulations but it's

2392
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
just talked about simulations but it's
 

2393
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,230
just talked about simulations but it's
difficult to simulate

2394
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
difficult to simulate
 

2395
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,109
difficult to simulate
the behavior of astrophysical disks on

2396
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:35,119
the behavior of astrophysical disks on
 

2397
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,470
the behavior of astrophysical disks on
time scales

2398
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
time scales
 

2399
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,069
time scales
that are in between a few orbits

2400
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
that are in between a few orbits
 

2401
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,270
that are in between a few orbits
and their entire evolution so it's

2402
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280
and their entire evolution so it's
 

2403
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,510
and their entire evolution so it's
over a time scale of a few orbits you

2404
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
over a time scale of a few orbits you
 

2405
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,589
over a time scale of a few orbits you
have you do a hydrodynamic you know

2406
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
have you do a hydrodynamic you know
 

2407
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,870
have you do a hydrodynamic you know
simulation

2408

simulation
 

2409
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,150
simulation
right you do that basically that's

2410
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
right you do that basically that's
 

2411
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,190
right you do that basically that's
something that you can do

2412
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
something that you can do
 

2413
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,190
something that you can do
on a modern computer on a time scale of

2414
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
on a modern computer on a time scale of
 

2415
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,470
on a modern computer on a time scale of
say a week

2416
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,480
say a week
 

2417
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,710
say a week
when it comes to their evolution over

2418
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
when it comes to their evolution over
 

2419
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,870
when it comes to their evolution over
their entire lifetime you don't hope to

2420
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
their entire lifetime you don't hope to
 

2421
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,710
their entire lifetime you don't hope to
resolve the orbits you just kind of

2422
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
resolve the orbits you just kind of
 

2423
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,910
resolve the orbits you just kind of
hope to understand how the system

2424
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
hope to understand how the system
 

2425
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,309
hope to understand how the system
behaves in between

2426
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
behaves in between
 

2427
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,950
behaves in between
right you to get access to that as it

2428
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
right you to get access to that as it
 

2429
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,910
right you to get access to that as it
turns out it's pretty

2430
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:09,920
turns out it's pretty
 

2431
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,630
turns out it's pretty
um it's pretty cute you can use uh you

2432
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
um it's pretty cute you can use uh you
 

2433
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,230
um it's pretty cute you can use uh you
can use the schrodinger equation to get

2434
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
can use the schrodinger equation to get
 

2435
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,270
can use the schrodinger equation to get
the answer

2436
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,280
the answer
 

2437
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,349
the answer
rapidly so it's a calculational tool

2438
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
rapidly so it's a calculational tool
 

2439
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,630
rapidly so it's a calculational tool
that's fascinating by the way the

2440
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
that's fascinating by the way the
 

2441
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,230
that's fascinating by the way the
astrophysical disks how what are they

2442
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
astrophysical disks how what are they
 

2443
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,309
astrophysical disks how what are they
how broad is this definition okay so

2444
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
how broad is this definition okay so
 

2445
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,109
how broad is this definition okay so
astrophysical disks span

2446
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
astrophysical disks span
 

2447
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,109
astrophysical disks span
a huge uh huge amount of ranges

2448
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
a huge uh huge amount of ranges
 

2449
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,589
a huge uh huge amount of ranges
they start maybe at the smallest scale

2450
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
they start maybe at the smallest scale
 

2451
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,270
they start maybe at the smallest scale
they start with actually kuiper belt

00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
they start with actually kuiper belt
 

2453
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,030
they start with actually kuiper belt
objects some kuiper belt objects have

2454
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,950
rings
so that's maybe the smallest example of

2458
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
so that's maybe the smallest example of
 

2459
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,150
so that's maybe the smallest example of
an astrophysical disc

2460
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
an astrophysical disc
 

2461
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,309
an astrophysical disc
we've got this little potato shaped

2462
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
we've got this little potato shaped
 

2463
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,349
we've got this little potato shaped
asteroid

2464
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359
asteroid
 

2465
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,510
asteroid
you know which is you know sort of the

2466
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
you know which is you know sort of the
 

2467
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,990
you know which is you know sort of the
size of la or something and around it

2468
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,000
size of la or something and around it
 

2469
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,990
size of la or something and around it
is are some rings of icy matter that

2470
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
is are some rings of icy matter that
 

2471
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,790
is are some rings of icy matter that
object is a small astrophysical disk

2472
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
object is a small astrophysical disk
 

2473
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,589
object is a small astrophysical disk
then you have

2474
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
then you have
 

2475
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,630
then you have
saturn the rings of saturn you have the

2476
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:00,640
saturn the rings of saturn you have the
 

2477
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,990
saturn the rings of saturn you have the
next set of scale you have the solar

2478
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
next set of scale you have the solar
 

2479
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,750
next set of scale you have the solar
system itself when it was forming you

2480
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
system itself when it was forming you
 

2481
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,069
system itself when it was forming you
have

2482
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
have
 

2483
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,349
have
this then you have black hole discs

2484
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
this then you have black hole discs
 

2485
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,950
this then you have black hole discs
you have galaxies discs are super common

2486
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:10,960
you have galaxies discs are super common
 

2487
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,990
you have galaxies discs are super common
in the universe

2488
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
in the universe
 

2489
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,349
in the universe
and the reason is that stuff rotates

2490
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
and the reason is that stuff rotates
 

2491
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,829
and the reason is that stuff rotates
right i mean gravity works yeah so uh

2492
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
right i mean gravity works yeah so uh
 

2493
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,230
right i mean gravity works yeah so uh
and those rings could be the material

2494
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,240
and those rings could be the material
 

2495
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,990
and those rings could be the material
that uh composes those rings could be

2496
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,000
that uh composes those rings could be
 

2497
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,069
that uh composes those rings could be
it could be gas it could be solid it

2498
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
it could be gas it could be solid it
 

2499
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,190
it could be gas it could be solid it
could be anything that's right so

2500
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
could be anything that's right so
 

2501
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,230
could be anything that's right so
the disc that made from which the

2502
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
the disc that made from which the
 

2503
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,150
the disc that made from which the
planets emerged was predominantly

2504
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,160
planets emerged was predominantly
 

2505
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,630
planets emerged was predominantly
hydrogen helium gas on the other hand

2506
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
hydrogen helium gas on the other hand
 

2507
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,390
hydrogen helium gas on the other hand
the rings of saturn

2508
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
the rings of saturn
 

2509
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,109
the rings of saturn
are made up of you know icicles ice

2510
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
are made up of you know icicles ice
 

2511
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,950
are made up of you know icicles ice
little like

2512
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
little like
 

2513
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,270
little like
ice cubes this big about a centimeter

2514
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
ice cubes this big about a centimeter
 

2515
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,630
ice cubes this big about a centimeter
across

2516
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
across
 

2517
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,550
across
that sounds refreshing so that's

2518
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
that sounds refreshing so that's
 

2519
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,950
that sounds refreshing so that's
incredible hydrogen helium gas

2520
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:50,960
incredible hydrogen helium gas
 

2521
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,349
incredible hydrogen helium gas
so in the beginning it was just hydrogen

2522
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
so in the beginning it was just hydrogen
 

2523
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,870
so in the beginning it was just hydrogen
and helium

2524
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
and helium
 

2525
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,349
and helium
around the sun how does that lead to the

2526
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
around the sun how does that lead to the
 

2527
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,950
around the sun how does that lead to the
first formations of solid

2528
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
first formations of solid
 

2529
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,470
first formations of solid
objects in terms of simulation okay

2530
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
objects in terms of simulation okay
 

2531
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,430
objects in terms of simulation okay
here's the story um so you're like have

2532
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
here's the story um so you're like have
 

2533
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,670
here's the story um so you're like have
you ever been to the desert

2534
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:07,680
you ever been to the desert
 

2535
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,349
you ever been to the desert
yes i've been to the death valley and

2536
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
yes i've been to the death valley and
 

2537
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,430
yes i've been to the death valley and
actually it was uh terrifying just as

2538
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
actually it was uh terrifying just as
 

2539
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,750
actually it was uh terrifying just as
total tangent i'm distracting you but i

2540
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
total tangent i'm distracting you but i
 

2541
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,790
total tangent i'm distracting you but i
was uh

2542
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
was uh
 

2543
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,069
was uh
driving through it and i was really

2544
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
driving through it and i was really
 

2545
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,230
driving through it and i was really
surprised because it was at first

2546
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
surprised because it was at first
 

2547
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,109
surprised because it was at first
hot and then as it was getting into the

2548
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
hot and then as it was getting into the
 

2549
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,270
hot and then as it was getting into the
evening there's this huge thunderstorm

2550
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
evening there's this huge thunderstorm
 

2551
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,670
evening there's this huge thunderstorm
like

2552
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
like
 

2553
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,910
like
it was raining and it got freezing cold

like what the hell is
 

2557
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,270
like what the hell is
it was the apocalypse yeah i had to like

2558
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:29,280
it was the apocalypse yeah i had to like
 

2559
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,470
it was the apocalypse yeah i had to like
just sit there

2560
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480
just sit there
 

2561
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,670
just sit there
listening to bruce springsteen i

2562
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
listening to bruce springsteen i
 

2563
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,829
listening to bruce springsteen i
remember and just thinking i'm probably

2564
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
remember and just thinking i'm probably
 

2565
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,630
remember and just thinking i'm probably
going to die

2566
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
going to die
 

2567
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,470
going to die
and i was okay with it because bruce

2568
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
and i was okay with it because bruce
 

2569
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,990
and i was okay with it because bruce
springsteen was on the radio look

2570
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
springsteen was on the radio look
 

2571
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,390

yeah so look i mean it's a good line

2576
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
yeah so look i mean it's a good line
 

2577
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,230
yeah so look i mean it's a good line
so i'm sorry that's true um

yeah by the way like to continue on this
tangent i

2582
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
tangent i
 

2583
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,309
tangent i
i absolutely love the southwest for this

2584
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:54,319
i absolutely love the southwest for this
 

2585
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,750
i absolutely love the southwest for this
reason just um you know i know during

2586
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
reason just um you know i know during
 

2587
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,710
reason just um you know i know during
the pandemic i

00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
the pandemic i
 

2589
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,670
the pandemic i
drove from la to new mexico a bunch of

2590
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
drove from la to new mexico a bunch of
 

2591
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,230
drove from la to new mexico a bunch of
times

2592
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,240
times
 

2593
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,190
times
the madness the weather yeah the the the

2594
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
the madness the weather yeah the the the
 

2595
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,069
the madness the weather yeah the the the
chaos of

2596
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
chaos of
 

2597
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,670
chaos of
weather the fact that you know it'll be

2598
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
weather the fact that you know it'll be
 

2599
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,349
weather the fact that you know it'll be
blazing hot one minute and then it's

2600
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359
blazing hot one minute and then it's
 

2601
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,470
blazing hot one minute and then it's
just like

2602
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
just like
 

2603
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,069
just like
we'll decide to have a little

2604
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
we'll decide to have a little
 

2605
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,990
we'll decide to have a little
thunderstorm maybe you'll decide

2606
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
thunderstorm maybe you'll decide
 

2607
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,550
thunderstorm maybe you'll decide
to go back momentarily to like a

2608
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
to go back momentarily to like a
 

2609
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,910
to go back momentarily to like a
thousand degrees and then go back to the

2610
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:17,920
thousand degrees and then go back to the
 

2611
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,950
thousand degrees and then go back to the
thunderstorm

2612
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
thunderstorm
 

2613
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,510
thunderstorm
it's amazing it's it's that by the way

2614
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
it's amazing it's it's that by the way
 

2615
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,510
it's amazing it's it's that by the way
is chaos theory in action yeah

2616
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
is chaos theory in action yeah
 

2617
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,750
is chaos theory in action yeah
right um but let's get back to talking

2618
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
right um but let's get back to talking
 

2619
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,030
right um but let's get back to talking
about the desert yeah

2620
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
about the desert yeah
 

2621
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,069
about the desert yeah
so in the desert um tumbleweeds

2622
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:30,079
so in the desert um tumbleweeds
 

2623
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,309
so in the desert um tumbleweeds
have a tendency to roll because the wind

2624
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
have a tendency to roll because the wind
 

2625
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,349
have a tendency to roll because the wind
rolls them

2626
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:33,359
rolls them
 

2627
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,829
rolls them
and if you're careful you'll

2628
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
and if you're careful you'll
 

2629
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,750
and if you're careful you'll
occasionally see this family of temple

2630
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:37,760
occasionally see this family of temple
 

2631
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,910
occasionally see this family of temple
weeds where like there's like a big one

2632
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
weeds where like there's like a big one
 

2633
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,589
weeds where like there's like a big one
and then there's a bunch of little ones

2634
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:41,599
and then there's a bunch of little ones
 

2635
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,510
and then there's a bunch of little ones
that that kind of hide in its

2636
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
that that kind of hide in its
 

2637
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,829
that that kind of hide in its
wake right and are all rolling together

2638
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
wake right and are all rolling together
 

2639
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,349
wake right and are all rolling together
and still almost looks like

2640
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
and still almost looks like
 

2641
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,109
and still almost looks like
you know a family of ducks crossing a

2642
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
you know a family of ducks crossing a
 

2643
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,390
you know a family of ducks crossing a
street or something

2644
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400
street or something
 

2645
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,829
street or something
um or for example you know

2646
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:53,839
um or for example you know
 

2647
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,069
um or for example you know
if you watch tour de france right you've

2648
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:56,079
if you watch tour de france right you've
 

2649
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,069
if you watch tour de france right you've
got a whole bunch of cyclists and

2650
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
got a whole bunch of cyclists and
 

2651
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,109
got a whole bunch of cyclists and
they're like cycling

2652
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
they're like cycling
 

2653
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,430
they're like cycling
you know within 10 centimeters of each

2654
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:01,440
you know within 10 centimeters of each
 

2655

2657
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,870
other they're not
bffs right yeah but they're not yeah

2658
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
bffs right yeah but they're not yeah

00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
trying to be
 

2661
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,589

00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
trying to write together they are
 

2663
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,670
trying to write together they are
writing together to minimize the

uh you know air resistance if you will

2668
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
uh you know air resistance if you will
 

2669
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,470

that they experience turns out solids in
the protoplanetary disk do

2674
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
the protoplanetary disk do
 

2675
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,670
the protoplanetary disk do
just this there's an instability

2676
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
just this there's an instability
 

2677
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,950
just this there's an instability
wherein solid particles right things

2678

a centimeter across will start to hide
 

2683
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,750
a centimeter across will start to hide
behind one another and form these clouds

2684
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
behind one another and form these clouds
 

2685
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,589
behind one another and form these clouds
why because cumulatively that minimizes

now these clouds because they're kind of

2694
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
now these clouds because they're kind of
 

2695
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,430
now these clouds because they're kind of
a favorable

2696
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
a favorable
 

2697
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,069
a favorable
energetic condition for the dust to live

2698
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
energetic condition for the dust to live
 

2699
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:50,630

in

2700
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
in
 

2701
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,349
in
they grow grow grow grow grow until they

2702
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
they grow grow grow grow grow until they
 

2703
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,950
they grow grow grow grow grow until they
become so massive that they collapse

2704
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
become so massive that they collapse
 

2705
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,549
become so massive that they collapse
under their own weight

2706
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
under their own weight
 

2707
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,790
under their own weight
that's how the first building blocks of

2708
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
that's how the first building blocks of
 

2709
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,390
that's how the first building blocks of
planets form that's how the

2710
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
planets form that's how the
 

2711
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,309
planets form that's how the
big asteroids got there that's

2712
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:02,319
big asteroids got there that's
 

2713
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,990
big asteroids got there that's
incredible yeah so that

2714
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
incredible yeah so that
 

2715
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,150
incredible yeah so that
is that simulatable or is it not useful

2716
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:06,160
is that simulatable or is it not useful
 

2717
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,390
is that simulatable or is it not useful
to simulate no no that's simulatable

2718
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
to simulate no no that's simulatable
 

2719
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,950
to simulate no no that's simulatable
um and people do these types of

2720
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
um and people do these types of
 

2721
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,910
um and people do these types of
calculations

2722
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
calculations
 

2723
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,470
calculations
it's it's really cool that's actually

2724
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
it's it's really cool that's actually
 

2725
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,950
it's it's really cool that's actually
that's

00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
that's
 

2727
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,549
that's
one of the many fields of planet

2728
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
one of the many fields of planet
 

2729
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,950
one of the many fields of planet
formation theory that is really really

2730
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
formation theory that is really really
 

2731
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,589
formation theory that is really really
active

2732
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
active
 

2733
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,630
active
right now people are trying to

2734
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
right now people are trying to
 

2735
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,349
right now people are trying to
understand all kinds of aspects of that

2736
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
understand all kinds of aspects of that
 

2737
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,549
understand all kinds of aspects of that
process because of course

2738
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
process because of course
 

2739
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,790
process because of course
i've explained it you know like as if

2740
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
i've explained it you know like as if
 

2741
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,069
i've explained it you know like as if
there's one

2742
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
there's one
 

2743
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,190
there's one
thing that happens turns out it's a

2744
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
thing that happens turns out it's a
 

2745
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,950
thing that happens turns out it's a
it's a beautifully rich dynamic but the

00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
it's a beautifully rich dynamic but the
 

2747
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,829
it's a beautifully rich dynamic but the

2750
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
building blocks
 

2751
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,549
building blocks
actually follows the same sequence as

2752
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
actually follows the same sequence as
 

2753
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,750
actually follows the same sequence as
formation of stars

2754
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760
formation of stars
 

2755
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,270
formation of stars
right stars are just clouds of gas

2756
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,280
right stars are just clouds of gas
 

2757
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,109
right stars are just clouds of gas
hydrogen helium gas that sit in space

2758
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
hydrogen helium gas that sit in space
 

2759
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,030
hydrogen helium gas that sit in space
and slowly cool and at some point they

2760
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040
and slowly cool and at some point they
 

2761
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,990
and slowly cool and at some point they
you know contract to a point where their

2762
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
you know contract to a point where their
 

2763
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,390
you know contract to a point where their
gravity overtakes the thermal

2764
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
gravity overtakes the thermal
 

2765
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,069
gravity overtakes the thermal
you know pressure support if you will

2766
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
you know pressure support if you will
 

2767
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,670
you know pressure support if you will
and they collapse under their own weight

2768
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
and they collapse under their own weight
 

2769
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,430
and they collapse under their own weight
and you get a little baby solar system

2770
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
and you get a little baby solar system
 

2771
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,270
and you get a little baby solar system
that's amazing so do you think one day

2772
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
that's amazing so do you think one day
 

2773
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,109
that's amazing so do you think one day
it will be possible to

2774
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:07,119
it will be possible to
 

2775
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,390
it will be possible to
simulate the full history

2776
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,400
simulate the full history
 

2777
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,030
simulate the full history
that took our solar system to what it is

2778
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
that took our solar system to what it is
 

2779
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,190
that took our solar system to what it is

so you don't think your story many of

2784
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:20,240
so you don't think your story many of
 

2785
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,990
so you don't think your story many of
the ideas that you have about jupiter

like retelling that story in high

2790
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
like retelling that story in high

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,710
like retelling that story in high
resolution is not that important

some sense a compression
 

2829
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,829
some sense a compression
of information so therefore you must

of information so therefore you must
 

2831
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,270

lose detail

2832
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
lose detail
 

2833
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,790

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,710
how difficult would it be to simulate
our solar system such that we would not

00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
sure is there a nice compressible way of
 

2911
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,069
sure is there a nice compressible way of
doing that or

00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
doing that or
 

2913
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,829
doing that or
just kind of like you intuited with a

2914
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
just kind of like you intuited with a
 

2915
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,990
just kind of like you intuited with a
three body situation

2916
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
three body situation
 

2917
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,150
three body situation
is just a giant mess that you cannot

2918
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
is just a giant mess that you cannot
 

2919
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,069
is just a giant mess that you cannot
create a video game

actually
 

2925
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,030
actually
building it so i'm you know i'm

2926
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
building it so i'm you know i'm
 

2927
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,870
building it so i'm you know i'm
speculating but

2928
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
speculating but
 

2929
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,910
speculating but
one of the yeah i know i know like

2930
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
one of the yeah i know i know like
 

2931
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,670
one of the yeah i know i know like
you have a deep understanding of this

2932
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,680
you have a deep understanding of this
 

2933
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,270
you have a deep understanding of this
but like for me

2934
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
but like for me
 

2935
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,309
but like for me
i'm just gonna like speculate that for

2936
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
i'm just gonna like speculate that for
 

2937
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,829
i'm just gonna like speculate that for
um at least in the types of simulations

2938
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
um at least in the types of simulations
 

2939
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:12,790
um at least in the types of simulations
that we can do

2940
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
that we can do
 

2941
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,750
that we can do
today inevitably you run into the

2942
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:15,760
today inevitably you run into the
 

2943
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,430
today inevitably you run into the
problem of resolution

right you're doesn't matter what you're
 

2947

right you're doesn't matter what you're
doing it is discrete

now um the way you would go

2950
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
now um the way you would go
 

2951
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,630
now um the way you would go
about asking you know if what we're

2952
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
about asking you know if what we're
 

2953
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,790
about asking you know if what we're
observing is that a simulation or

2954
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
observing is that a simulation or
 

2955
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,430
observing is that a simulation or
uh or is that you know some real

2956
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,440
uh or is that you know some real
 

2957
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,470
uh or is that you know some real
continuous

thing uh is you you zoom in right you

2960
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
thing uh is you you zoom in right you
 

2961
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,430
thing uh is you you zoom in right you
zoom in and try and find

2962
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
zoom in and try and find
 

2963
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,270
zoom in and try and find
the you know the grid scale if you will

2964
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,280
the you know the grid scale if you will
 

2965
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,990

um yeah i mean

2966
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,000
um yeah i mean
 

2967
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,230

time
 

3037
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,870

like came in like the 90s and it's been

3038
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
like came in like the 90s and it's been
 

3039
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,870
like came in like the 90s and it's been

00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
just games i mean
 

3043
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,710
just games i mean
it's accelerated i just recently saw

3044
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
it's accelerated i just recently saw
 

3045
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,190
it's accelerated i just recently saw

wow and fortnite were played 140 billion

3048
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
wow and fortnite were played 140 billion
 

3049
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,430
wow and fortnite were played 140 billion
hours

3050
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
hours
 

3051
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,190
hours
and those are just video games yeah and

3052
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
and those are just video games yeah and
 

3053
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,109
and those are just video games yeah and
that's like increasing very very quickly

3054
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
that's like increasing very very quickly
 

3055
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,309
that's like increasing very very quickly
especially with the people

3056
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
especially with the people
 

3057
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,470
especially with the people
coming up now and being born now and

3058
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
coming up now and being born now and
 

3059
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,630
coming up now and being born now and
become you know becoming teenagers

3060
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
become you know becoming teenagers
 

3061
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,230
become you know becoming teenagers
and so on let's have a thought

3062
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
and so on let's have a thought
 

3063
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,910
and so on let's have a thought
experiment where it's just you and a

3064
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:23,920
experiment where it's just you and a
 

3065
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,150
experiment where it's just you and a
video game character inside a room

3066
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
video game character inside a room
 

3067
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,630
video game character inside a room
where you remove the simulation they

3068
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:28,640
where you remove the simulation they
 

3069
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,670
where you remove the simulation they
need to simulate sort of

3070
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,680
need to simulate sort of
 

3071
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,750
need to simulate sort of
a lot of objects if it's just you and

3072
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:33,760
a lot of objects if it's just you and
 

3073
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,069
a lot of objects if it's just you and
that character

3074
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
that character
 

3075
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,710
that character
how far do you need to simulate in terms

3076
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:38,720
how far do you need to simulate in terms
 

3077
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,589
how far do you need to simulate in terms
of zooming in

3078
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
of zooming in
 

3079
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,870
of zooming in
for it to be very real to you as real as

3080
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:42,880
for it to be very real to you as real as
 

3081
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,670
for it to be very real to you as real as
reality

3082
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
reality
 

3083
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,829

so like first of all you kind of

3084
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
so like first of all you kind of
 

3085
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,030
so like first of all you kind of
mentioned zooming in which is

3086
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
mentioned zooming in which is
 

3087
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,470
mentioned zooming in which is
fascinating because

3088
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
fascinating because
 

3089
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,230
fascinating because
we have these tools of science that

3090
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
we have these tools of science that
 

3091
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,510
we have these tools of science that
allow us to zoom in

3092
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
allow us to zoom in
 

3093
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,190
allow us to zoom in
quote unquote in all kinds of ways

3094
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
quote unquote in all kinds of ways
 

3095
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,430
quote unquote in all kinds of ways
uh in the world around us but our

3096
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,440
uh in the world around us but our
 

3097
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,430
uh in the world around us but our
cognitive abilities like our perception

3098
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440

is very limited in terms of situations
 

3103
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,309
is very limited in terms of situations
so we might be very easily fooled

3104
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
so we might be very easily fooled
 

3105
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,309
so we might be very easily fooled

00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
years of collective practice to develop
 

3307
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,870
years of collective practice to develop
uh

3308
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
uh
 

3309
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,069
uh
it's just lost but it was just an

3310
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
it's just lost but it was just an
 

3311
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,349
it's just lost but it was just an
incredible amount of fun

3312
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:37,359
incredible amount of fun
 

3313
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,470
incredible amount of fun
way more fun than all the like studio

3314
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
way more fun than all the like studio
 

3315
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,390
way more fun than all the like studio
you know sitting around and playing uh

3316
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:42,400
you know sitting around and playing uh
 

3317
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,990
you know sitting around and playing uh
that i did you know throughout the

3318
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
that i did you know throughout the
 

3319
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,109
that i did you know throughout the
entire year

entire year
 

3321
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,270
entire year
so i think there's something there's

3322
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
so i think there's something there's
 

3323
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,710
so i think there's something there's
something intangible

3324
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
something intangible
 

3325
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,670
something intangible
or maybe maybe tangible about being uh

00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680
or maybe maybe tangible about being uh
 

3327
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,030
or maybe maybe tangible about being uh
being in person

3328

you know we that's not something that
 

3333
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,309
you know we that's not something that
will get lost because i think there's

3334
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
will get lost because i think there's
 

3335
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,710
will get lost because i think there's
like such a large part of the human

3336
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:02,720
like such a large part of the human
 

3337
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,829
like such a large part of the human

you know i'm sure people talk about the
 

3357
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,630
you know i'm sure people talk about the
same way at the beginning of the 20th

3358

same way at the beginning of the 20th
 

3359
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,390
same way at the beginning of the 20th
century about horses

century about horses
 

3361
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,870
century about horses
where they're they are much more

3362

where they're they are much more
 

3363

where they're they are much more
efficient

3364
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
efficient
 

3365
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,589
efficient
they're much uh easier to maintain than

3366
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
they're much uh easier to maintain than
 

3367
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,150
they're much uh easier to maintain than
cars

all the ways that cars break down and
 

3373
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,870
all the ways that cars break down and
there's not enough infrastructure in

3374

there's not enough infrastructure in
 

3375
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,549
there's not enough infrastructure in
terms of roads for cars

terms of roads for cars
 

3377
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,470

historical overview of our solar system
 

3419
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,030
historical overview of our solar system
what is planet nine

3420
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,040
what is planet nine
 

3421
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,430
what is planet nine
okay planet nine is a hypothetical

okay planet nine is a hypothetical
 

3423
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,910
okay planet nine is a hypothetical
object that orbits the solar system

3424
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:27,920
object that orbits the solar system
 

3425
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,789
object that orbits the solar system
right at

3426
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
right at
 

3427
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,549
right at
an orbital period of about 10 000 years

3428
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
an orbital period of about 10 000 years
 

3429
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,069
an orbital period of about 10 000 years
and an orbit which is slightly tilted

3430
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
and an orbit which is slightly tilted
 

3431
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,670
and an orbit which is slightly tilted
with respect to the plane of the solar

3432
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
with respect to the plane of the solar
 

3433
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,549
with respect to the plane of the solar
system

3434
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:38,559
system
 

3435
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,750
system
slightly eccentric and the object itself

3436
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
slightly eccentric and the object itself
 

3437
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,510
slightly eccentric and the object itself
we think is five times more massive than

3438
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
we think is five times more massive than
 

3439
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,789
we think is five times more massive than
the earth we have never seen planet nine

3440
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:48,799
the earth we have never seen planet nine
 

3441
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,990
the earth we have never seen planet nine
in a telescope but we have gravitational

3442
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
in a telescope but we have gravitational
 

3443
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,349
in a telescope but we have gravitational
evidence for it

3444
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
evidence for it
 

3445
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,430
evidence for it
and so this is where all the stuff we've

3446
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
and so this is where all the stuff we've
 

3447
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,829
and so this is where all the stuff we've
been talking about this clustering ideas

3448
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
been talking about this clustering ideas
 

3449
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,910
been talking about this clustering ideas
maybe you can speak to the approximate

3450
01:00:59,910 --> 01:00:59,920
maybe you can speak to the approximate
 

3451
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,270
maybe you can speak to the approximate
location that we

3452
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
location that we
 

3453
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,270
location that we
suspect and also the question i wanted

3454
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280
suspect and also the question i wanted
 

3455
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,030
suspect and also the question i wanted
to ask is uh

3456
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
to ask is uh
 

3457
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,630
to ask is uh
what are we supposed to be imagining

3458
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
what are we supposed to be imagining
 

3459
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,549
what are we supposed to be imagining
here because he said there's certain

3460
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
here because he said there's certain
 

3461
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:09,990
here because he said there's certain
objects in the kuiper belt that

3462
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
objects in the kuiper belt that
 

3463
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,470
objects in the kuiper belt that
are kind of have a direction to them

3464
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:12,480
are kind of have a direction to them
 

3465
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,270
are kind of have a direction to them
that they're all

3466
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
that they're all
 

3467
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,069
that they're all
like like flocking in some kind of way

3468
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
like like flocking in some kind of way
 

3469
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,510
like like flocking in some kind of way
so that's the sense that there's some

3470
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
so that's the sense that there's some
 

3471
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,190
so that's the sense that there's some
kind of gravitational object

3472
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
kind of gravitational object
 

3473
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,910
kind of gravitational object
not changing their orbit but kind of

3474
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
not changing their orbit but kind of
 

3475
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,789
not changing their orbit but kind of
confining them

3476
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
confining them
 

3477
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,630
confining them
right yeah finding like grouping their

3478
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
right yeah finding like grouping their
 

3479
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,990
right yeah finding like grouping their
orbits together

3480
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
orbits together
 

3481
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,750
orbits together
see what would happen if planet nine

3482
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:27,760
see what would happen if planet nine
 

3483
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,990
see what would happen if planet nine
were not there is these orbits that

3484
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
were not there is these orbits that
 

3485
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,030
were not there is these orbits that
roughly share

3486
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
roughly share
 

3487
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,549
roughly share
a common orientation they would just

3488
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:34,559
a common orientation they would just
 

3489
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,190
a common orientation they would just
disperse right they would just become as

3490
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
disperse right they would just become as
 

3491
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,470
disperse right they would just become as
a mutually symmetric

makes it such that these objects stay

3496
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
makes it such that these objects stay
 

3497
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,270
makes it such that these objects stay
in a state that's that's basically

3498
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
in a state that's that's basically
 

3499
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,150
in a state that's that's basically
anti-aligned with respect to the orb

of planet nine um and
 

3503
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,589
of planet nine um and
and sort of hang out there and kind of

01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:55,599
and sort of hang out there and kind of
 

3505
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,029

maybe visualize just because it's fun to
 

3517
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,029
maybe visualize just because it's fun to
think about orbits that all point

think about orbits that all point
 

3519
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,789
think about orbits that all point
into the same direction but i should

01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,270
into the same direction but i should
you know emphasize that for example the

01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,309
you know emphasize that for example the

01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
so they're kind of
 

3563
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,309
so they're kind of
there's basically five different things

01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,510
there's basically five different things
that the uh that planet nine does

that the uh that planet nine does

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,630
that the uh that planet nine does
individually that are like kind of

individually that are like kind of
 

3569
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,270
individually that are like kind of
maybe a one sigma effect where you would

maybe a one sigma effect where you would

01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,190
maybe a one sigma effect where you would
say yeah okay if that's all it was

3572
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:09,200
say yeah okay if that's all it was
 

3573
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,950
say yeah okay if that's all it was
maybe it's not no reason to jump up and

3574
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:10,960
maybe it's not no reason to jump up and
 

3575
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,630
maybe it's not no reason to jump up and
down but because

3576
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
down but because
 

3577
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,430
down but because
it's it's mult it's a multitude of these

3578
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,440
it's it's mult it's a multitude of these
 

3579
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,069
it's it's mult it's a multitude of these

3580
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079

3581
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,829

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,150
that all are explained by one hypothesis
that's that's really the the magnetism

01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
that's that's really the the magnetism
 

3585
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,190
that's that's really the the magnetism
the attraction of the planet nine model

the attraction of the planet nine model
 

3587
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,390
the attraction of the planet nine model
so can you just clarify so

3588
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
so can you just clarify so
 

3589
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,190
so can you just clarify so
most orbit most planets in the solar

3590
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:31,200
most orbit most planets in the solar
 

3591
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,349
most orbit most planets in the solar
system orbit

3592
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
system orbit
 

3593
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,589
system orbit
and approximately the same so it's flat

3594
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:35,599
and approximately the same so it's flat
 

3595
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:36,390
and approximately the same so it's flat
yeah it's like

3596
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
yeah it's like
 

3597
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,510
yeah it's like
one degree they the difference between

3598
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
one degree they the difference between
 

3599
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,069
one degree they the difference between
them is

3600
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
them is
 

3601
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,789
them is
about one degree so but nevertheless if

3602
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
about one degree so but nevertheless if
 

3603
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,069
about one degree so but nevertheless if
we looked at our solar

3604
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
we looked at our solar
 

3605
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,309
we looked at our solar
system it would look and i could see

3606
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
system it would look and i could see
 

3607
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,670
system it would look and i could see
every single object it would look like a

3608
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
every single object it would look like a
 

3609
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,950
every single object it would look like a
sphere

3610
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
sphere
 

3611
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,750
sphere
the inner part where the planets are

3612
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
the inner part where the planets are
 

3613
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,789
the inner part where the planets are
would look

3614
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
would look
 

3615
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,829
would look
like you know flat right the the kuiper

3616
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:55,839
like you know flat right the the kuiper
 

3617
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,630
like you know flat right the the kuiper
belt

3618
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
belt
 

3619
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,990
belt
and the asteroid belt have a larger

3620
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
and the asteroid belt have a larger
 

3621
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,230
and the asteroid belt have a larger
um it gets fatter and fatter yeah that's

3622
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
um it gets fatter and fatter yeah that's
 

3623
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,510
um it gets fatter and fatter yeah that's
kind of like becomes a sphere

3624
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,520
kind of like becomes a sphere
 

3625
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,589
kind of like becomes a sphere
that's right and if you look at the very

3626
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
that's right and if you look at the very
 

3627
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,750
that's right and if you look at the very
outside it's polluted by this

3628
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
outside it's polluted by this
 

3629
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,950
outside it's polluted by this
you know quasi-spheroidal thing

3630
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
you know quasi-spheroidal thing
 

3631
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,430
you know quasi-spheroidal thing
nobody's of course ever seen the oort

3632
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440
nobody's of course ever seen the oort
 

3633
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,230
nobody's of course ever seen the oort
cloud

3634
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
cloud
 

3635
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,109
cloud
right we've only seen comments that come

3636
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
right we've only seen comments that come
 

3637
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,470
right we've only seen comments that come
from the oort cloud so

3638
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:18,480
from the oort cloud so
 

3639
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,349
from the oort cloud so
the oort cloud which is this right

3640
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
the oort cloud which is this right
 

3641
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,510
the oort cloud which is this right
population of distant debris

3642
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,520
population of distant debris
 

3643
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,549
population of distant debris
its existence is also inferred you could

3644
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:26,559
its existence is also inferred you could
 

3645
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:26,870
its existence is also inferred you could
say

3646
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:26,880
say
 

3647
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,990
say
alternatively there is you know there's

3648
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
alternatively there is you know there's
 

3649
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,470
alternatively there is you know there's
a big

3650
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:30,480
a big
 

3651
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,950
a big
cosmic creature that occasionally you

3652
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
cosmic creature that occasionally you
 

3653
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,950
cosmic creature that occasionally you
know sitting at 20 000 au and

3654
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
know sitting at 20 000 au and
 

3655
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,710
know sitting at 20 000 au and
occasionally throws an icy

3656
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
occasionally throws an icy
 

3657
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,069
occasionally throws an icy
rock towards the sound like that

3658
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079
rock towards the sound like that
 

3659
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,910
rock towards the sound like that
spaghetti monster i think it's called

3660
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:39,920
spaghetti monster i think it's called
 

3661
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,549
spaghetti monster i think it's called
okay

3662
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
okay
 

3663
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,990
okay
i mean so it's a mystery in many ways

3664
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
i mean so it's a mystery in many ways
 

3665
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,349
i mean so it's a mystery in many ways
but you can kind of infer a bunch of

3666
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
but you can kind of infer a bunch of
 

3667
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,710
but you can kind of infer a bunch of
things about it

3668
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
things about it
 

3669
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,470
things about it
it's by the way both terrifying and

3670
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
it's by the way both terrifying and
 

3671
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,829
it's by the way both terrifying and
exciting that there's this

3672
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
exciting that there's this
 

3673
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,829
exciting that there's this
vast darkness all around us that's full

3674
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
vast darkness all around us that's full
 

3675
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,190
vast darkness all around us that's full
of objects that are just

3676
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
of objects that are just
 

3677
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,910
of objects that are just
throwing just there yeah it's actually

3678
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920
throwing just there yeah it's actually
 

3679
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,270
throwing just there yeah it's actually
kind of astonishing right

3680
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:57,280
kind of astonishing right
 

3681
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,390
kind of astonishing right
that we have only

3682
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
that we have only
 

3683
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,109
that we have only
explored a small fraction of the solar

3684
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,119
explored a small fraction of the solar
 

3685
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:03,990
explored a small fraction of the solar
system

3686
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
system
 

3687
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,270
system
right that that really kind of baffles

3688
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
right that that really kind of baffles
 

3689
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,390
right that that really kind of baffles
me because

3690
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
me because
 

3691
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,309
me because
uh remember as a student you know

3692
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:10,319
uh remember as a student you know
 

3693
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,430
uh remember as a student you know
studying physics

3694
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
studying physics
 

3695
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,750
studying physics
you know you do the problem where you

3696
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
you know you do the problem where you
 

3697
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,750
you know you do the problem where you
put the earth around the sun you solve

3698
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:15,760
put the earth around the sun you solve
 

3699
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,390
put the earth around the sun you solve
that and

3700
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,400
that and
 

3701
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,270
that and
like it's one line of math and you say

3702
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
like it's one line of math and you say
 

3703
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,230
like it's one line of math and you say
okay well that

3704
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
okay well that
 

3705
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,870
okay well that
surely was figured out by newton so like

3706
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:22,880
surely was figured out by newton so like
 

3707
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,990
surely was figured out by newton so like
all the interesting stuff

3708
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
all the interesting stuff
 

3709
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,390
all the interesting stuff
is not in the solar system but that um

3710
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
is not in the solar system but that um
 

3711
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,589
is not in the solar system but that um
it's just plainly not true there are

3712
01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:31,599
it's just plainly not true there are
 

3713
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,390
it's just plainly not true there are
there are mysteries in the solar system

3714
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
there are mysteries in the solar system
 

3715
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:34,870
there are mysteries in the solar system
that

3716
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
that
 

3717
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,670
that
are remarkable that we are only now

3718
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
are remarkable that we are only now
 

3719
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,270
are remarkable that we are only now
starting to just kind of scratch the

3720
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,280
starting to just kind of scratch the
 

3721
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,230
starting to just kind of scratch the
surface of

3722
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240
surface of
 

3723
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,230
surface of
and some of those objects probably have

3724
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:42,240
and some of those objects probably have
 

3725
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,910
and some of those objects probably have
some information about the history of

3726
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:43,920
some information about the history of
 

3727
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,789
some information about the history of
our solar system

3728
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
our solar system
 

3729
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,870
our solar system
absolutely absolutely like a great

3730
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
absolutely absolutely like a great
 

3731
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,910
absolutely absolutely like a great
example is

3732
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
example is
 

3733
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,470
example is
uh you know small meteorites right small

3734
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
uh you know small meteorites right small
 

3735
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,910
uh you know small meteorites right small
meteorites

3736
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
meteorites
 

3737
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,910
meteorites
are melted right they have they're

3738
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
are melted right they have they're
 

3739
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,670
are melted right they have they're
differentiated meaning some of the

3740
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
differentiated meaning some of the
 

3741
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,789
differentiated meaning some of the
uh iron sinks you say

3742
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
uh iron sinks you say
 

3743
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,789
uh iron sinks you say
how can that be because they're so small

3744
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799
how can that be because they're so small
 

3745
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,390
how can that be because they're so small
that they wouldn't have melted just from

3746
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
that they wouldn't have melted just from
 

3747
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,230
that they wouldn't have melted just from
the heat of their accretion

3748
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,240
the heat of their accretion
 

3749
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,190
the heat of their accretion
turns out the fact that the solar nebula

3750
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:07,200
turns out the fact that the solar nebula
 

3751
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:07,750
turns out the fact that the solar nebula
the

3752

aluminum 26 is in itself a remarkable
 

3759
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,950
aluminum 26 is in itself a remarkable
thing it means

01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
thing it means
 

3761
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,789
thing it means
the solar system did not form an

isolation it formed
 

3765
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,349

01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,150
stars that were also forming
some of which were undergoing you know

01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
some of which were undergoing you know
 

3771
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,150
some of which were undergoing you know
going through supernova explosions some

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,750
and releasing these unstable isotopes
that of which we now see kind of the

3778
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
that of which we now see kind of the
 

3779
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,670
that of which we now see kind of the
traces of

3780
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:37,680
traces of
 

3781
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,829
traces of
it's so cool do you think it's possible

3782
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
it's so cool do you think it's possible
 

3783
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,029
it's so cool do you think it's possible
that life from

3784
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
that life from
 

3785
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,510
that life from
other solar systems was injected and

3786
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
other solar systems was injected and
 

3787
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,630
other solar systems was injected and
that that was

3788
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
that that was
 

3789
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,750
that that was
what was uh the origin of life on earth

3790
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
what was uh the origin of life on earth
 

3791
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,789
what was uh the origin of life on earth
yeah defense permea idea um

3792
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
yeah defense permea idea um
 

3793
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,470
yeah defense permea idea um
that's seen as a low probability event

3794
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
that's seen as a low probability event
 

3795
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,230
that's seen as a low probability event
by people who studied the original life

3796
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
by people who studied the original life
 

3797
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,750
by people who studied the original life
but that's because

3798
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:55,760
but that's because
 

3799
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,029
but that's because
uh then they would be out of a job well

3800
01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
uh then they would be out of a job well
 

3801
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,390
uh then they would be out of a job well
i don't think they'd be out of the job

3802
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
i don't think they'd be out of the job
 

3803
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,750
i don't think they'd be out of the job
because you just then say you have to

3804
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
because you just then say you have to
 

3805
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,190
because you just then say you have to
figure out how life started

3806
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200
figure out how life started
 

3807
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,270
figure out how life started
and there but then you have to go there

3808
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280
and there but then you have to go there
 

3809
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,390
and there but then you have to go there
we can study

3810
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
we can study
 

3811
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,390
we can study
life on earth much easier we could study

3812
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
life on earth much easier we could study
 

3813
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,510
life on earth much easier we could study
in the lab

3814
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
in the lab
 

3815
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,589
in the lab
much easier because we could replicate

3816
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
much easier because we could replicate
 

3817
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,870
much easier because we could replicate
conditions that are

3818
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
conditions that are
 

3819
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,390
conditions that are
from an early earth much easier

3820
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
from an early earth much easier
 

3821
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,910
from an early earth much easier
from a chemistry perspective from a

you can intuit a bunch of stuff you can

3826
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
you can intuit a bunch of stuff you can
 

3827
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,109
you can intuit a bunch of stuff you can
look at different parts of earth and

3828
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:23,119
look at different parts of earth and
 

3829
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:23,510
look at different parts of earth and
just

3830
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
just
 

3831
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,470
just
to an extent i mean the early earth was

3832
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
to an extent i mean the early earth was
 

3833
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,190
to an extent i mean the early earth was
completely

completely
 

3835
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,789
completely
unlike the current earth right there was

3836
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
unlike the current earth right there was

certain right something like
 

3845
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,109
certain right something like
100 certainty that life started on mars

um this is not a problem
that i like to kind of

3854

that i like to kind of
 

3855
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,589
that i like to kind of
think about too much like the origin of

think about too much like the origin of
 

3857
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,750
think about too much like the origin of
life it's a fascinating problem

3858
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,760
life it's a fascinating problem
 

3859
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,710
life it's a fascinating problem
but you know it's not physics and i just

3860
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
but you know it's not physics and i just
 

3861

have said that all in a reverse order or

3896
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
have said that all in a reverse order or
 

3897
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,229
have said that all in a reverse order or
something

3898
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
something
 

3899
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,030
something
but i like to focus on these things and

3900
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
but i like to focus on these things and
 

3901
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,070
but i like to focus on these things and
not worry too much

3902
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
not worry too much
 

3903
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,829
not worry too much
about about everything else you know

3904
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
about about everything else you know
 

3905
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,829
about about everything else you know
what i mean yes just because there is a

3906
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
what i mean yes just because there is a
 

3907
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,070
what i mean yes just because there is a
like you said earlier there's a time

3908
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,080
like you said earlier there's a time
 

3909
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,070
like you said earlier there's a time
constraint you can't

3910
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,080
constraint you can't
 

3911
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,470
constraint you can't
do it all there's many mysteries all

3912
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
do it all there's many mysteries all
 

3913
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,269
do it all there's many mysteries all
around us

3914
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:49,279
around us
 

3915
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,309
around us

3959
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,950
the moment planet nine gets imaged from
a telescope on earth it's done i mean

3960
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:36,960
a telescope on earth it's done i mean
 

3961
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,829
a telescope on earth it's done i mean
it's just there

01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,349
it's just there
can you clarify because you mentioned

3964
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
can you clarify because you mentioned
 

3965
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,950
can you clarify because you mentioned
that before from an

3966
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:40,960
that before from an
 

3967
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,829
that before from an
image would you be able to tell yes so

3968
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
image would you be able to tell yes so
 

3969
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:44,309

01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
from
 

3971
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,070
from
an image the moment you see

3972
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
an image the moment you see
 

3973
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,630
an image the moment you see
something something that is reflecting

3974
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
something something that is reflecting
 

3975
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,349
something something that is reflecting
sunlight

3976
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
sunlight
 

3977
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,750
sunlight
back at you and you know that it's

3978
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:55,760
back at you and you know that it's
 

3979
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,189
back at you and you know that it's
hundreds of times as far away from

3980
01:09:59,189 --> 01:09:59,199
hundreds of times as far away from
 

3981
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,310
hundreds of times as far away from
the sun as as the earth you're done

3982
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,320
the sun as as the earth you're done
 

3983
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,229
the sun as as the earth you're done
so you're thinking so basically if you

3984
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
so you're thinking so basically if you
 

3985
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,950
so you're thinking so basically if you
have a really far away thing that's big

3986
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
have a really far away thing that's big
 

3987
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,390
have a really far away thing that's big
yeah you know five times the size of

3988
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
yeah you know five times the size of
 

3989
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,270
yeah you know five times the size of
earth that means

3990
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
earth that means
 

3991
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,910
earth that means
uh that that's fine that is planet could

3992
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
uh that that's fine that is planet could
 

3993
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,510
uh that that's fine that is planet could
there be multiple objects like that i

3994
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
there be multiple objects like that i
 

3995
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,070
there be multiple objects like that i
guess

3996
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
guess
 

3997
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,030
guess
in principle yeah i mean there's no

3998
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:19,040
in principle yeah i mean there's no
 

3999
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,870
in principle yeah i mean there's no
there's no law of physics that uh that

4000
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
there's no law of physics that uh that
 

4001
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,390
there's no law of physics that uh that
doesn't allow you to have multiple

4002
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,400
doesn't allow you to have multiple
 

4003
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,790
doesn't allow you to have multiple
there's also no evidence at present for

4004
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:24,800
there's also no evidence at present for
 

4005
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,310
there's also no evidence at present for
there being multiple i wonder if

4006
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
there being multiple i wonder if
 

4007
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,750
there being multiple i wonder if
it's possible this is like just like

4008
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
it's possible this is like just like
 

4009
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,669
it's possible this is like just like
we're finding exoplanets

4010
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:29,679
we're finding exoplanets
 

4011
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,229
we're finding exoplanets
whether given the size of the or cloud

4012
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
whether given the size of the or cloud
 

4013
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,270
whether given the size of the or cloud
there's basically

4014
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
there's basically
 

4015
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,910
there's basically
it's rare and rare but they're sprinkled

4016
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:35,920
it's rare and rare but they're sprinkled
 

4017
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,030
it's rare and rare but they're sprinkled

ten eleven twelve like these yeah

4020
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
ten eleven twelve like these yeah
 

4021
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,910
ten eleven twelve like these yeah
some got thirteen after that yeah i can

4022
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:43,920
some got thirteen after that yeah i can
 

4023
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,030
some got thirteen after that yeah i can
just keep counting

4024
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
just keep counting
 

4025
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,189
just keep counting
so like just something about the dynamic

4026
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
so like just something about the dynamic
 

4027
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,229
so like just something about the dynamic
system

4028
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
system
 

4029
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,669
system
like it becomes lower and lower

4030
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
like it becomes lower and lower
 

4031
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,910
like it becomes lower and lower
probability event but they gather up

4032
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:51,920
probability event but they gather up
 

4033
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,149
probability event but they gather up
like they they become would they become

4034
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:54,159
like they they become would they become
 

4035
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,669
like they they become would they become
larger and larger maybe

4036
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
larger and larger maybe
 

4037
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,990
larger and larger maybe
something like that and i wonder i

4038
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,000
something like that and i wonder i
 

4039
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,950
something like that and i wonder i
wonder if like discovering planet nine

4040
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
wonder if like discovering planet nine
 

4041
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,630
wonder if like discovering planet nine
will just like be almost like a

4042
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
will just like be almost like a
 

4043
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,229
will just like be almost like a
springboard it's like well what's

01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:04,239
springboard it's like well what's
 

4045
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,070

01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
what's beyond that it's entirely
 

4047
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,310
what's beyond that it's entirely
plausible the oort cloud itself

4048
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
plausible the oort cloud itself
 

4049
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,950
plausible the oort cloud itself
probably holds about five earth masses

4050
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
probably holds about five earth masses
 

4051
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,510
probably holds about five earth masses
or seven earth masses of material

4052
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
or seven earth masses of material
 

4053
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,430
or seven earth masses of material
right so it's not it's not nothing and

right it was discovered by uh it was

4078
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
right it was discovered by uh it was
 

4079
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,270
right it was discovered by uh it was
certain mathematically

4080
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280
certain mathematically
 

4081
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,790
certain mathematically
right so yeah the orbit of

4082
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:48,800
right so yeah the orbit of
 

4083
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,229
right so yeah the orbit of
uranus when uranus was found um

4084
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
uranus when uranus was found um
 

4085
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,669
uranus when uranus was found um
yes this was 1781. uh it's

4086
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:55,679
yes this was 1781. uh it's
 

4087
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,310
yes this was 1781. uh it's
the kind of tracking uh both the

01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:05,600
revealed
 

4099
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,390
revealed
that it was not following the orbit that

4100
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
that it was not following the orbit that
 

4101
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,430
that it was not following the orbit that
it was supposed to

it was supposed to
 

4103
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,669
it was supposed to
right the the predicted orbit deviated

4104
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
right the the predicted orbit deviated
 

4105
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,750
right the the predicted orbit deviated
away from where it actually was

4106
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:13,760
away from where it actually was
 

4107
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,430
away from where it actually was
so uh in the mid eighteen hundreds

4108
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
so uh in the mid eighteen hundreds

if this is due to gravity of a
 

4119
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,390
if this is due to gravity of a
more distant planet then that planet is

4120
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
more distant planet then that planet is
 

4121
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,270

01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,920
okay and then they found it but the
 

4125
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,790
okay and then they found it but the
point is the

4126
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:36,800
point is the
 

4127
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,229
point is the

01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,229
can you just like light one up while
you're waiting or

01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
you're waiting or
 

4197
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:41,040
you're waiting or
uh

4198
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:41,050

[Laughter]
but you're making me actually realize

4202
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:45,280
but you're making me actually realize
 

4203
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,669
but you're making me actually realize
that the one way to explore

4204
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:49,679
that the one way to explore
 

4205
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,790
that the one way to explore
the the galaxy is by just sitting here

4206
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:52,800
the the galaxy is by just sitting here
 

4207
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,390
the the galaxy is by just sitting here
on earth and waiting

4208
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
on earth and waiting
 

4209
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,910
on earth and waiting
so if we can just get really good at

4210
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
so if we can just get really good at
 

4211
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,630
so if we can just get really good at
waiting it's like a more more or these

4212
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
waiting it's like a more more or these
 

4213
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,990
waiting it's like a more more or these
interstellar objects that

4214
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
interstellar objects that
 

4215
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,990
interstellar objects that
fly in you can just wait for them to

4216
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
fly in you can just wait for them to
 

4217
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,910
fly in you can just wait for them to
come to you same with the aliens you can

4218
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
come to you same with the aliens you can
 

4219
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,270
come to you same with the aliens you can
wait for them to come to you

4220
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
wait for them to come to you
 

4221
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,990
wait for them to come to you
if you get really good at waiting um

4222
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,000
if you get really good at waiting um
 

4223
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,110
if you get really good at waiting um
then

4224
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
then
 

4225
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,709
then
that's one way to do the exploration

4226
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
that's one way to do the exploration
 

4227
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,070
that's one way to do the exploration
because eventually the thing will come

4228
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
because eventually the thing will come
 

4229
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,350
because eventually the thing will come
to you maybe that's the entire

4230
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
to you maybe that's the entire
 

4231
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,590
to you maybe that's the entire
maybe the intelligent alien

4232
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
maybe the intelligent alien
 

4233
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,950
maybe the intelligent alien
civilizations

4234
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
civilizations
 

4235
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,110
civilizations
get much better at waiting and so they

4236
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,120
get much better at waiting and so they
 

4237
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,229
get much better at waiting and so they
all decide so

4238
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
all decide so
 

4239
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,750
all decide so
game theoretically to start waiting and

4240
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
game theoretically to start waiting and
 

4241
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,430
game theoretically to start waiting and
it's just a bunch of like

4242
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:23,440
it's just a bunch of like
 

4243
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,510
it's just a bunch of like
ancient intelligent civilizations of

4244
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
ancient intelligent civilizations of
 

4245
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,270
ancient intelligent civilizations of
aliens all throughout the universe

4246
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
aliens all throughout the universe
 

4247
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,630
aliens all throughout the universe
they're just sitting there waiting for

4248
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,640
they're just sitting there waiting for
 

4249
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,270
they're just sitting there waiting for
each other

4250
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
each other
 

4251
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,590
each other
look you can't just be good at waiting

4252
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
look you can't just be good at waiting
 

4253
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,950
look you can't just be good at waiting
you got to know how to chill

4254
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:32,960
you got to know how to chill
 

4255
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,110
you got to know how to chill
okay like like you can't just like sit

4256
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
okay like like you can't just like sit
 

4257
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,790
okay like like you can't just like sit
around and do nothing you got to be

4258
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:36,800
around and do nothing you got to be
 

4259
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,310
around and do nothing you got to be
you get you got to know how to chill i

4260
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
you get you got to know how to chill i
 

4261
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,990
you get you got to know how to chill i
honestly think that

4262
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
honestly think that
 

4263
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,390
honestly think that
as we progress if the aliens are

4264
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
as we progress if the aliens are
 

4265
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,430
as we progress if the aliens are
anything like us

4266
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
anything like us
 

4267
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,709
anything like us
we enjoy loving things we do

4268
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
we enjoy loving things we do
 

4269
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,110
we enjoy loving things we do
and it it's uh it's very possible that

4270
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
and it it's uh it's very possible that
 

4271
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,669
and it it's uh it's very possible that
we just figure out mechanisms

4272
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:51,679
we just figure out mechanisms
 

4273
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,990
we just figure out mechanisms
here on earth to enjoy our life and we

4274
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
here on earth to enjoy our life and we
 

4275
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,750
here on earth to enjoy our life and we
just stay here on our f

4276
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:55,760
just stay here on our f
 

4277
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,390
just stay here on our f
forever that exploration becomes less

4278
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:58,400
forever that exploration becomes less
 

4279
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,149
forever that exploration becomes less
and less of an interesting thing to do

4280
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
and less of an interesting thing to do
 

4281
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,270
and less of an interesting thing to do
and so you basically yes wait and chill

4282
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
and so you basically yes wait and chill
 

4283
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,950
and so you basically yes wait and chill
you get really optimally good at

4284
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
you get really optimally good at
 

4285
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,470
you get really optimally good at
chilling and thereby

4286
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,480
chilling and thereby
 

4287
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,830
chilling and thereby
exploring is not that interesting so you

4288
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
exploring is not that interesting so you
 

4289
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,470
exploring is not that interesting so you
know

4290
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
know
 

4291
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,310
know
in terms of 4 000 years would be nothing

4292
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,320
in terms of 4 000 years would be nothing
 

4293
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,830
in terms of 4 000 years would be nothing
for scientists we'll be chilling and

4294
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:13,840
for scientists we'll be chilling and
 

4295
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,310
for scientists we'll be chilling and
just

4296
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
just
 

4297
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,870
just
all kinds of scientific explorations

4298
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:16,880
all kinds of scientific explorations
 

4299
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,510
all kinds of scientific explorations
will become

4300
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
will become
 

4301
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,550
will become
possible because we'll just be here

4302
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560

 

4303
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,990

you have a paper out recently because

4304
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
you have a paper out recently because
 

4305
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,270
you have a paper out recently because
you already mentioned some of these

4306
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
you already mentioned some of these
 

4307
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:25,990
you already mentioned some of these
ideas but

4308
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,000
ideas but
 

4309
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,430
ideas but
i'd love it if you could dig into it a

4310
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
i'd love it if you could dig into it a
 

4311
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,430
i'd love it if you could dig into it a
little bit yeah of course the injection

4312
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
little bit yeah of course the injection
 

4313
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,149
little bit yeah of course the injection
of inner

4314
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
of inner
 

4315
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,709
of inner
or cloud objects into the distant kuiper

4316
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:32,719
or cloud objects into the distant kuiper
 

4317
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,790
or cloud objects into the distant kuiper
belt by planet nine

4318
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
belt by planet nine
 

4319
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,310
belt by planet nine
what is this idea of

4320
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,320
what is this idea of
 

4321
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,070
what is this idea of
planet nine injecting objects into the

4322
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,080
planet nine injecting objects into the
 

4323
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,390
planet nine injecting objects into the
kuiper belt okay let me take a

4324
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,400
kuiper belt okay let me take a
 

4325
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,430
kuiper belt okay let me take a
brief step back and when we do

4326
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
brief step back and when we do
 

4327
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,630
brief step back and when we do
calculations of

4328
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
calculations of
 

4329
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,669
calculations of
planet nine we do the simulations

4330
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
planet nine we do the simulations
 

4331
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,390
planet nine we do the simulations
as far as our simulations are concerned

4332
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
as far as our simulations are concerned
 

4333
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:52,870
as far as our simulations are concerned
sort of

4334
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:52,880
sort of
 

4335
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,870
sort of
the uh neptune

4336
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
the uh neptune
 

4337
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,669
the uh neptune
like kind of the trans-neptunian solar

4338
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
like kind of the trans-neptunian solar
 

4339
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:00,550
like kind of the trans-neptunian solar

4340
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560

namely the kuiper belt gets scattered by

4344
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:07,040
namely the kuiper belt gets scattered by
 

4345
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,110
namely the kuiper belt gets scattered by
neptune and then planet nine does things

4346
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120
neptune and then planet nine does things
 

4347
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,030
neptune and then planet nine does things
to it and aligns the orbits and

4348
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,040
to it and aligns the orbits and
 

4349
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,070
to it and aligns the orbits and
and so on and then we calculate what uh

4350
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
and so on and then we calculate what uh
 

4351
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,590
and so on and then we calculate what uh
what happens on the lifetime of the

4352
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
what happens on the lifetime of the

we a disprove ourselves and b
how can we improve our simulations like

01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:39,280
how can we improve our simulations like

01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,709
how can we improve our simulations like
what's missing

4374
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:40,719
what's missing
 

4375
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,910
what's missing
one idea that maybe should have been

4376
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
one idea that maybe should have been
 

4377
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,990
one idea that maybe should have been
obvious in retrospect is that all of our

4378
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:46,000
obvious in retrospect is that all of our
 

4379
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,990
obvious in retrospect is that all of our
simulations treated the solar system

4380
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
simulations treated the solar system
 

4381
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,790
simulations treated the solar system
as some isolated creature right but the

as some isolated creature right but the
 

4383
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,030
as some isolated creature right but the
solar system did not form in isolation

solar system did not form in isolation
 

4385
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,750
solar system did not form in isolation
right it formed in this cluster of stars

4386
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:55,760
right it formed in this cluster of stars
 

4387
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,669
right it formed in this cluster of stars
and during that phase

4388
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
and during that phase
 

4389
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,910
and during that phase
of forming together with thousands of

other stars
we believe the solar system formed this

01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:04,239
we believe the solar system formed this
 

4395
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,870
we believe the solar system formed this

01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,630
little bit closer
if planet nine's not there that

4410
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:22,640
if planet nine's not there that
 

4411
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,630
if planet nine's not there that
population is completely dormant

01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
population is completely dormant
 

4413
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,750
population is completely dormant
and these objects just slowly orbit

01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:32,960
happens to them ever but what we
 

4419
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,189
happens to them ever but what we
realized that if planet nine is there

4420
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
realized that if planet nine is there
 

4421
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,110
realized that if planet nine is there
planet nine can actually grab some of

4422
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,120
planet nine can actually grab some of
 

4423
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,630
planet nine can actually grab some of
those objects and gravitationally

4424
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:38,640
those objects and gravitationally
 

4425
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,070
those objects and gravitationally
re-inject them

4426
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
re-inject them
 

4427
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,870
re-inject them
into the distant solar system so we

4428
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
into the distant solar system so we
 

4429
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,550
into the distant solar system so we
thought okay let's look into this

4430
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
thought okay let's look into this
 

4431
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,950
thought okay let's look into this
with numerical experiments do do our

01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
does this process work and if it works
 

4437
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,750
does this process work and if it works
uh

01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
uh
 

4439
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,350
uh
what are its consequences so it turns

you kind of at the end of the day that

4468
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
you kind of at the end of the day that
 

4469
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,229
you kind of at the end of the day that
it

01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
it
 

4471
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,630
it
it has an effect on the best fit orbit

4472
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
it has an effect on the best fit orbit
 

4473
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,910
it has an effect on the best fit orbit
for planet nine itself

for planet nine itself
 

4475
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,470
for planet nine itself
so if you realize that the data set that

4476
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
so if you realize that the data set that
 

4477
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,750
so if you realize that the data set that
we're observing

4478
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
we're observing
 

4479
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,149

is not entirely composed of things that

4480
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159
is not entirely composed of things that
 

4481
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,750
is not entirely composed of things that
came out of the solar system but also

4482
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
came out of the solar system but also
 

4483
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,550
came out of the solar system but also
things that got

4484
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
things that got
 

4485
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,430
things that got
re-injected back in then turns out the

4486
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:41,440
re-injected back in then turns out the
 

4487
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,950
re-injected back in then turns out the
best fit planet nine slightly more

4488
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:42,960
best fit planet nine slightly more
 

4489
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,830
best fit planet nine slightly more

that's kind of getting into the weeds

4492
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:45,679
that's kind of getting into the weeds
 

4493
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,990
that's kind of getting into the weeds
the the point here is that

4494
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
the the point here is that
 

4495
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,550
the the point here is that
uh you know the existence of planet nine

4496
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:50,560
uh you know the existence of planet nine
 

4497
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,229
uh you know the existence of planet nine
itself provides this

4498
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
itself provides this
 

4499
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,550
itself provides this
natural bridge that connects an

01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
natural bridge that connects an

with things that we're starting to

4506
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,360
with things that we're starting to
 

4507
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,270
with things that we're starting to
directly observe so you can flow back so

4508
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
directly observe so you can flow back so
 

4509
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,950
directly observe so you can flow back so
it's not just the river flowing one way

4510
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:02,960
it's not just the river flowing one way
 

4511
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,270
it's not just the river flowing one way
it's

4512
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
it's
 

4513
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,830
it's
maybe a smaller stream go back and

4514
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
maybe a smaller stream go back and
 

4515
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,550
maybe a smaller stream go back and
backwash

4516
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:06,560
backwash
 

4517
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,830
backwash
you want a backwash you want to

4518
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:07,840
you want a backwash you want to
 

4519
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,750
you want a backwash you want to
incorporate that into the simulations

4520
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
incorporate that into the simulations
 

4521
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,310
incorporate that into the simulations
into your

4522
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
into your
 

4523
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,470
into your
understanding of those distant objects

4524
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
understanding of those distant objects
 

4525
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,990
understanding of those distant objects
when you're trying to make sense of the

4526
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,000
when you're trying to make sense of the
 

4527
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,910
when you're trying to make sense of the
various observations and so on exactly

4528
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
various observations and so on exactly
 

4529
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,430
various observations and so on exactly
that's fascinating

4530
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:17,440
that's fascinating
 

4531
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,830
that's fascinating
i gotta ask you some people think that

4532
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:20,840
i gotta ask you some people think that
 

4533
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,750
i gotta ask you some people think that
uh many of the observations you're

4534
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
uh many of the observations you're
 

4535
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,470
uh many of the observations you're
describing

4536
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:24,480
describing
 

4537
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,070
describing
could be described by a primordial black

4538
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
could be described by a primordial black
 

4539
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,030
could be described by a primordial black
hole

4540
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
hole
 

4541
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,110
hole
first what is the primordial black hole

4542
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,120
first what is the primordial black hole
 

4543
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,550
first what is the primordial black hole
and what do you think about this idea

4544
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
and what do you think about this idea
 

4545
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,270
and what do you think about this idea
yeah

4546
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
yeah
 

4547
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,390
yeah
so primordial black hole is a black hole

4548
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
so primordial black hole is a black hole
 

4549
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,189
so primordial black hole is a black hole
which is made

4550
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,199
which is made
 

4551
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,590
which is made
not through the usual pathway of making

4552
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
not through the usual pathway of making
 

4553
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,750
not through the usual pathway of making
a black hole

4554
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
a black hole
 

4555
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,310
a black hole
which is that you have a star which is

4556
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:44,320
which is that you have a star which is
 

4557
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,590
which is that you have a star which is
uh more massive

4558
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
uh more massive
 

4559
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,910
uh more massive
than you know 1.4 or so solar masses and

4560
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
than you know 1.4 or so solar masses and
 

4561
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,910
than you know 1.4 or so solar masses and
basically when it runs out of

4562
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:51,920
basically when it runs out of
 

4563
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,189
basically when it runs out of
fuel uh runs out of its nuclear fusion

4564
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
fuel uh runs out of its nuclear fusion
 

4565
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,070
fuel uh runs out of its nuclear fusion
fuel

4566
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,080
fuel
 

4567
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,550
fuel
it can't hold itself up anymore and just

4568
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
it can't hold itself up anymore and just
 

4569
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,270
it can't hold itself up anymore and just
the whole thing collapses on itself

4570
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
the whole thing collapses on itself
 

4571
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,630
the whole thing collapses on itself
right you create a um

4572
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
right you create a um
 

4573
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,590
right you create a um
i mean one i guess simple way to think

4574
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
i mean one i guess simple way to think
 

4575
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,709
i mean one i guess simple way to think
about it is you create an

4576
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:08,719
about it is you create an
 

4577
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,510
about it is you create an
object with zero radius that has mass

4578
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
object with zero radius that has mass
 

4579
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,870
object with zero radius that has mass
but zero radius

4580
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:12,880
but zero radius
 

4581
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,310
but zero radius
that singularity

4582
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
that singularity
 

4583
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,350
that singularity
now that's such black holes exist all

4584
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
now that's such black holes exist all
 

4585
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,030
now that's such black holes exist all
over the place in the galaxy there's in

4586
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
over the place in the galaxy there's in
 

4587
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,830
over the place in the galaxy there's in
fact

4588
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:21,840
fact
 

4589
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,510
fact
a really big one at the center of the

4590
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:23,520
a really big one at the center of the
 

4591
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,430
a really big one at the center of the
galaxy that's like yeah

4592
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
galaxy that's like yeah
 

4593
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,350
galaxy that's like yeah
that that one's always looking at you

4594
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
that that one's always looking at you
 

4595
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,629
that that one's always looking at you
when you're not looking

4596
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:28,639
when you're not looking
 

4597
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,110
when you're not looking
okay right and it's it's always talking

4598
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
okay right and it's it's always talking
 

4599
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:31,669
okay right and it's it's always talking
about you

4600
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
about you
 

4601
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,830
about you
and when you turn off the lights it's it

4602
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
and when you turn off the lights it's it
 

4603
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,709
and when you turn off the lights it's it
wakes up

4604
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
wakes up
 

4605
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,990
wakes up
that's right um but you know so such

4606
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
that's right um but you know so such
 

4607
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,870
that's right um but you know so such
black holes

4608
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
black holes
 

4609
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,709
black holes
are all over the place we when they

4610
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:40,719
are all over the place we when they
 

4611
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,149
are all over the place we when they
merge we get to see

4612
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:42,159
merge we get to see
 

4613
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,910
merge we get to see
you know incredible gravitational waves

4614
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:43,920
you know incredible gravitational waves
 

4615
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,430
you know incredible gravitational waves
that they emit etc etc

4616
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
that they emit etc etc
 

4617
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,830
that they emit etc etc
one kind of plausible scenario however

4618
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
one kind of plausible scenario however
 

4619
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,550
one kind of plausible scenario however
is that

4620
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
is that
 

4621
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,709
is that
when the universe was forming basically

4622
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
when the universe was forming basically
 

4623
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,470
when the universe was forming basically
during the big bang

4624
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
during the big bang
 

4625
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,830
during the big bang
you created a whole spectrum of black

4626
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
you created a whole spectrum of black
 

4627
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,430
you created a whole spectrum of black
holes

4628
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
holes
 

4629
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,910

01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,830
some with masses of
10 earth masses like the entire you know

01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:08,800
the amount some the mass of asteroids
 

4639
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,990
the amount some the mass of asteroids
now on the smaller end over the lifetime

4640
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
now on the smaller end over the lifetime
 

4641
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,030
now on the smaller end over the lifetime
of the universe

4642
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
of the universe
 

4643
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,669
of the universe
the small ones kind of evaporate and

4644
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
the small ones kind of evaporate and
 

4645
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,270
the small ones kind of evaporate and
they're not there anymore at least this

4646
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
they're not there anymore at least this
 

4647
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,629
they're not there anymore at least this
is what we

4648
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:18,639
is what we
 

4649
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,669
is what we
what the calculations tell us but five

4650
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:21,679
what the calculations tell us but five
 

4651
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:23,510
what the calculations tell us but five
earth masses is big enough to

4652
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:23,520
earth masses is big enough to
 

4653
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,270
earth masses is big enough to
not have evaporated so one idea is that

4654
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
not have evaporated so one idea is that
 

4655
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,550
not have evaporated so one idea is that
planet nine is not a planet and instead

4656
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
planet nine is not a planet and instead
 

4657
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,990
planet nine is not a planet and instead
it is a five

4658
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,000
it is a five
 

4659
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,430
it is a five
earth mass black hole and that's why

4660
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
earth mass black hole and that's why
 

4661
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,270
earth mass black hole and that's why
it's hard to find now

4662
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280

 

4663
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,629

can we right away from our calculations

4664
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
can we right away from our calculations
 

4665
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,189
can we right away from our calculations
say

4666
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
say
 

4667
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,550
say
that's definitely true or that's not

4668
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
that's definitely true or that's not
 

4669
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,709
that's definitely true or that's not
true absolutely not we can't in fact our

4670
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
true absolutely not we can't in fact our
 

4671
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,390
true absolutely not we can't in fact our
calculations

4672
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400
calculations
 

4673
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,149
calculations
tell you nothing other than the orbit

4674
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
tell you nothing other than the orbit
 

4675
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,430
tell you nothing other than the orbit
and the mass and that means the

4676
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:55,440
and the mass and that means the
 

4677
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,510
and the mass and that means the
black hole i mean it could be a five

4678
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:57,520
black hole i mean it could be a five
 

4679
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,790
black hole i mean it could be a five
earth mass you know

4680
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
earth mass you know
 

4681
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,270
earth mass you know
cup it could be a five earth mass

4682
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,280
cup it could be a five earth mass
 

4683
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,270
cup it could be a five earth mass
hedgehog or a black hole or

4684
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
hedgehog or a black hole or
 

4685
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,270
hedgehog or a black hole or
really anything that's five earth masses

4686
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,280
really anything that's five earth masses
 

4687
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,750
really anything that's five earth masses
will do because the gravity of a black

4688
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
will do because the gravity of a black
 

4689
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,550
will do because the gravity of a black
hole

4690
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
hole
 

4691
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,470
hole
is no different than the gravity of a

4692
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
is no different than the gravity of a
 

4693
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,790
is no different than the gravity of a
planet right if the sun became a black

4694
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:12,800
planet right if the sun became a black
 

4695
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,550
planet right if the sun became a black
hole tomorrow

4696
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:14,560
hole tomorrow
 

4697
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,790
hole tomorrow
it would be dark but or the earth would

4698
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,800
it would be dark but or the earth would
 

4699
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,310
it would be dark but or the earth would
keep orbiting it

4700
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
keep orbiting it
 

4701
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,709
keep orbiting it
and like this notion that oh black holes

4702
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
and like this notion that oh black holes
 

4703
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:21,830
and like this notion that oh black holes
suck everything in

4704
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
suck everything in
 

4705
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,990
suck everything in
it's it's not that's like a sci-fi

4706
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
it's it's not that's like a sci-fi
 

4707
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,350
it's it's not that's like a sci-fi
notion right it's just mass

4708
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
notion right it's just mass
 

4709
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,950
notion right it's just mass
what would be the difference between a

4710
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
what would be the difference between a
 

4711
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,430
what would be the difference between a
black hole and a planet

4712
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
black hole and a planet
 

4713
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,070
black hole and a planet
in terms of observationally uh

4714
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
in terms of observationally uh
 

4715
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,990
in terms of observationally uh
observationally the difference would be

4716
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,000
observationally the difference would be
 

4717
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,149
observationally the difference would be
that you will never find the black hole

4718
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
that you will never find the black hole
 

4719
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,870
that you will never find the black hole
right the truth is they're kind of um

4720
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
right the truth is they're kind of um
 

4721
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,510
right the truth is they're kind of um
i'm actually

4722
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
i'm actually
 

4723
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,629
i'm actually
not you know i never looked into this

4724
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
not you know i never looked into this
 

4725
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,590
not you know i never looked into this
very carefully

4726
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
very carefully
 

4727
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,790
very carefully
but there are some constraints that you

4728
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
but there are some constraints that you
 

4729
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,750
but there are some constraints that you
can

4730
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:47,760
can
 

4731
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,390
can
get just statistically say okay if the

4732
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
get just statistically say okay if the
 

4733
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,189
get just statistically say okay if the
sun

4734
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
sun
 

4735
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,350
sun
has a binary companion which is a five

4736
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
has a binary companion which is a five
 

4737
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,430
has a binary companion which is a five
earth mass black hole

4738
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:55,440
earth mass black hole
 

4739
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,990
earth mass black hole
then that means such black holes would

4740
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,000
then that means such black holes would
 

4741
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,110
then that means such black holes would
be extremely

4742
01:22:59,110 --> 01:22:59,120
be extremely
 

4743
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,430
be extremely
common and you know you can sort of look

4744
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,440
common and you know you can sort of look
 

4745
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,350
common and you know you can sort of look
for lensing events and then you say okay

4746
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
for lensing events and then you say okay
 

4747
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,030
for lensing events and then you say okay
maybe that's not so likely

4748
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040
maybe that's not so likely
 

4749
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,510
maybe that's not so likely
but you know that said i want to

4750
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
but you know that said i want to
 

4751
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,470
but you know that said i want to
emphasize that

4752
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
emphasize that
 

4753
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,270
emphasize that
there's a limit to what our calculations

4754
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
there's a limit to what our calculations
 

4755
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:11,910
there's a limit to what our calculations
uh

4756
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
uh
 

4757
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,669
uh
can tell you that's the orbit and the

4758
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
can tell you that's the orbit and the
 

4759
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,189
can tell you that's the orbit and the
mass so

4760
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
mass so
 

4761
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,270
mass so
i think there's a bunch like ed whitton

4762
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
i think there's a bunch like ed whitton
 

4763
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,390
i think there's a bunch like ed whitton
i think

4764
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
i think
 

4765
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,110
i think
wishes it's a black hole because i think

4766
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
wishes it's a black hole because i think
 

4767
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,709
wishes it's a black hole because i think
the one exciting things about black

4768
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:22,719
the one exciting things about black
 

4769
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:23,189
the one exciting things about black
holes

4770
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
holes
 

4771
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,830
holes
in our solar system is that we can go

4772
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
in our solar system is that we can go
 

4773
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,550
in our solar system is that we can go
there

4774
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:26,560
there
 

4775
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,790
there
and we can maybe study the singularity

4776
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,800
and we can maybe study the singularity
 

4777
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,470
and we can maybe study the singularity
somehow because that allows us to

4778
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:30,480
somehow because that allows us to
 

4779
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,990
somehow because that allows us to
understand some fundamental things about

4780
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
understand some fundamental things about
 

4781
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,110
understand some fundamental things about
physics

4782
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:33,120

if um it's a planet so planet nine

4784
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
if um it's a planet so planet nine
 

4785
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,870
if um it's a planet so planet nine
we may not you know and we go there we

4786
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
we may not you know and we go there we
 

4787
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,910
we may not you know and we go there we
may not discover

4788

anything profoundly new
 

4791
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,629
anything profoundly new
the interesting thing perhaps you can

4792
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
the interesting thing perhaps you can
 

4793
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,310
the interesting thing perhaps you can
correct me about planet nine

4794
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
correct me about planet nine
 

4795
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,790
correct me about planet nine
is like the big picture of it the whole

4796
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:48,800
is like the big picture of it the whole
 

4797
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,870
is like the big picture of it the whole
big story of the kuiper belt and all

4798
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
big story of the kuiper belt and all
 

4799
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,070
big story of the kuiper belt and all
those kinds of things

4800
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
those kinds of things
 

4801
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,149
those kinds of things
it's not that planet nine would be

4802
01:23:54,149 --> 01:23:54,159
it's not that planet nine would be
 

4803
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,990
it's not that planet nine would be
somehow fundamentally different

4804
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
somehow fundamentally different
 

4805
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,149
somehow fundamentally different
from um from i don't know neptune

4806
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
from um from i don't know neptune
 

4807
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,550
from um from i don't know neptune
in terms of um in terms of the kind of

4808
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:02,560
in terms of um in terms of the kind of
 

4809
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,070
in terms of um in terms of the kind of
things we can learn from it so i think

4810
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:04,080
things we can learn from it so i think
 

4811
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:04,390
things we can learn from it so i think
that

4812
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
that
 

4813
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,149
that
there's kind of a hope that it's a black

4814
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
there's kind of a hope that it's a black
 

4815
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:08,149
there's kind of a hope that it's a black
hole because it's an entirely new kind

4816
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
hole because it's an entirely new kind
 

4817
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,669
hole because it's an entirely new kind
of object maybe you can

4818
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
of object maybe you can
 

4819
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:13,030
of object maybe you can
uh correct me yeah i mean of course here

4820
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,040
uh correct me yeah i mean of course here
 

4821
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,990
uh correct me yeah i mean of course here

01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
you know
 

4827
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,070
you know
in planets around other stars and

4828
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
in planets around other stars and
 

4829
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,030
in planets around other stars and
i would say i would disagree that you

4830
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
i would say i would disagree that you
 

4831
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,550
i would say i would disagree that you
know we wouldn't find

01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
know we wouldn't find
 

4833
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,669
know we wouldn't find
things that would be truly you know

01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
things that would be truly you know
 

4835
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,629

fundamentally new new because as it

01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:30,639
fundamentally new new because as it
 

4837
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:31,669
fundamentally new new because as it
turns out

4838
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
turns out
 

4839
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,030
turns out
the the galaxy is really good at making

01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,040
the the galaxy is really good at making
 

4841
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,390
the the galaxy is really good at making
five or three earth mass objects right

4842
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:38,400
five or three earth mass objects right
 

4843
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,990
five or three earth mass objects right
the most common type of planet that we

4844
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
the most common type of planet that we
 

4845
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,790
the most common type of planet that we
see that we you know discover orbiting

4853
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,510

01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,950
if planet nine is a planet going there
will give us the closest window and to

01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:08,960
will give us the closest window and to

01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,229
will give us the closest window and to
understanding what

understanding what
 

4873
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:14,550
understanding what
other planets look like and um

4874
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
other planets look like and um
 

4875
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,709
other planets look like and um
i will you know i'll say this that you

4876
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
i will you know i'll say this that you
 

4877
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:17,830
i will you know i'll say this that you
know planets

4878
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
know planets
 

4879
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,750
know planets
kind of in terms of their complexity on

4880
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:19,760
kind of in terms of their complexity on
 

4881
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,830
kind of in terms of their complexity on
some logarithmic scale

4882
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
some logarithmic scale
 

4883
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,550
some logarithmic scale
fall somewhere between a star and an

4884
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,560
fall somewhere between a star and an
 

4885
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,510
fall somewhere between a star and an

insect
 

4887
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,870
insect
right an insect is way more complicated

4888
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:28,880
right an insect is way more complicated
 

4889
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,910
right an insect is way more complicated
than a star

4890
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
than a star
 

4891
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,790
than a star
right just there's all kinds of physical

4892
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:32,800
right just there's all kinds of physical
 

4893
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,310
right just there's all kinds of physical
processes and really

4894
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
processes and really
 

4895
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,030
processes and really
biochemical processes that occur inside

4896
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,040
biochemical processes that occur inside
 

4897
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,470
biochemical processes that occur inside
of an insect

4898
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,480
of an insect
 

4899
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,510
of an insect
that just make a star look like

4900
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
that just make a star look like
 

4901
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,669
that just make a star look like
you know somebody is like playing with

4902
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
you know somebody is like playing with
 

4903
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,030
you know somebody is like playing with
the spring or something yeah

4904
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
the spring or something yeah
 

4905
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,470
the spring or something yeah
right so the i i think

4906
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
right so the i i think
 

4907
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,830
right so the i i think
you know it would be you know arguably

4908
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:51,840
you know it would be you know arguably
 

4909
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,350
you know it would be you know arguably
you know more interesting to go to um

4910
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
you know more interesting to go to um
 

4911
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,430
you know more interesting to go to um
you know to go to planet nine if it's a

4912
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
you know to go to planet nine if it's a
 

4913
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,110
you know to go to planet nine if it's a
planet because black holes are simple

4914
01:25:59,110 --> 01:25:59,120
planet because black holes are simple
 

4915
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,390
planet because black holes are simple
they're just kind of

4916
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
they're just kind of
 

4917
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,590
they're just kind of
they're basically macroscopic like

4918
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
they're basically macroscopic like
 

4919
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,629
they're basically macroscopic like
particles yeah right and so just like

4920
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:06,639
particles yeah right and so just like
 

4921
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,310
particles yeah right and so just like
you mentioned in terms of complexity so

4922
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
you mentioned in terms of complexity so
 

4923
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,550
you mentioned in terms of complexity so
it's possible that planet nine

4924
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:10,560
it's possible that planet nine
 

4925
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,470
it's possible that planet nine
as opposed to being like homogeneous is

4926
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
as opposed to being like homogeneous is
 

4927
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,590
as opposed to being like homogeneous is
like super

4928
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
like super
 

4929
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,430
like super
like heterogeneous is a bunch of cool

4930
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440
like heterogeneous is a bunch of cool
 

4931
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,709
like heterogeneous is a bunch of cool
stuff going on absolutely

4932
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:16,719
stuff going on absolutely
 

4933
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,470
stuff going on absolutely
that could give us an intuition i never

4934
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,480
that could give us an intuition i never
 

4935
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,070
that could give us an intuition i never
thought about that that it's

4936
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080
thought about that that it's
 

4937
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,950
thought about that that it's
basically earth number two in terms of

4938
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
basically earth number two in terms of
 

4939
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,070
basically earth number two in terms of
size

4940
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,080
size
 

4941
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,390
size
and gives us starts giving us intuition

4942
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,400
and gives us starts giving us intuition
 

4943
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,709
and gives us starts giving us intuition
that could be generalizable to

4944
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:28,719
that could be generalizable to
 

4945
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,709
that could be generalizable to
earth-like planets elsewhere in the

4946
01:26:30,709 --> 01:26:30,719
earth-like planets elsewhere in the
 

4947
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,390
earth-like planets elsewhere in the
galaxy yeah pluto

4948
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:32,400
galaxy yeah pluto
 

4949
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,110
galaxy yeah pluto
is also in the sense like you know pluto

4950
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,120
is also in the sense like you know pluto
 

4951
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,990
is also in the sense like you know pluto
is a tiny tiny thing right just like

4952
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,000
is a tiny tiny thing right just like
 

4953
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,510
is a tiny tiny thing right just like
you would imagine there's just a tiny

4954
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
you would imagine there's just a tiny
 

4955
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,510
you would imagine there's just a tiny
ball of ice like who cares but the new

4956
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
ball of ice like who cares but the new
 

4957
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,310
ball of ice like who cares but the new
horizons

4958
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
horizons
 

4959
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,189
horizons
images of pluto reveal so much

4960
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199
images of pluto reveal so much
 

4961
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,870
images of pluto reveal so much
remarkable structure

4962
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:46,880
remarkable structure
 

4963
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,270
remarkable structure
right they reveal glaciers flowing and

4964
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
right they reveal glaciers flowing and
 

4965
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,070
right they reveal glaciers flowing and
these are glaciers

4966
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
these are glaciers
 

4967
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,990
these are glaciers
not made out of water ice but you know

4968
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
not made out of water ice but you know
 

4969
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,189
not made out of water ice but you know
co ice

4970
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
co ice
 

4971
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,470
co ice
it turns out at those temperatures

4972
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:56,480
it turns out at those temperatures
 

4973
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,070
it turns out at those temperatures
right of like 40 or so kelvin water ice

4974
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
right of like 40 or so kelvin water ice
 

4975
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,149
right of like 40 or so kelvin water ice
looks like metal right it doesn't flow

4976
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
looks like metal right it doesn't flow
 

4977
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,189
looks like metal right it doesn't flow
at all but then

4978
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:03,199
at all but then
 

4979
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,550
at all but then
ice made up of carbon monoxide

4980
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
ice made up of carbon monoxide
 

4981
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,149
ice made up of carbon monoxide
starts to flow i mean there's just like

4982
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
starts to flow i mean there's just like
 

4983
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,629
starts to flow i mean there's just like
all kinds of really cool

4984
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:10,639
all kinds of really cool
 

4985
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,830
all kinds of really cool
uh phenomena that you otherwise just

4986
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:13,840
uh phenomena that you otherwise just
 

4987
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,030
uh phenomena that you otherwise just
wouldn't really even imagine that occur

4988
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
wouldn't really even imagine that occur
 

4989
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,590
wouldn't really even imagine that occur
so yeah i mean there's a reason why i

4990
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:19,600
so yeah i mean there's a reason why i
 

4991
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,350
so yeah i mean there's a reason why i
like planets

4992
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,360
like planets
 

4993
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,110
like planets
well let me ask you i find uh

4994
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
well let me ask you i find uh
 

4995
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,990
well let me ask you i find uh
as i read the idea that edwin was

4996
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,000
as i read the idea that edwin was
 

4997
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,430
as i read the idea that edwin was
thinking about this kind of stuff

4998
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
thinking about this kind of stuff
 

4999
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,510
thinking about this kind of stuff
fascinating so he he's a mathematical

5000
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:31,520
fascinating so he he's a mathematical
 

5001
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,430
fascinating so he he's a mathematical
physicist

5002
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
physicist
 

5003
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,350
physicist
who's uh very interested in string

5004
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
who's uh very interested in string
 

5005
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,430
who's uh very interested in string
theory won the fields

5006
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
theory won the fields
 

5007
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,270
theory won the fields
metal for his work in mathematics

5008
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
metal for his work in mathematics
 

5009
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,910
metal for his work in mathematics
so i read that he proposed a fleet of

5010
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
so i read that he proposed a fleet of
 

5011
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,550
so i read that he proposed a fleet of
probes

5012
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
probes
 

5013
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,030
probes
accelerated by radiation pressure that

5014
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
accelerated by radiation pressure that
 

5015
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,189
accelerated by radiation pressure that
could discover a planet nine primordial

5016
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
could discover a planet nine primordial
 

5017
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:52,070
could discover a planet nine primordial
black holes location

5018
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
black holes location
 

5019
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,750
black holes location
uh what do you think about this idea of

5020
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
uh what do you think about this idea of
 

5021
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,990
uh what do you think about this idea of
sending a bunch of probes out there

5022
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:56,000
sending a bunch of probes out there
 

5023
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,830
sending a bunch of probes out there
yeah look the way the the idea is a cool

5024
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
yeah look the way the the idea is a cool
 

5025
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,390
yeah look the way the the idea is a cool
one

5026
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
one
 

5027
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,590
one
right you go and you say

5028
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,600
right you go and you say
 

5029
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,350
right you go and you say
you know launch them basically

5030
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,360
you know launch them basically
 

5031
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,910
you know launch them basically
isotropically you track where they go

5032
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
isotropically you track where they go
 

5033
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,950
isotropically you track where they go
and uh if i understand the idea

5034
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:10,960
and uh if i understand the idea
 

5035
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,510
and uh if i understand the idea
correctly you basically measure the

5036
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:13,520
correctly you basically measure the
 

5037
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,669
correctly you basically measure the
deflection and then you say okay there

5038
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
deflection and then you say okay there
 

5039
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:16,629
deflection and then you say okay there
must be

5040
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:16,639
must be
 

5041
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,669
must be
something there since the the

5042
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
something there since the the
 

5043
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,750
something there since the the
probe trajectories are being altered oh

5044
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
probe trajectories are being altered oh
 

5045
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,709
probe trajectories are being altered oh
so the measurement

5046
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
so the measurement
 

5047
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,430
so the measurement
the basic sensory mechanism is the it's

5048
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
the basic sensory mechanism is the it's
 

5049
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,189
the basic sensory mechanism is the it's
not like you have sensors on the probes

5050
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
not like you have sensors on the probes
 

5051
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,110
not like you have sensors on the probes
it's more like you're

5052
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
it's more like you're
 

5053
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,870
it's more like you're
because you're very precisely able to

5054
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
because you're very precisely able to
 

5055
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,030
because you're very precisely able to
capture to measure the trajectory of the

5056
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,040
capture to measure the trajectory of the
 

5057
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,070
capture to measure the trajectory of the
probes you can then

5058
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
probes you can then
 

5059
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,830
probes you can then
infer the gravitational fields and i

5060
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
infer the gravitational fields and i
 

5061
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,550
infer the gravitational fields and i
think i think that's the basic idea

5062
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
think i think that's the basic idea
 

5063
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,990
think i think that's the basic idea
um you know back a few years ago we

5064
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
um you know back a few years ago we
 

5065
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,030
um you know back a few years ago we
had conversations like these with um

5066
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,040
had conversations like these with um
 

5067
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,550
had conversations like these with um
you know engineers from jpl they

5068
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
you know engineers from jpl they
 

5069
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,669
you know engineers from jpl they
more or less convinced me that this is

5070
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
more or less convinced me that this is
 

5071
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,510
more or less convinced me that this is
much more difficult than it seems

5072
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
much more difficult than it seems
 

5073
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,870
much more difficult than it seems
because

5074
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
because
 

5075
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,270
because
you don't at that level of precision

5076
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:57,280
you don't at that level of precision
 

5077
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,550
you don't at that level of precision
right

5078
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,560
right
 

5079
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,629
right
things like solar flares matter right

5080
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
things like solar flares matter right
 

5081
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:01,590
things like solar flares matter right
solar flares

5082
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
solar flares
 

5083
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,149
solar flares
right are completely chaotic you can't

5084
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
right are completely chaotic you can't
 

5085
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,590
right are completely chaotic you can't
predict which

5086
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
predict which
 

5087
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,270
predict which
where a solar flare will happen that

5088
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:07,280
where a solar flare will happen that
 

5089
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,950
where a solar flare will happen that
will drive radiation

5090
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:08,960
will drive radiation
 

5091
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,110
will drive radiation
pressure gradients you don't know where

5092
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,120
pressure gradients you don't know where
 

5093
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,510
pressure gradients you don't know where
every single asteroid is so like

5094
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
every single asteroid is so like
 

5095
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,350
every single asteroid is so like
actually doing that problem

5096
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:17,360
actually doing that problem
 

5097
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,669
actually doing that problem
i think it's possible but it's it's not

5098
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:19,679
i think it's possible but it's it's not
 

5099
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:20,790
i think it's possible but it's it's not
a trivial matter

5100
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:20,800
a trivial matter
 

5101
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,990
a trivial matter
right well i wonder not just about

5102
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
right well i wonder not just about
 

5103
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,550
right well i wonder not just about
planet nine i wonder if that's kind of

5104
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
planet nine i wonder if that's kind of
 

5105
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,750
planet nine i wonder if that's kind of
the future

5106
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:27,760
the future
 

5107
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,790
the future
of doing science in our solar system

5108
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,800
of doing science in our solar system
 

5109
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,709
of doing science in our solar system
is to just launch a huge number of

5110
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:32,719
is to just launch a huge number of
 

5111
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,229
is to just launch a huge number of
probes so like a

5112
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:34,239
probes so like a
 

5113
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,790
probes so like a
whole order of magnitude many orders of

5114
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:36,800
whole order of magnitude many orders of
 

5115
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,550
whole order of magnitude many orders of
magnitude larger

5116
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
magnitude larger
 

5117
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,950
magnitude larger
numbers of probes and then starting for

5118
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:40,960
numbers of probes and then starting for
 

5119
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,310
numbers of probes and then starting for
a bunch of different stuff

5120
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:42,320
a bunch of different stuff
 

5121
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,709
a bunch of different stuff
not just gravity but everything else so

5122
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
not just gravity but everything else so
 

5123
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:45,669
not just gravity but everything else so
in this regard

5124
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
in this regard
 

5125
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,590
in this regard
i actually think there is a huge

5126
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:47,600
i actually think there is a huge
 

5127
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,510
i actually think there is a huge
revolution that's

5128
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,520
revolution that's
 

5129
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,149
revolution that's
to some extent already started right the

5130
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:52,159
to some extent already started right the
 

5131
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,430
to some extent already started right the
standard kind of like

5132
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
standard kind of like
 

5133
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,830
standard kind of like
time scale for a nasa mission is that

5134
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
time scale for a nasa mission is that
 

5135
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,709
time scale for a nasa mission is that
you like

5136
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
you like
 

5137
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,350
you like
propose it and it launches i don't know

5138
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
propose it and it launches i don't know
 

5139
01:29:59,360 --> 01:29:59,830
propose it and it launches i don't know
like

5140
01:29:59,830 --> 01:29:59,840
like
 

5141
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,390
like
150 years after you propose i'm over

5142
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
150 years after you propose i'm over
 

5143
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,510
150 years after you propose i'm over
exaggerating but

5144
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
exaggerating but
 

5145
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,750
exaggerating but
yeah you know it's just like some huge

5146
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:05,760
yeah you know it's just like some huge
 

5147
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,270
yeah you know it's just like some huge
development cycle

5148
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
development cycle
 

5149
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,270
development cycle
yeah and it gets delayed 55 times

5150
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,280
yeah and it gets delayed 55 times
 

5151
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,470
yeah and it gets delayed 55 times
like that is not going away

5152
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
like that is not going away
 

5153
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,270
like that is not going away
yeah right the the really cutting edge

5154
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
yeah right the the really cutting edge
 

5155
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,070
yeah right the the really cutting edge
things

5156
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,080
things
 

5157
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,669
things
you have to do it this way because you

5158
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
you have to do it this way because you
 

5159
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,189
you have to do it this way because you
don't know what you're building so to

5160
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
don't know what you're building so to
 

5161
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:21,990
don't know what you're building so to
speak

5162
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,000
speak
 

5163
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,510
speak
but the cubesat kind of world

5164
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
but the cubesat kind of world
 

5165
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,110
but the cubesat kind of world
is starting to um you know provide an

5166
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,120
is starting to um you know provide an
 

5167
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,110
is starting to um you know provide an
avenue for like

5168
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,120
avenue for like
 

5169
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,709
avenue for like
you know launching something that costs

5170
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:32,719
you know launching something that costs
 

5171
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,390
you know launching something that costs
you know a few million dollars

5172
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:34,400
you know a few million dollars
 

5173
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,189
you know a few million dollars
and has a turnaround time scale of like

5174
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:37,199
and has a turnaround time scale of like
 

5175
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,189
and has a turnaround time scale of like
a couple years you can imagine doing

5176
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
a couple years you can imagine doing
 

5177
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:42,390
a couple years you can imagine doing
you know phd theses where you design the

5178
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
you know phd theses where you design the
 

5179
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,030
you know phd theses where you design the
mission

5180
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,040
mission
 

5181
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,870
mission
the mission goes to where you're going

5182
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:44,880
the mission goes to where you're going
 

5183
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,070
the mission goes to where you're going
and you do the science

5184
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
and you do the science
 

5185
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,189
and you do the science
all within a time span of five six years

5186
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:49,199
all within a time span of five six years
 

5187
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:53,189
all within a time span of five six years
that is has not been fully executed on

5188
01:30:53,189 --> 01:30:53,199
that is has not been fully executed on
 

5189
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,430
that is has not been fully executed on
yet but i absolutely think that's on the

5190
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:55,440
yet but i absolutely think that's on the
 

5191
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,189
yet but i absolutely think that's on the
horizon and we're not talking

5192
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:57,199
horizon and we're not talking
 

5193
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:59,350
horizon and we're not talking
a decade i think we're talking like this

5194
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
a decade i think we're talking like this
 

5195
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,229
a decade i think we're talking like this
decade

5196
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239
decade
 

5197
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,070
decade
yeah and the company is accelerating all

5198
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:02,080
yeah and the company is accelerating all
 

5199
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,350
yeah and the company is accelerating all
this uh

5200
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:03,360
this uh
 

5201
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,350
this uh
with uh blue origin and and uh spacex

5202
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,360
with uh blue origin and and uh spacex
 

5203
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,590
with uh blue origin and and uh spacex
there's a bunch of more cubesat oriented

5204
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:09,600
there's a bunch of more cubesat oriented
 

5205
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,590
there's a bunch of more cubesat oriented
companies that are pushing this forward

5206
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
companies that are pushing this forward
 

5207
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,310
companies that are pushing this forward
uh well let me ask you let me ask you on

5208
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:14,320
uh well let me ask you let me ask you on
 

5209
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,790
uh well let me ask you let me ask you on
that topic what do you think about

5210
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
that topic what do you think about
 

5211
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,990
that topic what do you think about
either one elon musk with spacex

5212
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:20,000
either one elon musk with spacex
 

5213
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,870
either one elon musk with spacex
uh going to mars i think he wants spacex

5214
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
uh going to mars i think he wants spacex
 

5215
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,669
uh going to mars i think he wants spacex
to be the first

5216
01:31:23,669 --> 01:31:23,679
to be the first
 

5217
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:28,070
to be the first

i'm not tracking this closely but i

5238
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
i'm not tracking this closely but i

think i am
 

5241
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,310
think i am
familiar with folks who built their own

5242
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
familiar with folks who built their own
 

5243
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,470
familiar with folks who built their own
rocket to try to prove the earth is flat

5244
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:54,480
rocket to try to prove the earth is flat
 

5245
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,910
rocket to try to prove the earth is flat
yes that's the guy i'm talking about

5246
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
yes that's the guy i'm talking about
 

5247
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,590
yes that's the guy i'm talking about
yeah he was also like he also jumped

5248
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
yeah he was also like he also jumped
 

5249
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,350
yeah he was also like he also jumped
some limousine yeah

5250
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,360
some limousine yeah
 

5251
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,430
some limousine yeah
for truly revolutionary minds

5252
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:03,440
for truly revolutionary minds
 

5253
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,270
for truly revolutionary minds
uh greater men than either you or i

5254
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
uh greater men than either you or i
 

5255
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,470
uh greater men than either you or i
but yeah so look it's been

5256
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:10,480
but yeah so look it's been
 

5257
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,350
but yeah so look it's been
astonishing to watch how really over the

5258
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,360
astonishing to watch how really over the
 

5259
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,070
astonishing to watch how really over the
last like

5260
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,080
last like
 

5261
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,270
last like
decade the commercial sector

5262
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:17,280
decade the commercial sector
 

5263
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,470
decade the commercial sector
took over this uh you know

5264
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,480
took over this uh you know
 

5265
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,030
took over this uh you know
this industry that traditionally has

5266
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
this industry that traditionally has
 

5267
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:23,910
this industry that traditionally has
really been like

5268
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
really been like
 

5269
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,590
really been like
a you know a government thing to do um

5270
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:27,600
a you know a government thing to do um
 

5271
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,590
a you know a government thing to do um
motivated primarily by the the

5272
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,600
motivated primarily by the the
 

5273
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,350
motivated primarily by the the
competition between nations like the

5274
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
competition between nations like the
 

5275
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,149
competition between nations like the
cold war

5276
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
cold war
 

5277
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:35,430
cold war
sure and now it's motivated more

5278
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:35,440
sure and now it's motivated more
 

5279
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,990
sure and now it's motivated more
more and more by the natural forces of

5280
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,000
more and more by the natural forces of
 

5281
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,110
more and more by the natural forces of
capitalism yes

5282
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
capitalism yes
 

5283
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,149
capitalism yes
that's right so um okay here

5284
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,159
that's right so um okay here
 

5285
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,070
that's right so um okay here
i have i have many ideas about i think

5286
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:44,080
i have i have many ideas about i think
 

5287
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,350
i have i have many ideas about i think
on the one hand right

5288
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
on the one hand right
 

5289
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,750
on the one hand right
like what spacex has been able to do for

5290
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:47,760
like what spacex has been able to do for
 

5291
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,270
like what spacex has been able to do for
example phenomenal

5292
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,280
example phenomenal
 

5293
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,350
example phenomenal
um if that brings down

5294
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:53,360
um if that brings down
 

5295
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,590
um if that brings down
the price of spacex within that

5296
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
the price of spacex within that
 

5297
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,189
the price of spacex within that
turnaround time scale for space

5298
01:32:57,189 --> 01:32:57,199
turnaround time scale for space
 

5299
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,910
turnaround time scale for space
exploration which i think it inevitably

5300
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
exploration which i think it inevitably
 

5301
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,189
exploration which i think it inevitably
will um that's a huge you know that's a

5302
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
will um that's a huge you know that's a
 

5303
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:03,990
will um that's a huge you know that's a
huge boost

5304
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,000
huge boost
 

5305
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,870
huge boost
to the to the human condition the same

5306
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
to the to the human condition the same
 

5307
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,270
to the to the human condition the same
time

5308
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:07,280
time
 

5309
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,510
time
right if we're talking astronomy right

5310
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:09,520
right if we're talking astronomy right
 

5311
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,110
right if we're talking astronomy right
there they're also

5312
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:11,120
there they're also
 

5313
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,669
there they're also
it comes at a huge cost right and the

5314
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:13,679
it comes at a huge cost right and the
 

5315
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,669
it comes at a huge cost right and the
starling satellites is a great example

5316
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:15,679
starling satellites is a great example
 

5317
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,990
starling satellites is a great example
of that cost right at one point uh

5318
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
of that cost right at one point uh
 

5319
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,030
of that cost right at one point uh
in fact i was just camping and the

5320
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,040
in fact i was just camping and the
 

5321
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,149
in fact i was just camping and the
mojave was a

5322
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:22,159
mojave was a
 

5323
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,629
mojave was a
with a friend of mine and they saw you

5324
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:24,639
with a friend of mine and they saw you
 

5325
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:25,189
with a friend of mine and they saw you
know

5326
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
know
 

5327
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,270
know
this uh the string of satellites just

5328
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:27,280
this uh the string of satellites just
 

5329
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,790
this uh the string of satellites just
kind of like

5330
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
kind of like
 

5331
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,669
kind of like
you know appear and then disappear uh

5332
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
you know appear and then disappear uh
 

5333
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,110
you know appear and then disappear uh
into nowhere so that

5334
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
into nowhere so that
 

5335
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,510
into nowhere so that
is beginning to interfere with you know

5336
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
is beginning to interfere with you know
 

5337
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,669
is beginning to interfere with you know
earth-based observations so

5338
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
earth-based observations so
 

5339
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,830
earth-based observations so
i think it's there's tremendous

5340
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840
i think it's there's tremendous
 

5341
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,950
i think it's there's tremendous
potential there

5342
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:40,960
potential there
 

5343
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,709
potential there
it's also important to be responsible

5344
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
it's also important to be responsible
 

5345
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,870
it's also important to be responsible
about how it's executed

5346
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
about how it's executed
 

5347
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,550
about how it's executed
now with mars and the whole idea of you

5348
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:48,560
now with mars and the whole idea of you
 

5349
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,629
now with mars and the whole idea of you
know exploring mars

5350
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
know exploring mars
 

5351
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,870
know exploring mars
right i don't have like strong opinions

5352
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880
right i don't have like strong opinions
 

5353
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,629
right i don't have like strong opinions
on whether a manned mission

5354
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:54,639
on whether a manned mission
 

5355
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,470
on whether a manned mission
is is required or not required

5356
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
is is required or not required
 

5357
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:02,310
is is required or not required
um but i do think you know

5358
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:02,320
um but i do think you know
 

5359
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,870
um but i do think you know
we need to focus the thing to keep in

5360
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:04,880
we need to focus the thing to keep in
 

5361
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:05,590
we need to focus the thing to keep in
mind is that

5362
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,600
mind is that
 

5363
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,709
mind is that
i i generally kind of

5364
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
i i generally kind of
 

5365
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,790
i i generally kind of
uh i'm not signed on if it will to the

5366
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:10,800
uh i'm not signed on if it will to the
 

5367
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,870
uh i'm not signed on if it will to the
idea that mars is some kind of a safe

5368
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
idea that mars is some kind of a safe
 

5369
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,149
idea that mars is some kind of a safe
haven that we can

5370
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
haven that we can
 

5371
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:17,669
haven that we can
uh you know escape to right

5372
01:34:17,669 --> 01:34:17,679
uh you know escape to right
 

5373
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:20,790
uh you know escape to right
mars sucks right like living on mars if

5374
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:20,800
mars sucks right like living on mars if
 

5375
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:21,110
mars sucks right like living on mars if
you

5376
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
you
 

5377
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,229
you
if you want to live on mars like you can

5378
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:24,239
if you want to live on mars like you can
 

5379
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,590
if you want to live on mars like you can
have that experience

5380

have that experience
 

5381
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,669
have that experience
by going to the mojave desert and

5382
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
by going to the mojave desert and
 

5383
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,070
by going to the mojave desert and
camping and it's just like

5384
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
camping and it's just like
 

5385
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,070
camping and it's just like
it's it's just not a great well it's

right not like okay we went to the moon

5472
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
right not like okay we went to the moon
 

5473
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:04,310
right not like okay we went to the moon
therefore

5474

therefore
 

5475
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,070
therefore
some person here has thought of this and

5476
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:06,080
some person here has thought of this and
 

5477
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,550
some person here has thought of this and
yes in in that similar sense

5478
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:08,560
yes in in that similar sense
 

5479
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,910
yes in in that similar sense
i think you know space exploration is

5480
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:11,920
i think you know space exploration is
 

5481
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,430
i think you know space exploration is
there's something there's some real

5482

there's something there's some real
 

5483
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,270
there's something there's some real
magnetism about it

5484
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:15,280
magnetism about it
 

5485
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,510
magnetism about it
and it's on a genetic level right like

5486
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
and it's on a genetic level right like
 

5487
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,790
and it's on a genetic level right like
we have this

5488
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:18,800
we have this
 

5489
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,590
we have this
need to keep exploring right when we're

5490
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
need to keep exploring right when we're
 

5491
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:22,310
need to keep exploring right when we're
done

5492
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
done
 

5493

uh with a certain frontier we move on to

5494
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:25,360
uh with a certain frontier we move on to
 

5495
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,669
uh with a certain frontier we move on to
the next frontier all that i'm saying

5496
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:27,679
the next frontier all that i'm saying
 

5497
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,310
the next frontier all that i'm saying
is that i'm not moving to mars to live

5498
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
is that i'm not moving to mars to live
 

5499
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,510
is that i'm not moving to mars to live
there permanently

5500
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:31,520
there permanently
 

5501
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,590
there permanently
uh ever you know and i think that you

5502
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
uh ever you know and i think that you
 

5503
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,430
uh ever you know and i think that you
know i'm glad you paid

5504
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:35,440
know i'm glad you paid
 

5505
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,390
know i'm glad you paid
you you noted the kind of degradation of

5506
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
you you noted the kind of degradation of
 

5507
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,189
you you noted the kind of degradation of
the earth

5508
01:36:39,189 --> 01:36:39,199
the earth
 

5509
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,629
the earth
right i think that is a true kind of

5510
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
right i think that is a true kind of
 

5511
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,950
right i think that is a true kind of
the leading order challenge of our great

5512
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
the leading order challenge of our great
 

5513
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:45,990
the leading order challenge of our great
engineering that's

5514
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
engineering that's
 

5515
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,669
engineering that's
a bunch of a bunch of engineering

5516
01:36:47,669 --> 01:36:47,679
a bunch of a bunch of engineering
 

5517
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,510
a bunch of a bunch of engineering
problems i'm most interested in this

5518
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:49,520
problems i'm most interested in this
 

5519
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,629
problems i'm most interested in this
space because as i've read extensively

5520
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
space because as i've read extensively
 

5521
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,310
space because as i've read extensively
it's apparently very difficult to have

5522
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:54,320
it's apparently very difficult to have
 

5523
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,750
it's apparently very difficult to have
sex in space

5524
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:55,760
sex in space
 

5525
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,270
sex in space
and so i just want that problem to be

5526
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:57,280
and so i just want that problem to be
 

5527
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,790
and so i just want that problem to be
solved because i think

5528
01:36:58,790 --> 01:36:58,800
solved because i think
 

5529
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,950
solved because i think
once we solve the sex and space problem

5530
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:00,960
once we solve the sex and space problem
 

5531
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,350
once we solve the sex and space problem
we'll revolutionize sex here on earth

5532
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
we'll revolutionize sex here on earth
 

5533
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,990
we'll revolutionize sex here on earth
thereby increasing the fun on earth and

5534
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
thereby increasing the fun on earth and
 

5535
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,629
thereby increasing the fun on earth and
um

5536
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:06,639
um
 

5537
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,470
um
the consequences of that can only be

5538
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:08,480
the consequences of that can only be
 

5539
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,070
the consequences of that can only be
good i mean you can

5540
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
good i mean you can
 

5541

5543
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,709
you've got a clear plan right and and it
sounds like uh yeah i'm submitting

5544
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
sounds like uh yeah i'm submitting
 

5545

sounds like uh yeah i'm submitting
proposals to nasa as we said that's

5546
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
proposals to nasa as we said that's
 

5547
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,470
proposals to nasa as we said that's
right

5548
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
right
 

5549
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,470
right
i keep getting rejected i don't know why

5550
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:20,480
i keep getting rejected i don't know why
 

5551
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,910
i keep getting rejected i don't know why
okay

5552
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
okay
 

5553
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,229
okay
uh you need better diagrams better

5554
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
uh you need better diagrams better
 

5555
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,189
uh you need better diagrams better
better pictures

5556
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:25,199
better pictures
 

5557
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,790
better pictures
i should have thought of that you a

5558
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
i should have thought of that you a
 

5559
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,229
i should have thought of that you a
while ago mentioned that

5560
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
while ago mentioned that
 

5561
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,990
while ago mentioned that
you know there's certain aspects in the

5562
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
you know there's certain aspects in the
 

5563
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,390
you know there's certain aspects in the
history of the solar system and earth

5564
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
history of the solar system and earth
 

5565
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,550
history of the solar system and earth
that resulted that it could have

5566
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
that resulted that it could have
 

5567
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,510
that resulted that it could have
resulted in an

5568
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
resulted in an
 

5569
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,790
resulted in an
opaque atmosphere but it didn't

5570
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:38,800
opaque atmosphere but it didn't
 

5571
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,629
opaque atmosphere but it didn't
we couldn't see the stars um

5572
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
we couldn't see the stars um
 

5573
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,270
we couldn't see the stars um
and uh somebody mentioned to me a little

5574
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:45,280
and uh somebody mentioned to me a little
 

5575
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,310
and uh somebody mentioned to me a little
bit ago

5576
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
bit ago
 

5577
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,590
bit ago
it's almost like a philosophical

5578
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:47,600
it's almost like a philosophical
 

5579
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,350
it's almost like a philosophical
question for you do you think

5580
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
question for you do you think
 

5581
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,430
question for you do you think
humans like human society would develop

5582
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,440
humans like human society would develop
 

5583
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,790
humans like human society would develop
as it did or at all if we couldn't see

5584
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
as it did or at all if we couldn't see
 

5585
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,750
as it did or at all if we couldn't see
the stars

5586
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
the stars
 

5587
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,790
the stars
it would be drastically different

5588
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
it would be drastically different
 

5589
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,910
it would be drastically different
just dr if it ever did develop so i

5590
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:05,920
just dr if it ever did develop so i
 

5591
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,149
just dr if it ever did develop so i
think some of the early developments

5592
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
think some of the early developments
 

5593
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:11,590
think some of the early developments
right of like fire and you know fire

5594
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:11,600
right of like fire and you know fire
 

5595
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,270
right of like fire and you know fire
you know first of all that atmosphere

5596
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
you know first of all that atmosphere
 

5597
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,270
you know first of all that atmosphere
would be so hot because you know if you

5598
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
would be so hot because you know if you
 

5599
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,550
would be so hot because you know if you
have an opaque

5600
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,560
have an opaque
 

5601
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,070
have an opaque
atmosphere the temperature at the bottom

5602
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:20,080
atmosphere the temperature at the bottom
 

5603
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,350
atmosphere the temperature at the bottom
is is huge um so we would

5604
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:23,360
is is huge um so we would
 

5605
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,590
is is huge um so we would
be very different beings to start with

5606
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:25,600
be very different beings to start with
 

5607
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,350
be very different beings to start with
we'd have it could be cloudy in certain

5608
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
we'd have it could be cloudy in certain
 

5609
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,270
we'd have it could be cloudy in certain
kinds of ways that you could still get

5610
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,280
kinds of ways that you could still get
 

5611
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,350
kinds of ways that you could still get
okay think about like uh like a

5612
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:31,360
okay think about like uh like a
 

5613
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,669
okay think about like uh like a
greenhouse right a greenhouse

5614
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
greenhouse right a greenhouse
 

5615
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,550
greenhouse right a greenhouse
is cloudy effectively uh but it's it's

5616
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
is cloudy effectively uh but it's it's
 

5617
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,669
is cloudy effectively uh but it's it's
super hot

5618
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:37,679
super hot
 

5619
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,629
super hot
um yeah it's hard to avoid having an

5620
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:40,639
um yeah it's hard to avoid having an
 

5621
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:41,830
um yeah it's hard to avoid having an
atmosphere if you have an

5622
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:41,840
atmosphere if you have an
 

5623
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,229
atmosphere if you have an
opaque atmosphere it's hard to right

5624
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:44,239
opaque atmosphere it's hard to right
 

5625
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:45,830
opaque atmosphere it's hard to right
venus is a great example

5626
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:45,840
venus is a great example
 

5627
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,550
venus is a great example
right venus is i don't remember exactly

5628
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
right venus is i don't remember exactly
 

5629
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,750
right venus is i don't remember exactly
how many degrees

5630
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:49,760
how many degrees
 

5631
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,790
how many degrees
and but it's hundreds in celsius right

5632
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
and but it's hundreds in celsius right
 

5633
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,870
and but it's hundreds in celsius right
it's not a hundred it's hundreds

5634
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
it's not a hundred it's hundreds
 

5635
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,709
it's not a hundred it's hundreds
uh even though it's only a little bit

5636
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
uh even though it's only a little bit
 

5637
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,709
uh even though it's only a little bit
closer to the sun that temperature

5638
01:38:58,709 --> 01:38:58,719
closer to the sun that temperature
 

5639
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,310
closer to the sun that temperature
is entirely coming from the fact that

5640
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320
is entirely coming from the fact that
 

5641
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,310
is entirely coming from the fact that
the atmosphere is thick so it's just a

5642
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
the atmosphere is thick so it's just a
 

5643
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,669
the atmosphere is thick so it's just a
sauna of sorts

5644
01:39:03,669 --> 01:39:03,679
sauna of sorts
 

5645
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,310
sauna of sorts
yeah yeah you go there you know you feel

5646
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
yeah yeah you go there you know you feel
 

5647
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,750
yeah yeah you go there you know you feel
refreshed after you come back

5648
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
refreshed after you come back
 

5649
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,870
refreshed after you come back
you know but if you stay there i mean so

5650
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
you know but if you stay there i mean so
 

5651
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,790
you know but if you stay there i mean so
okay take that as an assumption

5652
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
okay take that as an assumption
 

5653
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,550
okay take that as an assumption
this is a philosophical question not a

5654
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:14,560
this is a philosophical question not a
 

5655
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,470
this is a philosophical question not a
biological one so you have a life that

5656
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:16,480
biological one so you have a life that
 

5657
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,830
biological one so you have a life that
develops under these

5658
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:17,840
develops under these
 

5659
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,750
develops under these
extremely hot conditions yeah so let's

5660
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760
extremely hot conditions yeah so let's
 

5661
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,270
extremely hot conditions yeah so let's
see so much of

5662
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,280
see so much of
 

5663
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,550
see so much of
the early evolution of mankind

5664
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:24,560
the early evolution of mankind
 

5665
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:28,070
the early evolution of mankind
uh was driven by exploration yeah right

5666
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
uh was driven by exploration yeah right
 

5667
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,149
uh was driven by exploration yeah right
and the kind of interest and stars

5668
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:32,159
and the kind of interest and stars
 

5669
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:35,350
and the kind of interest and stars
originated in part as a tool

5670
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360
originated in part as a tool
 

5671
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,470
originated in part as a tool
to guide that exploration right i mean

5672
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
to guide that exploration right i mean
 

5673
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,149
to guide that exploration right i mean
that in itself i think would be a huge

5674
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
that in itself i think would be a huge
 

5675
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,390
that in itself i think would be a huge
uh you know a huge differential in the

5676
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,400
uh you know a huge differential in the
 

5677
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,910
uh you know a huge differential in the
way that we

5678
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
way that we
 

5679
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,149
way that we
you know our our our evolution on this

5680
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
you know our our our evolution on this
 

5681
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:48,950
you know our our our evolution on this
planet

5682
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:48,960
planet
 

5683
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,669
planet
yes i mean stars is that's brilliant so

5684
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:51,679
yes i mean stars is that's brilliant so
 

5685
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,149
yes i mean stars is that's brilliant so
even in that aspect but even in further

5686
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
even in that aspect but even in further
 

5687
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,510
even in that aspect but even in further
aspects

5688
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:55,520
aspects
 

5689
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,350
aspects
uh astronomy just shows up in basically

5690
01:39:59,350 --> 01:39:59,360
uh astronomy just shows up in basically
 

5691
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,430
uh astronomy just shows up in basically
every single development in the history

5692
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
every single development in the history
 

5693
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,990
every single development in the history
of science up until the 20th century

5694
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
of science up until the 20th century
 

5695
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,950
of science up until the 20th century
it shows up so i wonder without that if

5696
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
it shows up so i wonder without that if
 

5697
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,470
it shows up so i wonder without that if
we had we would have

5698
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
we had we would have
 

5699
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,709
we had we would have
if we would even get like calculus yeah

5700
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
if we would even get like calculus yeah
 

5701
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,070
if we would even get like calculus yeah
look that's a great

beyond just astronomy right there there
are questions

5776
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:30,400
are questions
 

5777
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,910
are questions
like why do we need to spend money on

5778
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:33,920
like why do we need to spend money on
 

5779
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,030
like why do we need to spend money on

patterns of uh penguins yeah that's like

5784
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:44,080
patterns of uh penguins yeah that's like
 

5785
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,270
patterns of uh penguins yeah that's like
essential that's right um i think

5786
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
essential that's right um i think
 

5787
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,070
essential that's right um i think
you know there's a tremendous uh

you know there's a tremendous uh
 

5789
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,229
you know there's a tremendous uh
underappreciation for the usefulness

underappreciation for the usefulness
 

5791
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,149
underappreciation for the usefulness
of useless knowledge right i mean

5792
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
of useless knowledge right i mean
 

5793
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,149
of useless knowledge right i mean
uh that's brilliant i didn't come up

guys can
have this conversation right that that

5824
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
have this conversation right that that
 

5825
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,470
have this conversation right that that
wasn't at no

5826
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:32,480
wasn't at no
 

5827
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,950
wasn't at no
at no point was that the motivation and

5828
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
at no point was that the motivation and
 

5829
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,830
at no point was that the motivation and
yet

5830
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:35,840
yet
 

5831
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,950
yet
you know it gave us the world that we

5832
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:38,960
you know it gave us the world that we
 

5833
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,950
you know it gave us the world that we
have today and the answer is if you

5834
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
have today and the answer is if you
 

5835
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,070
have today and the answer is if you
a purely pragmatic person if you don't

5836
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:44,080
a purely pragmatic person if you don't
 

5837
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,750
a purely pragmatic person if you don't
care at all about kind of the human

5838
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:45,760
care at all about kind of the human
 

5839
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,270
care at all about kind of the human
condition none of this

5840
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:47,280
condition none of this
 

5841
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,870
condition none of this
the answer is uh you can tax it

5842
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
the answer is uh you can tax it
 

5843
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,790
the answer is uh you can tax it
right like the useless things

5844
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:54,800
right like the useless things
 

5845
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,950
right like the useless things
have been have created way more capital

5846
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:58,960
have been have created way more capital
 

5847
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,590
have been have created way more capital
than useful things and the sad thing i

5848
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:01,600
than useful things and the sad thing i
 

5849
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:01,990
than useful things and the sad thing i
mean

5850
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
mean
 

5851
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,830
mean
first of all it's really important to

5852
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
first of all it's really important to
 

5853
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,510
first of all it's really important to
think about and it's

5854
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,520
think about and it's
 

5855
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,709
think about and it's
brilliant in the in the following

5856
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
brilliant in the in the following
 

5857

01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
of military-based funding in the
 

5865
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,270
of military-based funding in the
development of science

5866
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:17,280
development of science
 

5867
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,870
development of science
and then so much of technological

5868
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:20,880
and then so much of technological
 

5869
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,030
and then so much of technological
breakthroughs in the 20th century

5870
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:23,040
breakthroughs in the 20th century
 

5871
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,470
breakthroughs in the 20th century
had to do with humans working on

5872
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:26,480
had to do with humans working on
 

5873
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,229
had to do with humans working on
different military things

5874
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
different military things
 

5875
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,070
different military things
and then the outcome of that had nothing

5876
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,080
and then the outcome of that had nothing
 

5877
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,990
and then the outcome of that had nothing
to do with military it had some military

5878
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,000
to do with military it had some military
 

5879
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,669
to do with military it had some military
application but

5880
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
application but
 

5881
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:35,750
application but
their impact was much much bigger than

5882
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:35,760
their impact was much much bigger than
 

5883
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,149
their impact was much much bigger than
the military the splitting of the atom

5884
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
the military the splitting of the atom
 

5885
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,189
the military the splitting of the atom
is is a kind of a canonical example of

5886
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
is is a kind of a canonical example of
 

5887
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,189
is is a kind of a canonical example of
this we all know the tragedy that

5888
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
this we all know the tragedy that
 

5889
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,270
this we all know the tragedy that
you know arises from splitting of the

5890
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:45,280
you know arises from splitting of the
 

5891
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,669
you know arises from splitting of the
atom and and yet you know

5892
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:47,679
atom and and yet you know
 

5893
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:51,430
atom and and yet you know
so much i mean the atom itself

5894
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
so much i mean the atom itself
 

5895
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,350
so much i mean the atom itself
does not care for what purpose it is

5896
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
does not care for what purpose it is
 

5897
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,470
does not care for what purpose it is
being split

5898
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:54,480
being split
 

5899
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,270
being split
so so i wonder if if we you take took

5900
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,280
so so i wonder if if we you take took
 

5901
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,870
so so i wonder if if we you take took
the same amount of funding as we used

5902
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
the same amount of funding as we used
 

5903
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,750
the same amount of funding as we used
for war

5904
01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,760
for war
 

5905
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,790
for war
and poured it into like totally

5906
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
and poured it into like totally
 

5907
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,510
and poured it into like totally
seemingly

5908
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:03,520
seemingly
 

5909
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,430
seemingly
useless things like the mating patterns

5910
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,440
useless things like the mating patterns
 

5911
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,550
useless things like the mating patterns
of penguins

5912
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
of penguins
 

5913
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,950
of penguins
we would get the internet anyway i i

5914
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
we would get the internet anyway i i
 

5915
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,310
we would get the internet anyway i i
think so i think so

5916
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:10,320
think so i think so
 

5917
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,790
think so i think so
and uh you know perhaps more of the

5918
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:12,800
and uh you know perhaps more of the
 

5919
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,510
and uh you know perhaps more of the
internet

5920
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:13,520
internet
 

5921
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,470
internet
would have uh would have penguins you

5922
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
would have uh would have penguins you
 

5923
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,510
would have uh would have penguins you
know

5924
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
know
 

5925
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,669
know
so we're both joking but in some sense

5926
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
so we're both joking but in some sense
 

5927
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:20,550
so we're both joking but in some sense
like

5928
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:20,560
like
 

5929
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,790
like
i wonder it's not the the penguins

5930
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:22,800
i wonder it's not the the penguins
 

5931
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,070
i wonder it's not the the penguins
because penguins is more about

5932
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:24,080
because penguins is more about
 

5933
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,350
because penguins is more about
sort of biology but all useless kind of

5934
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
sort of biology but all useless kind of
 

5935
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,270
sort of biology but all useless kind of
tinkering and all kinds of

5936
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,280
tinkering and all kinds of
 

5937
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,629
tinkering and all kinds of
uh in all kinds of avenues

5938
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
uh in all kinds of avenues
 

5939
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,030
uh in all kinds of avenues
and also because military applications

5940
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
and also because military applications
 

5941
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,790
and also because military applications
are often

5942
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
are often
 

5943
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,990
are often
um burdened by the secrecy required

5944
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,000
um burdened by the secrecy required
 

5945
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,669
um burdened by the secrecy required
so it's often like so much uh

5946
01:44:43,669 --> 01:44:43,679
so it's often like so much uh
 

5947
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,149
so it's often like so much uh
the openness is lacking and if we

5948
01:44:46,149 --> 01:44:46,159
the openness is lacking and if we
 

5949
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:47,430
the openness is lacking and if we
learned anything from the last few

5950
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,440
learned anything from the last few
 

5951
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,550
learned anything from the last few
decades is that

5952
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
decades is that
 

5953
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,669
decades is that
when there's openness and science that

5954
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
when there's openness and science that
 

5955
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,590
when there's openness and science that
accelerates the development of science

5956
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:53,600
accelerates the development of science
 

5957
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,189
accelerates the development of science
that's right that's true

5958
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
that's right that's true
 

5959
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:58,629
that's right that's true
the openness of science truly

5960
01:44:58,629 --> 01:44:58,639
the openness of science truly
 

5961
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,350
the openness of science truly
you know it benefits everybody the

5962
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
you know it benefits everybody the
 

5963
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,070
you know it benefits everybody the
notion that

5964
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,080
notion that
 

5965
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,709
notion that
if you know i share my science with you

5966
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
if you know i share my science with you
 

5967
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:06,870
if you know i share my science with you
then you're gonna catch up and like

5968
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
then you're gonna catch up and like
 

5969
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,350
then you're gonna catch up and like
know the same thing that is a

5970
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
know the same thing that is a
 

5971
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,350
know the same thing that is a
short-sighted viewpoint because if you

5972
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:11,360
short-sighted viewpoint because if you
 

5973
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,070
short-sighted viewpoint because if you
catch up

5974
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
catch up
 

5975
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,430
catch up
and you open you know

5976
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,440
and you open you know
 

5977
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,830
and you open you know
you you discover something that puts me

5978
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
you you discover something that puts me
 

5979
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,270
you you discover something that puts me
in a position to do

5980
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:19,280
in a position to do
 

5981
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,229
in a position to do
the next step right it's just so i

5982
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,239
the next step right it's just so i
 

5983
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:23,510
the next step right it's just so i
absolutely agree

5984
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:23,520
absolutely agree
 

5985
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,030
absolutely agree
with um with all this i mean uh

5986
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:27,040
with um with all this i mean uh
 

5987
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,750
with um with all this i mean uh
the kind of question of like military

5988
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:29,760
the kind of question of like military
 

5989
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,910
the kind of question of like military
funding versus non-military funding is

5990
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
funding versus non-military funding is
 

5991
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,870
funding versus non-military funding is
is obviously a complicated one but at

5992
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
is obviously a complicated one but at
 

5993
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,030
is obviously a complicated one but at
the end of the day i think we have to

5994
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
the end of the day i think we have to
 

5995
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:37,430
the end of the day i think we have to
get

5996
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,440
get
 

5997
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,109
get
over the notion as a society

5998
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
over the notion as a society
 

5999
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:44,390
over the notion as a society
that we are going to you know pay for

6000
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
that we are going to you know pay for
 

6001
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,189
that we are going to you know pay for
this

6002
01:45:45,189 --> 01:45:45,199
this
 

6003
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:47,990
this
and then we will get that right that's

6004
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000
and then we will get that right that's
 

6005
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,390
and then we will get that right that's
true

6006
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:48,400
true
 

6007
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,430
true
if you're buying like i don't know

6008
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
if you're buying like i don't know
 

6009
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,270
if you're buying like i don't know
toilet paper or something right it's

6010
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:53,280
toilet paper or something right it's
 

6011
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,030
toilet paper or something right it's
just not true in the intellectual

6012
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,040
just not true in the intellectual
 

6013
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,430
just not true in the intellectual
pursuit that's not how it works

6014
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,440
pursuit that's not how it works
 

6015
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,470
pursuit that's not how it works
and sometimes it'll fail right like

6016
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:00,480
and sometimes it'll fail right like
 

6017
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,669
and sometimes it'll fail right like
sometimes like

6018
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
sometimes like
 

6019
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:04,550
sometimes like
a huge fraction of what i do right i

6020
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:04,560
a huge fraction of what i do right i
 

6021
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,430
a huge fraction of what i do right i
come up with an idea

6022
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
come up with an idea
 

6023
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,950
come up with an idea
i think oh it's great and then i work it

6024
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
i think oh it's great and then i work it
 

6025
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,950
i think oh it's great and then i work it
out it's totally not great right it

6026
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:08,960

thing and
 

6039
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,070
thing and
we should fund more and more of this

6040
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:20,080
we should fund more and more of this
 

6041
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,750
we should fund more and more of this
exploration the variety of the

from you know that generation of

6048
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:26,960
from you know that generation of
 

6049
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,990
from you know that generation of
scientists and

6050

scientists and
 

6051
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,590
scientists and
you know a good way to have good ideas

6052
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:31,600
you know a good way to have good ideas
 

6053
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,629
you know a good way to have good ideas
is to have a lot of ideas right so

6054
01:46:34,629 --> 01:46:34,639
is to have a lot of ideas right so
 

6055
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,070
is to have a lot of ideas right so
that's i think that's true um if you are

6056
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,080
that's i think that's true um if you are
 

6057
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,830
that's i think that's true um if you are
conservative in your thinking if you

6058
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:39,840
conservative in your thinking if you
 

6059
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,149
conservative in your thinking if you
worry about proposing something that's

6060
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:42,159
worry about proposing something that's
 

6061
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,629
worry about proposing something that's
going to fail and oh what if you know

6062
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
going to fail and oh what if you know
 

6063
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,070
going to fail and oh what if you know
like i there's no science police that's

6064
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
like i there's no science police that's
 

6065
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,669
like i there's no science police that's
going to come and arrest you for

6066
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
going to come and arrest you for
 

6067
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:52,790
going to come and arrest you for
proposing the wrong thing and you know

6068
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:52,800
proposing the wrong thing and you know
 

6069
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,350
proposing the wrong thing and you know
it's also just like why would you why

6070
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,360
it's also just like why would you why
 

6071
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,350
it's also just like why would you why
would you do science if you're

6072
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:57,360
would you do science if you're
 

6073
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:01,030
would you do science if you're
afraid of you know taking that step it'd

6074
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
afraid of you know taking that step it'd
 

6075
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,390
afraid of you know taking that step it'd
be so much better

6076
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:02,400
be so much better
 

6077
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,030
be so much better
to propose things that are that are

6078
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
to propose things that are that are
 

6079
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,709
to propose things that are that are
plausible that are interesting

6080
01:47:06,709 --> 01:47:06,719
plausible that are interesting
 

6081
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,310
plausible that are interesting
and then for a fraction of them to be

6082
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:08,320
and then for a fraction of them to be
 

6083
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,149
and then for a fraction of them to be
wrong than to just kind of

6084
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
wrong than to just kind of
 

6085
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:11,830
wrong than to just kind of
you know make incremental progress all

6086
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
you know make incremental progress all
 

6087
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,189
you know make incremental progress all
your life right

6088
01:47:13,189 --> 01:47:13,199
your life right
 

6089
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:16,310
your life right
speaking of wild ideas let me ask you

6090
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
speaking of wild ideas let me ask you
 

6091
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:16,790
speaking of wild ideas let me ask you
about

6092
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
about
 

6093
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,550
about
the thing we mentioned previously which

6094
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:18,560
the thing we mentioned previously which
 

6095
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,629
the thing we mentioned previously which
is this interstellar object a muamoa

6096
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:22,639
is this interstellar object a muamoa
 

6097
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,109
is this interstellar object a muamoa
could it be space junk from a distant

6098
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:25,119
could it be space junk from a distant
 

6099
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,270
could it be space junk from a distant
alien civilization

6100
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:27,280
alien civilization
 

6101
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,310
alien civilization
you can't immediately discount that

6102
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:30,320
you can't immediately discount that
 

6103
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,430
you can't immediately discount that
by saying absolutely it cannot

6104
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:33,440
by saying absolutely it cannot
 

6105
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,430
by saying absolutely it cannot
anything can be a space junk i mean from

6106
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:35,440
anything can be a space junk i mean from
 

6107
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,109
anything can be a space junk i mean from
that point of view can any of the kuiper

6108
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:37,119
that point of view can any of the kuiper
 

6109
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:38,790
that point of view can any of the kuiper
belt objects we see

6110
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
belt objects we see
 

6111
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,270
belt objects we see
okay you know be space beijing anything

6112
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
okay you know be space beijing anything
 

6113
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,550
okay you know be space beijing anything
on the night sky

6114
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:42,560
on the night sky
 

6115
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,870
on the night sky
can in principle be space junk and

6116
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
can in principle be space junk and
 

6117
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,629
can in principle be space junk and
kuiper belt would catch interstellar

6118
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:46,639
kuiper belt would catch interstellar
 

6119
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,950
kuiper belt would catch interstellar
objects potentially and like

6120
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:48,960
objects potentially and like
 

6121
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,470
objects potentially and like
force them into an orbit if they're like

6122
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,480
force them into an orbit if they're like
 

6123
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,950
force them into an orbit if they're like
small enough uh not the kuiper belt

6124
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
small enough uh not the kuiper belt
 

6125
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,870
small enough uh not the kuiper belt
itself but you can imagine like jupiter

6126
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:54,880
itself but you can imagine like jupiter
 

6127
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,830
itself but you can imagine like jupiter
family comets

6128
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:55,840
family comets
 

6129
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,629
family comets
being captured uh you know so so you can

6130
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
being captured uh you know so so you can
 

6131
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,550
being captured uh you know so so you can
actually capture things

6132
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:00,560
actually capture things
 

6133
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,109
actually capture things
it's even easier to do this very early

6134
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:03,119
it's even easier to do this very early
 

6135
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:04,070
it's even easier to do this very early
in the solar system

6136
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
in the solar system
 

6137
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,910
in the solar system
like early in the solar system's life

6138
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:05,920
like early in the solar system's life
 

6139
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,149
like early in the solar system's life
while it's still in a cluster of stars

6140
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
while it's still in a cluster of stars
 

6141
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:11,350
while it's still in a cluster of stars
um it's unavoidable that you

6142
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:11,360
um it's unavoidable that you
 

6143
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,390
um it's unavoidable that you
capture debris whether it be natural

6144
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
capture debris whether it be natural
 

6145
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,030
capture debris whether it be natural
debris or

6146
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:15,040
debris or
 

6147
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,189
debris or
unnatural debris or just debris of some

6148
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:17,199
unnatural debris or just debris of some
 

6149
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,070
unnatural debris or just debris of some
kind from

6150
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:18,080
kind from
 

6151
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,510
kind from
other stars that it's like a daycare

6152
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:21,520
other stars that it's like a daycare
 

6153
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:21,990
other stars that it's like a daycare
center

6154

center
 

6155
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,910
center
right like everybody passes their

6156
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:23,920
right like everybody passes their
 

6157
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,990
right like everybody passes their
infections on to other kids yeah

6158
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:26,000
infections on to other kids yeah
 

6159
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,070
infections on to other kids yeah
um you know or more and more there's

6160
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
um you know or more and more there's
 

6161
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,910
um you know or more and more there's
been a lot of discussion

6162
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:29,920
been a lot of discussion
 

6163
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,910
been a lot of discussion
about and there's been a lot of interest

6164
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:31,920
about and there's been a lot of interest
 

6165
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,910
about and there's been a lot of interest
in this over like is it is it

6166
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:33,920
in this over like is it is it
 

6167
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,590
in this over like is it is it
aliens or is it not but let's like if

6168
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
aliens or is it not but let's like if
 

6169
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,750
aliens or is it not but let's like if
you just kind of look at the facts

6170
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:37,760
you just kind of look at the facts
 

6171
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,669
you just kind of look at the facts
like what we know about it is it's kind

6172
01:48:39,669 --> 01:48:39,679
like what we know about it is it's kind
 

6173
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,750
like what we know about it is it's kind
of like a weird shape

6174
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
of like a weird shape
 

6175
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,950
of like a weird shape
and it also accelerated yeah right like

6176
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
and it also accelerated yeah right like
 

6177
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,270
and it also accelerated yeah right like
that's the two those are those are the

6178
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
that's the two those are those are the
 

6179
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,470
that's the two those are those are the
two interesting

6180
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
two interesting
 

6181
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,390
two interesting
uh things about it there are

6182
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:52,400
uh things about it there are
 

6183
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:56,550
uh things about it there are
um there are puzzles about it and

6184
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
um there are puzzles about it and
 

6185
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,310
um there are puzzles about it and
perhaps the most uh daring resolution

6186
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:00,320
perhaps the most uh daring resolution
 

6187
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,590
perhaps the most uh daring resolution
to this puzzle is that it's not you know

6188
01:49:03,590 --> 01:49:03,600
to this puzzle is that it's not you know
 

6189
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,149
to this puzzle is that it's not you know
aliens or it's not like a rock it's

6190
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:06,159
aliens or it's not like a rock it's
 

6191
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,629
aliens or it's not like a rock it's
actually a piece of hydrogen ice

6192
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
actually a piece of hydrogen ice
 

6193
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,750
actually a piece of hydrogen ice
so this is a friend of mine you know

6194
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
so this is a friend of mine you know
 

6195
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,750
so this is a friend of mine you know
daryl seligman greg laughlin came up

6196
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
daryl seligman greg laughlin came up
 

6197
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,109
daryl seligman greg laughlin came up
with this uh

6198
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:15,119
with this uh
 

6199
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:18,310
with this uh
idea where that in

6200
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
idea where that in
 

6201
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,790
idea where that in
giant molecular clouds that are just

6202
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
giant molecular clouds that are just
 

6203
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,950
giant molecular clouds that are just
clouds of hydrogen helium gas that

6204
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:22,960
clouds of hydrogen helium gas that
 

6205
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,229
clouds of hydrogen helium gas that
live in live throughout the galaxy

6206
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:26,239
live in live throughout the galaxy
 

6207
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:29,669
live in live throughout the galaxy
at their cores you can condense ice

6208
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:29,679
at their cores you can condense ice
 

6209
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,470
at their cores you can condense ice
to become these hydrogen you know

6210
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:32,480
to become these hydrogen you know
 

6211
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,709
to become these hydrogen you know
icebergs if you will and then

6212
01:49:34,709 --> 01:49:34,719
icebergs if you will and then
 

6213
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,470
icebergs if you will and then
uh that explains many of the aspects of

6214
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
uh that explains many of the aspects of
 

6215
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:41,430
uh that explains many of the aspects of
uh in fact i think that explains all of

6216
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:41,440
uh in fact i think that explains all of
 

6217
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,950
uh in fact i think that explains all of
the

6218
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
the
 

6219
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,990
the
mystery how it becomes elongated because

6220
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
mystery how it becomes elongated because
 

6221
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,310
mystery how it becomes elongated because
basically the hydrogen ice sublimates

6222
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:48,320
basically the hydrogen ice sublimates
 

6223
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,390
basically the hydrogen ice sublimates
and kind of like a bar of soap

6224
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:50,400
and kind of like a bar of soap
 

6225
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,189
and kind of like a bar of soap
that you know slowly kind of elongates

6226
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:53,199
that you know slowly kind of elongates
 

6227
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:53,910
that you know slowly kind of elongates
as you

6228
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:53,920
as you
 

6229
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,350
as you
uh as you strip away the the surface

6230
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,360
uh as you strip away the the surface
 

6231
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,390
uh as you strip away the the surface
layers

6232
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:58,400
layers
 

6233
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,030
layers
uh how it was able to accelerate because

6234
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:01,040
uh how it was able to accelerate because
 

6235
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,950
uh how it was able to accelerate because
of a jet that is produced from

6236
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
of a jet that is produced from
 

6237
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,550
of a jet that is produced from
you know the hydrogen coming off of it

6238
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
you know the hydrogen coming off of it
 

6239
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,750
you know the hydrogen coming off of it
but you can't see it because it's

6240
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:05,760
but you can't see it because it's
 

6241
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,910
but you can't see it because it's
hydrogen gas like all of this stuff

6242
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:07,920
hydrogen gas like all of this stuff
 

6243
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:12,229
hydrogen gas like all of this stuff
uh kind of falls together nicely

6244
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:12,239
uh kind of falls together nicely
 

6245
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:14,870
uh kind of falls together nicely
i'm i'm intrigued by that idea truly

6246
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:14,880
i'm i'm intrigued by that idea truly
 

6247
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:15,589
i'm i'm intrigued by that idea truly
because

6248
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:15,599
because
 

6249
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,229
because
it's like if that's true that's a new

6250
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:18,239
it's like if that's true that's a new
 

6251
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,149
it's like if that's true that's a new
type of astrophysical

6252
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:20,159
type of astrophysical
 

6253
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,750
type of astrophysical
object and it would be produced by

6254
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
object and it would be produced by
 

6255
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,189
object and it would be produced by
what's the monster that produced

6256
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
what's the monster that produced
 

6257
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,109
what's the monster that produced
initially that kind of object

6258
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
initially that kind of object
 

6259
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,950
initially that kind of object
so this is giant molecular molecular

6260
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:28,960
so this is giant molecular molecular
 

6261
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,310
so this is giant molecular molecular
clouds they're everywhere

6262
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:30,320
clouds they're everywhere
 

6263
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:33,510
clouds they're everywhere
i mean they are the fact that they exist

6264
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,520
i mean they are the fact that they exist
 

6265
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,229
i mean they are the fact that they exist
is not are they rogue clouds or are they

6266
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:36,239
is not are they rogue clouds or are they
 

6267
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:36,870
is not are they rogue clouds or are they
part of like an

6268
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:36,880
part of like an
 

6269
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,030
part of like an
oort cloud no no they're not so clouds

6270
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,040
oort cloud no no they're not so clouds
 

6271
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,629
oort cloud no no they're not so clouds
yeah they're just floating about

6272
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:40,639
yeah they're just floating about
 

6273
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:42,390
yeah they're just floating about
yeah so if you go like a lot of people

6274
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
yeah so if you go like a lot of people
 

6275
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,550
yeah so if you go like a lot of people
imagine the galaxy

6276
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:44,560
imagine the galaxy
 

6277
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,390
imagine the galaxy
as being a you know a bunch of stars

6278
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:48,400
as being a you know a bunch of stars
 

6279
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,629
as being a you know a bunch of stars
right and they're just orbiting right

6280
01:50:50,629 --> 01:50:50,639
right and they're just orbiting right
 

6281
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,149
right and they're just orbiting right
but the truth is if you fly between

6282
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,159
but the truth is if you fly between
 

6283
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:55,510
but the truth is if you fly between
stars you run into clouds uh they don't

6284
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:55,520
stars you run into clouds uh they don't
 

6285
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,390
stars you run into clouds uh they don't
have any large

6286
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:56,400
have any large
 

6287
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,550
have any large
object that creates orbits they're just

6288
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:58,560
object that creates orbits they're just
 

6289
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,910
object that creates orbits they're just
floating about just floating

6290
01:50:59,910 --> 01:50:59,920
floating about just floating
 

6291
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,750
floating about just floating
but why are they floating together oh

6292
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:01,760
but why are they floating together oh
 

6293
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,350
but why are they floating together oh
they just flowed together for time and

6294
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:03,360
they just flowed together for time and
 

6295
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:03,910
they just flowed together for time and
not

6296
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:03,920
not
 

6297
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,550
not
well so these are the these eventually

6298
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,560
well so these are the these eventually
 

6299
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,709
well so these are the these eventually
become the nurseries of stars

6300
01:51:08,709 --> 01:51:08,719
become the nurseries of stars
 

6301
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,750
become the nurseries of stars
so as they as they cool they contract

6302
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:11,760
so as they as they cool they contract
 

6303
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,550
so as they as they cool they contract
and uh you know then collapse into stars

6304
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
and uh you know then collapse into stars
 

6305
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,109
and uh you know then collapse into stars
or into

6306
01:51:15,109 --> 01:51:15,119
or into
 

6307
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,750
or into
groups of stars but some of them they

6308
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
groups of stars but some of them they
 

6309
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,229
groups of stars but some of them they
the starless

6310
01:51:20,229 --> 01:51:20,239
the starless
 

6311
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:23,189
the starless
molecular clouds according to the

6312
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:23,199
molecular clouds according to the
 

6313
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,189
molecular clouds according to the
calculations that daryl and greg

6314
01:51:25,189 --> 01:51:25,199
calculations that daryl and greg
 

6315
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:28,950
calculations that daryl and greg
did can uh can create these like

6316
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:28,960
did can uh can create these like
 

6317
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,510
did can uh can create these like
icicles of hydrogen ice i wonder why

6318
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,520
icicles of hydrogen ice i wonder why
 

6319
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,990
icicles of hydrogen ice i wonder why
they would be flying so fast because

6320
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,000
they would be flying so fast because
 

6321
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:34,870
they would be flying so fast because
they seem to be

6322
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:34,880
they seem to be
 

6323
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,149
they seem to be
moving pretty fast

6324
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159

 

6325
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,750

that's just because of the acceleration

6326
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:39,760
that's just because of the acceleration
 

6327
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,350
that's just because of the acceleration
due to uh due to the sun

6328
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:41,360
due to uh due to the sun
 

6329
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:44,550
due to uh due to the sun
if you stop i mean it's like

6330
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:44,560
if you stop i mean it's like
 

6331
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:46,950
if you stop i mean it's like
take something really far away let it go

6332
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:46,960
take something really far away let it go
 

6333
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,990
take something really far away let it go
and the sun is here

6334
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000
and the sun is here
 

6335
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,229
and the sun is here
by the time it comes close to the sun

6336
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:50,239
by the time it comes close to the sun
 

6337
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,790
by the time it comes close to the sun
right it's moving pretty fast

6338
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:52,800
right it's moving pretty fast
 

6339
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,510
right it's moving pretty fast
so that's an attractive explanation i

6340
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,520
so that's an attractive explanation i
 

6341
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,070
so that's an attractive explanation i
think

6342
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,080
think
 

6343
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,790
think
not so much because uh it's cool but it

6344
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,800
not so much because uh it's cool but it
 

6345
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,550
not so much because uh it's cool but it
makes a clear prediction

6346
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:00,560
makes a clear prediction
 

6347
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,589
makes a clear prediction
right of when their rubin

6348
01:52:03,589 --> 01:52:03,599
right of when their rubin
 

6349
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:06,790
right of when their rubin
observatory comes online next year or so

6350
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:06,800
observatory comes online next year or so
 

6351
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,510
observatory comes online next year or so
we will discover many many more of these

6352
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:09,520
we will discover many many more of these
 

6353
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,310
we will discover many many more of these
objects

6354
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:10,320
objects
 

6355
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,990
objects
right and they have um so i like i like

6356
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:14,000
right and they have um so i like i like
 

6357
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,189
right and they have um so i like i like
theories that are falsifiable right not

6358
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:17,199
theories that are falsifiable right not
 

6359
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,350
theories that are falsifiable right not
not just testable but falsifiable it's

6360
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:19,360
not just testable but falsifiable it's
 

6361
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,270
not just testable but falsifiable it's
good to have a falsifiable theory where

6362
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
good to have a falsifiable theory where
 

6363
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,350
good to have a falsifiable theory where
you can say that's not true

6364
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
you can say that's not true
 

6365
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,550
you can say that's not true
uh aliens is one that's

6366
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:26,560
uh aliens is one that's
 

6367
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,030
uh aliens is one that's
fundamentally difficult to say no that's

6368
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:29,040
fundamentally difficult to say no that's
 

6369
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,229
fundamentally difficult to say no that's
not aliens

6370
01:52:30,229 --> 01:52:30,239
not aliens
 

6371
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,470
not aliens
the interesting thing to me if you look

6372
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:32,480
the interesting thing to me if you look
 

6373
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,350
the interesting thing to me if you look
at one alien civilization

6374
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,360
at one alien civilization
 

6375
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,709
at one alien civilization
and then we look at the things it

6376
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
and then we look at the things it
 

6377
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,870
and then we look at the things it
produces in terms of if we were to try

6378
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:38,880
produces in terms of if we were to try
 

6379
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,750
produces in terms of if we were to try
to detect

6380
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
to detect
 

6381
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,189
to detect
the alien civilization the

6382
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
the alien civilization the
 

6383
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:46,550
the alien civilization the
there's like uh say there's 10 billion

6384
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:46,560
there's like uh say there's 10 billion
 

6385
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:52,629
there's like uh say there's 10 billion
aliens there would probably be

6386
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:52,639

 

6387
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:56,790

trillions of dumb drone type things

6388
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:56,800
trillions of dumb drone type things
 

6389
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,430
trillions of dumb drone type things
produced by the aliens and then be many

6390
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,440
produced by the aliens and then be many
 

6391
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:00,550
produced by the aliens and then be many
many many

6392
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:00,560
many many
 

6393
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,390
many many
more orders of magnitude of junk

6394
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:04,400
more orders of magnitude of junk
 

6395
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,149
more orders of magnitude of junk
so like if you were to look for an alien

6396
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:06,159
so like if you were to look for an alien
 

6397
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,750
so like if you were to look for an alien
civilization in my mind

6398
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:07,760
civilization in my mind
 

6399
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,830
civilization in my mind
you would be looking for the junk that's

6400
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
you would be looking for the junk that's
 

6401
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,149
you would be looking for the junk that's
the more efficient thing to look for

6402
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:12,159
the more efficient thing to look for
 

6403
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:15,030
the more efficient thing to look for
so i'm not saying has any

6404
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:15,040
so i'm not saying has any
 

6405
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,950
so i'm not saying has any
characteristics of space junk but

6406
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
characteristics of space junk but
 

6407
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,669
characteristics of space junk but
it kind of opened my eyes like to the

6408
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
it kind of opened my eyes like to the
 

6409
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:20,550
it kind of opened my eyes like to the
idea that

6410
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:20,560
idea that
 

6411
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,870
idea that
we shouldn't necessarily be looking to

6412
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:22,880
we shouldn't necessarily be looking to
 

6413
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,830
we shouldn't necessarily be looking to
the queen

6414
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
the queen
 

6415
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,229
the queen
of the ant colony we should be looking

6416
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:26,239
of the ant colony we should be looking
 

6417
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:27,589
of the ant colony we should be looking
at i don't know

6418
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
at i don't know
 

6419
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,629
at i don't know
i don't know like the traces of alien

6420
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:30,639
i don't know like the traces of alien
 

6421
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:31,350
i don't know like the traces of alien
life that

6422
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
life that
 

6423
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,510
life that
doesn't look intelligent in any way may

6424
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:33,520
doesn't look intelligent in any way may
 

6425
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,390
doesn't look intelligent in any way may
not even look like

6426
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
not even look like
 

6427
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,470
not even look like
life it could be just garbage we should

6428
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
life it could be just garbage we should
 

6429
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,830
life it could be just garbage we should
be looking for

6430
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:37,840
be looking for
 

6431
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,350
be looking for
garbage just generically

6432
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:41,360
garbage just generically
 

6433
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,149
garbage just generically
garbage that's producible by uh

6434
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:44,159
garbage that's producible by uh
 

6435
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:45,350
garbage that's producible by uh
unnatural

6436
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,360
unnatural
 

6437
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,990
unnatural
uh forces i mean for me at least that

6438
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:48,000
uh forces i mean for me at least that
 

6439
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,589
uh forces i mean for me at least that
was kind of interesting because

6440
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:49,599
was kind of interesting because
 

6441
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:51,189
was kind of interesting because
if you have a successful alien

6442
01:53:51,189 --> 01:53:51,199
if you have a successful alien
 

6443
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,870
if you have a successful alien
civilization

6444
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:52,880
civilization
 

6445
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,550
civilization
that we will be producing many more

6446
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:54,560
that we will be producing many more
 

6447
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,470
that we will be producing many more
orders and magnitude of junk and that'll

6448
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:56,480
orders and magnitude of junk and that'll
 

6449
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:56,790
orders and magnitude of junk and that'll
be

6450
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:56,800
be
 

6451
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,189
be
easier potentially to detect well so you

6452
01:53:59,189 --> 01:53:59,199
easier potentially to detect well so you
 

6453
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,629
easier potentially to detect well so you
have to produce the junk but you have to

6454
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
have to produce the junk but you have to
 

6455
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:01,430
have to produce the junk but you have to
also lunch

6456
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
also lunch
 

6457
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:04,149
also lunch
launch it so this is the this is where i

6458
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
launch it so this is the this is where i
 

6459
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:04,550
launch it so this is the this is where i
mean

6460
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:04,560
mean
 

6461
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,669
mean
let's let's imagine disposal yeah but

6462
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
let's let's imagine disposal yeah but
 

6463
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,470
let's let's imagine disposal yeah but
let's imagine we are a successful

6464
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
let's imagine we are a successful
 

6465
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,589
let's imagine we are a successful
civilization that

6466
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:11,599
civilization that
 

6467
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,430
civilization that
you know has made it to space we clearly

6468
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:13,440
you know has made it to space we clearly
 

6469
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,109
you know has made it to space we clearly
have right um

6470
01:54:15,109 --> 01:54:15,119
have right um
 

6471
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:17,589
have right um
and yes we're in the infancy of that

6472
01:54:17,589 --> 01:54:17,599
and yes we're in the infancy of that
 

6473
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:18,790
and yes we're in the infancy of that
pursuit but

6474
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:18,800
pursuit but
 

6475
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,709
pursuit but
you know we've launched i don't know how

6476
01:54:20,709 --> 01:54:20,719
you know we've launched i don't know how
 

6477
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:21,990
you know we've launched i don't know how
many satellites

6478
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:22,000
many satellites
 

6479
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,109
many satellites
um probably if you count

6480
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,119
um probably if you count
 

6481
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:28,070
um probably if you count
gps satellites it must be at least

6482
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
gps satellites it must be at least
 

6483
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:28,790
gps satellites it must be at least
thousands

6484
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:28,800
thousands
 

6485
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,149
thousands
it's it's certainly thousands i don't

6486
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
it's it's certainly thousands i don't
 

6487
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,589
it's it's certainly thousands i don't
know if it's over ten thousand yeah but

6488
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
know if it's over ten thousand yeah but
 

6489
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:32,310
know if it's over ten thousand yeah but
it's done that

6490
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:32,320
it's done that
 

6491
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,910
it's done that
but it's on that like a large order of

6492
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
but it's on that like a large order of
 

6493
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,990
but it's on that like a large order of
magnitude how many of the things

6494
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:36,000
magnitude how many of the things
 

6495
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,629
magnitude how many of the things
that we've launched will ever leave the

6496
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
that we've launched will ever leave the
 

6497
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,030
that we've launched will ever leave the
solar system i think two

6498
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:41,040
solar system i think two
 

6499
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,750
solar system i think two
two well maybe the voyager the voyager

6500
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:43,760
two well maybe the voyager the voyager
 

6501
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,270
two well maybe the voyager the voyager
one voyager two i don't know if the

6502
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:45,280
one voyager two i don't know if the
 

6503
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,709
one voyager two i don't know if the
pioneer

6504
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719
pioneer
 

6505
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:49,030
pioneer
so maybe three like oh there's also a

6506
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,040
so maybe three like oh there's also a
 

6507
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,030
so maybe three like oh there's also a
tesla roadster out there

6508
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:51,040
tesla roadster out there
 

6509
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,350
tesla roadster out there
uh that that one it will never leave the

6510
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
uh that that one it will never leave the
 

6511
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,550
uh that that one it will never leave the
solar system it'll just

6512
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:54,560
solar system it'll just
 

6513
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,629
solar system it'll just
i think that one will eventually collide

6514
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
i think that one will eventually collide
 

6515
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,070
i think that one will eventually collide
with mars that can be

6516
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
with mars that can be
 

6517
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,350
with mars that can be
spacex's first mars destination

6518
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
spacex's first mars destination
 

6519
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:05,270
spacex's first mars destination
um but look so there's an energetic cost

6520
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:05,280
um but look so there's an energetic cost
 

6521
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,990
um but look so there's an energetic cost
to interstellar travel uh which is

6522
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:08,000
to interstellar travel uh which is
 

6523
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,510
to interstellar travel uh which is
really hard to overcome

6524
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:09,520
really hard to overcome
 

6525
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,830
really hard to overcome
and when when we think about you know

6526
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:11,840
and when when we think about you know
 

6527
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:12,709
and when when we think about you know
generically

6528
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:12,719
generically
 

6529
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,229
generically
what do we look for in an alien

6530
01:55:14,229 --> 01:55:14,239
what do we look for in an alien
 

6531
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,470
what do we look for in an alien
civilization oftentimes we tend to

6532
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
civilization oftentimes we tend to
 

6533
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,430
civilization oftentimes we tend to
imagine that the

6534
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:17,440
imagine that the
 

6535
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,350
imagine that the
thing you look for is the thing that

6536
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:19,360
thing you look for is the thing that
 

6537
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,109
thing you look for is the thing that
we're doing right now

6538
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:21,119
we're doing right now
 

6539
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:24,229
we're doing right now
yeah right so i think that um you know

6540
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
yeah right so i think that um you know
 

6541
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,950
yeah right so i think that um you know
if i if i look at the future right i

6542
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:26,960
if i if i look at the future right i
 

6543
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,310
if i if i look at the future right i
mean for a while like

6544
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:28,320
mean for a while like
 

6545
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,310
mean for a while like
okay if aliens are are out there they

6546
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:30,320
okay if aliens are are out there they
 

6547
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,390
okay if aliens are are out there they
must be broadcasting and radio

6548
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:32,400
must be broadcasting and radio
 

6549
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,510
must be broadcasting and radio
right that radio um

6550
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,520
right that radio um
 

6551
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,510
right that radio um
you know the amount that we broadcast in

6552
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
you know the amount that we broadcast in
 

6553
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,950
you know the amount that we broadcast in
radio has

6554
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
radio has
 

6555
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,910
radio has
diminished tremendously in the last 50

6556
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:41,920
diminished tremendously in the last 50
 

6557
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:42,790
diminished tremendously in the last 50
years

6558
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:42,800
years
 

6559
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,310
years
but we're doing a lot more computation

6560
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:46,320
but we're doing a lot more computation
 

6561
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,189
but we're doing a lot more computation
right what are the signs of computation

6562
01:55:49,189 --> 01:55:49,199
right what are the signs of computation
 

6563
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:50,070
right what are the signs of computation
like that's a good

6564
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:50,080
like that's a good
 

6565
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,750
like that's a good
that's an interesting question to ask

6566
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:51,760
that's an interesting question to ask
 

6567
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,270
that's an interesting question to ask
right

6568
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280
right
 

6569
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,350
right
where i don't know i think something on

6570
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:55,360
where i don't know i think something on
 

6571
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,709
where i don't know i think something on
the order of a few percent

6572
01:55:56,709 --> 01:55:56,719
the order of a few percent
 

6573
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,229
the order of a few percent
of the entire electrical grid last year

6574
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,239
of the entire electrical grid last year
 

6575
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:00,629
of the entire electrical grid last year
went

6576
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
went
 

6577
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,870
went
to mining bitcoin right uh you know well

6578
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:04,880
to mining bitcoin right uh you know well
 

6579
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,270
to mining bitcoin right uh you know well
yeah the there could be a lot of in the

6580
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
yeah the there could be a lot of in the
 

6581
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,030
yeah the there could be a lot of in the
future different consequences of the

6582
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
future different consequences of the
 

6583
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,470
future different consequences of the
computation which

6584
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:10,480
computation which
 

6585
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:12,709
computation which
i mean by unbiased but it could be

6586
01:56:12,709 --> 01:56:12,719
i mean by unbiased but it could be
 

6587
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,070
i mean by unbiased but it could be
robotics it could be artificial

6588
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,080
robotics it could be artificial
 

6589
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:18,790
robotics it could be artificial
intelligence so we may be looking for

6590
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
intelligence so we may be looking for
 

6591
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,189
intelligence so we may be looking for
intelligent looking objects like that's

6592
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:21,199
intelligent looking objects like that's
 

6593
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,109
intelligent looking objects like that's
what i meant by probes like things that

6594
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:23,119
what i meant by probes like things that
 

6595
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:23,510
what i meant by probes like things that
move

6596
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:23,520
move
 

6597
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,910
move
in kind of artificial ways but the

6598
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:25,920
in kind of artificial ways but the
 

6599
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,229
in kind of artificial ways but the
emergence of ai is not an if

6600
01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:28,239
emergence of ai is not an if
 

6601
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:31,750
emergence of ai is not an if
right it's it's happening

6602
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
right it's it's happening
 

6603
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,910
right it's it's happening
right in front of our eyes and the

6604
01:56:33,910 --> 01:56:33,920
right in front of our eyes and the
 

6605
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,910
right in front of our eyes and the
energetic costs associated

6606
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:35,920
energetic costs associated
 

6607
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,149
energetic costs associated
with that are becoming you know a

6608
01:56:38,149 --> 01:56:38,159
with that are becoming you know a
 

6609
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:39,669
with that are becoming you know a
tangible problem

6610
01:56:39,669 --> 01:56:39,679
tangible problem
 

6611
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:42,070
tangible problem
so i think you know if you imagine kind

6612
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:42,080
so i think you know if you imagine kind
 

6613
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,950
so i think you know if you imagine kind
of extrapolating that into the future

6614
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
of extrapolating that into the future
 

6615
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,229
of extrapolating that into the future
right what are the you know

6616
01:56:48,229 --> 01:56:48,239
right what are the you know
 

6617
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,629
right what are the you know
what becomes the bottleneck right the

6618
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
what becomes the bottleneck right the
 

6619
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:53,189
what becomes the bottleneck right the
bottleneck might be

6620
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
bottleneck might be
 

6621
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:56,149
bottleneck might be
powering you know powering the broadly

6622
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
powering you know powering the broadly
 

6623
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:56,950
powering you know powering the broadly
speaking not

6624
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:56,960
speaking not
 

6625
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,430
speaking not
one air but powering that entire ai

6626
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
one air but powering that entire ai
 

6627
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,709
one air but powering that entire ai
ecosystem

6628
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
ecosystem
 

6629
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,750
ecosystem
right so i don't know i think

6630
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,760
right so i don't know i think
 

6631
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,109
right so i don't know i think
you know space junk isn't is kind of

6632
01:57:07,109 --> 01:57:07,119
you know space junk isn't is kind of
 

6633
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:09,270
you know space junk isn't is kind of
uh it's an interesting idea but it's

6634
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,280
uh it's an interesting idea but it's
 

6635
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,270
uh it's an interesting idea but it's
heavily influenced by like sci-fi of

6636
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:11,280
heavily influenced by like sci-fi of
 

6637
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:12,550
heavily influenced by like sci-fi of
1950s where

6638
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:12,560
1950s where
 

6639
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,510
1950s where
by 2020 we're all like flying to the

6640
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:15,520
by 2020 we're all like flying to the
 

6641
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,390
by 2020 we're all like flying to the
moon

6642
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:16,400
moon
 

6643
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,109
moon
um and so we produce a lot of space junk

6644
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
um and so we produce a lot of space junk
 

6645
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,030
um and so we produce a lot of space junk
i'm not

6646
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:21,040
i'm not
 

6647
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,910
i'm not
sure if that's the pathway that alien

6648
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
sure if that's the pathway that alien
 

6649
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,830
sure if that's the pathway that alien
civilizations take

6650
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
civilizations take
 

6651
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,270
civilizations take
i've also never seen an alien

6652
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
i've also never seen an alien
 

6653
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,870
i've also never seen an alien
civilization that's that's

6654
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:28,880
civilization that's that's
 

6655
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,589
civilization that's that's
true but if your theory of chill

6656
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
true but if your theory of chill
 

6657
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,430
true but if your theory of chill
turns out to be true and then we don't

6658
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,440
turns out to be true and then we don't
 

6659
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:36,950
turns out to be true and then we don't
you know we don't necessarily

6660
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:36,960
you know we don't necessarily
 

6661
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,109
you know we don't necessarily
explore we seize the exploration phase

6662
01:57:39,109 --> 01:57:39,119
explore we seize the exploration phase
 

6663
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:40,149
explore we seize the exploration phase
of uh

6664
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:40,159
of uh
 

6665
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:42,070
of uh
like alien civilizations quickly sees

6666
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,080
like alien civilizations quickly sees
 

6667
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:45,030
like alien civilizations quickly sees
the exploration phase of their

6668
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,040
the exploration phase of their
 

6669
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,550
the exploration phase of their
um of their efforts then uh

6670
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,560
um of their efforts then uh
 

6671
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,390
um of their efforts then uh
then perhaps they'll just be chilling in

6672
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
then perhaps they'll just be chilling in
 

6673
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,390
then perhaps they'll just be chilling in
a particular space

6674
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:52,400
a particular space
 

6675
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,270
a particular space
expanding slowly but then using up a lot

6676
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:55,280
expanding slowly but then using up a lot
 

6677
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,870
expanding slowly but then using up a lot
of resources and then have to have a lot

6678
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
of resources and then have to have a lot
 

6679
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,790
of resources and then have to have a lot
of garbage disposal that

6680
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:58,800
of garbage disposal that
 

6681
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,669
of garbage disposal that
sends stuff out and the other you know

6682
01:58:01,669 --> 01:58:01,679
sends stuff out and the other you know
 

6683
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:03,350
sends stuff out and the other you know
the other idea was that it could be a

6684
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:03,360
the other idea was that it could be a
 

6685
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,709
the other idea was that it could be a
relay

6686
01:58:04,709 --> 01:58:04,719
relay
 

6687
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:07,990
relay
that uh you almost have like these gps

6688
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,000
that uh you almost have like these gps
 

6689
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,270
that uh you almost have like these gps
like markers these

6690
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:09,280
like markers these
 

6691
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,430
like markers these
sent throughout which i think is kind of

6692
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:11,440
sent throughout which i think is kind of
 

6693
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,350
sent throughout which i think is kind of
interesting it's uh similar to this

6694
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,360
interesting it's uh similar to this
 

6695
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,790
interesting it's uh similar to this
probe idea

6696
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:14,800
probe idea
 

6697
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:19,270
probe idea
of sending a large number of probes out

6698
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:19,280
of sending a large number of probes out
 

6699
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:23,270
of sending a large number of probes out
to measure gravitational um

6700
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,280
to measure gravitational um
 

6701
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:26,070
to measure gravitational um
to to to measure basically yeah the the

6702
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,080
to to to measure basically yeah the the
 

6703
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,350
to to to measure basically yeah the the
gravitational field

6704
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:27,360
gravitational field
 

6705
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,109
gravitational field
essentially i mean a lot of people at

6706
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
essentially i mean a lot of people at
 

6707
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,430
essentially i mean a lot of people at
cal tech and mit are

6708
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:31,440
cal tech and mit are
 

6709
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,950
cal tech and mit are
trying to measure gravitational fields

6710
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:32,960
trying to measure gravitational fields
 

6711
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,510
trying to measure gravitational fields
and there's there's a lot of ideas of

6712
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
and there's there's a lot of ideas of
 

6713
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,470
and there's there's a lot of ideas of
sending

6714
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:36,480
sending
 

6715
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,990
sending
uh stuff out there that

6716
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,000
uh stuff out there that
 

6717
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,750
uh stuff out there that
accurately measures those gravitational

6718
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
accurately measures those gravitational
 

6719
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,430
accurately measures those gravitational
fields uh to

6720
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
fields uh to
 

6721
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,750
fields uh to
have a greater understanding of the

6722
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:45,760
have a greater understanding of the
 

6723
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,790
have a greater understanding of the
early universe

6724
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
early universe
 

6725
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,870
early universe
but then you might realize that

6726
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:48,880
but then you might realize that
 

6727
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,950
but then you might realize that
communication through gravitation

6728
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:50,960
communication through gravitation
 

6729
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,629
communication through gravitation
through gravity is actually much more

6730
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639
through gravity is actually much more
 

6731
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,470
through gravity is actually much more
effective than than radio waves for

6732
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:54,480
effective than than radio waves for
 

6733
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,189
effective than than radio waves for
example

6734
01:58:55,189 --> 01:58:55,199
example
 

6735
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:56,790
example
something like that and then you send

6736
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:56,800
something like that and then you send
 

6737
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,310
something like that and then you send
out

6738
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:58,320
out
 

6739
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,910
out
i mean okay if you're an alien

6740
01:58:59,910 --> 01:58:59,920
i mean okay if you're an alien
 

6741
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,550
i mean okay if you're an alien
civilization that's able to

6742
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:02,560
civilization that's able to
 

6743
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,470
civilization that's able to
have gigantic masses like basically

6744
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:06,480
have gigantic masses like basically
 

6745
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,149
have gigantic masses like basically
we're getting there as a as a

6746
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
we're getting there as a as a
 

6747
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,709
we're getting there as a as a
civilization no we're not not even close

6748
01:59:10,709 --> 01:59:10,719
civilization no we're not not even close
 

6749
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:14,310
civilization no we're not not even close
well i mean yeah okay

6750
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:14,320
well i mean yeah okay
 

6751
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,950
well i mean yeah okay
i i mean like be able to sort of uh play

6752
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:16,960
i i mean like be able to sort of uh play
 

6753
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,390
i i mean like be able to sort of uh play
with black holes that kind of thing so

6754
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
with black holes that kind of thing so
 

6755
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,709
with black holes that kind of thing so
we're talking about a whole nother diff

6756
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
we're talking about a whole nother diff
 

6757
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:23,350
we're talking about a whole nother diff
order of magnitude and masses then it

6758
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:23,360
order of magnitude and masses then it
 

6759
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,430
order of magnitude and masses then it
may be very effective to send signals

6760
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
may be very effective to send signals
 

6761
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,950
may be very effective to send signals
via gravitational waves

6762
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:26,960
via gravitational waves
 

6763
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,109
via gravitational waves
i actually my sense is that all of these

6764
01:59:29,109 --> 01:59:29,119
i actually my sense is that all of these
 

6765
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:30,229
i actually my sense is that all of these
things are

6766
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
things are
 

6767
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:33,669
things are
genuinely difficult to predict you know

6768
01:59:33,669 --> 01:59:33,679
genuinely difficult to predict you know
 

6769
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:35,669
genuinely difficult to predict you know
and i don't mean like to to kind of shy

6770
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:35,679
and i don't mean like to to kind of shy
 

6771
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,910
and i don't mean like to to kind of shy
away i just i really mean if you think

6772
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
away i just i really mean if you think
 

6773
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,669
away i just i really mean if you think
if you take um imagination of what the

6774
01:59:41,669 --> 01:59:41,679
if you take um imagination of what the
 

6775
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:42,550
if you take um imagination of what the
future

6776
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:42,560
future
 

6777
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,310
future
looked like from you know 500 years ago

6778
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
looked like from you know 500 years ago
 

6779
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,870
looked like from you know 500 years ago
right it's just it is so hard to

6780
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:48,880
right it's just it is so hard to
 

6781
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,589
right it's just it is so hard to
conceive

6782
01:59:49,589 --> 01:59:49,599
conceive
 

6783
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:52,520
conceive
of the impossible right so um

6784
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:52,530
of the impossible right so um
 

6785
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:53,669
of the impossible right so um

[Music]
 

6787
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:56,229
[Music]
it's it's almost like um you know it's

6788
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
it's it's almost like um you know it's
 

6789
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,470
it's it's almost like um you know it's
almost limiting to try and imagine

6790
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:58,480
almost limiting to try and imagine
 

6791
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:01,270
almost limiting to try and imagine
things that are an order of magnitude uh

6792
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:01,280
things that are an order of magnitude uh
 

6793
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,709
things that are an order of magnitude uh
you know or two orders of magnitude

6794
02:00:02,709 --> 02:00:02,719
you know or two orders of magnitude
 

6795
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,709
you know or two orders of magnitude
ahead in terms of progress

6796
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
ahead in terms of progress
 

6797
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,350
ahead in terms of progress
just because you know you mentioned cars

6798
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:07,360
just because you know you mentioned cars
 

6799
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:07,990
just because you know you mentioned cars
before

6800
02:00:07,990 --> 02:00:08,000
before
 

6801
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,709
before
you know if you were to ask people what

6802
02:00:10,709 --> 02:00:10,719
you know if you were to ask people what
 

6803
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:11,510
you know if you were to ask people what
they wanted

6804
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,520
they wanted
 

6805
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,870
they wanted
in 1870 is faster buggies

6806
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
in 1870 is faster buggies
 

6807
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:18,070
in 1870 is faster buggies
right so um so i think the whole like

6808
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
right so um so i think the whole like
 

6809
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,189
right so um so i think the whole like
kind of

6810
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:19,199
kind of
 

6811
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:22,870
kind of
you know alien conversation inevitably

6812
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:22,880
you know alien conversation inevitably
 

6813
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,149
you know alien conversation inevitably
gets gets limited by by our entire

6814
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
gets gets limited by by our entire
 

6815
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:29,589
gets gets limited by by our entire
kind of collective um astrophysical lack

6816
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:29,599
kind of collective um astrophysical lack
 

6817
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,589
kind of collective um astrophysical lack
of imagination

6818
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
of imagination
 

6819
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:35,109

so to push back a little bit i find that

6820
02:00:35,109 --> 02:00:35,119
so to push back a little bit i find that
 

6821
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:37,990
so to push back a little bit i find that
it's really interesting to talk about

6822
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:38,000
it's really interesting to talk about
 

6823
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,589
it's really interesting to talk about
these wild ideas about the future

6824

scientific questions
 

6837
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,070
scientific questions
and it's almost like putting on this

6838
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:54,080
and it's almost like putting on this
 

6839
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,589
and it's almost like putting on this
wild dreamy hat like

6840

some percent of the time and say like
 

6843
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,270
some percent of the time and say like
what are like what would alien

6844
02:00:59,270 --> 02:00:59,280
what are like what would alien
 

6845
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:01,669
what are like what would alien
civilizations look like what would alien

6846
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
civilizations look like what would alien
 

6847
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:04,870

trillions of ai systems out there like

6852
02:01:09,669 --> 02:01:09,679
trillions of ai systems out there like
 

6853
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:10,709
trillions of ai systems out there like
hal 9000

6854

hal 9000
 

6855
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:12,550
hal 9000
but 10 000 out there what would that

6856
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,560
but 10 000 out there what would that
 

6857
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,229
but 10 000 out there what would that
look like and you're right

6858
02:01:14,229 --> 02:01:14,239
look like and you're right
 

6859
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,229
look like and you're right
any one prediction is probably going to

6860
02:01:16,229 --> 02:01:16,239
any one prediction is probably going to
 

6861
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:17,990
any one prediction is probably going to
be horrendously wrong

6862
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,000
be horrendously wrong
 

6863
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,669
be horrendously wrong
but there's something about creating

6864
02:01:19,669 --> 02:01:19,679
but there's something about creating
 

6865
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:21,669
but there's something about creating
these kind of wild predictions

6866
02:01:21,669 --> 02:01:21,679
these kind of wild predictions
 

6867
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:24,870
these kind of wild predictions
that kind of opens up there's a huge

6868
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:24,880
that kind of opens up there's a huge
 

6869
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,149
that kind of opens up there's a huge
magnetism to it

6870
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
magnetism to it
 

6871
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:29,350
magnetism to it
right and some of some of it um

6872
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:29,360
right and some of some of it um
 

6873
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:33,270
right and some of some of it um
you know i mean some of the jules verne

6874
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:33,280
you know i mean some of the jules verne
 

6875

the future
 

6879
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:39,669
the future
right uh that that actually was a great

6880
02:01:39,669 --> 02:01:39,679
right uh that that actually was a great
 

6881

right uh that that actually was a great
example of what you're talking about

6882
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:40,960
example of what you're talking about
 

6883
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,189
example of what you're talking about
like allowing your imagination to

6884
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
like allowing your imagination to
 

6885
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:46,709
like allowing your imagination to
run free i mean i just hope

6886
02:01:46,709 --> 02:01:46,719
run free i mean i just hope
 

6887
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:49,510
run free i mean i just hope
i just hope there there's dragons that's

6888
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:49,520
i just hope there there's dragons that's
 

6889
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,310
i just hope there there's dragons that's
like

6893
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:56,790

but see the cool thing about science

6894
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:56,800
but see the cool thing about science
 

6895
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,550
but see the cool thing about science
fiction and these kinds of conversations

6896
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:58,560
fiction and these kinds of conversations
 

6897
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,629
fiction and these kinds of conversations
it doesn't just predict the future i

6898
02:02:00,629 --> 02:02:00,639
it doesn't just predict the future i
 

6899
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,790
it doesn't just predict the future i
think some of these things

6900
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
think some of these things
 

6901
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:06,149
think some of these things
will create the future pla planting the

6902
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:06,159
will create the future pla planting the
 

6903
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:07,189
will create the future pla planting the
idea

6904
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
idea
 

6905
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,350
idea
this will help the humans are amazing

6906
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
this will help the humans are amazing
 

6907
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:12,310
this will help the humans are amazing
like fake it till you make it

6908
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,320
like fake it till you make it
 

6909
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,589
like fake it till you make it
humans are really good at uh taking an

6910
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:15,599
humans are really good at uh taking an
 

6911
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:17,990
humans are really good at uh taking an
idea that seems impossible at the time

6912
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:18,000
idea that seems impossible at the time
 

6913
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,870
idea that seems impossible at the time
and for one any one individual human

6914
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:20,880
and for one any one individual human
 

6915
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,910
and for one any one individual human
that idea

6916
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:21,920
that idea
 

6917
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,550
that idea
is like a it's like planting a seed yes

6918
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:24,560
is like a it's like planting a seed yes
 

6919
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,229
is like a it's like planting a seed yes
that eventually materializes itself

6920
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
that eventually materializes itself
 

6921
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:28,790
that eventually materializes itself
it's weird it's weird science fiction

6922
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
it's weird it's weird science fiction
 

6923
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,750
it's weird it's weird science fiction
can

6924
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:29,760
can
 

6925
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,589
can
create science drive some of it it

6926
02:02:31,589 --> 02:02:31,599
create science drive some of it it
 

6927
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:33,350
create science drive some of it it
drives the science i agree with you

6928
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:33,360
drives the science i agree with you
 

6929
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,350
drives the science i agree with you
and uh and i think in this regard

6930
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:37,360
and uh and i think in this regard
 

6931
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,470
and uh and i think in this regard
you know i i'm like a sucker for for

6933
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,669
you know i i'm like a sucker for for
sci-fi

6934
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:41,679
sci-fi
 

6935
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:45,430
sci-fi
um it's it's all i listen to like now

6936
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
um it's it's all i listen to like now
 

6937
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:46,709
um it's it's all i listen to like now
when i when i run

6938
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
when i when i run
 

6939
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,109
when i when i run
and um and some of it is completely

6940
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:49,119
and um and some of it is completely
 

6941
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:49,910
and um and some of it is completely
implausible

6942
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
implausible
 

6943
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,070
implausible
right and it's like i don't care it's

6944
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:52,080
right and it's like i don't care it's

um right now right with
 

6965
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:15,830
um right now right with
you know transformer models and so on

6966
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:15,840
you know transformer models and so on
 

6967
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,589
you know transformer models and so on
but uh you know it's this black cloud

6968
02:03:17,589 --> 02:03:17,599
but uh you know it's this black cloud
 

6969
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:18,229
but uh you know it's this black cloud
shows up

6970
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239
shows up
 

6971
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:21,030
shows up
in in the solar system and then you know

6972
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
in in the solar system and then you know
 

6973
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,149
in in the solar system and then you know
people try to

6974
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:22,159
people try to
 

6975
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:24,550
people try to
send radio and then it learns to talk

6976
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560
send radio and then it learns to talk
 

6977
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,430
send radio and then it learns to talk
back at you

6978
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:25,440
back at you
 

6979
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,669
back at you
wow you know so anyway we don't have to

6980
02:03:27,669 --> 02:03:27,679
wow you know so anyway we don't have to
 

6981
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:29,270
wow you know so anyway we don't have to
talk at all about it but it's just

6982
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:29,280
talk at all about it but it's just
 

6983
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,109
talk at all about it but it's just
it's something worth checking out with

6984
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:31,119
it's something worth checking out with
 

6985
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:33,270
it's something worth checking out with
that on the alien front with the black

6986
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:33,280
that on the alien front with the black
 

6987
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:34,629
that on the alien front with the black
claw to me and

6988
02:03:34,629 --> 02:03:34,639
claw to me and
 

6989
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:37,109
claw to me and
exactly and the llp front and also just

6990
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:37,119
exactly and the llp front and also just
 

6991
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,629
exactly and the llp front and also just
explainability of ai

6992
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
explainability of ai
 

6993
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:41,109
explainability of ai
it's fascinating just a very question

6994
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
it's fascinating just a very question
 

6995
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,790
it's fascinating just a very question
stephen wolfram looked at this with the

6996
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:42,800
stephen wolfram looked at this with the
 

6997
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,990
stephen wolfram looked at this with the
movie arrival

6998
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
movie arrival
 

6999
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,430
movie arrival
it's like what would be the common

7000
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,440
it's like what would be the common
 

7001
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,510
it's like what would be the common
language that we would discover

7002
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
language that we would discover
 

7003
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,870
language that we would discover
the the reason that's really interesting

7004
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
the the reason that's really interesting
 

7005
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,709
the the reason that's really interesting
to me is we have aliens

7006
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
to me is we have aliens
 

7007
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,750
to me is we have aliens
here on earth japanese japanese is the

7008
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:53,760
here on earth japanese japanese is the
 

7009
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,709
here on earth japanese japanese is the
obvious answer

7010
02:03:54,709 --> 02:03:54,719
obvious answer
 

7011
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,270
obvious answer
japanese yeah that would be the common

7012
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:57,280
japanese yeah that would be the common
 

7013
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,589
japanese yeah that would be the common
maybe it would be music actually

7014
02:03:59,589 --> 02:03:59,599
maybe it would be music actually
 

7015
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,030
maybe it would be music actually
that's more likely it wouldn't be a

7016
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,040
that's more likely it wouldn't be a
 

7017
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,790
that's more likely it wouldn't be a
language it would be art

7018
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
language it would be art
 

7019
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,390
language it would be art
that they would communicate but you know

7020
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
that they would communicate but you know
 

7021
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,189
that they would communicate but you know
i i do believe that we have

7022
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:07,199
i i do believe that we have

i'm with stephen wolfram on this a

7024
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
i'm with stephen wolfram on this a
 

7025
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,430
i'm with stephen wolfram on this a
little bit that to me

7026
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,440
little bit that to me
 

7027
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:14,470
little bit that to me
computation like programs we write that

7028
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,480
computation like programs we write that
 

7029
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,470
computation like programs we write that
you know that they're kind of

7030
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:16,480
you know that they're kind of
 

7031
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,830
you know that they're kind of
intelligent creatures

7032
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:17,840
intelligent creatures
 

7033
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,189
intelligent creatures
and i feel like we haven't found the

7034
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:19,199
and i feel like we haven't found the
 

7035
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:21,030
and i feel like we haven't found the
common language to talk with them

7036
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,040
common language to talk with them
 

7037
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:24,310
common language to talk with them
like our little creations that are

7038
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:24,320
like our little creations that are
 

7039
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,069

innate thing that
 

7045
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:32,550
innate thing that
produces language with us and like

7046
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:32,560
produces language with us and like
 

7047
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,990
produces language with us and like
coming up with mechanisms for

7048
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,000
coming up with mechanisms for
 

7049
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,830
coming up with mechanisms for
communicating with them

7050
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
communicating with them
 

7051
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,990
communicating with them
uh is um is an effort that feels

7052
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:40,000
uh is um is an effort that feels
 

7053
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,910
uh is um is an effort that feels
like it will produce some incredible

7054
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:41,920
like it will produce some incredible
 

7055
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,510

discoveries you can even think of

7056
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:43,520
discoveries you can even think of
 

7057
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:46,149
discoveries you can even think of
if you think that math is discovered

7058
02:04:46,149 --> 02:04:46,159
if you think that math is discovered
 

7059
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:47,589
if you think that math is discovered
mathematics in itself

7060
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599
mathematics in itself
 

7061
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,390
mathematics in itself
is a kind of um oh yeah it's an innate

7062
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:50,400
is a kind of um oh yeah it's an innate
 

7063
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,350
is a kind of um oh yeah it's an innate
construction

7064

construction
 

7065
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,709
construction
of of the world we live in um i think we

7066
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:54,719
of of the world we live in um i think we
 

7067
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:56,550
of of the world we live in um i think we
are

7068
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,560
are
 

7069
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:00,669
are
you know a part of the way there because

7070
02:05:00,669 --> 02:05:00,679
you know a part of the way there because

computers who were human beings that

7074
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,400
computers who were human beings that
 

7075
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,990
computers who were human beings that
would carry out arithmetic

7076
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:08,000
would carry out arithmetic
 

7077
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,910
would carry out arithmetic
right and i think it was ulam um

7078
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:11,920
right and i think it was ulam um
 

7079
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,109
right and i think it was ulam um

02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
of the second world war wrote something
 

7085
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:20,069
of the second world war wrote something
about

02:05:20,069 --> 02:05:20,079
about
 

7087
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:22,629
about
how you know in the future right

7088
02:05:22,629 --> 02:05:22,639
how you know in the future right
 

7089
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:23,910
how you know in the future right
computers will not

7090
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:23,920
computers will not
 

7091
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:27,830
computers will not
be just arithmetic tool but will be

7092
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:27,840
be just arithmetic tool but will be
 

7093
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,109
be just arithmetic tool but will be
truly an interactive

7094
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:29,119
truly an interactive
 

7095
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:32,149
truly an interactive
you know thing with which you could

7096
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:32,159
you know thing with which you could
 

7097
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:34,950
you know thing with which you could
do experiments right at the time the

7098
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
do experiments right at the time the
 

7099
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,950
do experiments right at the time the
notion of doing an experiment

7100
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
notion of doing an experiment
 

7101
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,109
notion of doing an experiment
not like in the lab with some beakers

7102
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
not like in the lab with some beakers
 

7103
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:40,149
not like in the lab with some beakers
but uh

7104
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
but uh
 

7105
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:42,709
but uh
an experiment on a computer designing an

7106
02:05:42,709 --> 02:05:42,719
an experiment on a computer designing an
 

7107
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:43,669
an experiment on a computer designing an
experiment

7108
02:05:43,669 --> 02:05:43,679
experiment
 

7109
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:47,030
experiment
a numerical experiment was

7110
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,040
a numerical experiment was
 

7111
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,790
a numerical experiment was
a new one that's like you know 70

7112
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,800
a new one that's like you know 70
 

7113
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,350
a new one that's like you know 70
of what i do is i design com you know i

7114
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,360
of what i do is i design com you know i
 

7115
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:53,910
of what i do is i design com you know i
write

7116
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:53,920
write
 

7117
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,510
write
code terrible code to be uh clear like

7118
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:57,520
code terrible code to be uh clear like
 

7119
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,870
code terrible code to be uh clear like
but you know i write code that creates

7120
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
but you know i write code that creates
 

7121
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:03,109
but you know i write code that creates
an experiment which is a which is a

7122
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:03,119
an experiment which is a which is a
 

7123
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:04,149
an experiment which is a which is a
simulation

7124
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:04,159
simulation
 

7125
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:06,790
simulation
so in that sense i think we're beginning

7126
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:06,800
so in that sense i think we're beginning
 

7127
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,470
so in that sense i think we're beginning
to interact with the computer in in a

7128
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:08,480
to interact with the computer in in a
 

7129
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:09,750
to interact with the computer in in a
way that you're

7130
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:09,760
way that you're
 

7131
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:12,550
way that you're
saying not as just a you know fancy

7132
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:12,560
saying not as just a you know fancy
 

7133
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,229
saying not as just a you know fancy
calculator not as just a

7134
02:06:14,229 --> 02:06:14,239
calculator not as just a
 

7135
02:06:14,239 --> 02:06:18,149
calculator not as just a
you know call-in request type of

7136
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:18,159
you know call-in request type of
 

7137
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:19,589
you know call-in request type of
thing but but you know something that

7138
02:06:19,589 --> 02:06:19,599
thing but but you know something that
 

7139
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:21,830
thing but but you know something that
can generate uh

7140
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:21,840
can generate uh
 

7141
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,550
can generate uh
generate insights that are otherwise

7142
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:24,560
generate insights that are otherwise
 

7143
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,390
generate insights that are otherwise
completely unattainable right they're

7144
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:26,400
completely unattainable right they're
 

7145
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,669
completely unattainable right they're
unattainable by doing

7146
02:06:27,669 --> 02:06:27,679
unattainable by doing
 

7147
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:30,310
unattainable by doing
analytical mathematics yeah and there's

7148
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:30,320
analytical mathematics yeah and there's
 

7149
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:30,709
analytical mathematics yeah and there's
uh

7150
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
uh
 

7151
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,270
uh
like with the alpha fold two we're now

7152
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:33,280
like with the alpha fold two we're now
 

7153
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:33,750
like with the alpha fold two we're now
trying

7154
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:33,760
trying
 

7155
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,310
trying
we're now starting to crack open biology

7156
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:36,320
we're now starting to crack open biology
 

7157
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,430
we're now starting to crack open biology
so being able to

7158
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:37,440
so being able to
 

7159
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,589
so being able to
simulate at first trivial biological

7160
02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
simulate at first trivial biological
 

7161
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,030
simulate at first trivial biological
systems and hopefully down the line

7162
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
systems and hopefully down the line
 

7163
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,870
systems and hopefully down the line
complex biological systems

7164
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:42,880
complex biological systems
 

7165
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:45,270
complex biological systems
right my hope is to be able to simulate

7166
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:45,280
right my hope is to be able to simulate
 

7167
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,229
right my hope is to be able to simulate
psychology

7168
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:46,239
psychology
 

7169
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,310
psychology
psychological like sociological systems

7170
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:48,320
psychological like sociological systems
 

7171
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,350
psychological like sociological systems
like humans

7172
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
like humans
 

7173
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,629
like humans
i've you know um a large part of my work

7174
02:06:52,629 --> 02:06:52,639
i've you know um a large part of my work
 

7175
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:53,109
i've you know um a large part of my work
at

7176
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
at
 

7177
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:56,229
at
mit was on autonomous vehicles

7178
02:06:56,229 --> 02:06:56,239
mit was on autonomous vehicles
 

7179
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:57,589
mit was on autonomous vehicles
and the fascinating thing to me was

7180
02:06:57,589 --> 02:06:57,599
and the fascinating thing to me was
 

7181
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:00,069
and the fascinating thing to me was
about pedestrians

7182
02:07:00,069 --> 02:07:00,079
about pedestrians
 

7183
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:01,669
about pedestrians
human pedestrians interacting with

7184
02:07:01,669 --> 02:07:01,679
human pedestrians interacting with
 

7185
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,430
human pedestrians interacting with
autonomous vehicles and simulating those

7186
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:03,440
autonomous vehicles and simulating those
 

7187
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,510
autonomous vehicles and simulating those
systems without murdering humans

7188
02:07:05,510 --> 02:07:05,520
systems without murdering humans
 

7189
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:07,589
systems without murdering humans
would be very useful but nevertheless is

7190
02:07:07,589 --> 02:07:07,599
would be very useful but nevertheless is
 

7191
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:08,629
would be very useful but nevertheless is
exceptionally difficult

7192
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:08,639
exceptionally difficult
 

7193
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,470
exceptionally difficult
yeah i would say so when is my mustang

7194
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
yeah i would say so when is my mustang
 

7195
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,750
yeah i would say so when is my mustang
going to drive itself

7196
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
going to drive itself
 

7197
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:15,270
going to drive itself
right i'm not even joking it looks like

7198
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:15,280
right i'm not even joking it looks like
 

7199
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,550
right i'm not even joking it looks like
yeah yeah i it turns out it's much

7200
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,560
yeah yeah i it turns out it's much
 

7201
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,270
yeah yeah i it turns out it's much
difficult

7202
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:19,280
difficult
 

7203
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,470
difficult
it's much more difficult than we

7204
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:20,480
it's much more difficult than we
 

7205
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:22,870
it's much more difficult than we
imagined yeah and and i suppose that's

7206
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:22,880
imagined yeah and and i suppose that's
 

7207
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,709
imagined yeah and and i suppose that's
the kind of

7208
02:07:24,709 --> 02:07:24,719
the kind of
 

7209
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:27,990
the kind of
the progress of science is

7210
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
the progress of science is
 

7211
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,510
the progress of science is
just like you know going to mars

7212
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:31,520

 

7213
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,510

it's probably going to turn out to be

7214
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,520
it's probably going to turn out to be
 

7215
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,270
it's probably going to turn out to be
way more difficult to imagine

7216
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,280
way more difficult to imagine
 

7217
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,270
way more difficult to imagine
sending out probes to investigate planet

7218
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,280
sending out probes to investigate planet
 

7219
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,350
sending out probes to investigate planet
nine at the edge of our solar system

7220
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:39,360
nine at the edge of our solar system
 

7221
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,870
nine at the edge of our solar system
might turn out to be way more difficult

7222
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:40,880
might turn out to be way more difficult
 

7223
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:42,709
might turn out to be way more difficult
than we imagined but we do it anyway

7224
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
than we imagined but we do it anyway
 

7225
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:44,229
than we imagined but we do it anyway
yeah and we figure it out in the end

7226
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:44,239
yeah and we figure it out in the end
 

7227
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:45,750
yeah and we figure it out in the end
it's actually more of a great i mean

7228
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:45,760
it's actually more of a great i mean
 

7229
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:46,310
it's actually more of a great i mean
going

7230
02:07:46,310 --> 02:07:46,320
going
 

7231
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,109
going
sending humans to mars is way more

7232
02:07:49,109 --> 02:07:49,119
sending humans to mars is way more
 

7233
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:50,870
sending humans to mars is way more
complicated than huma sending humans to

7234
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
complicated than huma sending humans to
 

7235
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,350
complicated than huma sending humans to
the moon

7236
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:51,360
the moon
 

7237
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:54,069
the moon
you'd think just like naively yeah both

7238
02:07:54,069 --> 02:07:54,079
you'd think just like naively yeah both
 

7239
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:55,109
you'd think just like naively yeah both
are in space

7240
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:55,119
are in space
 

7241
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:57,510
are in space
who cares like if you go there why don't

7242
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:57,520
who cares like if you go there why don't
 

7243
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:58,470
who cares like if you go there why don't
you go there

7244
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:58,480
you go there
 

7245
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:01,589
you go there
um you know just

7246
02:08:01,589 --> 02:08:01,599
um you know just
 

7247
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:04,149
um you know just
life support is uh is an extremely

7248
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:04,159
life support is uh is an extremely
 

7249
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:06,069
life support is uh is an extremely
expensive thing yeah there's a bunch of

7250
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:06,079
expensive thing yeah there's a bunch of
 

7251
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:07,910
expensive thing yeah there's a bunch of
extra challenges but i disagree with you

7252
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:07,920
extra challenges but i disagree with you
 

7253
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,669
extra challenges but i disagree with you
i would be one of the early people to go

7254
02:08:09,669 --> 02:08:09,679
i would be one of the early people to go
 

7255
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:10,870
i would be one of the early people to go
i used to think not

7256
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:10,880
i used to think not
 

7257
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,390
i used to think not
yeah i used to think i'd be one of the

7258
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:12,400
yeah i used to think i'd be one of the
 

7259
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,390
yeah i used to think i'd be one of the
first maybe million to go once you have

7260
02:08:14,390 --> 02:08:14,400
first maybe million to go once you have
 

7261
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:15,830
first maybe million to go once you have
a little bit of a society

7262
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:15,840
a little bit of a society
 

7263
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,830
a little bit of a society
i think i'm i'm upgrading myself to the

7264
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:17,840
i think i'm i'm upgrading myself to the
 

7265
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,270
i think i'm i'm upgrading myself to the
first like ten thousand yeah that's

7266
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:19,280
first like ten thousand yeah that's
 

7267
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:19,750
first like ten thousand yeah that's
right

7268
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:19,760
right
 

7269
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,069
right
from the front of the cabin not

7270
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:22,079
from the front of the cabin not
 

7271
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:23,030
from the front of the cabin not
completely front

7272
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,040
completely front
 

7273
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,589
completely front
but like it would be interesting to die

7274
02:08:25,589 --> 02:08:25,599
but like it would be interesting to die
 

7275
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:26,629
but like it would be interesting to die
i'm okay

7276
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:26,639
i'm okay
 

7277
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:29,750
i'm okay
with uh death sucks

7278
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:29,760
with uh death sucks
 

7279
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,270
with uh death sucks
but i kind of like the idea of dying on

7280
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:33,280
but i kind of like the idea of dying on
 

7281
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,990
but i kind of like the idea of dying on
mars

7282
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,000
mars
 

7283
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,629
mars
of all the places to die i gotta say in

7284
02:08:36,629 --> 02:08:36,639
of all the places to die i gotta say in
 

7285
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:38,149
of all the places to die i gotta say in
this regard like

7286
02:08:38,149 --> 02:08:38,159
this regard like
 

7287
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:40,870
this regard like
i don't wanna die on mars i don't no no

7288
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:40,880
i don't wanna die on mars i don't no no
 

7289
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,390
i don't wanna die on mars i don't no no
i would much rather

7290
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:42,400
i would much rather
 

7291
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:46,229
i would much rather
die on earth uh i mean death

7292
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:46,239
die on earth uh i mean death
 

7293
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:48,470
die on earth uh i mean death
is is fundamentally boring right like

7294
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
is is fundamentally boring right like
 

7295
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,550
is is fundamentally boring right like
death is a very boring experience

7296
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:50,560
death is a very boring experience
 

7297
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,550
death is a very boring experience
but i mean i've never died before so i

7298
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:52,560
but i mean i've never died before so i
 

7299
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,229
but i mean i've never died before so i
don't know from first-hand experience as

7300
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:54,239
don't know from first-hand experience as
 

7301
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:55,430
don't know from first-hand experience as
far as you know yeah

7302
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:55,440
far as you know yeah
 

7303
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,870
far as you know yeah
it could be a reincarnation all those

7304
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
it could be a reincarnation all those
 

7305
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,669
it could be a reincarnation all those
kinds of things so you mean uh

7306
02:08:59,669 --> 02:08:59,679
kinds of things so you mean uh
 

7307
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:02,830
kinds of things so you mean uh
where would you die uh if you had to

7308
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:02,840
where would you die uh if you had to
 

7309
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:05,430
where would you die uh if you had to
choose oh man

7310
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:05,440
choose oh man
 

7311
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:08,069
choose oh man
um okay so and you know i would

7312
02:09:08,069 --> 02:09:08,079
um okay so and you know i would
 

7313
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:08,790
um okay so and you know i would
definitely

7314
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800
definitely
 

7315
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,709
definitely
you know there's a question of who i'd

7316
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:10,719

02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:19,750
in that sense the meritocracy is in its
richest most beautiful form is is

8610
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:19,760
richest most beautiful form is is
 

8611
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:20,790
richest most beautiful form is is
starting to win out

8612
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:20,800
starting to win out
 

8613
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:23,270
starting to win out
yeah it's weird because like you know my

8614
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:23,280
yeah it's weird because like you know my
 

8615
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:24,070
yeah it's weird because like you know my
understanding

8616
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:24,080
understanding
 

8617
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:25,990
understanding
and i'm not like i don't know the

8618
02:33:25,990 --> 02:33:26,000
and i'm not like i don't know the
 

8619
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,150
and i'm not like i don't know the
history of science well enough to

8620
02:33:28,150 --> 02:33:28,160
history of science well enough to
 

8621
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:30,950
history of science well enough to
to speak very confidently about this but

8622
02:33:30,950 --> 02:33:30,960
to speak very confidently about this but
 

8623
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:32,870
to speak very confidently about this but
you know the

8624
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:32,880
you know the
 

8625
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:36,309
you know the
advisor of my advisor of my advisor

8626
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:36,319
advisor of my advisor of my advisor
 

8627
02:33:36,319 --> 02:33:39,510
advisor of my advisor of my advisor
from undergrad uh like didn't have a phd

8628
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:39,520
from undergrad uh like didn't have a phd
 

8629
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:41,590
from undergrad uh like didn't have a phd
right so i think it was a more common

8630
02:33:41,590 --> 02:33:41,600
right so i think it was a more common
 

8631
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,349
right so i think it was a more common
thing back in the day

8632
02:33:43,349 --> 02:33:43,359
thing back in the day
 

8633
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:46,830
thing back in the day
even in uh the academic

8634
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:46,840
even in uh the academic
 

8635
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:50,389
even in uh the academic
sector to you know

8636
02:33:50,389 --> 02:33:50,399
sector to you know
 

8637
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:53,349
sector to you know
not have you know faraday like faraday

8638
02:33:53,349 --> 02:33:53,359
not have you know faraday like faraday
 

8639
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:54,630
not have you know faraday like faraday
didn't know algebra

8640
02:33:54,630 --> 02:33:54,640
didn't know algebra
 

8641
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:57,590
didn't know algebra
when drew diagrams about you know

8642
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:57,600
when drew diagrams about you know
 

8643
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,870
when drew diagrams about you know
magnetic fields like

8644
02:33:58,870 --> 02:33:58,880
magnetic fields like
 

8645
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:02,389
magnetic fields like
his faraday's law was derived entirely

8646
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
his faraday's law was derived entirely
 

8647
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:03,750
his faraday's law was derived entirely
from intuition

8648
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
from intuition
 

8649
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:07,110
from intuition
so uh it is interesting to to how

8650
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:07,120
so uh it is interesting to to how
 

8651
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:10,870
so uh it is interesting to to how
the world of academia has evolved into a

8652
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:10,880
the world of academia has evolved into a
 

8653
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:13,270
the world of academia has evolved into a
you got to do this and then get phd then

8654
02:34:13,270 --> 02:34:13,280
you got to do this and then get phd then
 

8655
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:15,670
you got to do this and then get phd then
you have to post doc once and twice

8656
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:15,680
you have to post doc once and twice
 

8657
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:18,230
you have to post doc once and twice
and maybe thrice and then like you you

8658
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:18,240
and maybe thrice and then like you you
 

8659
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,270
and maybe thrice and then like you you
move on so

8660
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:19,280
move on so
 

8661
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,590
move on so
you know it does i do wonder you know if

8662
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,600
you know it does i do wonder you know if
 

8663
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:23,270
you know it does i do wonder you know if
we're

8664
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:23,280
we're
 

8665
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:25,750
we're
you know if there's a better i think

8666
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:25,760
you know if there's a better i think
 

8667
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,790
you know if there's a better i think
we're heading there

8668
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:26,800
we're heading there
 

8669
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,230
we're heading there
but it's a fascinating historical

8670
02:34:28,230 --> 02:34:28,240
but it's a fascinating historical
 

8671
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,389
but it's a fascinating historical
perspective like that we might have just

8672
02:34:30,389 --> 02:34:30,399
perspective like that we might have just
 

8673
02:34:30,399 --> 02:34:32,469
perspective like that we might have just
tried this whole thing out uh for a

8674
02:34:32,469 --> 02:34:32,479
tried this whole thing out uh for a
 

8675
02:34:32,479 --> 02:34:34,230
tried this whole thing out uh for a
while where we put a lot more emphasis

8676
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,240
while where we put a lot more emphasis
 

8677
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:35,830
while where we put a lot more emphasis
on grades and certificates and

8678
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:35,840
on grades and certificates and
 

8679
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:38,070
on grades and certificates and
um degrees and all those kinds of things

8680
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:38,080
um degrees and all those kinds of things
 

8681
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:39,270
um degrees and all those kinds of things
i think the difference

8682
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:39,280
i think the difference
 

8683
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:42,870
i think the difference
historically is like we can actually

8684
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:42,880
historically is like we can actually
 

8685
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:45,990
historically is like we can actually
using the internet show off the

8686
02:34:45,990 --> 02:34:46,000
using the internet show off the
 

8687
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,469
using the internet show off the
show off ourselves and our creations

8688
02:34:48,469 --> 02:34:48,479
show off ourselves and our creations
 

8689
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:50,150
show off ourselves and our creations
better and better and more effectively

8690
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
better and better and more effectively
 

8691
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,790
better and better and more effectively
whether that's code or producing videos

8692
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:52,800
whether that's code or producing videos
 

8693
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,990
whether that's code or producing videos
or all those kinds of things that's

8694
02:34:53,990 --> 02:34:54,000
or all those kinds of things that's
 

8695
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:54,630
or all those kinds of things that's
right

8696
02:34:54,630 --> 02:34:54,640
right
 

8697
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:59,110
right
you can become a certified drone pilot

8698
02:34:59,110 --> 02:34:59,120
you can become a certified drone pilot
 

8699
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:01,270
you can become a certified drone pilot
that's true of all the of all the things

8700
02:35:01,270 --> 02:35:01,280
that's true of all the of all the things
 

8701
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,190
that's true of all the of all the things
you want to pick yeah for sure

8702
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:03,200
you want to pick yeah for sure
 

8703
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:04,710
you want to pick yeah for sure
or you could just fly make youtube

8704
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
or you could just fly make youtube
 

8705
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:06,070
or you could just fly make youtube
videos against hundreds of thousands of

8706
02:35:06,070 --> 02:35:06,080
videos against hundreds of thousands of
 

8707
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:07,590
videos against hundreds of thousands of

views with your drone and
 

8709
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,070
views with your drone and
never getting a certificate um that's

8710
02:35:10,070 --> 02:35:10,080
never getting a certificate um that's
 

8711
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:11,670
never getting a certificate um that's
probably illegal don't do it

8712
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
probably illegal don't do it
 

8713
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,510
probably illegal don't do it
what do you think is uh the meaning of

8714
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:13,520
what do you think is uh the meaning of
 

8715
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:14,790
what do you think is uh the meaning of
this whole thing so

8716
02:35:14,790 --> 02:35:14,800
this whole thing so
 

8717
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:18,070
this whole thing so
you look at planets they they seem to

8718
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
you look at planets they they seem to
 

8719
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:19,349
you look at planets they they seem to
orbit stuff

8720
02:35:19,349 --> 02:35:19,359
orbit stuff
 

8721
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:22,469
orbit stuff
um without without asking the why

8722
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:22,479
um without without asking the why
 

8723
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:23,190
um without without asking the why
question and

8724
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:23,200
question and
 

8725
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:25,590
question and
for some reason life emerged on earth

8726
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:25,600
for some reason life emerged on earth
 

8727
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:27,670
for some reason life emerged on earth
such that it led to big brains that

8728
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:27,680
such that it led to big brains that
 

8729
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:30,309
such that it led to big brains that
can ask the big why question do you

8730
02:35:30,309 --> 02:35:30,319
can ask the big why question do you
 

8731
02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:33,349
can ask the big why question do you
think there's an answer to it

8732
02:35:33,349 --> 02:35:33,359
think there's an answer to it
 

8733
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:36,550
think there's an answer to it
um i'm not sure what the question is

8734
02:35:36,550 --> 02:35:36,560
um i'm not sure what the question is
 

8735
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:38,469
um i'm not sure what the question is
like what meaning of life the meaning of

8736
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:38,479
like what meaning of life the meaning of
 

8737
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:40,230
like what meaning of life the meaning of
life um

8738
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:40,240
life um
 

8739
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:43,750
life um
it's 42. it's 42. yeah but

8740
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:43,760
it's 42. it's 42. yeah but
 

8741
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:46,630
it's 42. it's 42. yeah but
you know aside from that it's um you

8742
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,640
you know aside from that it's um you
 

8743
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:47,270
you know aside from that it's um you
know

8744
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:47,280
know
 

8745
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,790
know
why i think if the question you're

8746
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:50,800
why i think if the question you're
 

8747
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:51,830
why i think if the question you're
asking is like

8748
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:51,840
asking is like
 

8749
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,270
asking is like
why we do all this right

8750
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,280
why we do all this right
 

8751
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:59,750
why we do all this right
yeah um it's part of the human condition

8752
02:35:59,750 --> 02:35:59,760
yeah um it's part of the human condition
 

8753
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:04,710
yeah um it's part of the human condition
right human beings are fundamentally

8754
02:36:04,710 --> 02:36:04,720
right human beings are fundamentally
 

8755
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:08,870
right human beings are fundamentally
i feel like non like sort of stochastic

8756
02:36:08,870 --> 02:36:08,880
i feel like non like sort of stochastic
 

8757
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:14,070
i feel like non like sort of stochastic
and fundamentally interested in in

8758
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,080

 

8759
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,150

kind of expanding our own understanding

8760
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:16,160
kind of expanding our own understanding
 

8761
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:17,110
kind of expanding our own understanding
of the world

8762
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:17,120
of the world
 

8763
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:20,389
of the world
around us and creating stuff to enable

8764
02:36:20,389 --> 02:36:20,399
around us and creating stuff to enable
 

8765
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:21,429
around us and creating stuff to enable
that understanding

8766
02:36:21,429 --> 02:36:21,439
that understanding
 

8767
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:22,950
that understanding
so we're like a stochastic

8768
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:22,960
so we're like a stochastic
 

8769
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:24,710
so we're like a stochastic
fundamentalist so like there's

8770
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:24,720
fundamentalist so like there's
 

8771
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:26,630
fundamentalist so like there's
just a bunch of randomness that really

8772
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:26,640
just a bunch of randomness that really
 

8773
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:27,910
just a bunch of randomness that really
doesn't seem like it has a good

8774
02:36:27,910 --> 02:36:27,920
doesn't seem like it has a good
 

8775
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:28,950
doesn't seem like it has a good
explanation

8776
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:28,960
explanation
 

8777
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:31,590
explanation
and yet there's a kind of direction to

8778
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:31,600
and yet there's a kind of direction to
 

8779
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,190
and yet there's a kind of direction to
our being that we just keep wanting to

8780
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:33,200
our being that we just keep wanting to
 

8781
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:34,469
our being that we just keep wanting to
create and to understand

8782
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:34,479
create and to understand
 

8783
02:36:34,479 --> 02:36:36,710
create and to understand
that's right i've met people that are

8784
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:36,720
that's right i've met people that are
 

8785
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:39,190
that's right i've met people that are
you know that claim to be anti-science

8786
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
you know that claim to be anti-science
 

8787
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:42,469
you know that claim to be anti-science
right um and yet

8788
02:36:42,469 --> 02:36:42,479
right um and yet
 

8789
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:44,710
right um and yet
in their anti-science you know

8790
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:44,720
in their anti-science you know
 

8791
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:45,590
in their anti-science you know
discussion

8792
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:45,600
discussion
 

8793
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:48,630
discussion
like well like if you're so

8794
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:48,640
like well like if you're so
 

8795
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:51,190
like well like if you're so
you know scientific then how why don't

8796
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,200
you know scientific then how why don't
 

8797
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,630
you know scientific then how why don't
you explain to me how

8798
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:52,640
you explain to me how
 

8799
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:54,950
you explain to me how
i don't know this works and like it

8800
02:36:54,950 --> 02:36:54,960
i don't know this works and like it
 

8801
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:57,270
i don't know this works and like it
always there's that fundamental

8804
02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:00,160
speed of curiosity and interest that is
 

8805
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:01,030
speed of curiosity and interest that is
common to

8806

common to
 

8807
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,870
common to
to all of us that is absolutely what

8808
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:04,880
to all of us that is absolutely what
 

8809

02:37:27,429 --> 02:37:27,439
starting to see
 

8829
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:30,150
starting to see
you know shift towards that type of you

8830
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:30,160
you know shift towards that type of you
 

8831
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:31,110
you know shift towards that type of you
know

8832

know
 

8833
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,870
know
creative uh you know enterprise as being

8834
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:34,880
creative uh you know enterprise as being
 

8835
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:36,790
creative uh you know enterprise as being
as emerging as taking over a bigger and

8836
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:36,800
as emerging as taking over a bigger and
 

8837
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:38,630
as emerging as taking over a bigger and
bigger chunk of the

8838
02:37:38,630 --> 02:37:38,640
bigger chunk of the
 

8839
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:41,910
bigger chunk of the
sector it's not yet i think the dominant

8840
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:41,920
sector it's not yet i think the dominant
 

8841
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:45,030
sector it's not yet i think the dominant
uh portion of the economy by any account

8842
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:45,040
uh portion of the economy by any account
 

8843
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:46,150
uh portion of the economy by any account
but if we compare

8844
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:46,160
but if we compare
 

8845
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:49,670
but if we compare
this to like you know sometime when

8846
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:49,680
this to like you know sometime when
 

8847
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:52,309
this to like you know sometime when
the dominant thing you would do would be

8848
02:37:52,309 --> 02:37:52,319
the dominant thing you would do would be
 

8849
02:37:52,319 --> 02:37:52,710
the dominant thing you would do would be
to

8850
02:37:52,710 --> 02:37:52,720
to
 

8851
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:55,750
to
you know go to a factory and do the same

8852
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:55,760
you know go to a factory and do the same
 

8853
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:56,950
you know go to a factory and do the same
exact thing

8854
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:56,960
exact thing
 

8855
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:59,270
exact thing
right i think you know there's a tide

8856
02:37:59,270 --> 02:37:59,280
right i think you know there's a tide
 

8857
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,389
right i think you know there's a tide
there

8858
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:00,399
there
 

8859
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:01,990
there
and things are sort of headed in that

8860
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:02,000
and things are sort of headed in that
 

8861
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,830
and things are sort of headed in that
direction yeah life's becoming more and

8862
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:03,840
direction yeah life's becoming more and
 

8863
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,670

terminal point of this chill and wait
for those kuiper belt objects to

8872
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
for those kuiper belt objects to
 

8873
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:14,550
for those kuiper belt objects to
complete one orbit

8874
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:14,560
complete one orbit
 

8875
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:17,349
complete one orbit
i'm gonna credit you with this idea uh i

8876
02:38:17,349 --> 02:38:17,359
i'm gonna credit you with this idea uh i
 

8877
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:18,710
i'm gonna credit you with this idea uh i
do hope that

8878

do hope that
 

8879
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:22,070
do hope that
we definitively discover uh proof

8880
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:22,080
we definitively discover uh proof
 

8881
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:23,910
we definitively discover uh proof
that there is a planet nine out there in

8882
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:23,920
that there is a planet nine out there in
 

8883
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:25,830
that there is a planet nine out there in
the next few years so you can sit back

8884
