are you more interested in understanding
 

79
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,870
are you more interested in understanding
the human brain or in creating

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
the human brain or in creating
 

81
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,599
the human brain or in creating
artificial systems that have many of the

82
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:33,609
artificial systems that have many of the
 

83
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,999
artificial systems that have many of the
same qualities but don't necessarily

84
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,009
same qualities but don't necessarily
 

85
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,719
same qualities but don't necessarily
require that you actually understand the

86
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:38,729
require that you actually understand the
 

87
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,639
require that you actually understand the
underpinning workings of our mind so

88
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:41,649
underpinning workings of our mind so
 

89
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:43,649
underpinning workings of our mind so
there's a clear answer to that question

90
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:43,659
there's a clear answer to that question
 

91
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,809
there's a clear answer to that question
my primary interest is understanding the

92
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:45,819
my primary interest is understanding the
 

93
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,919
my primary interest is understanding the
human brain no question about it but I

94
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:49,929
human brain no question about it but I
 

95
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:53,130
human brain no question about it but I
also firmly believe that we will not be

96
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,140
also firmly believe that we will not be
 

97
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,510
also firmly believe that we will not be
able to create fully intelligent

98
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,520
able to create fully intelligent
 

99
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,949
able to create fully intelligent
machines until we understand how the

100
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:55,959
machines until we understand how the
 

101
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,870
machines until we understand how the
human brain works so I don't see those

102
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:57,880
human brain works so I don't see those
 

103
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
human brain works so I don't see those
as separate problems

104
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,770
as separate problems
 

105
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,380
as separate problems
I think there's limits so what can be

106
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,390
I think there's limits so what can be
 

107
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,789
I think there's limits so what can be
done with machine intelligence if you

108
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
done with machine intelligence if you
 

109
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,199
done with machine intelligence if you
don't understand the principles by which

110
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:04,209
don't understand the principles by which
 

111
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,389
don't understand the principles by which
the brain works and so I actually

112
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
the brain works and so I actually
 

113
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,009
the brain works and so I actually
believe that studying the brain is

114
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,019
believe that studying the brain is
 

115
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:10,350
believe that studying the brain is
actually the fast the fastest way to get

116
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
actually the fast the fastest way to get
 

117
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,660
actually the fast the fastest way to get
to machine intelligence and within that

118
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:12,670
to machine intelligence and within that
 

119
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,759
to machine intelligence and within that
let me ask the impossible question how

120
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:14,769
let me ask the impossible question how
 

121
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,100
let me ask the impossible question how
do you not define but at least think

122
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,110
do you not define but at least think
 

123
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,530
do you not define but at least think
about what it means to be intelligent so

124
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,540
about what it means to be intelligent so
 

125
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,390
about what it means to be intelligent so
I didn't try to answer that question

126
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:21,400
I didn't try to answer that question
 

127
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,970
I didn't try to answer that question
first we said let's just talk about how

128
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:23,980
first we said let's just talk about how
 

129
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,199
first we said let's just talk about how
the brain works let's figure out how

130
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,209
the brain works let's figure out how
 

131
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,059
the brain works let's figure out how
certain parts of the brain mostly the

132
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:27,069
certain parts of the brain mostly the
 

133
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,100
certain parts of the brain mostly the
new your cortex but some other parts to

134
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,110
new your cortex but some other parts to
 

135
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,050
new your cortex but some other parts to
the parts of the very most associated

136
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,060
the parts of the very most associated
 

137
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,870
the parts of the very most associated
intelligence and let's discover the

138
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:33,880
intelligence and let's discover the
 

139
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,710
intelligence and let's discover the
principles about how they work because

140
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
principles about how they work because
 

141
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,759
principles about how they work because
intelligence isn't just like some

142
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:38,769
intelligence isn't just like some
 

143
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:39,990
intelligence isn't just like some
mechanism and it's not just some

144
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
mechanism and it's not just some
 

145
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,849
mechanism and it's not just some
capabilities it's like okay we don't

146
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:41,859
capabilities it's like okay we don't
 

147
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,199
capabilities it's like okay we don't
even have know where to begin on this

148
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,209
even have know where to begin on this
 

149
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,370
even have know where to begin on this
stuff and so now that we've made a lot

150
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,380
stuff and so now that we've made a lot
 

151
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,890
stuff and so now that we've made a lot
of progress on this after we've made a

152
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:49,900
of progress on this after we've made a
 

153
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,120
of progress on this after we've made a
lot of progress on how the neocortex

154
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,130
lot of progress on how the neocortex
 

155
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
lot of progress on how the neocortex
works and we can talk about that I now

156
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
works and we can talk about that I now
 

157
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,110
works and we can talk about that I now
have a very good idea what's going to be

158
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
have a very good idea what's going to be
 

159
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,089
have a very good idea what's going to be
required to make intelligent machines I

160
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:57,099
required to make intelligent machines I
 

161
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,280
required to make intelligent machines I
can tell you today you know some of the

162
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,290
can tell you today you know some of the
 

163
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,530
can tell you today you know some of the
things are gonna be necessary I believe

164
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:01,540
things are gonna be necessary I believe
 

165
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,720
things are gonna be necessary I believe
to create intelligent machines well so

166
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730
to create intelligent machines well so
 

167
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,129
to create intelligent machines well so
we'll get there we'll get to the

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:05,139
we'll get there we'll get to the
 

169
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,500
we'll get there we'll get to the
neocortex and some of the theories of

170
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,510
neocortex and some of the theories of
 

171
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,360
neocortex and some of the theories of
how the whole thing works and you're

172
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,370
how the whole thing works and you're
 

173
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,900
how the whole thing works and you're
saying as we understand more and more

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:11,910
saying as we understand more and more
 

175
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,460
saying as we understand more and more
about the neocortex about our own human

it's not useful
look there's a long history of AI as you

188
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,510
look there's a long history of AI as you
 

189
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,300
look there's a long history of AI as you
know right and there's been different

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,310
know right and there's been different

approaches taken to it and who knows
 

193
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,599
approaches taken to it and who knows
maybe they're all useful right so you

194
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:33,609
maybe they're all useful right so you
 

195
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,539
maybe they're all useful right so you
know the good old fashioned AI the

would think almost everyone agree that

211
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,110
set of a deep way that that humans are
and so it's it's just the question is

212
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
and so it's it's just the question is
 

213
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,460
and so it's it's just the question is
how do you get from where those systems

214
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:54,470
how do you get from where those systems
 

215
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,190
how do you get from where those systems
were or are today to where a lot of

219
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,250
people think we're going to go and just
big big gap there a huge gap and I think

220
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,260
big big gap there a huge gap and I think
 

221
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,699
big big gap there a huge gap and I think
the quickest way of bridging that gap is

222
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:05,709
the quickest way of bridging that gap is
 

223
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,050
the quickest way of bridging that gap is
to figure out how the brain does that

224
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,060
to figure out how the brain does that
 

225
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,030
to figure out how the brain does that
and then we can sit back and look and

226
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,040
and then we can sit back and look and
 

227
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,009
and then we can sit back and look and
say oh what do these principles that the

228
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,019
say oh what do these principles that the
 

229
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,080
say oh what do these principles that the
brain works on are necessary and which

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,090
brain works on are necessary and which
 

231
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,770
brain works on are necessary and which
ones or not

00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
difficult question do you think it's
 

251
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,640
difficult question do you think it's
possible that we will never be able to

possible that we will never be able to

maybe there's aspects to the human mind

256
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,060
maybe there's aspects to the human mind
 

257
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,650
maybe there's aspects to the human mind
like we ourselves cannot introspectively

like we ourselves cannot introspectively

get to the core that there's a wall you

260
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,240
get to the core that there's a wall you
 

261
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,150
get to the core that there's a wall you
eventually hit yeah I don't believe

262
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,160
eventually hit yeah I don't believe
 

263
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,620
eventually hit yeah I don't believe
that's the case

264
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,630
that's the case
 

265
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,120
that's the case
I have never believed that's the case

Vittal right there's like what's the

280
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,490
Vittal right there's like what's the
 

281
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,470
Vittal right there's like what's the
difference in living matter and

282
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:06,480
difference in living matter and
 

283
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,030
difference in living matter and
nonliving matter something special you

284
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,040
nonliving matter something special you
 

285
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,950
nonliving matter something special you
never understand we no longer think that

286
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:09,960
never understand we no longer think that
 

287
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,250
never understand we no longer think that
so there's there's no historical

288
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,260
so there's there's no historical
 

289
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,290
so there's there's no historical
evidence to suggest is the case and I

290
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,300
evidence to suggest is the case and I
 

291
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,520
evidence to suggest is the case and I
just never even considered that's a

292
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,530
just never even considered that's a
 

293
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,630
just never even considered that's a
possibility I would also say today we

294
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:20,640
possibility I would also say today we
 

295
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,550
possibility I would also say today we
understand so much about the neocortex

296
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
understand so much about the neocortex
 

297
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,290
understand so much about the neocortex
we've made tremendous progress in the

298
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,300
we've made tremendous progress in the
 

299
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,690
we've made tremendous progress in the
last few years that I no longer think of

300
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:26,700
last few years that I no longer think of
 

301
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,740
last few years that I no longer think of
it as an open question the answers are

302
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:30,750
it as an open question the answers are
 

303
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,840
it as an open question the answers are
very clear to me and the pieces we know

304
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:32,850
very clear to me and the pieces we know
 

305
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,030
very clear to me and the pieces we know
we don't know I are clearly me but the

306
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,040
we don't know I are clearly me but the
 

307
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,830
we don't know I are clearly me but the
framework is all there and it's like oh

308
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
framework is all there and it's like oh
 

309
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,690
framework is all there and it's like oh
okay we're gonna be able to do this this

310
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:38,700
okay we're gonna be able to do this this
 

311
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,370
okay we're gonna be able to do this this
is not a problem anymore it just takes

312
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:40,380
is not a problem anymore it just takes
 

313
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,620
is not a problem anymore it just takes
time and effort but there's no mystery a

314
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,630
time and effort but there's no mystery a
 

315
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,960
time and effort but there's no mystery a
big mystery anymore so then let's get it

316
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:44,970
big mystery anymore so then let's get it
 

317
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,030
big mystery anymore so then let's get it
into it for people like myself we're not

318
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,040
into it for people like myself we're not
 

319
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,240
into it for people like myself we're not
very well versed in the human brain

320
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,250
very well versed in the human brain
 

321
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,540
very well versed in the human brain
except my own can you describe to me at

322
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,550
except my own can you describe to me at
 

323
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,950
except my own can you describe to me at
the highest level what are the different

324
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:57,960
the highest level what are the different
 

325
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,390
the highest level what are the different
parts of the human brain and then

326
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
parts of the human brain and then
 

327
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,480
parts of the human brain and then
zooming in on the neocortex the parts of

328
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,490
zooming in on the neocortex the parts of
 

329
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,000
zooming in on the neocortex the parts of
the neocortex and so on a quick overview

330
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,010
the neocortex and so on a quick overview
 

331
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,630
the neocortex and so on a quick overview
yeah sure human brain we can divide it

332
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:08,640
yeah sure human brain we can divide it
 

333
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,480
yeah sure human brain we can divide it
roughly into two parts there's the old

334
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,490
roughly into two parts there's the old
 

335
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,750
roughly into two parts there's the old
parts lots of pieces and then there's a

336
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:14,760
parts lots of pieces and then there's a
 

337
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,110
parts lots of pieces and then there's a
new part the new part is the neocortex

338
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
new part the new part is the neocortex
 

339
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,790
new part the new part is the neocortex
it's new because it didn't exist before

340
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:19,800
it's new because it didn't exist before
 

341
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
it's new because it didn't exist before
mammals the only mammals have a

342
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,330
mammals the only mammals have a
 

343
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,570
mammals the only mammals have a
neocortex and in humans it's in primates

344
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,580
neocortex and in humans it's in primates
 

345
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,610
neocortex and in humans it's in primates
it's very large in the human brain the

346
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:25,620
it's very large in the human brain the
 

347
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,680
it's very large in the human brain the
neocortex occupies about seventy to

348
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,690
neocortex occupies about seventy to
 

349
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,930
neocortex occupies about seventy to
seventy-five percent of the volume of

350
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:29,940
seventy-five percent of the volume of
 

351
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,900
seventy-five percent of the volume of
the brain it's huge and the old parts of

352
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:32,910
the brain it's huge and the old parts of
 

353
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,630
the brain it's huge and the old parts of
the brain are there's lots of pieces

354
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:35,640
the brain are there's lots of pieces
 

355
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,370
the brain are there's lots of pieces
there there's a spinal cord and there's

356
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,380
there there's a spinal cord and there's
 

357
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,590
there there's a spinal cord and there's
the brain stem and the cerebellum and

358
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
the brain stem and the cerebellum and
 

359
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
the brain stem and the cerebellum and
the different parts of the basal ganglia

360
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:40,710
the different parts of the basal ganglia
 

361
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,860
the different parts of the basal ganglia
and so on in the old parts of the brain

362
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:42,870
and so on in the old parts of the brain
 

363
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,930
and so on in the old parts of the brain
you have the autonomic regulation like

364
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:44,940
you have the autonomic regulation like
 

365
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,420
you have the autonomic regulation like
breathing and heart rate you have basic

366
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,430
breathing and heart rate you have basic
 

367
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,550
breathing and heart rate you have basic
behaviors so like walking and running or

368
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,560
behaviors so like walking and running or
 

369
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,750
behaviors so like walking and running or
controlled by the old parts of the brain

370
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,760
controlled by the old parts of the brain
 

371
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,940
controlled by the old parts of the brain
all the emotional centers of the brain

372
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:52,950
all the emotional centers of the brain
 

373
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,110
all the emotional centers of the brain
are in the old part of the brains when

374
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,120
are in the old part of the brains when
 

375
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,490
are in the old part of the brains when
you feel anger or hungry lust with

376
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:55,500
you feel anger or hungry lust with
 

377
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,600
you feel anger or hungry lust with
things like that those are all in the

378
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:56,610
things like that those are all in the
 

379
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,430
things like that those are all in the
old parts of the brain

380
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,440
old parts of the brain
 

381
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,250
old parts of the brain
and and we associate with the neocortex

382
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,260
and and we associate with the neocortex
 

383
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,860
and and we associate with the neocortex
all the things we think about as sort of

384
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:03,870
all the things we think about as sort of
 

385
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,460
all the things we think about as sort of
high-level perception and cognitive

386
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,470
high-level perception and cognitive
 

387
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,280
high-level perception and cognitive
functions anything from seeing and

388
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,290
functions anything from seeing and
 

389
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,370
functions anything from seeing and
hearing and touching things to language

390
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,380
hearing and touching things to language
 

391
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,230
hearing and touching things to language
to mathematics and engineering and

392
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
to mathematics and engineering and
 

393
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,300
to mathematics and engineering and
science and so on those are all

394
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,310
science and so on those are all
 

395
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,210
science and so on those are all
associative the neocortex and they're

396
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,220
associative the neocortex and they're
 

397
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,790
associative the neocortex and they're
certainly correlated our abilities in

398
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
certainly correlated our abilities in
 

399
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,230
certainly correlated our abilities in
those regards are correlated with the

400
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
those regards are correlated with the
 

401
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,150
those regards are correlated with the
relative size of our neocortex compared

402
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
relative size of our neocortex compared
 

403
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,520
relative size of our neocortex compared
to other mammals so that's like the

404
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,530
to other mammals so that's like the
 

405
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,270
to other mammals so that's like the
rough division and you obviously can't

406
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,280
rough division and you obviously can't
 

407
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,440
rough division and you obviously can't
understand the new your cortex is

408
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,450
understand the new your cortex is
 

409
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,630
understand the new your cortex is
completely isolated but you can

410
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:35,640
completely isolated but you can
 

411
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,670
completely isolated but you can
understand a lot of it with just a few

412
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
understand a lot of it with just a few
 

413
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
understand a lot of it with just a few
interfaces so the all parts of the brain

414
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,570
interfaces so the all parts of the brain
 

415
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,020
interfaces so the all parts of the brain
and so it it gives you a system to study

416
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,030
and so it it gives you a system to study
 

417
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,430
and so it it gives you a system to study
the other remarkable thing about the

418
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
the other remarkable thing about the
 

419
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,010
the other remarkable thing about the
neocortex compared to the old parts of

420
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,020
neocortex compared to the old parts of
 

421
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
neocortex compared to the old parts of
the brain is the neocortex it's

422
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,030
the brain is the neocortex it's
 

423
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,580
the brain is the neocortex it's
extremely uniform it's not visually or

424
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,590
extremely uniform it's not visually or
 

425
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,370
extremely uniform it's not visually or
anatomically or it's very sucky

426
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:58,380
anatomically or it's very sucky
 

427
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,990
anatomically or it's very sucky
I always like to say it's like the size

428
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
I always like to say it's like the size
 

429
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,880
I always like to say it's like the size
of a dinner napkin about two and a half

430
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:01,890
of a dinner napkin about two and a half
 

431
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,550
of a dinner napkin about two and a half
millimeters thick and it looks

432
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
millimeters thick and it looks
 

433
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,900
millimeters thick and it looks
remarkably the same everywhere

434
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:05,910
remarkably the same everywhere
 

435
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,220
remarkably the same everywhere
everywhere you look and that children

436
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,230
everywhere you look and that children
 

437
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,540
everywhere you look and that children
have millimeters is this detailed

438
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,550
have millimeters is this detailed
 

439
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,120
have millimeters is this detailed
architecture and it looks remarkably the

440
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,130
architecture and it looks remarkably the
 

441
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,080
architecture and it looks remarkably the
same everywhere and that's a cross

442
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,090
same everywhere and that's a cross
 

443
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,240
same everywhere and that's a cross
species the mouse versus a cat and a dog

444
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,250
species the mouse versus a cat and a dog
 

445
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,040
species the mouse versus a cat and a dog
and a human or if you look at the old

446
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,050
and a human or if you look at the old
 

447
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,600
and a human or if you look at the old
parts of the brain there's lots of

448
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:17,610
parts of the brain there's lots of
 

449
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,240
parts of the brain there's lots of
little pieces do specific things so it's

450
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,250
little pieces do specific things so it's
 

451
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,010
little pieces do specific things so it's
like the old parts of a brain evolved

452
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,020
like the old parts of a brain evolved
 

453
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,940
like the old parts of a brain evolved
look this is the part that controls

454
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:22,950
look this is the part that controls
 

455
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,290
look this is the part that controls
heart rate and this is the part that

456
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,300
heart rate and this is the part that
 

457
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,610
heart rate and this is the part that
controls this and this is this the kind

458
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,620
controls this and this is this the kind
 

459
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,659
controls this and this is this the kind
of thing and that's this kind of thing

460
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:26,669
of thing and that's this kind of thing
 

461
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,390
of thing and that's this kind of thing
and he's evolved for eons a long long

462
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,400
and he's evolved for eons a long long
 

463
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,710
and he's evolved for eons a long long
time and they have their specific

464
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
time and they have their specific
 

465
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,810
time and they have their specific
functions and all sudden mammals come

466
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:32,820
functions and all sudden mammals come
 

467
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,130
functions and all sudden mammals come
along and they got this thing called the

468
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,140
along and they got this thing called the
 

469
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,589
along and they got this thing called the
neocortex and it got large by just

470
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:36,599
neocortex and it got large by just
 

471
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,719
neocortex and it got large by just
replicating the same thing over and over

472
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:38,729
replicating the same thing over and over
 

473
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,209
replicating the same thing over and over
and over again this is like wow this is

474
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:41,219
and over again this is like wow this is
 

475
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,250
and over again this is like wow this is
incredible so all the evidence we have

476
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,260
incredible so all the evidence we have
 

477
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,780
incredible so all the evidence we have
and this is an idea that was first

478
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:47,790
and this is an idea that was first
 

479
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,290
and this is an idea that was first
articulated in a very cogent and

480
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,300
articulated in a very cogent and
 

481
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,760
articulated in a very cogent and
beautiful argument by a guy named Vernon

482
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:52,770
beautiful argument by a guy named Vernon
 

483
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,630
beautiful argument by a guy named Vernon
mal Castle in 1978 was that the

484
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
mal Castle in 1978 was that the
 

485
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,620
mal Castle in 1978 was that the
neocortex all works on the same

486
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:00,630
neocortex all works on the same
 

487
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,980
neocortex all works on the same
principle so language hearing touch

488
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:03,990
principle so language hearing touch
 

489
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,870
principle so language hearing touch
vision engineering all these things are

490
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:05,880
vision engineering all these things are
 

491
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,700
vision engineering all these things are
basically underlying or all built in the

492
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:07,710
basically underlying or all built in the
 

493
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,460
basically underlying or all built in the
same computational substrate they're

494
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,470
same computational substrate they're
 

495
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,260
same computational substrate they're
really all the same problem

496
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,270
really all the same problem
 

497
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,820
really all the same problem
all over the building blocks all look

498
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:13,830
all over the building blocks all look
 

499
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,740
all over the building blocks all look
similar yeah and they're not even that

500
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:15,750
similar yeah and they're not even that
 

501
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,060
similar yeah and they're not even that
low-level we're not talking about like

502
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,070
low-level we're not talking about like
 

503
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,410
low-level we're not talking about like
like neurons we're talking about this

504
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,420
like neurons we're talking about this
 

505
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,450
like neurons we're talking about this
very complex circuit that exists

506
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:20,460
very complex circuit that exists
 

507
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,880
very complex circuit that exists
throughout the neocortex is remarkably

508
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:22,890
throughout the neocortex is remarkably
 

509
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,220
throughout the neocortex is remarkably
similar it is it's like yes did you see

510
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,230
similar it is it's like yes did you see
 

511
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,780
similar it is it's like yes did you see
variations of it here and there more of

512
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:26,790
variations of it here and there more of
 

513
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,750
variations of it here and there more of
the cell uh so that's not all so on but

514
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
the cell uh so that's not all so on but
 

515
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,030
the cell uh so that's not all so on but
what now encruster argued was it says

516
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,040
what now encruster argued was it says
 

517
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,310
what now encruster argued was it says
you know if you take a section on your

518
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
you know if you take a section on your
 

519
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,280
you know if you take a section on your
cortex why is one a visual area and one

520
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,290
cortex why is one a visual area and one
 

521
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,650
cortex why is one a visual area and one
is a auditory area or why 'since and his

522
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
is a auditory area or why 'since and his
 

523
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,350
is a auditory area or why 'since and his
answer was it's because one is connected

524
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,360
answer was it's because one is connected
 

525
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,740
answer was it's because one is connected
to eyes and one is connected ears

526
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:44,750
to eyes and one is connected ears
 

527
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,750
to eyes and one is connected ears
literally you mean just its most closest

528
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
literally you mean just its most closest
 

529
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,030
literally you mean just its most closest
in terms of number of connections to

530
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
in terms of number of connections to
 

531
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,830
in terms of number of connections to
listen sir literally if you took the

532
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:51,840
listen sir literally if you took the
 

533
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,900
listen sir literally if you took the
optic nerve and it attached it to a

534
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:53,910
optic nerve and it attached it to a
 

535
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,400
optic nerve and it attached it to a
different part of the neocortex that

536
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,410
different part of the neocortex that
 

537
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,100
different part of the neocortex that
part would become a visual region this

538
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,110
part would become a visual region this
 

539
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,080
part would become a visual region this
actually this experiment was actually

540
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
actually this experiment was actually
 

541
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,850
actually this experiment was actually
done by Mercosur oh boy

542
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:01,860
done by Mercosur oh boy
 

543
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,610
done by Mercosur oh boy
and uh in in developing I think it was

544
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:04,620
and uh in in developing I think it was
 

545
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,900
and uh in in developing I think it was
lemurs I can't remember there was some

546
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:05,910
lemurs I can't remember there was some
 

547
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,880
lemurs I can't remember there was some
animal and and there's a lot of evidence

548
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:07,890
animal and and there's a lot of evidence
 

549
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,560
animal and and there's a lot of evidence
to this you know if you take a blind

550
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:09,570
to this you know if you take a blind
 

551
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,380
to this you know if you take a blind
person the person is born blind at Birth

552
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:11,390
person the person is born blind at Birth
 

553
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,940
person the person is born blind at Birth
they they're born with a visual

554
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:13,950
they they're born with a visual
 

555
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,760
they they're born with a visual
neocortex it doesn't may not get any

556
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:16,770
neocortex it doesn't may not get any
 

557
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,770
neocortex it doesn't may not get any
input from the eyes because of some

558
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:18,780
input from the eyes because of some
 

559
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,610
input from the eyes because of some
congenital defect or something and that

560
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:22,620
congenital defect or something and that
 

561
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,740
congenital defect or something and that
region become does something else it

562
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:24,750
region become does something else it
 

563
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,330
region become does something else it
picks up another task so and it's it's

564
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:29,340
picks up another task so and it's it's
 

565
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,150
picks up another task so and it's it's
so it's just it's this very complex

566
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
so it's just it's this very complex
 

567
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,230
so it's just it's this very complex
thing it's not like oh they're all built

568
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
thing it's not like oh they're all built
 

569
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,460
thing it's not like oh they're all built
on neurons no they're all built in this

570
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,470
on neurons no they're all built in this
 

571
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,000
on neurons no they're all built in this
very complex circuit and and somehow

572
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,010
very complex circuit and and somehow
 

573
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,460
very complex circuit and and somehow
that circuit underlies everything and so

574
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,470
that circuit underlies everything and so
 

575
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,790
that circuit underlies everything and so
this is the it it's called the common

576
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:43,800
this is the it it's called the common
 

577
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,070
this is the it it's called the common
cortical algorithm if you will some

578
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,080
cortical algorithm if you will some
 

579
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
cortical algorithm if you will some
scientists just find it hard to believe

580
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,490
scientists just find it hard to believe
 

581
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,400
scientists just find it hard to believe
and they decide can't really that's true

582
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,410
and they decide can't really that's true
 

583
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,740
and they decide can't really that's true
but the evidence is overwhelming in this

584
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:51,750
but the evidence is overwhelming in this
 

585
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,840
but the evidence is overwhelming in this
case and so a large part of what it

586
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
case and so a large part of what it
 

587
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,460
case and so a large part of what it
means to figure out how the brain

588
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,470
means to figure out how the brain
 

589
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,050
means to figure out how the brain
creates intelligence and what is

590
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,060
creates intelligence and what is
 

591
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,260
creates intelligence and what is
intelligence in the brain is to

592
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,270
intelligence in the brain is to
 

593
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,150
intelligence in the brain is to
understand what that circuit does if you

594
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
understand what that circuit does if you
 

595
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,820
understand what that circuit does if you
can figure out what that circuit does as

596
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:04,830
can figure out what that circuit does as
 

597
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,070
can figure out what that circuit does as
amazing as it is then you can then you

598
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,080
amazing as it is then you can then you
 

599
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
amazing as it is then you can then you
then you understand what all these other

600
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:08,730
then you understand what all these other
 

601
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,880
then you understand what all these other
cognitive functions are so a few words

602
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:10,890
cognitive functions are so a few words
 

603
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,820
cognitive functions are so a few words
to sort of put neural cortex outside of

604
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:13,830
to sort of put neural cortex outside of
 

605
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,890
to sort of put neural cortex outside of
your book on intelligence you look if

606
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:15,900
your book on intelligence you look if
 

607
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,200
your book on intelligence you look if
you wrote a giant tome a textbook on the

608
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,210
you wrote a giant tome a textbook on the
 

609
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,460
you wrote a giant tome a textbook on the
neocortex and you look maybe a couple

610
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,470
neocortex and you look maybe a couple
 

611
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,950
neocortex and you look maybe a couple
centuries from now how much of what we

612
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:24,960
centuries from now how much of what we
 

613
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,180
centuries from now how much of what we
know now would still be

614
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,190
know now would still be
 

615
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,400
know now would still be
two centuries from now so how close are

616
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,410
two centuries from now so how close are
 

617
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,070
two centuries from now so how close are
we in terms of understand I have to

618
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,080
we in terms of understand I have to
 

619
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,870
we in terms of understand I have to
speak from my own particular experience

620
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
speak from my own particular experience
 

621
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
speak from my own particular experience
here so I run a small research lab here

622
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,610
here so I run a small research lab here
 

623
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,400
here so I run a small research lab here
it's like yeah it's like I need other

624
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,410
it's like yeah it's like I need other
 

625
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,570
it's like yeah it's like I need other
research lab I'm the sort of the

626
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:38,580
research lab I'm the sort of the
 

627
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,590
research lab I'm the sort of the
principal investigator there was

628
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
principal investigator there was
 

629
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,670
principal investigator there was
actually two of us and there's a bunch

630
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:40,680
actually two of us and there's a bunch
 

631
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,250
actually two of us and there's a bunch
of other people and this is what we do

632
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,260
of other people and this is what we do
 

633
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,290
of other people and this is what we do
we started the neocortex and we

634
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
we started the neocortex and we
 

635
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,450
we started the neocortex and we
published our results and so on so about

636
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:47,460
published our results and so on so about
 

637
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,300
published our results and so on so about
three years ago we had a real

638
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,310
three years ago we had a real
 

639
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,940
three years ago we had a real
breakthrough in this in this film just

640
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:51,950
breakthrough in this in this film just
 

641
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,960
breakthrough in this in this film just
tremendous spectrum we started we've now

642
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:53,970
tremendous spectrum we started we've now
 

643
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,570
tremendous spectrum we started we've now
published I think three papers on it and

644
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:56,580
published I think three papers on it and
 

645
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,690
published I think three papers on it and
so I have I have a pretty good

646
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:58,700
so I have I have a pretty good
 

647
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,100
so I have I have a pretty good
understanding of all the pieces and what

648
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,110
understanding of all the pieces and what
 

649
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,550
understanding of all the pieces and what
we're missing I would say that almost

650
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
we're missing I would say that almost
 

651
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,410
we're missing I would say that almost
all the empirical data we've collected

652
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,420
all the empirical data we've collected
 

653
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,750
all the empirical data we've collected
about the brain which is enormous if you

654
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:08,760
about the brain which is enormous if you
 

655
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,980
about the brain which is enormous if you
don't know the neuroscience literature

656
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:09,990
don't know the neuroscience literature
 

657
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,470
don't know the neuroscience literature
it's just incredibly big and it's it's

658
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
it's just incredibly big and it's it's
 

659
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,810
it's just incredibly big and it's it's
the most part all correct its facts and

660
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:17,820
the most part all correct its facts and
 

661
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,590
the most part all correct its facts and
and experimental results and

662
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
and experimental results and
 

663
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,090
and experimental results and
measurements and all kinds of stuff but

664
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,100
measurements and all kinds of stuff but
 

665
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,860
measurements and all kinds of stuff but
it none none of that has been really

666
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:24,870
it none none of that has been really
 

667
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,040
it none none of that has been really
assimilated into a theoretical framework

668
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,050
assimilated into a theoretical framework
 

669
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,110
assimilated into a theoretical framework
it's it's data without it's in the

670
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,120
it's it's data without it's in the
 

671
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,590
it's it's data without it's in the
language of Thomas Kuhns a historian it

672
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
language of Thomas Kuhns a historian it
 

673
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
language of Thomas Kuhns a historian it
would be a sort of a pre paradigm

674
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:34,890
would be a sort of a pre paradigm
 

675
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,980
would be a sort of a pre paradigm
science lots of data but no way to fit

676
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:36,990
science lots of data but no way to fit
 

677
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,020
science lots of data but no way to fit
in together I think almost all of that's

678
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,030
in together I think almost all of that's
 

679
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,580
in together I think almost all of that's
correct it's gonna be some mistakes in

680
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,590
correct it's gonna be some mistakes in
 

681
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,790
correct it's gonna be some mistakes in
there and for the most part there aren't

682
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:43,800
there and for the most part there aren't
 

683
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,040
there and for the most part there aren't
really good cogent theories about it how

684
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,050
really good cogent theories about it how
 

685
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,020
really good cogent theories about it how
to put it together it's not like we have

686
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,030
to put it together it's not like we have
 

687
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,000
to put it together it's not like we have
two or three competing good theories

688
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,010
two or three competing good theories
 

689
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,260
two or three competing good theories
which ones are right and which ones are

690
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,270
which ones are right and which ones are
 

691
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,910
which ones are right and which ones are
wrong it's like yeah people just like

692
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:52,920
wrong it's like yeah people just like
 

693
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,140
wrong it's like yeah people just like
scratching their heads wrong things you

694
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,150
scratching their heads wrong things you
 

695
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,910
scratching their heads wrong things you
know some people given up on trying to

696
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
know some people given up on trying to
 

697
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,900
know some people given up on trying to
like figure out what the whole thing

698
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:56,910
like figure out what the whole thing
 

699
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,930
like figure out what the whole thing
does in fact is very very few labs that

700
00:12:59,930 --> 00:12:59,940
does in fact is very very few labs that
 

701
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,090
does in fact is very very few labs that
we that we do that focus really on

702
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,100
we that we do that focus really on
 

703
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,180
we that we do that focus really on
theory and all this unassimilated data

704
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,190
theory and all this unassimilated data
 

705
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,100
theory and all this unassimilated data
and trying to explain it so it's not

706
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,110
and trying to explain it so it's not
 

707
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,110
and trying to explain it so it's not
like we have we've got it wrong it's

708
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
like we have we've got it wrong it's
 

709
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,240
like we have we've got it wrong it's
just that we haven't got it at all so

710
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,250
just that we haven't got it at all so
 

711
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,760
just that we haven't got it at all so
it's really I would say pretty early

712
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:13,770
it's really I would say pretty early
 

713
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,610
it's really I would say pretty early
days in terms of understanding the

714
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:16,620
days in terms of understanding the
 

715
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,550
days in terms of understanding the
fundamental theories forces of the way

716
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
fundamental theories forces of the way
 

717
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,350
fundamental theories forces of the way
our mind works I don't think so that

718
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
our mind works I don't think so that
 

719
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,060
our mind works I don't think so that
what I would have said that's true five

720
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,070
what I would have said that's true five
 

721
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,830
what I would have said that's true five
years ago so I

722
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:26,840
years ago so I
 

723
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,690
years ago so I
we have some really big breakthroughs on

724
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:28,700
we have some really big breakthroughs on
 

725
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,010
we have some really big breakthroughs on
this recently and we started publishing

726
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,020
this recently and we started publishing
 

727
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,990
this recently and we started publishing
papers on this so look it but so I don't

728
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,000
papers on this so look it but so I don't
 

729
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,610
papers on this so look it but so I don't
think it's I you know I'm an optimist

730
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:36,620
think it's I you know I'm an optimist
 

731
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,530
think it's I you know I'm an optimist
and from where I sit today most people

732
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:38,540
and from where I sit today most people
 

733
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,790
and from where I sit today most people
would disagree with this but from where

734
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:39,800
would disagree with this but from where
 

735
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,630
would disagree with this but from where
I sit city from what I know uh it's not

736
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:43,640
I sit city from what I know uh it's not
 

737
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,610
I sit city from what I know uh it's not
super early days anymore we are it's

738
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:45,620
super early days anymore we are it's
 

739
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,900
super early days anymore we are it's
it's you know the way these things go is

740
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:46,910
it's you know the way these things go is
 

741
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,430
it's you know the way these things go is
it's not a linear path right you don't

742
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:48,440
it's not a linear path right you don't
 

743
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
it's not a linear path right you don't
just start accumulating and get better

744
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,210
just start accumulating and get better
 

745
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,550
just start accumulating and get better
and better better no you okay all the

746
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:51,560
and better better no you okay all the
 

747
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,380
and better better no you okay all the
stuff you've collected none of it makes

748
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,390
stuff you've collected none of it makes
 

749
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,940
stuff you've collected none of it makes
sense all these different things we just

750
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:54,950
sense all these different things we just
 

751
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,380
sense all these different things we just
turn around and then you're gonna have

752
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,390
turn around and then you're gonna have
 

753
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,850
turn around and then you're gonna have
some breaking points or all sudden oh my

754
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:57,860
some breaking points or all sudden oh my
 

755
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,830
some breaking points or all sudden oh my
god now we got it right so that's how it

756
00:13:59,830 --> 00:13:59,840
god now we got it right so that's how it
 

757
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,490
god now we got it right so that's how it
goes and science and I feel like we

758
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:03,500
goes and science and I feel like we
 

759
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,900
goes and science and I feel like we
passed that little thing about a couple

760
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:04,910
passed that little thing about a couple
 

761
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,150
passed that little thing about a couple
years ago all that big thing a couple

762
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
years ago all that big thing a couple
 

763
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,760
years ago all that big thing a couple
years ago so we can talk about that time

764
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:09,770
years ago so we can talk about that time
 

765
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,920
years ago so we can talk about that time
will tell if I'm right but I feel very

766
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:11,930
will tell if I'm right but I feel very
 

767
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,420
will tell if I'm right but I feel very
confident about it that's my moment to

768
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,430
confident about it that's my moment to
 

769
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,410
confident about it that's my moment to
say it on tape like this at least very

770
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:17,420
say it on tape like this at least very
 

771
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,570
say it on tape like this at least very
optimistic so let's before those few

772
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:19,580
optimistic so let's before those few
 

773
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,200
optimistic so let's before those few
years ago

774
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,210
years ago
 

775
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,350
years ago
let's take take step back to HTM the

776
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
let's take take step back to HTM the
 

777
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,570
let's take take step back to HTM the
hierarchical temporal memory theory

778
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:25,580
hierarchical temporal memory theory
 

779
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,460
hierarchical temporal memory theory
which you first proposed on intelligence

780
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,470
which you first proposed on intelligence
 

781
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,290
which you first proposed on intelligence
and went through a few different

782
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,300
and went through a few different
 

783
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,940
and went through a few different
generations can you describe what it is

784
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:30,950
generations can you describe what it is
 

785
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,440
generations can you describe what it is
how it evolved through the three

786
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,450
how it evolved through the three
 

787
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,450
how it evolved through the three
generations yes you first put it on

788
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:34,460
generations yes you first put it on
 

789
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,890
generations yes you first put it on
paper yeah so one of the things that

790
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:37,900
paper yeah so one of the things that
 

791
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,980
paper yeah so one of the things that
neuroscientists just sort of missed for

792
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:41,990
neuroscientists just sort of missed for
 

793
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,870
neuroscientists just sort of missed for
many many years and ice and especially

794
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:43,880
many many years and ice and especially
 

795
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,940
many many years and ice and especially
people were thinking about theory was

796
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:45,950
people were thinking about theory was
 

797
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,360
people were thinking about theory was
the nature of time in the brain brains

798
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,370
the nature of time in the brain brains
 

799
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,790
the nature of time in the brain brains
process information through time the

800
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:51,800
process information through time the
 

801
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
process information through time the
information coming into the brain is

802
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:52,970
information coming into the brain is
 

803
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,230
information coming into the brain is
constantly changing the patterns from my

804
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
constantly changing the patterns from my
 

805
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,420
constantly changing the patterns from my
speech right now if you're listening to

806
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,430
speech right now if you're listening to
 

807
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,920
speech right now if you're listening to
it at normal speed

808
00:14:59,920 --> 00:14:59,930
it at normal speed
 

809
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,380
it at normal speed
we'd be changing on IRA's about every 10

810
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,390
we'd be changing on IRA's about every 10
 

811
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,850
we'd be changing on IRA's about every 10
milliseconds or so you'd have it change

812
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:03,860
milliseconds or so you'd have it change
 

813
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,310
milliseconds or so you'd have it change
this constant flow when you look at the

814
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
this constant flow when you look at the
 

815
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,780
this constant flow when you look at the
world your eyes are moving constantly

816
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:07,790
world your eyes are moving constantly
 

817
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,850
world your eyes are moving constantly
three to five times a second and the

818
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:09,860
three to five times a second and the
 

819
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,800
three to five times a second and the
inputs complete completely if I were to

820
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:11,810
inputs complete completely if I were to
 

821
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,540
inputs complete completely if I were to
touch something like a coffee cup as I

822
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,550
touch something like a coffee cup as I
 

823
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,280
touch something like a coffee cup as I
move my fingers that input changes so

824
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,290
move my fingers that input changes so
 

825
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,860
move my fingers that input changes so
this idea that the brain works on time

826
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:17,870
this idea that the brain works on time
 

827
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,680
this idea that the brain works on time
changing patterns is almost completely

828
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:20,690
changing patterns is almost completely
 

829
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,540
changing patterns is almost completely
or was almost completely missing from a

830
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:22,550
or was almost completely missing from a
 

831
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,370
or was almost completely missing from a
lot of the basic theories like fears of

832
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:24,380
lot of the basic theories like fears of
 

833
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,570
lot of the basic theories like fears of
vision and so it's like oh no we're

834
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:25,580
vision and so it's like oh no we're
 

835
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,280
vision and so it's like oh no we're
going to put this image in front of you

836
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,290
going to put this image in front of you
 

837
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,040
going to put this image in front of you
and flash it and say what is it a

838
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,050
and flash it and say what is it a
 

839
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,940
and flash it and say what is it a
convolutional neural networks work that

840
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,950
convolutional neural networks work that
 

841
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,710
convolutional neural networks work that
way today right you know classify this

842
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
way today right you know classify this
 

843
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,320
way today right you know classify this
picture but that's not what visions like

844
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,330
picture but that's not what visions like
 

845
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,290
picture but that's not what visions like
vision is this sort of crazy time-based

846
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,300
vision is this sort of crazy time-based
 

847
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,640
vision is this sort of crazy time-based
pattern that's going all over the place

848
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:39,650
pattern that's going all over the place
 

849
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,300
pattern that's going all over the place
and

850
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,310
and
 

851
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,069
and
was touched and so is hearing so the

852
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
was touched and so is hearing so the
 

853
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,480
was touched and so is hearing so the
first part of a hierarchal temporal

854
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:43,490
first part of a hierarchal temporal
 

855
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,699
first part of a hierarchal temporal
memory was the temporal part it's it's

856
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:45,709
memory was the temporal part it's it's
 

857
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,920
memory was the temporal part it's it's
the same you you won't understand the

858
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:47,930
the same you you won't understand the
 

859
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,660
the same you you won't understand the
brain orally understand intelligent

00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:50,749
machines unless you're dealing with
 

863
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,110
machines unless you're dealing with
time-based patterns the second thing was

864
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
time-based patterns the second thing was
 

865
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,960
time-based patterns the second thing was
the memory component of it was is to say

866
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:55,970
the memory component of it was is to say
 

867
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,400
the memory component of it was is to say
that we aren't just processing input we

868
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,410
that we aren't just processing input we
 

869
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,429
that we aren't just processing input we
learn a model of the world that's the

870
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:03,439
learn a model of the world that's the
 

871
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,900
learn a model of the world that's the
memory stands for that model we have to

872
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:04,910
memory stands for that model we have to
 

873
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,790
memory stands for that model we have to
the point of the brain part of the New

874
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
the point of the brain part of the New
 

875
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,139
the point of the brain part of the New
York white chest it learns a model of

876
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:08,149
York white chest it learns a model of
 

877
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,910
York white chest it learns a model of
the world we have to store things that

878
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
the world we have to store things that
 

879
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,090
the world we have to store things that
our experience is in a form that leads

880
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,100
our experience is in a form that leads
 

881
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
our experience is in a form that leads
to a model the world so we can move

882
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,110
to a model the world so we can move
 

883
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,299
to a model the world so we can move
around the world we can pick things up

884
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:16,309
around the world we can pick things up
 

885
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,739
around the world we can pick things up
and do things and navigate know how it's

886
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:17,749
and do things and navigate know how it's
 

887
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,090
and do things and navigate know how it's
going on so that's that's what the

888
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,100
going on so that's that's what the
 

889
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,650
going on so that's that's what the
memory referred to and many people just

890
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:20,660
memory referred to and many people just
 

891
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,319
memory referred to and many people just
they were thinking about like certain

892
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:23,329
they were thinking about like certain
 

893
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,389
they were thinking about like certain
processes without memory at all it just

894
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:25,399
processes without memory at all it just
 

895
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,879
processes without memory at all it just
like processing things and finally the

896
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:27,889
like processing things and finally the
 

897
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,389
like processing things and finally the
hierarchical component was reflection to

898
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
hierarchical component was reflection to
 

899
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,439
hierarchical component was reflection to
that the New York or check so though

900
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:32,449
that the New York or check so though
 

901
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,100
that the New York or check so though
it's just uniform sheet of cells

902
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,110
it's just uniform sheet of cells
 

903
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,269
it's just uniform sheet of cells
different parts of it project to other

904
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
different parts of it project to other
 

905
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,210
different parts of it project to other
parts which project to other parts and

906
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,220
parts which project to other parts and
 

907
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,769
parts which project to other parts and
there is this sort of rough hierarchy in

908
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:41,779
there is this sort of rough hierarchy in
 

909
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,129
there is this sort of rough hierarchy in
terms of them so the hyperbole temporal

910
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,139
terms of them so the hyperbole temporal
 

911
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,600
terms of them so the hyperbole temporal
memory is just saying look we should be

912
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,610
memory is just saying look we should be
 

913
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,170
memory is just saying look we should be
thinking about the brain as time-based

914
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:49,180
thinking about the brain as time-based
 

915
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,090
thinking about the brain as time-based
you know model memory based and

916
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,100
you know model memory based and
 

917
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,019
you know model memory based and
hierarchical processing and and that was

918
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:56,029
hierarchical processing and and that was
 

919
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,970
hierarchical processing and and that was
a placeholder for a bunch of components

920
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:57,980
a placeholder for a bunch of components
 

921
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,970
a placeholder for a bunch of components
that we would then plug into that we

922
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:00,980
that we would then plug into that we
 

923
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,410
that we would then plug into that we
still believe all those things I just

924
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:02,420
still believe all those things I just
 

925
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,010
still believe all those things I just
said but we now know so much more that

926
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,020
said but we now know so much more that
 

927
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,510
said but we now know so much more that
I'm stopping to use the word hierarchal

928
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm stopping to use the word hierarchal
 

929
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,770
I'm stopping to use the word hierarchal
thumper memory yeah because it's it's

930
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:08,780
thumper memory yeah because it's it's
 

931
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,840
thumper memory yeah because it's it's
insufficient to capture the stuff we

932
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:10,850
insufficient to capture the stuff we
 

933
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,120
insufficient to capture the stuff we
know so again it's not incorrect but

934
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,130
know so again it's not incorrect but
 

935
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,740
know so again it's not incorrect but
it's I now know more and I would rather

936
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,750
it's I now know more and I would rather
 

937
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,169
it's I now know more and I would rather
describe it more accurately yeah so

938
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:17,179
describe it more accurately yeah so
 

939
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,610
describe it more accurately yeah so
you're basically we can think of HTM as

940
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:20,620
you're basically we can think of HTM as
 

941
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,809
you're basically we can think of HTM as
emphasizing that there's three aspects

942
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:22,819
emphasizing that there's three aspects
 

943
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,510
emphasizing that there's three aspects
of intelligence that important to think

944
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
of intelligence that important to think
 

945
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,429
of intelligence that important to think
about whatever the whatever the eventual

946
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
about whatever the whatever the eventual
 

947
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,260
about whatever the whatever the eventual
theory it converges to yeah so in terms

948
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,270
theory it converges to yeah so in terms
 

949
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,169
theory it converges to yeah so in terms
of time how do you think of nature of

950
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:32,179
of time how do you think of nature of
 

951
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,000
of time how do you think of nature of
time across different time scales so you

952
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,010
time across different time scales so you
 

953
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,149
time across different time scales so you
mentioned things changing a sensory

954
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:37,159
mentioned things changing a sensory
 

955
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,889
mentioned things changing a sensory
inputs changing every 10 being myself

956
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:38,899
inputs changing every 10 being myself
 

957
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,630
inputs changing every 10 being myself
what about it every few minutes every

958
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
what about it every few minutes every
 

959
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,060
what about it every few minutes every
few yeah Montse well if you think about

960
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,070
few yeah Montse well if you think about
 

961
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,200
few yeah Montse well if you think about
a neuroscience problem the brain problem

962
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,210
a neuroscience problem the brain problem
 

963
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,899
a neuroscience problem the brain problem
neurons themselves can stay active for

964
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:49,909
neurons themselves can stay active for
 

965
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,630
neurons themselves can stay active for
certain perks of time they parts of the

966
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
certain perks of time they parts of the
 

967
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,799
certain perks of time they parts of the
brain with this doctor 4-minute

968
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:53,809
brain with this doctor 4-minute
 

969
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,810
brain with this doctor 4-minute
you know so you could hold up a certain

970
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:55,820
you know so you could hold up a certain
 

971
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,159
you know so you could hold up a certain
perception or an activity for a certain

972
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:00,169
perception or an activity for a certain
 

973
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,830
perception or an activity for a certain
period of time but not most of them

974
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:02,840
period of time but not most of them
 

975
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,999
period of time but not most of them
don't last that long

976
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,009
don't last that long
 

977
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,879
don't last that long
and so if you think about your thoughts

978
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:06,889
and so if you think about your thoughts
 

979
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,489
and so if you think about your thoughts
are the activity neurons if you're going

980
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:09,499
are the activity neurons if you're going
 

981
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:10,749
are the activity neurons if you're going
to want to involve something that

982
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:10,759
to want to involve something that
 

983
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,399
to want to involve something that
happened a long time ago I'm even just

984
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:12,409
happened a long time ago I'm even just
 

985
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,769
happened a long time ago I'm even just
this morning for example the neurons

986
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:14,779
this morning for example the neurons
 

987
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,060
this morning for example the neurons
haven't been active throughout that time

988
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,070
haven't been active throughout that time
 

989
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,249
haven't been active throughout that time
so you have to store that so if I asked

990
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:18,259
so you have to store that so if I asked
 

991
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,779
so you have to store that so if I asked
you what did you have for breakfast

992
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:19,789
you what did you have for breakfast
 

993
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,539
you what did you have for breakfast
today that is memory that is you've

994
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:22,549
today that is memory that is you've
 

995
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,070
today that is memory that is you've
built into your model of the world now

996
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
built into your model of the world now
 

997
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,719
built into your model of the world now
you remember that and that memory is in

998
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:25,729
you remember that and that memory is in
 

999
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,359
you remember that and that memory is in
the in the synapses it's basically in

1000
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:28,369
the in the synapses it's basically in
 

1001
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:32,680
the in the synapses it's basically in
the formation of synapses and so it's it

1002
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:32,690
the formation of synapses and so it's it
 

1003
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,289
the formation of synapses and so it's it
you're sliding into what you know is two

1004
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:35,299
you're sliding into what you know is two
 

1005
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,209
you're sliding into what you know is two
different time scales there's time

1006
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:37,219
different time scales there's time
 

1007
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:38,379
different time scales there's time
scales of which we are like

1008
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:38,389
scales of which we are like
 

1009
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,060
scales of which we are like
understanding my language and moving

1010
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,070
understanding my language and moving
 

1011
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,499
understanding my language and moving
about and seeing things rapidly and over

1012
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:41,509
about and seeing things rapidly and over
 

1013
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,639
about and seeing things rapidly and over
time that's the time scales of

1014
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:42,649
time that's the time scales of
 

1015
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,979
time that's the time scales of
activities of neurons but if you want to

1016
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:44,989
activities of neurons but if you want to
 

1017
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,570
activities of neurons but if you want to
get longer time scales then it's more

1018
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:46,580
get longer time scales then it's more
 

1019
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,009
get longer time scales then it's more
memory and we have to invoke those

1020
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:48,019
memory and we have to invoke those
 

1021
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:50,589
memory and we have to invoke those
memories to say oh yes well now I can

1022
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:50,599
memories to say oh yes well now I can
 

1023
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,759
memories to say oh yes well now I can
remember what I had for breakfast

1024
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:51,769
remember what I had for breakfast
 

1025
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,399
remember what I had for breakfast
because I stored that someplace I may

1026
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:54,409
because I stored that someplace I may
 

1027
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,889
because I stored that someplace I may
forget it tomorrow but I'd stored for

1028
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:56,899
forget it tomorrow but I'd stored for
 

1029
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,820
forget it tomorrow but I'd stored for
afor now so this is memory also need to

1030
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:00,830
afor now so this is memory also need to
 

1031
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,560
afor now so this is memory also need to
have so the hierarchical aspect of

1032
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:05,570
have so the hierarchical aspect of
 

1033
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,779
have so the hierarchical aspect of
reality is not just about concepts it's

1034
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:07,789
reality is not just about concepts it's
 

1035
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,399
reality is not just about concepts it's
also about time do you think of it that

1036
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:09,409
also about time do you think of it that
 

1037
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,759
also about time do you think of it that
way yeah time is infused in everything

1038
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:12,769
way yeah time is infused in everything
 

1039
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,349
way yeah time is infused in everything
it's like you really can't separate it

1040
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:14,359
it's like you really can't separate it
 

1041
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,219
it's like you really can't separate it
out if I ask you what is the what is

1042
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:18,229
out if I ask you what is the what is
 

1043
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:19,779
out if I ask you what is the what is
your you know how's the brain learning a

1044
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:19,789
your you know how's the brain learning a
 

1045
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,519
your you know how's the brain learning a
model of this coffee cup here I have a

1046
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:21,529
model of this coffee cup here I have a
 

1047
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:22,899
model of this coffee cup here I have a
coffee cup and I'm at the coffee cup I

1048
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:22,909
coffee cup and I'm at the coffee cup I
 

1049
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,239
coffee cup and I'm at the coffee cup I
said well time is not an inherent

1050
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:25,249
said well time is not an inherent
 

1051
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,849
said well time is not an inherent
property of this of this of the model I

1052
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:27,859
property of this of this of the model I
 

1053
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:28,989
property of this of this of the model I
have of this cup whether it's a visual

1054
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:28,999
have of this cup whether it's a visual
 

1055
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,049
have of this cup whether it's a visual
model or attack the model I can sense it

1056
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:32,059
model or attack the model I can sense it
 

1057
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,729
model or attack the model I can sense it
through time but if the model self

1058
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:33,739
through time but if the model self
 

1059
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,529
through time but if the model self
doesn't really much time if I asked you

1060
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:35,539
doesn't really much time if I asked you
 

1061
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,479
doesn't really much time if I asked you
if I said well what is the model of my

1062
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:37,489
if I said well what is the model of my
 

1063
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,119
if I said well what is the model of my
cell phone my brain has learned a model

1064
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:40,129
cell phone my brain has learned a model
 

1065
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,339
cell phone my brain has learned a model
of the cell phone so if you have a smart

1066
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:42,349
of the cell phone so if you have a smart
 

1067
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,529
of the cell phone so if you have a smart
phone like this and I said well this has

1068
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:44,539
phone like this and I said well this has
 

1069
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,419
phone like this and I said well this has
time aspects to it I have expectations

1070
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:46,429
time aspects to it I have expectations
 

1071
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,669
time aspects to it I have expectations
when I turn it on what's gonna happen

1072
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:48,679
when I turn it on what's gonna happen
 

1073
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,259
when I turn it on what's gonna happen
what water how long it's going to take

1074
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:50,269
what water how long it's going to take
 

1075
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,450
what water how long it's going to take
to do certain things if I bring up an

1076
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:52,460
to do certain things if I bring up an
 

1077
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,119
to do certain things if I bring up an
app what sequences and so I have instant

1078
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,129
app what sequences and so I have instant
 

1079
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,529
app what sequences and so I have instant
it's all like melodies in the world you

1080
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:56,539
it's all like melodies in the world you
 

1081
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:58,629
it's all like melodies in the world you
know yeah melody has a sense of time so

1082
00:19:58,629 --> 00:19:58,639
know yeah melody has a sense of time so
 

1083
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,969
know yeah melody has a sense of time so
many things in the world move and act

1084
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:00,979
many things in the world move and act
 

1085
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,680
many things in the world move and act
and there's a sense of time related to

1086
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:02,690
and there's a sense of time related to
 

1087
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,190
and there's a sense of time related to
them some don't but most things do

1088
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
them some don't but most things do
 

1089
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,100
them some don't but most things do
really so it's it's sort of infused

1090
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,110
really so it's it's sort of infused
 

1091
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,139
really so it's it's sort of infused
throughout the models of the world you

1092
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:12,149
throughout the models of the world you
 

1093
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,850
throughout the models of the world you
build a model of the world you're

1094
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:13,860
build a model of the world you're
 

1095
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,680
build a model of the world you're
learning the structure of the objects in

1096
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:15,690
learning the structure of the objects in
 

1097
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,509
learning the structure of the objects in
the world and you're also learning how

1098
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:17,519
the world and you're also learning how
 

1099
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,019
the world and you're also learning how
those things change through time okay so

1100
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:21,029
those things change through time okay so
 

1101
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,330
those things change through time okay so
it's it's it really is just a fourth

1102
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,340
it's it's it really is just a fourth
 

1103
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,000
it's it's it really is just a fourth
dimension that's infused deeply and they

1104
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,010
dimension that's infused deeply and they
 

1105
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,500
dimension that's infused deeply and they
have to make sure that your models have

1106
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:27,510
have to make sure that your models have
 

1107
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,289
have to make sure that your models have
been intelligence incorporated so like

1108
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:33,299
been intelligence incorporated so like
 

1109
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,759
been intelligence incorporated so like
you mentioned the state of neuroscience

1110
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:34,769
you mentioned the state of neuroscience
 

1111
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,440
you mentioned the state of neuroscience
is deeply empirical a lot of data

1112
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,450
is deeply empirical a lot of data
 

1113
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,250
is deeply empirical a lot of data
collection it's uh you know that's

1114
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,260
collection it's uh you know that's
 

1115
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,169
collection it's uh you know that's
that's where it is using meshing Thomas

1116
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:42,179
that's where it is using meshing Thomas
 

1117
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,139
that's where it is using meshing Thomas
Kuhn right yeah and then you're

1118
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:45,149
Kuhn right yeah and then you're
 

1119
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,799
Kuhn right yeah and then you're
proposing a theory of intelligence and

1120
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:47,809
proposing a theory of intelligence and
 

1121
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,250
proposing a theory of intelligence and
which is really the next step the really

1122
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,260
which is really the next step the really
 

1123
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,470
which is really the next step the really
important stuff to take but why why is

1124
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
important stuff to take but why why is
 

1125
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,440
important stuff to take but why why is
HTM or what we'll talk about soon

1126
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,450
HTM or what we'll talk about soon
 

1127
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,940
HTM or what we'll talk about soon
the right theory so is it more in this

1128
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:04,950
the right theory so is it more in this
 

1129
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,909
the right theory so is it more in this
it what is it backed by intuition is it

1130
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
it what is it backed by intuition is it
 

1131
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,580
it what is it backed by intuition is it
backed by evidence is it backed by a

1132
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,590
backed by evidence is it backed by a
 

1133
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,159
backed by evidence is it backed by a
mixture of both is it kind of closer to

1134
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:13,169
mixture of both is it kind of closer to
 

1135
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,899
mixture of both is it kind of closer to
or string theories in physics where this

1136
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:16,909
or string theories in physics where this
 

1137
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,279
or string theories in physics where this
mathematical components would show that

1138
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,289
mathematical components would show that
 

1139
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,389
mathematical components would show that
you know what it seems that this it fits

1140
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:23,399
you know what it seems that this it fits
 

1141
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,700
you know what it seems that this it fits
together too well for not to be true

1142
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:25,710
together too well for not to be true
 

1143
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,009
together too well for not to be true
which is what we're string theory is is

1144
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:28,019
which is what we're string theory is is
 

1145
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,649
which is what we're string theory is is
that where your fix of all those things

1146
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:30,659
that where your fix of all those things
 

1147
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,600
that where your fix of all those things
although definitely where we are right

1148
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:32,610
although definitely where we are right
 

1149
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,830
although definitely where we are right
now it's definitely much more on the

1150
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
now it's definitely much more on the
 

1151
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,269
now it's definitely much more on the
empirical side than let's say string

1152
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:35,279
empirical side than let's say string
 

1153
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,360
empirical side than let's say string
theory the way this goes about we're

1154
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,370
theory the way this goes about we're
 

1155
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,279
theory the way this goes about we're
theorists right so we look at all this

1156
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:40,289
theorists right so we look at all this
 

1157
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,539
theorists right so we look at all this
data and we're trying to come up with

1158
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:41,549
data and we're trying to come up with
 

1159
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,580
data and we're trying to come up with
some sort of model that explains it

1160
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:43,590
some sort of model that explains it
 

1161
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,430
some sort of model that explains it
basically and there's yeah unlike string

1162
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,440
basically and there's yeah unlike string
 

1163
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,980
basically and there's yeah unlike string
theory there's this vast more amounts of

1164
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:48,990
theory there's this vast more amounts of
 

1165
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,200
theory there's this vast more amounts of
empirical data here that I think than

1166
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,210
empirical data here that I think than
 

1167
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,610
empirical data here that I think than
most physicists deal with

1168
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:54,620
most physicists deal with
 

1169
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,310
most physicists deal with
and so our challenge is to sort through

1170
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,320
and so our challenge is to sort through
 

1171
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,039
and so our challenge is to sort through
that and figure out what kind of

1172
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,049
that and figure out what kind of
 

1173
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,100
that and figure out what kind of
constructs would explain this and when

1174
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,110
constructs would explain this and when
 

1175
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,529
constructs would explain this and when
we have an idea you come up with a

1176
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:05,539
we have an idea you come up with a
 

1177
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,480
we have an idea you come up with a
theory of some sort you have lots of

1178
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,490
theory of some sort you have lots of
 

1179
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,480
theory of some sort you have lots of
ways of testing it first of all I am you

1180
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,490
ways of testing it first of all I am you
 

1181
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,259
ways of testing it first of all I am you
know there are hundred years of

1182
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:13,269
know there are hundred years of
 

1183
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:15,909
know there are hundred years of
assimilated unassimilated empirical data

1184
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
assimilated unassimilated empirical data
 

1185
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,710
assimilated unassimilated empirical data
from neuroscience so we go back and read

1186
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:17,720
from neuroscience so we go back and read
 

1187
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,749
from neuroscience so we go back and read
papers we said oh did someone find this

1188
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:19,759
papers we said oh did someone find this
 

1189
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,629
papers we said oh did someone find this
already with you we can predict x y&z

1190
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:22,639
already with you we can predict x y&z
 

1191
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,180
already with you we can predict x y&z
and maybe no one's even talked about it

1192
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,190
and maybe no one's even talked about it
 

1193
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,519
and maybe no one's even talked about it
since 1972 or something but we go back

1194
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:27,529
since 1972 or something but we go back
 

1195
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,769
since 1972 or something but we go back
and find out we say Oh either it can

1196
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:29,779
and find out we say Oh either it can
 

1197
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,710
and find out we say Oh either it can
support the theory or it can invalidate

1198
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
support the theory or it can invalidate
 

1199
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,299
support the theory or it can invalidate
the theory and we said okay we have to

1200
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:34,309
the theory and we said okay we have to
 

1201
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,830
the theory and we said okay we have to
start over again oh no it's the poor

1202
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
start over again oh no it's the poor
 

1203
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,649
start over again oh no it's the poor
let's keep going with that one so the

1204
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:38,659
let's keep going with that one so the
 

1205
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:41,200
let's keep going with that one so the
way I kind of view it when we do our

1206
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,210
way I kind of view it when we do our
 

1207
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,529
way I kind of view it when we do our
work we come up we we look at all this

1208
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:44,539
work we come up we we look at all this
 

1209
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,480
work we come up we we look at all this
empirical data and it's it's what I call

1210
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,490
empirical data and it's it's what I call
 

1211
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,950
empirical data and it's it's what I call
is a set of constraints we're not

1212
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:47,960
is a set of constraints we're not
 

1213
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,759
is a set of constraints we're not
interested in something that's

1214
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:48,769
interested in something that's
 

1215
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,320
interested in something that's
biologically inspired we're trying to

1216
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,330
biologically inspired we're trying to
 

1217
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,909
biologically inspired we're trying to
figure out how the actual brain works so

1218
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
figure out how the actual brain works so
 

1219
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,769
figure out how the actual brain works so
every piece of empirical data is a

1220
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:53,779
every piece of empirical data is a
 

1221
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,139
every piece of empirical data is a
constraint on a theory in theory if you

1222
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:56,149
constraint on a theory in theory if you
 

1223
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,580
constraint on a theory in theory if you
have the correct theory it needs to

1224
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:57,590
have the correct theory it needs to
 

1225
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,859
have the correct theory it needs to
explain every pin right so we have this

1226
00:22:59,859 --> 00:22:59,869
explain every pin right so we have this
 

1227
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,320
explain every pin right so we have this
huge number of constraints on the

1228
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,330
huge number of constraints on the
 

1229
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,600
huge number of constraints on the
problem which initially makes it very

1230
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:04,610
problem which initially makes it very
 

1231
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,789
problem which initially makes it very
very difficult if you don't have any

1232
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
very difficult if you don't have any
 

1233
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,139
very difficult if you don't have any
constraints you can make up stuff all

1234
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:08,149
constraints you can make up stuff all
 

1235
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,700
constraints you can make up stuff all
the day you know here's an answer how

1236
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:09,710
the day you know here's an answer how
 

1237
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,810
the day you know here's an answer how
you can do this you can do that you can

1238
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:10,820
you can do this you can do that you can
 

1239
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,789
you can do this you can do that you can
do this but if you consider all biology

1240
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
do this but if you consider all biology
 

1241
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,409
do this but if you consider all biology
as a set of constraints all neuroscience

1242
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:14,419
as a set of constraints all neuroscience
 

1243
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,239
as a set of constraints all neuroscience
instead of constraints and even if

1244
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:16,249
instead of constraints and even if
 

1245
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:17,350
instead of constraints and even if
you're working on one little part of the

1246
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
you're working on one little part of the
 

1247
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,570
you're working on one little part of the
neocortex for example there are hundreds

1248
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:19,580
neocortex for example there are hundreds
 

1249
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,859
neocortex for example there are hundreds
and hundreds of constraints these are

1250
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:20,869
and hundreds of constraints these are
 

1251
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:23,350
and hundreds of constraints these are
empirical constraints that it's very

1252
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
empirical constraints that it's very
 

1253
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,539
empirical constraints that it's very
very difficult initially to come up with

1254
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:25,549
very difficult initially to come up with
 

1255
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,519
very difficult initially to come up with
a radical framework for that but when

1256
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:27,529
a radical framework for that but when
 

1257
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,499
a radical framework for that but when
you do and it solves all those

1258
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:29,509
you do and it solves all those
 

1259
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,019
you do and it solves all those
constraints at once you have a high

1260
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:32,029
constraints at once you have a high
 

1261
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,629
constraints at once you have a high
confidence that you got something close

1262
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:34,639
confidence that you got something close
 

1263
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,419
confidence that you got something close
to correct it's just in mathematically

1264
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:37,429
to correct it's just in mathematically
 

1265
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,629
to correct it's just in mathematically
almost impossible not to be so it that's

1266
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:40,639
almost impossible not to be so it that's
 

1267
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:42,549
almost impossible not to be so it that's
the the curse and the advantage of what

1268
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
the the curse and the advantage of what
 

1269
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,369
the the curse and the advantage of what
we have the curse is we have to solve we

1270
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:45,379
we have the curse is we have to solve we
 

1271
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,710
we have the curse is we have to solve we
have to meet all these constraints which

1272
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:47,720
have to meet all these constraints which
 

1273
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,039
have to meet all these constraints which
is really hard but when you do meet them

1274
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:50,049
is really hard but when you do meet them
 

1275
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,350
is really hard but when you do meet them
then you have a great confidence that

1276
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
then you have a great confidence that
 

1277
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,659
then you have a great confidence that
you discover something in addition then

1278
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:55,669
you discover something in addition then
 

1279
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,419
you discover something in addition then
we work with scientific labs so we'll

1280
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:58,429
we work with scientific labs so we'll
 

1281
00:23:58,429 --> 00:23:59,919
we work with scientific labs so we'll
say oh there's something we can't find

1282
00:23:59,919 --> 00:23:59,929
say oh there's something we can't find
 

1283
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,019
say oh there's something we can't find
we can predict something but we can't

1284
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:02,029
we can predict something but we can't
 

1285
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,539
we can predict something but we can't
find it anywhere in the literature so we

1286
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:04,549
find it anywhere in the literature so we
 

1287
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,609
find it anywhere in the literature so we
will then we have people we collaborated

1288
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:06,619
will then we have people we collaborated
 

1289
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:07,090
will then we have people we collaborated
with

1290
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,100
with
 

1291
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,010
with
say that sometimes they'll say you know

1292
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,020
say that sometimes they'll say you know
 

1293
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,570
say that sometimes they'll say you know
I have some collected data which I

1294
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:10,580
I have some collected data which I
 

1295
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,549
I have some collected data which I
didn't publish but we can go back and

1296
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
didn't publish but we can go back and
 

1297
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,890
didn't publish but we can go back and
look in it and see if we can find that

1298
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:13,900
look in it and see if we can find that
 

1299
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,330
look in it and see if we can find that
which is much easier than designing in

1300
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:16,340
which is much easier than designing in
 

1301
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,529
which is much easier than designing in
your experiment you know new

1302
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:17,539
your experiment you know new
 

1303
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,120
your experiment you know new
neuroscience experiments take a long

1304
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,130
neuroscience experiments take a long
 

1305
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,060
neuroscience experiments take a long
time years so although some people are

1306
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,070
time years so although some people are
 

1307
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,900
time years so although some people are
doing that now too so but between all of

1308
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:25,910
doing that now too so but between all of
 

1309
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,740
doing that now too so but between all of
these things I think it's reasonable

1310
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:28,750
these things I think it's reasonable
 

1311
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,450
these things I think it's reasonable
it's actually a very very good approach

1312
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:31,460
it's actually a very very good approach
 

1313
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,220
it's actually a very very good approach
we we are blessed with the fact that we

1314
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:33,230
we we are blessed with the fact that we
 

1315
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,680
we we are blessed with the fact that we
can test our theories out the ying-yang

1316
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:35,690
can test our theories out the ying-yang
 

1317
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,240
can test our theories out the ying-yang
here because there's so much on a

1318
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,250
here because there's so much on a
 

1319
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,310
here because there's so much on a
similar data and we can also falsify our

1320
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,320
similar data and we can also falsify our
 

1321
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,680
similar data and we can also falsify our
theories very easily which we do often

1322
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:40,690
theories very easily which we do often
 

1323
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,270
theories very easily which we do often
it's kind of reminiscent to whenever

1324
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,280
it's kind of reminiscent to whenever
 

1325
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,480
it's kind of reminiscent to whenever
whenever that was with Copernicus you

1326
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:46,490
whenever that was with Copernicus you
 

1327
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,799
whenever that was with Copernicus you
know when you figure out that the sun's

1328
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:47,809
know when you figure out that the sun's
 

1329
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:51,220
know when you figure out that the sun's
at the center of the the solar system as

1330
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,230
at the center of the the solar system as
 

1331
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,190
at the center of the the solar system as
opposed to earth the pieces just fall

1332
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:54,200
opposed to earth the pieces just fall
 

1333
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
opposed to earth the pieces just fall
into place yeah I think that's the

1334
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:55,850
into place yeah I think that's the
 

1335
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,430
into place yeah I think that's the
general nature of aha moments is in

1336
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,440
general nature of aha moments is in
 

1337
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,230
general nature of aha moments is in
history Copernicus it could be you could

1338
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
history Copernicus it could be you could
 

1339
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,350
history Copernicus it could be you could
say the same thing about Darwin you

1340
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
say the same thing about Darwin you
 

1341
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,810
say the same thing about Darwin you
could say same thing about you know

1342
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:06,820
could say same thing about you know
 

1343
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,200
could say same thing about you know
about the double helix that that people

1344
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,210
about the double helix that that people
 

1345
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,460
about the double helix that that people
have been working on a problem for so

1346
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:12,470
have been working on a problem for so
 

1347
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,750
have been working on a problem for so
long and I have all this data and they

1348
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
long and I have all this data and they
 

1349
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,919
long and I have all this data and they
can't make sense of it they can't make

1350
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:14,929
can't make sense of it they can't make
 

1351
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,140
can't make sense of it they can't make
sense of it but when the answer comes to

1352
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,150
sense of it but when the answer comes to
 

1353
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,450
sense of it but when the answer comes to
you and everything falls into place it's

1354
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:19,460
you and everything falls into place it's
 

1355
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,370
you and everything falls into place it's
like oh my gosh that's it

1356
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:21,380
like oh my gosh that's it
 

1357
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,310
like oh my gosh that's it
that's got to be right I asked both Jim

1358
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
that's got to be right I asked both Jim
 

1359
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,690
that's got to be right I asked both Jim
Watson and Francis Crick about this I

1360
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:28,700
Watson and Francis Crick about this I
 

1361
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,330
Watson and Francis Crick about this I
asked him you know when you were working

1362
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,340
asked him you know when you were working
 

1363
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,580
asked him you know when you were working
on trying to discover the structure of

1364
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,590
on trying to discover the structure of
 

1365
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,399
on trying to discover the structure of
the double helix and when you came up

1366
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:36,409
the double helix and when you came up
 

1367
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,760
the double helix and when you came up
with the the sort of the structure that

1368
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:39,770
with the the sort of the structure that
 

1369
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,029
with the the sort of the structure that
ended up being correct but it was sort

1370
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
ended up being correct but it was sort
 

1371
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,680
ended up being correct but it was sort
of a guess you know I wasn't really

1372
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:44,690
of a guess you know I wasn't really
 

1373
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,200
of a guess you know I wasn't really
verified yeah I said did you know that

1374
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,210
verified yeah I said did you know that
 

1375
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,970
verified yeah I said did you know that
it was right and they both said

1376
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:48,980
it was right and they both said
 

1377
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,370
it was right and they both said
absolutely so we absolutely knew it was

1378
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:51,380
absolutely so we absolutely knew it was
 

1379
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,409
absolutely so we absolutely knew it was
right and it doesn't matter if other

1380
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:53,419
right and it doesn't matter if other
 

1381
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,240
right and it doesn't matter if other
people didn't believe it or not we knew

1382
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,250
people didn't believe it or not we knew
 

1383
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,409
people didn't believe it or not we knew
it was right they get around the thing

1384
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:56,419
it was right they get around the thing
 

1385
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,690
it was right they get around the thing
agree with it eventually anyway

1386
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,700
agree with it eventually anyway
 

1387
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,430
agree with it eventually anyway
and that's the kind of thing you hear a

1388
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:00,440
and that's the kind of thing you hear a
 

1389
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,890
and that's the kind of thing you hear a
lot with scientists who who really are

1390
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:02,900
lot with scientists who who really are
 

1391
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,590
lot with scientists who who really are
studying a difficult problem and I feel

1392
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
studying a difficult problem and I feel
 

1393
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,480
studying a difficult problem and I feel
that way too about our work if you talk

1394
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,490
that way too about our work if you talk
 

1395
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,690
that way too about our work if you talk
to Kirk or Watson about the the problem

1396
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:10,700
to Kirk or Watson about the the problem
 

1397
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,620
to Kirk or Watson about the the problem
you're trying to solve the of finding

1398
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:14,630
you're trying to solve the of finding
 

1399
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,470
you're trying to solve the of finding
the DNA of the brain yeah in fact

1400
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:17,480
the DNA of the brain yeah in fact
 

1401
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,210
the DNA of the brain yeah in fact
Francis Crick was very interested in

1402
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,220
Francis Crick was very interested in
 

1403
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,950
Francis Crick was very interested in
this in the latter part of his

1404
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
this in the latter part of his
 

1405
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,680
this in the latter part of his
and in fact I got interested in brains

1406
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:23,690
and in fact I got interested in brains
 

1407
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,290
and in fact I got interested in brains
by reading an essay he wrote in 1979

1408
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:26,300
by reading an essay he wrote in 1979
 

1409
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,470
by reading an essay he wrote in 1979
called thinking about the brain and that

1410
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,480
called thinking about the brain and that
 

1411
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,840
called thinking about the brain and that
is when I decided I'm gonna leave my

1412
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:31,850
is when I decided I'm gonna leave my
 

1413
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,790
is when I decided I'm gonna leave my
profession of computers and engineering

1414
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:33,800
profession of computers and engineering
 

1415
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,040
profession of computers and engineering
and become a neuroscientist just reading

1416
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,050
and become a neuroscientist just reading
 

1417
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,930
and become a neuroscientist just reading
that one essay from Francis Crick I got

1418
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:37,940
that one essay from Francis Crick I got
 

1419
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,030
that one essay from Francis Crick I got
to meet him later in life

1420
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,040
to meet him later in life
 

1421
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,540
to meet him later in life
I got I spoke at the Salk Institute and

1422
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,550
I got I spoke at the Salk Institute and
 

1423
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,370
I got I spoke at the Salk Institute and
he was in the audience and then I had a

1424
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,380
he was in the audience and then I had a
 

1425
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,270
he was in the audience and then I had a
tea with him afterwards you know he was

1426
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,280
tea with him afterwards you know he was
 

1427
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,380
tea with him afterwards you know he was
interested in a different problem and he

1428
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,390
interested in a different problem and he
 

1429
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,050
interested in a different problem and he
was he was focused on consciousness yeah

1430
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,060
was he was focused on consciousness yeah
 

1431
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,950
was he was focused on consciousness yeah
and the easy problem right well I I

1432
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
and the easy problem right well I I
 

1433
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,350
and the easy problem right well I I
think it's the red herring and and so we

1434
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
think it's the red herring and and so we
 

1435
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,410
think it's the red herring and and so we
weren't really overlapping a lot there

1436
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:01,420
weren't really overlapping a lot there
 

1437
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,610
weren't really overlapping a lot there
Jim Watson who's still alive is is also

1438
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:06,620
Jim Watson who's still alive is is also
 

1439
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,750
Jim Watson who's still alive is is also
interested in this problem and he was

1440
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
interested in this problem and he was
 

1441
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,910
interested in this problem and he was
when he was director of the coast of

1442
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:09,920
when he was director of the coast of
 

1443
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,480
when he was director of the coast of
Harbor laboratories he was really sort

1444
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,490
Harbor laboratories he was really sort
 

1445
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,130
Harbor laboratories he was really sort
of behind moving in the direction of

1446
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,140
of behind moving in the direction of
 

1447
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,230
of behind moving in the direction of
neuroscience there and so he had a

1448
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,240
neuroscience there and so he had a
 

1449
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,440
neuroscience there and so he had a
personal interest in this field and I

1450
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:20,450
personal interest in this field and I
 

1451
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,370
personal interest in this field and I
have met with him numerous times and in

1452
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:24,380
have met with him numerous times and in
 

1453
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,100
have met with him numerous times and in
fact the last time was a little bit over

1454
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,110
fact the last time was a little bit over
 

1455
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,320
fact the last time was a little bit over
a year ago I gave a talk close to me

1456
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,330
a year ago I gave a talk close to me
 

1457
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,270
a year ago I gave a talk close to me
Harbor labs about the progress we were

1458
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,280
Harbor labs about the progress we were
 

1459
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,210
Harbor labs about the progress we were
making in in our work and it was a lot

1460
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,220
making in in our work and it was a lot
 

1461
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,450
making in in our work and it was a lot
of fun because he said well you you

wouldn't be coming here unless you had
 

1465
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,700
wouldn't be coming here unless you had
something important to say so I'm gonna

1466
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:42,710
something important to say so I'm gonna
 

1467
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,400
something important to say so I'm gonna
go change our talk so he sat in the very

1468
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,410
go change our talk so he sat in the very
 

1469
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,740
go change our talk so he sat in the very
front row next to most next to him was

1470
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:47,750
front row next to most next to him was
 

1471
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,230
front row next to most next to him was
the director of the lab was Stillman so

1472
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
the director of the lab was Stillman so
 

1473
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,430
the director of the lab was Stillman so
these guys are in the front row of this

1474
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
these guys are in the front row of this
 

1475
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,260
these guys are in the front row of this
auditorium right so nobody else in the

1476

because Jim Watson is detective and and

1480
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:58,790
because Jim Watson is detective and and
 

1481
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,360

I gave a talk and I had dinner with Jim

1482
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,370
I gave a talk and I had dinner with Jim
 

1483
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,020
I gave a talk and I had dinner with Jim
afterwards but it's I there's a great

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,030
afterwards but it's I there's a great
 

1485

mahad took where I'm up there sort of

1488
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:08,750
mahad took where I'm up there sort of
 

1489
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,240
mahad took where I'm up there sort of
like screaming the basics of this new

1490
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,250
like screaming the basics of this new
 

1491
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,940
like screaming the basics of this new
framework we have and Jim Watson is on

1492
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:12,950
framework we have and Jim Watson is on
 

1493
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,380
framework we have and Jim Watson is on
the edge of his chair he's literally on

1494
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:14,390
the edge of his chair he's literally on
 

1495
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,940
the edge of his chair he's literally on
the edge of his chair like intently

1496
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:15,950
the edge of his chair like intently
 

1497
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,910
the edge of his chair like intently
staring up at the screen and when he

1498
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:18,920
staring up at the screen and when he
 

1499
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,760
staring up at the screen and when he
discovered the structure of DNA the

1500
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:21,770
discovered the structure of DNA the
 

1501
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,190
discovered the structure of DNA the
first public talk he gave was that Cold

1502
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,200
first public talk he gave was that Cold
 

1503
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,380
first public talk he gave was that Cold
Spring Harbor labs so and there's a

1504
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,390
Spring Harbor labs so and there's a
 

1505
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,970
Spring Harbor labs so and there's a
picture those famous picture Jim Watson

1506
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:27,980
picture those famous picture Jim Watson
 

1507
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,530
picture those famous picture Jim Watson
standing at the whiteboard was where the

1508
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:29,540
standing at the whiteboard was where the
 

1509
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,180
standing at the whiteboard was where the
overrated thing pointing at something

1510
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,190
overrated thing pointing at something
 

1511
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,470
overrated thing pointing at something
was holding a double helix at this point

1512
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,480
was holding a double helix at this point
 

1513
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,730
was holding a double helix at this point
it actually looks a lot like the picture

1514
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:34,740
it actually looks a lot like the picture
 

1515
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,919
it actually looks a lot like the picture
of me so there was funny I got talking

1516
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:36,929
of me so there was funny I got talking
 

1517
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:38,210
of me so there was funny I got talking
about the brain and there's Jim Watson

1518
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,220
about the brain and there's Jim Watson
 

1519
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,680
about the brain and there's Jim Watson
staring intently I didn't course there

1520
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:39,690
staring intently I didn't course there
 

1521
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,299
staring intently I didn't course there
was you know whatever sixty years

1522
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:41,309
was you know whatever sixty years
 

1523
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:42,710
was you know whatever sixty years
earlier he was standing you know

1524
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
earlier he was standing you know
 

1525
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,390
earlier he was standing you know
pointing at the double helix and it's

1526
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:44,400
pointing at the double helix and it's
 

1527
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,159
pointing at the double helix and it's
one of the great discoveries and and all

1528
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:46,169
one of the great discoveries and and all
 

1529
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,590
one of the great discoveries and and all
of you know whatever by all the science

1530
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:48,600
of you know whatever by all the science
 

1531
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,010
of you know whatever by all the science
all science yeah yeah hey so this is the

1532
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,020
all science yeah yeah hey so this is the
 

1533
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,390
all science yeah yeah hey so this is the
funny that there's echoes of that in

1534
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,400
funny that there's echoes of that in
 

1535
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,159
funny that there's echoes of that in
your presentation do you think in terms

1536
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:55,169
your presentation do you think in terms
 

1537
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,430
your presentation do you think in terms
of evolutionary timeline in history the

1538
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:58,440
of evolutionary timeline in history the
 

1539
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,740
of evolutionary timeline in history the
development of the neocortex was a big

1540
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:00,750
development of the neocortex was a big
 

1541
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:07,430
development of the neocortex was a big
leap or is it just a small step so like

1542
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
leap or is it just a small step so like
 

1543
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,950
leap or is it just a small step so like
if we ran the whole thing over again

1544
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
if we ran the whole thing over again
 

1545
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,020
if we ran the whole thing over again
from the from the birth of life on Earth

1546
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,030
from the from the birth of life on Earth
 

1547
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,020
from the from the birth of life on Earth
how likely develop the mechanism and you

1548
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,030
how likely develop the mechanism and you
 

1549
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,280
how likely develop the mechanism and you
okay well those are two separate

1550
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,290
okay well those are two separate
 

1551
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,740
okay well those are two separate
questions one it was it a big leap and

1552
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:18,750
questions one it was it a big leap and
 

1553
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,650
questions one it was it a big leap and
one was how like it is okay they're not

1554
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:21,660
one was how like it is okay they're not
 

1555
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,190
one was how like it is okay they're not
necessarily related maybe correlated we

1556
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
necessarily related maybe correlated we
 

1557
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,270
necessarily related maybe correlated we
don't really have enough data to make a

1558
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:26,280
don't really have enough data to make a
 

1559
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,460
don't really have enough data to make a
judgment about that I would say

1560
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:28,470
judgment about that I would say
 

1561
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,020
judgment about that I would say
definitely was a big league and leap and

1562
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,030
definitely was a big league and leap and
 

1563
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,820
definitely was a big league and leap and
I can tell you why I think I don't think

1564
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:31,830
I can tell you why I think I don't think
 

1565
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,370
I can tell you why I think I don't think
it was just another incremental step at

1566
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,380
it was just another incremental step at
 

1567
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,039
it was just another incremental step at
that moment I don't really have any idea

1568
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,049
that moment I don't really have any idea
 

1569
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:39,320
that moment I don't really have any idea
how likely it is if we look at evolution

1570
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,330
how likely it is if we look at evolution
 

1571
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,380
how likely it is if we look at evolution
we have one data point which is earth

1572
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,390
we have one data point which is earth
 

1573
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,240
we have one data point which is earth
right life formed on earth billions of

1574
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,250
right life formed on earth billions of
 

1575
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,610
right life formed on earth billions of
years ago whether it was introduced here

1576
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:46,620
years ago whether it was introduced here
 

1577
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,380
years ago whether it was introduced here
or it created it here or someone

1578
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,390
or it created it here or someone
 

1579
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,640
or it created it here or someone
introduced it we don't really know but

1580
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,650
introduced it we don't really know but
 

1581
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,890
introduced it we don't really know but
it was here early it took a long long

1582
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:51,900
it was here early it took a long long
 

1583
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,460
it was here early it took a long long
time to get to multicellular life and

1584
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,470
time to get to multicellular life and
 

1585
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,820
time to get to multicellular life and
then from multi to other started life it

1586
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:58,830
then from multi to other started life it
 

1587
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,280
then from multi to other started life it
took a long long time to get his

1588
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,290
took a long long time to get his
 

1589
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,049
took a long long time to get his
neocortex and we've only had the New

1590
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:03,059
neocortex and we've only had the New
 

1591
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,549
neocortex and we've only had the New
York Texas for a few hundred thousand

1592
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
York Texas for a few hundred thousand
 

1593
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,840
York Texas for a few hundred thousand
years so that's like nothing okay so is

1594
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:08,850
years so that's like nothing okay so is
 

1595
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,580
years so that's like nothing okay so is
it likely well certainly isn't something

1596
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:10,590
it likely well certainly isn't something
 

1597
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,250
it likely well certainly isn't something
that happened right away on earth and

1598
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260
that happened right away on earth and
 

1599
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,020
that happened right away on earth and
there were multiple steps to get there

1600
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,030
there were multiple steps to get there
 

1601
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,850
there were multiple steps to get there
so I would say it's probably not get

1602
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:16,860
so I would say it's probably not get
 

1603
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,350
so I would say it's probably not get
something what happened instantaneous on

1604
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:18,360
something what happened instantaneous on
 

1605
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,659
something what happened instantaneous on
other planets that might have life it

1606
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:20,669
other planets that might have life it
 

1607
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,039
other planets that might have life it
might take several billion years on

1608
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,049
might take several billion years on
 

1609
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,950
might take several billion years on
average um is it likely I don't know but

1610
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
average um is it likely I don't know but
 

1611
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
average um is it likely I don't know but
you'd have to survive for several

1612
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,010
you'd have to survive for several
 

1613
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,570
you'd have to survive for several
billion years to find out probably is it

1614
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:29,580
billion years to find out probably is it
 

1615
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,030
billion years to find out probably is it
a big leap yeah I think it's it is a

1616
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,040
a big leap yeah I think it's it is a
 

1617
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,990
a big leap yeah I think it's it is a
qualitative difference than all other

1618
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
qualitative difference than all other
 

1619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,840
qualitative difference than all other
evolutionary steps I can try to describe

1620
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:38,850
evolutionary steps I can try to describe
 

1621
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,060
evolutionary steps I can try to describe
that if you'd like sure you know which

1622
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,070
that if you'd like sure you know which
 

1623
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,000
that if you'd like sure you know which
way uh yeah I can tell you how pretty

1624
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,010
way uh yeah I can tell you how pretty
 

1625
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,180
way uh yeah I can tell you how pretty
much I'll start a little press

1626
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,190
much I'll start a little press
 

1627
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,250
much I'll start a little press
many of the things that humans are able

1628
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,260
many of the things that humans are able
 

1629
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,950
many of the things that humans are able
to do do not have obvious survival

1630
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
to do do not have obvious survival
 

1631
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,090
to do do not have obvious survival
advantages precedent yeah you know we

1632
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,100
advantages precedent yeah you know we
 

1633
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,740
advantages precedent yeah you know we
create music is that is there a really

1634
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:00,750
create music is that is there a really
 

1635
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,170
create music is that is there a really
survival advantage to that maybe maybe

1636
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:03,180
survival advantage to that maybe maybe
 

1637
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,710
survival advantage to that maybe maybe
not

1638
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:03,720
not
 

1639
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,360
not
what about mathematics is there a real

1640
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,370
what about mathematics is there a real
 

1641
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,870
what about mathematics is there a real
survival advantage to mathematics it's

1642
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
survival advantage to mathematics it's
 

1643
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,040
survival advantage to mathematics it's
stretchy you can try to figure these

1644
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,050
stretchy you can try to figure these
 

1645
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,640
stretchy you can try to figure these
things out right but up but mostly

1646
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:13,650
things out right but up but mostly
 

1647
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,470
things out right but up but mostly
evolutionary history everything had

1648
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:15,480
evolutionary history everything had
 

1649
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,900
evolutionary history everything had
immediate survival advantages too right

1650
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:17,910
immediate survival advantages too right
 

1651
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,100
immediate survival advantages too right
so I'll tell you a story which I like me

1652
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,110
so I'll tell you a story which I like me
 

1653
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,850
so I'll tell you a story which I like me
may not be true but the story goes as

1654
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:25,860
may not be true but the story goes as
 

1655
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,260
may not be true but the story goes as
follows organisms have been evolving

1656
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,270
follows organisms have been evolving
 

1657
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,970
follows organisms have been evolving
first since the beginning of life here

1658
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:31,980
first since the beginning of life here
 

1659
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,610
first since the beginning of life here
on earth anything this sort of

1660
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:34,620
on earth anything this sort of
 

1661
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,050
on earth anything this sort of

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,060
complexity on to that just sort of
 

1663
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,350
complexity on to that just sort of
complexity and the brain itself is

1664
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,360
complexity and the brain itself is
 

1665
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,060
complexity and the brain itself is
evolved this way in fact there's an old

1666
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,070
evolved this way in fact there's an old
 

1667
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,860

1669
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,210
parts and older parts and older older
parts of the brain that kind of just

1670
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,220
parts of the brain that kind of just
 

1671
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,740
parts of the brain that kind of just
keeps calling on new things and we keep

1672
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:45,750
keeps calling on new things and we keep
 

1673
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,780
keeps calling on new things and we keep
adding capabilities and we got for the

1674
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:47,790
adding capabilities and we got for the
 

1675
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,290
adding capabilities and we got for the
neocortex initially it had a very clear

1676
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:51,300
neocortex initially it had a very clear
 

1677
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,660
neocortex initially it had a very clear
survival advantage and that it produced

1678
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:53,670
survival advantage and that it produced
 

1679
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,160
survival advantage and that it produced
better vision and better hearing and

1680
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,170
better vision and better hearing and
 

1681
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,960
better vision and better hearing and
better thoughts and maybe a new place so

1682
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:56,970
better thoughts and maybe a new place so
 

1683
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,140
better thoughts and maybe a new place so
on but what what I think happens is that

1684
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,150
on but what what I think happens is that
 

1685
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,820
on but what what I think happens is that
evolution just kept it took it took a

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:01,830
evolution just kept it took it took a
 

1687
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,730
evolution just kept it took it took a
mechanism and this is in our recent

1688
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:04,740
mechanism and this is in our recent
 

1689
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,410
mechanism and this is in our recent
theories but it took a mechanism evolved

1690
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:06,420
theories but it took a mechanism evolved
 

1691
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,260
theories but it took a mechanism evolved
a long time ago for navigating in the

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,270
a long time ago for navigating in the

1695
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,190

the so called grid cells and place cells

1696
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
the so called grid cells and place cells
 

1697
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,850
the so called grid cells and place cells
of an old part of the brain and it took

1698
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:16,860
of an old part of the brain and it took
 

1699
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,640
of an old part of the brain and it took
that mechanism for building maps of the

1700
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:19,650
that mechanism for building maps of the
 

1701
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,400
that mechanism for building maps of the
world and knowing we are in those maps

1702
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,410
world and knowing we are in those maps
 

1703
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,560
world and knowing we are in those maps
and how to navigate those maps and turns

1704
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,570
and how to navigate those maps and turns
 

1705
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,590
and how to navigate those maps and turns
it into a sort of a slimmed-down

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:26,600
it into a sort of a slimmed-down
 

1707
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,900
it into a sort of a slimmed-down
idealized version of it mm-hmm and that

00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,200
ideally this version could now apply to
building maps of other things maps of

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,230
coffee cups and maps the phone's maps of
 

1715
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,900
coffee cups and maps the phone's maps of
these concepts yes and not just almost

1716
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:38,910
these concepts yes and not just almost
 

1717
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,650
these concepts yes and not just almost
exactly and and so you and it just

1718
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:42,660
exactly and and so you and it just
 

1719
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,210
exactly and and so you and it just
started replicating this stuff right you

1720
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,220
started replicating this stuff right you
 

1721
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,620
started replicating this stuff right you
just think more and more more bits so we

1722
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:45,630
just think more and more more bits so we
 

1723
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,990
just think more and more more bits so we
went from being sort of dedicated

1724
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
went from being sort of dedicated
 

1725
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,690
went from being sort of dedicated
purpose neural hardware to solve certain

1726
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:50,700
purpose neural hardware to solve certain
 

1727
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,760
purpose neural hardware to solve certain
problems that are important to survival

1728
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:52,770
problems that are important to survival
 

1729
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,730
problems that are important to survival
to a general purpose neural hardware

1730
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:55,740
to a general purpose neural hardware
 

1731
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,080
to a general purpose neural hardware
that could be applied to all problems

1732
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,090
that could be applied to all problems
 

1733
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,080
that could be applied to all problems
and now it's just it's

1734
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,090
and now it's just it's
 

1735
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,990
and now it's just it's
the orbit of survival it's we are now

1736
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,000
the orbit of survival it's we are now
 

1737
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,659
the orbit of survival it's we are now
able to apply it to things which we find

1738
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:05,669
able to apply it to things which we find
 

1739
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,440
able to apply it to things which we find
enjoyment you know but aren't really

1740
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,450
enjoyment you know but aren't really
 

1741
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,640
enjoyment you know but aren't really
clearly survival characteristics and

1742
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:13,650
clearly survival characteristics and
 

1743
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,860
clearly survival characteristics and
that it seems to only have happened in

1744
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:15,870
that it seems to only have happened in
 

1745
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,269
that it seems to only have happened in
humans to the large extent and so that's

1746
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:20,279
humans to the large extent and so that's
 

1747
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,090
humans to the large extent and so that's
what's going on where we sort of have

1748
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,100
what's going on where we sort of have
 

1749
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,640
what's going on where we sort of have
we've sort of escape the gravity of

1750
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:24,650
we've sort of escape the gravity of
 

1751
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,140
we've sort of escape the gravity of
evolutionary pressure in some sense in

1752
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,150
evolutionary pressure in some sense in
 

1753
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,140
evolutionary pressure in some sense in
the neocortex and it now does things

1754
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,150
the neocortex and it now does things
 

1755
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,090
the neocortex and it now does things
which but not that are really

1756
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,100
which but not that are really
 

1757
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,710
which but not that are really
interesting discovery models of the

1758
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,720
interesting discovery models of the
 

1759
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,080
interesting discovery models of the
universe which may not really help us

1760
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,090
universe which may not really help us
 

1761
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,700
universe which may not really help us
doesn't matter how is it help of

1762
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:37,710
doesn't matter how is it help of
 

1763
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,289
doesn't matter how is it help of
surviving knowing that there might be

1764
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:39,299
surviving knowing that there might be
 

1765
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,960
surviving knowing that there might be
multiple no there might be you know the

1766
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:41,970
multiple no there might be you know the
 

1767
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,060
multiple no there might be you know the
age of the universe or what how do you

1768
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,070
age of the universe or what how do you
 

1769
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,130
age of the universe or what how do you
know various stellar things occur it

1770
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,140
know various stellar things occur it
 

1771
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,210
know various stellar things occur it
doesn't really help us survive at all

1772
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:47,220
doesn't really help us survive at all
 

1773
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,090
doesn't really help us survive at all
but we enjoy it and that's what happened

1774
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,100
but we enjoy it and that's what happened
 

1775
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,860
but we enjoy it and that's what happened
or at least not in the obvious way

1776
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:51,870
or at least not in the obvious way
 

1777
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,870
or at least not in the obvious way
perhaps it is required if you look at

1778
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880
perhaps it is required if you look at
 

1779
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,070
perhaps it is required if you look at
the entire universe in an evolutionary

1780
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
the entire universe in an evolutionary
 

1781
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,480
the entire universe in an evolutionary
way it's required for us to do

1782
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,490
way it's required for us to do
 

1783
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,100
way it's required for us to do
interplanetary travel and therefore

1784
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,110
interplanetary travel and therefore
 

1785
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,409
interplanetary travel and therefore
survive past our own Sun but you know

1786
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:03,419
survive past our own Sun but you know
 

1787
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,930
survive past our own Sun but you know
let's not get too but you know evolution

1788
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:05,940
let's not get too but you know evolution
 

1789
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,359
let's not get too but you know evolution
works at one time frame it's it's

1790
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:08,369
works at one time frame it's it's
 

1791
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,129
works at one time frame it's it's
survival if you think of a survival of

1792
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:10,139
survival if you think of a survival of
 

1793
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,409
survival if you think of a survival of
the phenotype survival of the individual

1794
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:12,419
the phenotype survival of the individual
 

1795
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,480
the phenotype survival of the individual
it is that what you're talking about

1796
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,490
it is that what you're talking about
 

1797
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,520
it is that what you're talking about
there is spans well beyond that so

1798
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,530
there is spans well beyond that so
 

1799
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,280
there is spans well beyond that so
there's no genetic I'm not transferring

1800
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,290
there's no genetic I'm not transferring
 

1801
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,119
there's no genetic I'm not transferring
any genetic traits to my children that

1802
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,129
any genetic traits to my children that
 

1803
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,220
any genetic traits to my children that
are gonna help them survive better on

1804
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,230
are gonna help them survive better on
 

1805
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,869
are gonna help them survive better on
Mars right it's totally different

1806
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879
Mars right it's totally different
 

1807
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
Mars right it's totally different
mechanism let's yeah so let's get into

1808
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:28,889
mechanism let's yeah so let's get into
 

1809
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,000
mechanism let's yeah so let's get into
the the new as you've mentioned the idea

1810
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,010
the the new as you've mentioned the idea
 

1811
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,159
the the new as you've mentioned the idea
that I don't know if you have a nice

1812
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,169
that I don't know if you have a nice
 

1813
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,349
that I don't know if you have a nice
name thousand you call it a thousand

1814
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:36,359
name thousand you call it a thousand
 

1815
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,540
name thousand you call it a thousand
brain theory often told I like it so can

1816
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:38,550
brain theory often told I like it so can
 

1817
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,889
brain theory often told I like it so can
you talk about the this idea of spatial

1818
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:42,899
you talk about the this idea of spatial
 

1819
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,260
you talk about the this idea of spatial
view of concepts and so on yeah so can I

1820
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,270
view of concepts and so on yeah so can I
 

1821
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,730
view of concepts and so on yeah so can I
just describe sort of the there's an

1822
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:46,740
just describe sort of the there's an
 

1823
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,730
just describe sort of the there's an
underlying core discovery which then

1824
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:49,740
underlying core discovery which then
 

1825
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,589
underlying core discovery which then
everything comes from that that's a very

1826
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599
everything comes from that that's a very
 

1827
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,000
everything comes from that that's a very
simple this is really what happened we

1828
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,010
simple this is really what happened we
 

1829
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,859
simple this is really what happened we
were deep into problems about

1830
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:57,869
were deep into problems about
 

1831
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,660
were deep into problems about
understanding how we build models of

1832
00:34:59,660 --> 00:34:59,670
understanding how we build models of
 

1833
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,070
understanding how we build models of
stuff in the world and how we make

1834
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,080
stuff in the world and how we make
 

1835
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,770
stuff in the world and how we make
predictions about things and I was

1836
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:03,780
predictions about things and I was
 

1837
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,870
predictions about things and I was
holding a coffee cup just like this in

1838
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:05,880
holding a coffee cup just like this in
 

1839
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,780
holding a coffee cup just like this in
my hand and I had my finger was touching

1840
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:08,790
my hand and I had my finger was touching
 

1841
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,450
my hand and I had my finger was touching
the side my index finger and I moved it

1842
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:11,460
the side my index finger and I moved it
 

1843
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,890
the side my index finger and I moved it
to the top and I was going to feel the

1844
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:13,900
to the top and I was going to feel the
 

1845
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,599
to the top and I was going to feel the
the rim at the top of the cover and I

1846
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:15,609
the rim at the top of the cover and I
 

1847
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:17,730
the rim at the top of the cover and I
asked myself a very simple question I

1848
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:17,740
asked myself a very simple question I
 

1849
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,099
asked myself a very simple question I
said well first of all I have to say I

1850
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:20,109
said well first of all I have to say I
 

1851
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:21,660
said well first of all I have to say I
know that my brain predicts what its

1852
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:21,670
know that my brain predicts what its
 

1853
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,640
know that my brain predicts what its
gonna feel before it touches it you can

1854
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:23,650
gonna feel before it touches it you can
 

1855
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,069
gonna feel before it touches it you can
just think about it and imagine it and

1856
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
just think about it and imagine it and
 

1857
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,180
just think about it and imagine it and
so we know that the brain is making

1858
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,190
so we know that the brain is making
 

1859
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,920
so we know that the brain is making
predictions all the time so the question

1860
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:28,930
predictions all the time so the question
 

1861
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,539
predictions all the time so the question
is what does it take to predict that

1862
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:30,549
is what does it take to predict that
 

1863
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:32,309
is what does it take to predict that
right and there's a very interesting

1864
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:32,319
right and there's a very interesting
 

1865
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,620
right and there's a very interesting
answer that first of all it says the

1866
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:34,630
answer that first of all it says the
 

1867
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,120
answer that first of all it says the
brain has to know it's touching a coffee

1868
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,130
brain has to know it's touching a coffee
 

1869
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,739
brain has to know it's touching a coffee
cup and I said a model or a coffee cup

1870
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:37,749
cup and I said a model or a coffee cup
 

1871
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,630
cup and I said a model or a coffee cup
and needs to know where the finger

1872
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:39,640
and needs to know where the finger
 

1873
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,480
and needs to know where the finger
currently is on the cup relative to the

1874
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:42,490
currently is on the cup relative to the
 

1875
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,519
currently is on the cup relative to the
cup because when I make a movement and

1876
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:44,529
cup because when I make a movement and
 

1877
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:45,870
cup because when I make a movement and
used to know where it's going to be on

1878
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:45,880
used to know where it's going to be on
 

1879
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,839
used to know where it's going to be on
the cup after the movement is completed

1880
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:47,849
the cup after the movement is completed
 

1881
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,299
the cup after the movement is completed
relative to the cup and then it can make

1882
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:51,309
relative to the cup and then it can make
 

1883
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:52,980
relative to the cup and then it can make
a prediction about what's going to sense

1884
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:52,990
a prediction about what's going to sense
 

1885
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,900
a prediction about what's going to sense
so this told me that Dean your cortex

1886
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:54,910
so this told me that Dean your cortex
 

1887
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,700
so this told me that Dean your cortex
which is making this prediction needs to

1888
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:56,710
which is making this prediction needs to
 

1889
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,009
which is making this prediction needs to
know that it's sensing it's touching a

1890
00:35:59,009 --> 00:35:59,019
know that it's sensing it's touching a
 

1891
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:01,019
know that it's sensing it's touching a
cup and it needs to know the location of

1892
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:01,029
cup and it needs to know the location of
 

1893
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:02,489
cup and it needs to know the location of
my finger relative to that cup in a

1894
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:02,499
my finger relative to that cup in a
 

1895
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,710
my finger relative to that cup in a
reference frame of the cup it doesn't

1896
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
reference frame of the cup it doesn't
 

1897
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,150
reference frame of the cup it doesn't
matter where the cup is relative my body

1898
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
matter where the cup is relative my body
 

1899
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,460
matter where the cup is relative my body
it doesn't matter its orientation none

1900
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,470
it doesn't matter its orientation none
 

1901
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,870
it doesn't matter its orientation none
of that matters it's where my finger is

1902
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:09,880
of that matters it's where my finger is
 

1903
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,640
of that matters it's where my finger is
relative to the cup which tells me then

1904
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:11,650
relative to the cup which tells me then
 

1905
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,489
relative to the cup which tells me then
that the neocortex is has a reference

1906
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:14,499
that the neocortex is has a reference
 

1907
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:17,460
that the neocortex is has a reference
frame that's anchored to the cup because

1908
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,470
frame that's anchored to the cup because
 

1909
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,720
frame that's anchored to the cup because
otherwise I wouldn't be able to say the

1910
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:18,730
otherwise I wouldn't be able to say the
 

1911
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,829
otherwise I wouldn't be able to say the
location and I wouldn't be able to

1912
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:19,839
location and I wouldn't be able to
 

1913
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,870
location and I wouldn't be able to
predict my new location and then we

1914
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:21,880
predict my new location and then we
 

1915
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,789
predict my new location and then we
quickly vary installation instantly you

1916
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:23,799
quickly vary installation instantly you
 

1917
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,559
quickly vary installation instantly you
can say well every part of my skin could

1918
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:25,569
can say well every part of my skin could
 

1919
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,029
can say well every part of my skin could
touch this cup and therefore every part

1920
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:27,039
touch this cup and therefore every part
 

1921
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,200
touch this cup and therefore every part
of my skin is making predictions and

1922
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,210
of my skin is making predictions and
 

1923
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,430
of my skin is making predictions and
every part my skin must have a reference

1924
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,440
every part my skin must have a reference
 

1925
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,489
every part my skin must have a reference
frame that it's using to make

1926
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:32,499
frame that it's using to make
 

1927
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:36,269
frame that it's using to make
predictions so the the big idea is that

1928
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:36,279
predictions so the the big idea is that
 

1929
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,690
predictions so the the big idea is that
throughout the neocortex

1930
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:38,700
throughout the neocortex
 

1931
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,549
throughout the neocortex
there are everything as being is being

1932
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:43,559
there are everything as being is being
 

1933
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,440
there are everything as being is being
stored and referenced in reference

1934
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,450
stored and referenced in reference
 

1935
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,849
stored and referenced in reference
frames you can think of them like XYZ

1936
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:47,859
frames you can think of them like XYZ
 

1937
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:49,349
frames you can think of them like XYZ
reference things but they're not like

1938
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
reference things but they're not like
 

1939
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,239
reference things but they're not like
that we know a lot about the neural

1940
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:51,249
that we know a lot about the neural
 

1941
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:53,640
that we know a lot about the neural
mechanisms for this but the brain thinks

1942
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:53,650
mechanisms for this but the brain thinks
 

1943
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,979
mechanisms for this but the brain thinks
in reference frames and it's an engineer

1944
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:55,989
in reference frames and it's an engineer
 

1945
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,180
in reference frames and it's an engineer
if you're an engineer this is not

1946
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,190
if you're an engineer this is not
 

1947
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,529
if you're an engineer this is not
surprising you'd say if I wanted to

1948
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:58,539
surprising you'd say if I wanted to
 

1949
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:01,019
surprising you'd say if I wanted to
build a a CAD model of the coffee cup

1950
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:01,029
build a a CAD model of the coffee cup
 

1951
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:02,579
build a a CAD model of the coffee cup
well I would bring it up in some CAD

1952
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:02,589
well I would bring it up in some CAD
 

1953
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,200
well I would bring it up in some CAD
software and I would assign some

1954
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,210
software and I would assign some
 

1955
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,519
software and I would assign some
reference frame and say this features at

1956
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:05,529
reference frame and say this features at
 

1957
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:07,440
reference frame and say this features at
this locations and so on but the fact

1958
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,450
this locations and so on but the fact
 

1959
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,210
this locations and so on but the fact
that this the idea that this is

1960
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,220
that this the idea that this is
 

1961
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,650
that this the idea that this is
occurring through out in your cortex

1962
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:10,660
occurring through out in your cortex
 

1963
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,900
occurring through out in your cortex
everywhere it was a novel idea and and

1964
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:15,910
everywhere it was a novel idea and and
 

1965
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,239
everywhere it was a novel idea and and
then zillion things fell into place

1966
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:18,249
then zillion things fell into place
 

1967
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,789
then zillion things fell into place
after that it's doing so now we think

1968
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:20,799
after that it's doing so now we think
 

1969
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,440
after that it's doing so now we think
about the neocortex as processing

1970
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,450
about the neocortex as processing
 

1971
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,579
about the neocortex as processing
information quite differently than we

1972
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:23,589
information quite differently than we
 

1973
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,930
information quite differently than we
used to do it we used to think about the

1974
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:24,940
used to do it we used to think about the
 

1975
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,690
used to do it we used to think about the
neural cortex is processing sensory data

1976
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:27,700
neural cortex is processing sensory data
 

1977
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,890
neural cortex is processing sensory data
and extracting features from that

1978
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:28,900
and extracting features from that
 

1979
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,510
and extracting features from that
sensory data and then extracting

1980
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:30,520
sensory data and then extracting
 

1981
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,160
sensory data and then extracting
features from the features very much

1982
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,170
features from the features very much
 

1983
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,069
features from the features very much
like a deep Learning Network does today

1984
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
like a deep Learning Network does today
 

1985
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
like a deep Learning Network does today
but that's not how the brain works at

1986
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,010
but that's not how the brain works at
 

1987
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,549
but that's not how the brain works at
all the brain works by assigning

00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:38,559
all the brain works by assigning
 

1989

everything every input everything to
reference frames and there are thousands

1992
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:43,299
reference frames and there are thousands
 

1993
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:44,970

hundreds and thousands of them active at
 

1995
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,510
hundreds and thousands of them active at
once in your neocortex it's a surprising

1996
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:48,520
once in your neocortex it's a surprising
 

1997
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,220
once in your neocortex it's a surprising
thing the thing about but once you sort

1998
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,230
thing the thing about but once you sort
 

1999
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,289
thing the thing about but once you sort
of internalize this you understand that

2000
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:52,299
of internalize this you understand that
 

2001
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:54,630
of internalize this you understand that
it explains almost every all the almost

2002
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
it explains almost every all the almost
 

2003
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,099
it explains almost every all the almost
all the mysteries we've had about this

2004
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:56,109
all the mysteries we've had about this
 

2005
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,039
all the mysteries we've had about this
it's about this structure so one of the

2006
00:37:59,039 --> 00:37:59,049
it's about this structure so one of the
 

2007
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:01,380
it's about this structure so one of the
consequences of that is that every small

2008
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:01,390
consequences of that is that every small
 

2009
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,849
consequences of that is that every small
part of the neocortex so you have a

2010
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:02,859
part of the neocortex so you have a
 

2011
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,890
part of the neocortex so you have a
millimeter square and there's a hundred

2012
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:04,900
millimeter square and there's a hundred
 

2013
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,510
millimeter square and there's a hundred
and fifty thousand of those so it's

2014
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:06,520
and fifty thousand of those so it's
 

2015
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,760
and fifty thousand of those so it's
about 150,000 square millimeters if you

2016
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:08,770
about 150,000 square millimeters if you
 

2017
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,200
about 150,000 square millimeters if you
take every little square millimeter of

2018
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,210
take every little square millimeter of
 

2019
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,299
take every little square millimeter of
the cortex it's got some input coming

2020
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:12,309
the cortex it's got some input coming
 

2021
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,430
the cortex it's got some input coming
into it and it's going to have reference

2022
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,440
into it and it's going to have reference
 

2023
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,470
into it and it's going to have reference
frames which assign that input to and

2024
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
frames which assign that input to and
 

2025
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
frames which assign that input to and
each square millimeter can learn

2026
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,210
each square millimeter can learn
 

2027
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,569
each square millimeter can learn
complete models of objects so what do I

2028
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:21,579
complete models of objects so what do I
 

2029
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:22,740
complete models of objects so what do I
mean by that if I'm touching the coffee

2030
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:22,750
mean by that if I'm touching the coffee
 

2031
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,690
mean by that if I'm touching the coffee
cup well if I just touch it in one place

2032
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:24,700
cup well if I just touch it in one place
 

2033
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,030
cup well if I just touch it in one place
I can't learn what this coffee cup is

2034
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
I can't learn what this coffee cup is
 

2035
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,160
I can't learn what this coffee cup is
because I'm just feeling one part but if

2036
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,170
because I'm just feeling one part but if
 

2037
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,380
because I'm just feeling one part but if
I move it around the cup it touched you

2038
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,390
I move it around the cup it touched you
 

2039
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,120
I move it around the cup it touched you
to different areas I can build up a

2040
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,130
to different areas I can build up a
 

2041
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,589
to different areas I can build up a
complete model the cup because I'm now

2042
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:34,599
complete model the cup because I'm now
 

2043
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,390
complete model the cup because I'm now
filling in that three dimensional map

2044
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,400
filling in that three dimensional map
 

2045
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,799
filling in that three dimensional map
which is the coffee cup I can say oh

2046
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:37,809
which is the coffee cup I can say oh
 

2047
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,000
which is the coffee cup I can say oh
what am I feeling in all these different

2048
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,010
what am I feeling in all these different
 

2049
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,859
what am I feeling in all these different
locations that's the basic idea it's

2050
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:40,869
locations that's the basic idea it's
 

2051
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,829
locations that's the basic idea it's
more complicated than that but so

2052
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:43,839
more complicated than that but so
 

2053
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,420
more complicated than that but so
through time and we talked about time

2054
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:45,430
through time and we talked about time
 

2055
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,609
through time and we talked about time
earlier through time even a single

2056
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:47,619
earlier through time even a single
 

2057
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,140
earlier through time even a single
column which is only looking at or a

2058
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,150
column which is only looking at or a
 

2059
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,520
column which is only looking at or a
single part of the cortex it's only

2060
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,530
single part of the cortex it's only
 

2061
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,859
single part of the cortex it's only
looking at a small part of the world can

2062
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:52,869
looking at a small part of the world can
 

2063
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,480
looking at a small part of the world can
build up a complete model of an object

2064
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,490
build up a complete model of an object
 

2065
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,609
build up a complete model of an object
and so if you think about the part of

2066
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:56,619
and so if you think about the part of
 

2067
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:57,870
and so if you think about the part of
the brain which is getting input from

2068
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:57,880
the brain which is getting input from
 

2069
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,740
the brain which is getting input from
all my fingers

2070
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:58,750
all my fingers
 

2071
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,660
all my fingers
so there's they're spread across the top

2072
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:00,670
so there's they're spread across the top
 

2073
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,309
so there's they're spread across the top
and here this is the somatosensory

2074
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:02,319
and here this is the somatosensory
 

2075
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,370
and here this is the somatosensory
cortex there's columns associated all

2076
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:05,380
cortex there's columns associated all
 

2077
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,599
cortex there's columns associated all
these from areas of my skin

2078
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:06,609
these from areas of my skin
 

2079
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:10,500
these from areas of my skin
and what we believe is happening is that

2080
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,510
and what we believe is happening is that
 

2081
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,240
and what we believe is happening is that
all of them are building models of this

2082
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,250
all of them are building models of this
 

2083
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,359
all of them are building models of this
cup every one of them or things not do

2084
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:15,369
cup every one of them or things not do
 

2085
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,250
cup every one of them or things not do
not all building all not every column

2086
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,260
not all building all not every column
 

2087
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,599
not all building all not every column
every part of the cortex builds models

2088
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:18,609
every part of the cortex builds models
 

2089
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,220
every part of the cortex builds models
of everything but they're all building

2090
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,230
of everything but they're all building
 

2091
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,370
of everything but they're all building
models of something and and so you have

2092
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:23,380
models of something and and so you have
 

2093
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,799
models of something and and so you have
it so when I when I touch this cup with

2094
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:25,809
it so when I when I touch this cup with
 

2095
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:28,079
it so when I when I touch this cup with
my hand there are multiple models of the

2096
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,089
my hand there are multiple models of the
 

2097
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:29,970
my hand there are multiple models of the
cup being invoked if I look at it with

2098
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:29,980
cup being invoked if I look at it with
 

2099
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,920
cup being invoked if I look at it with
my eyes there again many models of the

2100
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:31,930
my eyes there again many models of the
 

2101
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,450
my eyes there again many models of the
cup being invoked because each part of

2102
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:33,460
cup being invoked because each part of
 

2103
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,920
cup being invoked because each part of
the visual system and the brain doesn't

2104
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:34,930
the visual system and the brain doesn't
 

2105
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,900
the visual system and the brain doesn't
process an image that's mr. that's a

2106
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:36,910
process an image that's mr. that's a
 

2107
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,569
process an image that's mr. that's a
misleading idea it's just like your

2108
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:39,579
misleading idea it's just like your
 

2109
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,600
misleading idea it's just like your
fingers touching

2110
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,610
fingers touching
 

2111
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,560
fingers touching
so different parts of my Radnor of

2112
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,570
so different parts of my Radnor of
 

2113
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,550
so different parts of my Radnor of
looking at different parts of the cup

2114
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560
looking at different parts of the cup
 

2115
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,400
looking at different parts of the cup
and thousands and thousands of models of

2116
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:45,410
and thousands and thousands of models of
 

2117
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,990
and thousands and thousands of models of
the cup are being invoked at once and

2118
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,000
the cup are being invoked at once and
 

2119
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,970
the cup are being invoked at once and
they're all voting with each other

2120
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:48,980
they're all voting with each other
 

2121
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,380
they're all voting with each other
trying to figure out what's going on so

2122
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,390
trying to figure out what's going on so
 

2123
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,310
trying to figure out what's going on so
that's why we call it the thousand

2124
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:51,320
that's why we call it the thousand
 

2125
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,720
that's why we call it the thousand
brains theory of intelligence because

2126
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:52,730
brains theory of intelligence because
 

2127
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,090
brains theory of intelligence because
there isn't one model of a cop there are

2128
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,100
there isn't one model of a cop there are
 

2129
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,560
there isn't one model of a cop there are
thousands of models to this Cup there

2130
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,570
thousands of models to this Cup there
 

2131
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,760
thousands of models to this Cup there
are thousands of models for your cell

2132
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:57,770
are thousands of models for your cell
 

2133
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,470
are thousands of models for your cell
phone and about cameras and microphones

2134
00:39:59,470 --> 00:39:59,480
phone and about cameras and microphones
 

2135
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,140
phone and about cameras and microphones
and so on it's a distributed modeling

2136
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,150
and so on it's a distributed modeling
 

2137
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,940
and so on it's a distributed modeling
system which is very different than what

2138
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:03,950
system which is very different than what
 

2139
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,350
system which is very different than what
people have thought about it so this is

2140
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,360
people have thought about it so this is
 

2141
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,000
people have thought about it so this is
a really compelling and interesting idea

2142
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,010
a really compelling and interesting idea
 

2143
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,820
a really compelling and interesting idea
of f2 first questions - one on the

2144
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:09,830
of f2 first questions - one on the
 

2145
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,590
of f2 first questions - one on the
ensemble part of everything coming

2146
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:11,600
ensemble part of everything coming
 

2147
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,190
ensemble part of everything coming
together you have these thousand brains

2148
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,200
together you have these thousand brains
 

2149
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,350
together you have these thousand brains
how do you know which one has done the

2150
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,360
how do you know which one has done the
 

2151
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,420
how do you know which one has done the
best job of forming the great question

2152
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,430
best job of forming the great question

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,330
best job of forming the great question
let me try Spain there there's a problem

2154
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:21,340
let me try Spain there there's a problem
 

2155
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,890
let me try Spain there there's a problem
that's known in neuroscience called the

2156
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:23,900
that's known in neuroscience called the
 

2157
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,890
that's known in neuroscience called the
sensor fusion problem yes and so is the

2158
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:26,900
sensor fusion problem yes and so is the
 

2159
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,480
sensor fusion problem yes and so is the
idea of something like oh the image

2160
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,490
idea of something like oh the image
 

2161
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,800
idea of something like oh the image
comes from the eye there's a picture on

2162
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:29,810
comes from the eye there's a picture on
 

2163
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,780
comes from the eye there's a picture on
the retina and it gets projected to than

2164
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:31,790
the retina and it gets projected to than
 

2165
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,210
the retina and it gets projected to than
your cortex no by now it's all spread

2166
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:34,220
your cortex no by now it's all spread
 

2167
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,680
your cortex no by now it's all spread
out all over the place and it's kind of

2168
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,690
out all over the place and it's kind of
 

2169
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,140
out all over the place and it's kind of
squirrely and distorted and pieces are

2170
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,150
squirrely and distorted and pieces are
 

2171
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,370
squirrely and distorted and pieces are
all over this you know it doesn't look

2172
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,380
all over this you know it doesn't look
 

2173
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,300
all over this you know it doesn't look
like a picture anymore

2174
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,310
like a picture anymore
 

2175
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,190
like a picture anymore
when does it all come back together

2176
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,200
when does it all come back together
 

2177
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,340
when does it all come back together
again right or you might say well yes

2178
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:45,350
again right or you might say well yes
 

2179
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,680
again right or you might say well yes
but I also I also have sounds or touches

2180
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:47,690
but I also I also have sounds or touches
 

2181
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,060
but I also I also have sounds or touches
associated with a couple so I'm seeing

2182
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,070
associated with a couple so I'm seeing
 

2183
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,040
associated with a couple so I'm seeing
the cup and touching the cup how do they

2184
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,050
the cup and touching the cup how do they
 

2185
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,200
the cup and touching the cup how do they
get combined together again so this it's

2186
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,210
get combined together again so this it's
 

2187
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,520
get combined together again so this it's
called the sensor fusion problem is if

2188
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,530
called the sensor fusion problem is if
 

2189
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,230
called the sensor fusion problem is if
all these disparate parts have to be

2190
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
all these disparate parts have to be
 

2191
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,580
all these disparate parts have to be
brought together into one model

2192
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,590
brought together into one model
 

2193
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,270
brought together into one model
someplace that's the wrong idea the

2194
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,280
someplace that's the wrong idea the
 

2195
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,560
someplace that's the wrong idea the
right idea is that you get all these

2196
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,570
right idea is that you get all these
 

2197
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,050
right idea is that you get all these
guys voting there's auditory models of

00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,060
guys voting there's auditory models of
 

2199
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,550
guys voting there's auditory models of
the cup there's visual models the cup

2200
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
the cup there's visual models the cup
 

2201
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,490
the cup there's visual models the cup
those tactile models of the cup there's

2202
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:09,500
those tactile models of the cup there's
 

2203
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,960
those tactile models of the cup there's
one the individual system there might be

2204
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:10,970
one the individual system there might be
 

2205
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,310
one the individual system there might be
ones that are more focused on black and

white ones fortunate on color it doesn't
really matter there's just thousands and

00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,470
really matter there's just thousands and
 

2211
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,470
really matter there's just thousands and
thousands of models of this Cup and they

2212
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,480
thousands of models of this Cup and they
 

2213
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,330
thousands of models of this Cup and they
vote they don't actually come together

2214
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:19,340
vote they don't actually come together
 

2215

in one spot it just literally think of

2216
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:21,560
in one spot it just literally think of
 

2217
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,500
in one spot it just literally think of
it this way I imagine you have these

2218
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:23,510
it this way I imagine you have these
 

2219
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,270
it this way I imagine you have these
columns or like about the size of a

2220
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
columns or like about the size of a
 

2221
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,770
columns or like about the size of a
little piece of spaghetti okay like a

2222
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:26,780
little piece of spaghetti okay like a
 

2223
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,510
little piece of spaghetti okay like a
two and a half millimeters tall and

2224
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:28,520
two and a half millimeters tall and
 

2225
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,100
two and a half millimeters tall and
about a millimeter in mind they're not

2226
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,110
about a millimeter in mind they're not
 

2227
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,140
about a millimeter in mind they're not
physical like but you could think of

2228
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,150
physical like but you could think of
 

2229
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,300
physical like but you could think of
them that way and each one's trying to

2230
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,310
them that way and each one's trying to
 

2231
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,380
them that way and each one's trying to
guess what this thing is they're

2232
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,390
guess what this thing is they're
 

2233
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,450
guess what this thing is they're
touching now they can they can do a

2234
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:37,460
touching now they can they can do a
 

2235
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,560
touching now they can they can do a
pretty good job if they're allowed to

2236
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:38,570
pretty good job if they're allowed to
 

2237
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,870
pretty good job if they're allowed to
move over to us so I could reach my hand

2238
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
move over to us so I could reach my hand
 

2239
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,250
move over to us so I could reach my hand
into a black box and move my finger

2240
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,260
into a black box and move my finger
 

2241
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,140
into a black box and move my finger
around an object and if I touch enough

2242
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,150
around an object and if I touch enough
 

2243
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,120
around an object and if I touch enough
spaces like oh okay I don't know what it

2244
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,130
spaces like oh okay I don't know what it
 

2245
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,520
spaces like oh okay I don't know what it
is but often we don't do that often I

2246
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:48,530
is but often we don't do that often I
 

2247
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,600
is but often we don't do that often I
can just reach and grab something with

2248
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:49,610
can just reach and grab something with
 

2249
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,670
can just reach and grab something with
my hand all the once and I get it or if

2250
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
my hand all the once and I get it or if
 

2251
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,780
my hand all the once and I get it or if
I had to look through the world through

2252
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:52,790
I had to look through the world through
 

2253
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,140
I had to look through the world through
a straw so long

00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,349
invoking one little column I can only
see part of some things I have to move

2258
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359
see part of some things I have to move
 

2259
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,910
see part of some things I have to move
the straw around but if I open my eyes

2260
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:58,920
the straw around but if I open my eyes
 

2261
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,650
the straw around but if I open my eyes
to see the whole thing at once so what

2262
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:00,660
to see the whole thing at once so what
 

2263
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,940
to see the whole thing at once so what
we think is going on it's all these

little pieces of spaghetti if you know
 

2267
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,730
little pieces of spaghetti if you know
all these little columns in the cortex

00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,099
all these little columns in the cortex
or all trying to guess what it is that

2270
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:07,109
or all trying to guess what it is that
 

2271
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,079
or all trying to guess what it is that
they're sensing they'll do a better

they're sensing they'll do a better
guess if they have time and can move

2274
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,160
guess if they have time and can move
 

2275
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,650
guess if they have time and can move
over time so if I move my eyes and with

2276
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:12,660
over time so if I move my eyes and with
 

2277
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,809
over time so if I move my eyes and with
my fingers but if they don't they have a

probabilistic s of what they might be
 

2283
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,410

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,420
touching now imagine they can post their
 

2285
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,809
touching now imagine they can post their
probability at the top of a little piece

00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:23,819
probability at the top of a little piece
 

2287
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,400
probability at the top of a little piece
of spaghetti each one of them says I

2288
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,410
of spaghetti each one of them says I
 

2289
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,930
of spaghetti each one of them says I
think and it's not really a probability

2290
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:26,940
think and it's not really a probability
 

2291
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,670
think and it's not really a probability
decision it's more like a set of

2292
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:28,680
decision it's more like a set of
 

2293
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,710
decision it's more like a set of
possibilities in the brain it doesn't

2294
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
possibilities in the brain it doesn't
 

2295
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,000
possibilities in the brain it doesn't
work as a probability distribution it

2296
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,010
work as a probability distribution it
 

2297
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,559
work as a probability distribution it
works is more like what we call the

2298
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:33,569
works is more like what we call the
 

2299
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:35,720
works is more like what we call the
Union so you could say and one column

2300
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:35,730
Union so you could say and one column
 

2301
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,279
Union so you could say and one column
says I think it could be a coffee cup

2302
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:37,289
says I think it could be a coffee cup
 

2303
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,190
says I think it could be a coffee cup
sort of can or a water bottle and the

2304
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,200
sort of can or a water bottle and the
 

2305
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,480
sort of can or a water bottle and the
other column says I think it could be a

2306
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,490
other column says I think it could be a
 

2307
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,539
other column says I think it could be a
coffee cup or you know telephone or

2308
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:44,549
coffee cup or you know telephone or
 

2309
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:48,049
coffee cup or you know telephone or
camera whatever right and and all these

2310
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:48,059
camera whatever right and and all these
 

2311
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:49,730
camera whatever right and and all these
guys are saying what they think might be

2312
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:49,740
guys are saying what they think might be
 

2313
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,559
guys are saying what they think might be
and there's these long range connections

2314
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:51,569
and there's these long range connections
 

2315
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,660
and there's these long range connections
in certain layers in the cortex so

2316
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:53,670
in certain layers in the cortex so
 

2317
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,180
in certain layers in the cortex so
there's been some layers in some cell

2318
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,190
there's been some layers in some cell
 

2319
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,010
there's been some layers in some cell
types in each column send their

2320
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,020
types in each column send their
 

2321
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,440
types in each column send their
projections across the brain and that's

2322
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,450
projections across the brain and that's
 

2323
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,329
projections across the brain and that's
the voting occurs and so there's a

2324
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:02,339
the voting occurs and so there's a
 

2325
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,099
the voting occurs and so there's a
simple associative memory mechanism

2326
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:04,109
simple associative memory mechanism
 

2327
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:05,960
simple associative memory mechanism
we've described this in a recent paper

2328
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:05,970
we've described this in a recent paper
 

2329
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,620
we've described this in a recent paper
and we've modeled this that says they

2330
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:09,630
and we've modeled this that says they
 

2331
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,960
and we've modeled this that says they
can all quickly settle on the only or

2332
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:11,970
can all quickly settle on the only or
 

2333
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,809
can all quickly settle on the only or
the one best answer for all of them if

2334
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:14,819
the one best answer for all of them if
 

2335
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,670
the one best answer for all of them if
there is a single best answer they all

2336
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:16,680
there is a single best answer they all
 

2337
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,079
there is a single best answer they all
vote and say yeah it's got to be the

2338
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:18,089
vote and say yeah it's got to be the
 

2339
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:20,059
vote and say yeah it's got to be the
coffee cup and at that point they all

2340
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:20,069
coffee cup and at that point they all
 

2341
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:21,769
coffee cup and at that point they all
know it's a coffee go and at that point

2342
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:21,779
know it's a coffee go and at that point
 

2343
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,359
know it's a coffee go and at that point
everyone acts as if it's the coffee cup

2344
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:23,369
everyone acts as if it's the coffee cup
 

2345
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:24,380
everyone acts as if it's the coffee cup
they yeah we know it's a coffee even

2346
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:24,390
they yeah we know it's a coffee even
 

2347
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,700
they yeah we know it's a coffee even
though I've only seen one little piece

2348
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,710
though I've only seen one little piece
 

2349
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,359
though I've only seen one little piece
of this world

2350
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:26,369
of this world
 

2351
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,829
of this world
I know it's coffee cup I'm touching or

2352
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
I know it's coffee cup I'm touching or
 

2353
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,870
I know it's coffee cup I'm touching or
I'm seeing or whatever and so you can

2354
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm seeing or whatever and so you can
 

2355
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,250
I'm seeing or whatever and so you can
think of all these columns are looking

2356
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,260
think of all these columns are looking
 

2357
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,809
think of all these columns are looking
at different parts in different places

2358
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:32,819
at different parts in different places
 

2359
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,309
at different parts in different places
different sensory and put different

2360
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
different sensory and put different
 

2361
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,500
different sensory and put different
locations they're all different but this

2362
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:36,510
locations they're all different but this
 

2363
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,230
locations they're all different but this
layer that's doing the voting that's

2364
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:39,240
layer that's doing the voting that's
 

2365
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,120
layer that's doing the voting that's
it's solidifies it's just like it

2366
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,130
it's solidifies it's just like it
 

2367
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,980
it's solidifies it's just like it
crystallizes and says oh we all know

2368
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:42,990
crystallizes and says oh we all know
 

2369
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,990
crystallizes and says oh we all know
what we're doing and so you don't bring

2370
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,000
what we're doing and so you don't bring
 

2371
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,579
what we're doing and so you don't bring
these models together in one model you

2372
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:46,589
these models together in one model you
 

2373
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,049
these models together in one model you
just vote and there's a crystallization

2374
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:48,059
just vote and there's a crystallization
 

2375
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,079
just vote and there's a crystallization
of the vote great that's a at least a

2376
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:51,089
of the vote great that's a at least a
 

2377
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:55,010
of the vote great that's a at least a
compelling way to think about about the

2378
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,020
compelling way to think about about the
 

2379
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,339
compelling way to think about about the
way you form a model of the world now

2380
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:58,349
way you form a model of the world now
 

2381
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:01,160
way you form a model of the world now
you talk about a coffee cup do you see

2382
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,170
you talk about a coffee cup do you see
 

2383
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,440
you talk about a coffee cup do you see
this as far as I understand you're

2384
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,450
this as far as I understand you're
 

2385
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,480
this as far as I understand you're
proposing this as well that this extends

2386
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,490
proposing this as well that this extends
 

2387
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,650
proposing this as well that this extends
to much more than coffee cups

2388
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:07,660
to much more than coffee cups
 

2389
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,720
to much more than coffee cups
it does or at least the physical world

2390
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:10,730
it does or at least the physical world
 

2391
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,260
it does or at least the physical world
it expands to the world of concepts yeah

2392
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,270
it expands to the world of concepts yeah
 

2393
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,080
it expands to the world of concepts yeah
it does and well first the primary face

2394
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,090
it does and well first the primary face
 

2395
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,240
it does and well first the primary face
every evidence for that is that the

2396
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,250
every evidence for that is that the
 

2397
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,980
every evidence for that is that the
regions of the neocortex that are

2398
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:20,990
regions of the neocortex that are
 

2399
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,630
regions of the neocortex that are
associated with language or high-level

2400
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
associated with language or high-level
 

2401
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,190
associated with language or high-level
thought or mathematics or things like

2402
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:24,200
thought or mathematics or things like
 

2403
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,600
thought or mathematics or things like
that they look like the regions of the

2404
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:25,610
that they look like the regions of the
 

2405
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,250
that they look like the regions of the
new your cortex that process vision

2406
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:27,260
new your cortex that process vision
 

2407
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,630
new your cortex that process vision
hearing and touch there they don't look

2408
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,640
hearing and touch there they don't look
 

2409
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
hearing and touch there they don't look
any different or they look only

2410
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,410
any different or they look only
 

2411
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,060
any different or they look only
marginally different and so one would

2412
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,070
marginally different and so one would
 

2413
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,520
marginally different and so one would
say well if Vernon now Castle who

2414
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:36,530
say well if Vernon now Castle who
 

2415
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,350
say well if Vernon now Castle who
proposed it all that come all the parts

2416
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:38,360
proposed it all that come all the parts
 

2417
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,250
proposed it all that come all the parts
of New York or trees doing the same

2418
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:39,260
of New York or trees doing the same
 

2419
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,220
of New York or trees doing the same
thing if he's right then the parts that

2420
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,230
thing if he's right then the parts that
 

2421
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,480
thing if he's right then the parts that
during language or mathematics or

2422
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:43,490
during language or mathematics or
 

2423
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,370
during language or mathematics or
physics are working on the same

2424
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:45,380
physics are working on the same
 

2425
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,510
physics are working on the same
principle they must be working on the

2426
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:46,520
principle they must be working on the
 

2427
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,120
principle they must be working on the
principle of reference frames so that's

2428
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,130
principle of reference frames so that's
 

2429
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,390
principle of reference frames so that's
a little odd flawed hmm but of course we

2430
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
a little odd flawed hmm but of course we
 

2431
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:52,780
a little odd flawed hmm but of course we
had no eye

2432
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:52,790
had no eye
 

2433
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,610
had no eye
we had no prior idea how these things

2434
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:54,620
we had no prior idea how these things
 

2435
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,130
we had no prior idea how these things
happen so that's let's go with that

2436
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:57,140
happen so that's let's go with that
 

2437
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,340
happen so that's let's go with that
and we in our recent paper we talked a

2438
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:00,350
and we in our recent paper we talked a
 

2439
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,170
and we in our recent paper we talked a
little bit about that I've been working

2440
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:02,180
little bit about that I've been working
 

2441
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,090
little bit about that I've been working
on it more since I have better ideas

2442
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,100
on it more since I have better ideas
 

2443
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,580
on it more since I have better ideas
about it now I'm sitting here very

2444
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:06,590
about it now I'm sitting here very
 

2445
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,540
about it now I'm sitting here very
confident that that's what's happening

2446
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:07,550
confident that that's what's happening
 

2447
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,460
confident that that's what's happening
and I can give you some examples to help

2448
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:09,470
and I can give you some examples to help
 

2449
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,390
and I can give you some examples to help
you think about that

2450
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
you think about that
 

2451
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,670
you think about that
it's not we understand it completely but

2452
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:12,680
it's not we understand it completely but
 

2453
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,840
it's not we understand it completely but
I understand it better than I've

2454
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:13,850
I understand it better than I've
 

2455
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,510
I understand it better than I've
described it in any paper so far so but

2456
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:16,520
described it in any paper so far so but
 

2457
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,190
described it in any paper so far so but
we did put that idea out there says okay

2458
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:18,200
we did put that idea out there says okay
 

2459
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,430
we did put that idea out there says okay
this is it's it's it's it's a good place

2460
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
this is it's it's it's it's a good place
 

2461
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,350
this is it's it's it's it's a good place
to start you know and the evidence would

2462
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:23,360
to start you know and the evidence would
 

2463
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,330
to start you know and the evidence would
suggest this how it's happening and then

2464
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:25,340
suggest this how it's happening and then
 

2465
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,800
suggest this how it's happening and then
we can start tackling that problem one

2466
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:26,810
we can start tackling that problem one
 

2467
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,000
we can start tackling that problem one
piece at a time like what does it mean

2468
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,010
piece at a time like what does it mean
 

2469
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,530
piece at a time like what does it mean
to do high-level thought what it means a

2470
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:29,540
to do high-level thought what it means a
 

2471
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,120
to do high-level thought what it means a
new language how would that fit into a

2472
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,130
new language how would that fit into a
 

2473
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,990
new language how would that fit into a
reference frame framework yes so there's

2474
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,000
reference frame framework yes so there's
 

2475
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,120
reference frame framework yes so there's
a if you could tell me if there's a

2476
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,130
a if you could tell me if there's a
 

2477
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,100
a if you could tell me if there's a
connection but there's an app called

2478
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,110
connection but there's an app called
 

2479
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,740
connection but there's an app called
Anki that helps you remember different

2480
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:41,750
Anki that helps you remember different
 

2481
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,660
Anki that helps you remember different
concepts and they they talk about like a

2482
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:43,670
concepts and they they talk about like a
 

2483
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,300
concepts and they they talk about like a
memory palace that helps you remember a

2484
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:46,310
memory palace that helps you remember a
 

2485
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,240
memory palace that helps you remember a
completely random concepts by so trying

2486
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,250
completely random concepts by so trying
 

2487
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,650
completely random concepts by so trying
to put them in a physical space in your

2488
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:50,660
to put them in a physical space in your
 

2489
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,300
to put them in a physical space in your
mind yeah and putting them next to each

2490
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,310
mind yeah and putting them next to each
 

2491
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,850
mind yeah and putting them next to each
other the method of loci okay yeah for

2492
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:54,860
other the method of loci okay yeah for
 

2493
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,080
other the method of loci okay yeah for
some reason that seems to work really

2494
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,090
some reason that seems to work really
 

2495
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,810
some reason that seems to work really
well yeah no that's a very narrow kind

2496
00:45:58,810 --> 00:45:58,820
well yeah no that's a very narrow kind
 

2497
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,370
well yeah no that's a very narrow kind
of application of just remembering some

2498
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:00,380
of application of just remembering some
 

2499
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,890
of application of just remembering some
facts but that's a very very telling one

2500
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:02,900
facts but that's a very very telling one
 

2501
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,650
facts but that's a very very telling one
yes exactly so it seems like you're

2502
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:05,660
yes exactly so it seems like you're
 

2503
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,590
yes exactly so it seems like you're
describing a mechanism why this seems

2504
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:08,600
describing a mechanism why this seems
 

2505
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,110
describing a mechanism why this seems
yeah so so basically the way what we

2506
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,120
yeah so so basically the way what we
 

2507
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,630
yeah so so basically the way what we
think is going on is all things you know

2508
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:13,640
think is going on is all things you know
 

2509
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,790
think is going on is all things you know
all concepts all ideas words everything

2510
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:15,800
all concepts all ideas words everything
 

2511
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,800
all concepts all ideas words everything
you know are stored in reference frames

2512
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:20,810
you know are stored in reference frames
 

2513
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,830
you know are stored in reference frames
and so if you want to remember something

2514
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:23,840
and so if you want to remember something
 

2515
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,170
and so if you want to remember something
you have to basically navigate through a

2516
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:26,180
you have to basically navigate through a
 

2517
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,640
you have to basically navigate through a
reference frame the same way a rat

2518
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:27,650
reference frame the same way a rat
 

2519
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,200
reference frame the same way a rat
navigates to a Maeve in the same way my

2520
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,210
navigates to a Maeve in the same way my
 

2521
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,850
navigates to a Maeve in the same way my
finger rat navigates to this coffee cup

2522
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:30,860
finger rat navigates to this coffee cup
 

2523
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,820
finger rat navigates to this coffee cup
you are moving through some space and so

2524
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:33,830
you are moving through some space and so
 

2525
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,560
you are moving through some space and so
what you if you have a random list of

2526
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:35,570
what you if you have a random list of
 

2527
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,540
what you if you have a random list of
things you were asked to remember by

2528
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:37,550
things you were asked to remember by
 

2529
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,190
things you were asked to remember by
assigning him to a reference frame

2530
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
assigning him to a reference frame
 

2531
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,810
assigning him to a reference frame
you've already know very well to see

2532
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:40,820
you've already know very well to see
 

2533
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,940
you've already know very well to see
your house right an idea the method of

2534
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:42,950
your house right an idea the method of
 

2535
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,190
your house right an idea the method of
loci is you can say okay in my lobby I'm

2536
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
loci is you can say okay in my lobby I'm
 

2537
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,480
loci is you can say okay in my lobby I'm
going to put this thing and then and

2538
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:46,490
going to put this thing and then and
 

2539
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,860
going to put this thing and then and
then the bedroom I put this one I go

2540
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:47,870
then the bedroom I put this one I go
 

2541
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,360
then the bedroom I put this one I go
down the hall I put this thing and then

2542
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:49,370
down the hall I put this thing and then
 

2543
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,100
down the hall I put this thing and then
you want to recall those facts so we

2544
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,110
you want to recall those facts so we
 

2545
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,720
you want to recall those facts so we
call this things you just walk mentally

2546
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:52,730
call this things you just walk mentally
 

2547
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,280
call this things you just walk mentally
you walk through your house you're

2548
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,290
you walk through your house you're
 

2549
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,840
you walk through your house you're
mentally moving through a reference

2550
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:55,850
mentally moving through a reference
 

2551
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,120
mentally moving through a reference
frame that you already had and that

2552
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,130
frame that you already had and that
 

2553
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,040
frame that you already had and that
tells you there's two things are really

2554
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,050
tells you there's two things are really
 

2555
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,330
tells you there's two things are really
important about it tells us the brain

2556
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:01,340
important about it tells us the brain
 

2557
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,280
important about it tells us the brain
prefers to store things in reference

2558
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,290
prefers to store things in reference
 

2559
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,010
prefers to store things in reference
frames and that the method of recalling

2560
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:06,020
frames and that the method of recalling
 

2561
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,380
frames and that the method of recalling
things or thinking if you will is to

2562
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,390
things or thinking if you will is to
 

2563
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,840
things or thinking if you will is to
move mentally through those reference

2564
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:10,850
move mentally through those reference
 

2565
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,700
move mentally through those reference
frames you could move physically through

2566
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:12,710
frames you could move physically through
 

2567
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,050
frames you could move physically through
some reference frames like I could

2568
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,060
some reference frames like I could
 

2569
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,100
some reference frames like I could
physically move through the reference

2570
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,110
physically move through the reference
 

2571
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,690
physically move through the reference
name of this coffee cup I can also

2572
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:16,700
name of this coffee cup I can also
 

2573
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,040
name of this coffee cup I can also
mentally move to the reference time the

2574
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,050
mentally move to the reference time the
 

2575
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,110
mentally move to the reference time the
coffee cup imagining me touching it but

2576
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:20,120
coffee cup imagining me touching it but
 

2577
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,090
coffee cup imagining me touching it but
I can also mentally move my house and

2578
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:22,100
I can also mentally move my house and
 

2579
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,910
I can also mentally move my house and
and so now we can ask yourself or are

2580
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:24,920
and so now we can ask yourself or are
 

2581
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,890
and so now we can ask yourself or are
all concepts toward this way there's

2582
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:26,900
all concepts toward this way there's
 

2583
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,040
all concepts toward this way there's
some recent research using human

2584
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,050
some recent research using human
 

2585
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,800
some recent research using human
subjects in fMRI and I'm gonna apologize

2586
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:32,810
subjects in fMRI and I'm gonna apologize
 

2587
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,330
subjects in fMRI and I'm gonna apologize
for not knowing the name of the

2588
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:34,340
for not knowing the name of the
 

2589
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,230
for not knowing the name of the
scientist that did this but what they

2590
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
scientist that did this but what they
 

2591
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,810
scientist that did this but what they
did is they they put humans in this fMRI

2592
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:40,820
did is they they put humans in this fMRI
 

2593
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,860
did is they they put humans in this fMRI
machine which was one of these imaging

2594
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:41,870
machine which was one of these imaging
 

2595
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:44,680
machine which was one of these imaging
machines and they they gave the humans

2596
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:44,690
machines and they they gave the humans
 

2597
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,840
machines and they they gave the humans
tasks to think about Birds so they had

2598
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:46,850
tasks to think about Birds so they had
 

2599
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:48,610
tasks to think about Birds so they had
different types of birds and beverage it

2600
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:48,620
different types of birds and beverage it
 

2601
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,320
different types of birds and beverage it
looked big and small and long necks and

2602
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,330
looked big and small and long necks and
 

2603
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,630
looked big and small and long necks and
long legs things like that and what they

2604
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,640
long legs things like that and what they
 

2605
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,630
long legs things like that and what they
could tell from the fMRI it was a very

2606
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:55,640
could tell from the fMRI it was a very
 

2607
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,150
could tell from the fMRI it was a very
clever experiment get to tell when

2608
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
clever experiment get to tell when
 

2609
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,910
clever experiment get to tell when
humans were thinking about the birds

2610
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
humans were thinking about the birds
 

2611
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,160
humans were thinking about the birds
that the birds that the knowledge of

2612
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,170
that the birds that the knowledge of
 

2613
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,320
that the birds that the knowledge of
birds was arranged in a reference frame

2614
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,330
birds was arranged in a reference frame
 

2615
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,210
birds was arranged in a reference frame
similar to the ones that are used when

2616
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:07,220
similar to the ones that are used when
 

2617
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,580
similar to the ones that are used when
you navigate in a room that these are

2618
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:09,590
you navigate in a room that these are
 

2619
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,110
you navigate in a room that these are
called grid cells and there are grid

2620
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:11,120
called grid cells and there are grid
 

2621
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,210
called grid cells and there are grid
cell like patterns of activity in the

2622
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:13,220
cell like patterns of activity in the
 

2623
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,520
cell like patterns of activity in the
new your cortex when they do this so

2624
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:15,530
new your cortex when they do this so
 

2625
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,730
new your cortex when they do this so
that it's a very clever experiment you

2626
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:18,740
that it's a very clever experiment you
 

2627
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,260
that it's a very clever experiment you
know and what it basically says that

2628
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:20,270
know and what it basically says that
 

2629
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,160
know and what it basically says that
even when you're thinking about

2630
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,170
even when you're thinking about
 

2631
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,630
even when you're thinking about
something abstract and you're not really

2632
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
something abstract and you're not really
 

2633
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,130
something abstract and you're not really
thinking about it as a reference frame

2634
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:24,140
thinking about it as a reference frame
 

2635
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,350
thinking about it as a reference frame
it tells us the brain is actually using

2636
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:26,360
it tells us the brain is actually using
 

2637
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,580
it tells us the brain is actually using
a reference frame and it's using the

2638
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:27,590
a reference frame and it's using the
 

2639
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,140
a reference frame and it's using the
same neural mechanisms these grid cells

2640
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,150
same neural mechanisms these grid cells
 

2641
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,910
same neural mechanisms these grid cells
are the basic same neural mechanism that

2642
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:30,920
are the basic same neural mechanism that
 

2643
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,420
are the basic same neural mechanism that
we we propose that grid cells which

2644
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:33,430
we we propose that grid cells which
 

2645
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,339
we we propose that grid cells which
in the old part of the brain the entire

2646
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:35,349
in the old part of the brain the entire
 

2647
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,650
in the old part of the brain the entire
cortex that that mechanism is now

2648
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:37,660
cortex that that mechanism is now
 

2649
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,480
cortex that that mechanism is now
similar mechanism is used throughout the

2650
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:39,490
similar mechanism is used throughout the
 

2651
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,790
similar mechanism is used throughout the
neocortex it's the same nature preserve

2652
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:41,800
neocortex it's the same nature preserve
 

2653
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,589
neocortex it's the same nature preserve
this interesting way of creating

2654
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
this interesting way of creating
 

2655
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,510
this interesting way of creating
reference frames and so now they have

2656
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
reference frames and so now they have
 

2657
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,210
reference frames and so now they have
empirical evidence that when you think

2658
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:48,220
empirical evidence that when you think
 

2659
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,859
empirical evidence that when you think
about concepts like birds that you're

2660
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:49,869
about concepts like birds that you're
 

2661
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,109
about concepts like birds that you're
using reference frames that are built on

2662
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:52,119
using reference frames that are built on
 

2663
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:54,480
using reference frames that are built on
grid cells so this that's similar to the

2664
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:54,490
grid cells so this that's similar to the
 

2665
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,980
grid cells so this that's similar to the
method of loci but in this case the

2666
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:55,990
method of loci but in this case the
 

2667
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,450
method of loci but in this case the
birds are related so it makes they

2668
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:57,460
birds are related so it makes they
 

2669
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,710
birds are related so it makes they
create their own reference frame which

2670
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
create their own reference frame which
 

2671
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,380
create their own reference frame which
is consistent with bird space and when

2672
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:01,390
is consistent with bird space and when
 

2673
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,670
is consistent with bird space and when
you think about something you go through

2674
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:02,680
you think about something you go through
 

2675
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,950
you think about something you go through
that you can make the same example let's

2676
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:04,960
that you can make the same example let's
 

2677
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,780
that you can make the same example let's
take a math mathematics all right let's

2678
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:06,790
take a math mathematics all right let's
 

2679
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,880
take a math mathematics all right let's
say you want to prove a conjecture ok

2680
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:08,890
say you want to prove a conjecture ok
 

2681
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,849
say you want to prove a conjecture ok
what is a conjecture conjecture is a

2682
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:10,859
what is a conjecture conjecture is a
 

2683
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,859
what is a conjecture conjecture is a
statement you believe to be true but you

2684
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:13,869
statement you believe to be true but you
 

2685
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,079
statement you believe to be true but you
haven't proven it and so it might be an

2686
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:16,089
haven't proven it and so it might be an
 

2687
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,030
haven't proven it and so it might be an
equation I I want to show that this is

2688
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:18,040
equation I I want to show that this is
 

2689
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
equation I I want to show that this is
equal to that and you have a place you

2690
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,050
equal to that and you have a place you
 

2691
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,420
equal to that and you have a place you
have some places you start with you said

2692
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,430
have some places you start with you said
 

2693
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,799
have some places you start with you said
well I know this is true and I know this

2694
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:22,809
well I know this is true and I know this
 

2695
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:25,079
well I know this is true and I know this
is true and I think that maybe to get to

2696
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:25,089
is true and I think that maybe to get to
 

2697
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:26,730
is true and I think that maybe to get to
the final proof I need to go through

2698
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:26,740
the final proof I need to go through
 

2699
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,130
the final proof I need to go through
some intermediate results but I believe

2700
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:29,140
some intermediate results but I believe
 

2701
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,089
some intermediate results but I believe
is happening is literally these

2702
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:32,099
is happening is literally these
 

2703
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,950
is happening is literally these
equations where these points are

2704
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
equations where these points are
 

2705
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,270
equations where these points are
assigned to a reference frame a

2706
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,280
assigned to a reference frame a
 

2707
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,400
assigned to a reference frame a
mathematical reference frame and when

2708
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,410
mathematical reference frame and when
 

2709
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,170
mathematical reference frame and when
you do mathematical operations a simple

2710
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:40,180
you do mathematical operations a simple
 

2711
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,880
you do mathematical operations a simple
one might be multiply or divide but you

2712
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:41,890
one might be multiply or divide but you
 

2713
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,289
one might be multiply or divide but you
might be a little applause transform or

2714
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:43,299
might be a little applause transform or
 

2715
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:44,819
might be a little applause transform or
something else that is like a movement

2716
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:44,829
something else that is like a movement
 

2717
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:47,010
something else that is like a movement
in the reference frame of the math and

2718
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:47,020
in the reference frame of the math and
 

2719
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,380
in the reference frame of the math and
so you're literally trying to discover a

2720
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:49,390
so you're literally trying to discover a
 

2721
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,960
so you're literally trying to discover a
path from one location to another

2722
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:51,970
path from one location to another
 

2723
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,829
path from one location to another
location in a space of mathematics and

2724
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
location in a space of mathematics and
 

2725
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,809
location in a space of mathematics and
if you can get to these intermediate

2726
00:49:57,809 --> 00:49:57,819
if you can get to these intermediate
 

2727
00:49:57,819 --> 00:49:59,609
if you can get to these intermediate
results then you know your map is pretty

2728
00:49:59,609 --> 00:49:59,619
results then you know your map is pretty
 

2729
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:01,380
results then you know your map is pretty
good and you know you're using the right

2730
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,390
good and you know you're using the right
 

2731
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,960
good and you know you're using the right
operations much of what we think about

2732
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:03,970
operations much of what we think about
 

2733
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,170
operations much of what we think about
is solving hard problems is designing

2734
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:07,180
is solving hard problems is designing
 

2735
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,490
is solving hard problems is designing
the correct reference frame for that

2736
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:08,500
the correct reference frame for that
 

2737
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,289
the correct reference frame for that
problem figure out how to organize the

2738
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:10,299
problem figure out how to organize the
 

2739
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,900
problem figure out how to organize the
information and what behaviors I want to

2740
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:12,910
information and what behaviors I want to
 

2741
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,380
information and what behaviors I want to
use in that space to get me there yeah

2742
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:16,390
use in that space to get me there yeah
 

2743
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,510
use in that space to get me there yeah
so if you dig in an idea of this

2744
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:18,520
so if you dig in an idea of this
 

2745
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,069
so if you dig in an idea of this
reference frame whether it's the math

2746
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
reference frame whether it's the math
 

2747
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,260
reference frame whether it's the math
you start a set of axioms to try to get

2748
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,270
you start a set of axioms to try to get
 

2749
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,770
you start a set of axioms to try to get
to proving the conjecture can you try to

2750
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:25,780
to proving the conjecture can you try to
 

2751
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,410
to proving the conjecture can you try to
describe maybe taking step back how you

2752
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:28,420
describe maybe taking step back how you
 

2753
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,819
describe maybe taking step back how you
think of the reference frame in that

2754
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:29,829
think of the reference frame in that
 

2755
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:32,700
think of the reference frame in that
context is is it the reference frame

2756
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:32,710
context is is it the reference frame
 

2757
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,510
context is is it the reference frame
that the axioms are happy in is it the

2758
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:36,520
that the axioms are happy in is it the
 

2759
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,010
that the axioms are happy in is it the
reference frame that might contain

2760
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:38,020
reference frame that might contain
 

2761
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,589
reference frame that might contain
everything is that a changing thing so

2762
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:40,599
everything is that a changing thing so
 

2763
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,260
everything is that a changing thing so
there it is you

thing in the world has its own reference
 

2773
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,300
thing in the world has its own reference
frame so every word has its own

frame so every word has its own
 

2775
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,500

reference names and we can talk about

2776
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:51,510
reference names and we can talk about
 

2777
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,890
reference names and we can talk about
this the mathematics work out this is no

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,190
have well it's on a table let's say you
 

2785
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,920
have well it's on a table let's say you
asked how many reference names could the

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:03,930
asked how many reference names could the

there are many miles of a coffee cup and
 

2799
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,800
there are many miles of a coffee cup and
you could say well how many different

00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:46,770
where we just called this cup and now I
 

2831
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,320
where we just called this cup and now I
have this clementa logo on it well

2832

that's something that exists elsewhere
 

2835
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,440
that's something that exists elsewhere
in the world it's it's own thing so it

2836
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,450
in the world it's it's own thing so it
 

2837
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,640
in the world it's it's own thing so it
has its own reference time so we now

2838
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:52,650
has its own reference time so we now
 

2839
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,890
has its own reference time so we now
have to say how can I sign the new

that came out in December this last year
 

2849
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,540
that came out in December this last year
the idea of how you can assign reference

2850
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:08,550
the idea of how you can assign reference
 

2851
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,770
the idea of how you can assign reference
names to reference names how neurons

2852
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:09,780
names to reference names how neurons
 

2853
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,600
names to reference names how neurons
could do this so well my question is

2854
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:11,610
could do this so well my question is
 

2855
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,730
could do this so well my question is
okay even though you mentioned reference

2856
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:13,740
okay even though you mentioned reference
 

2857
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,650
okay even though you mentioned reference
frames a lot I almost feel it's really

2858
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:15,660
frames a lot I almost feel it's really
 

2859
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,280
frames a lot I almost feel it's really
useful to dig into how you think of what

2860
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,290
useful to dig into how you think of what
 

2861
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,630
useful to dig into how you think of what
a reference frame is I mean I was

2862
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
a reference frame is I mean I was
 

2863
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,040
a reference frame is I mean I was
already helpful for me to understand

2864
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,050
already helpful for me to understand
 

2865
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,810
already helpful for me to understand
sure you think of reference frames is

2866
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:23,820
sure you think of reference frames is
 

2867
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,680
sure you think of reference frames is
something there is a lot of okay so

2868
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:26,690
something there is a lot of okay so
 

2869
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,730
something there is a lot of okay so
let's just say that we're gonna have

2870
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:28,740
let's just say that we're gonna have
 

2871
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,620
let's just say that we're gonna have
some neurons in the brain not many

2872
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:30,630
some neurons in the brain not many
 

2873
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,690
some neurons in the brain not many
actually 10,000 20,000 are gonna create

2874
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:32,700
actually 10,000 20,000 are gonna create
 

2875
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,490
actually 10,000 20,000 are gonna create
a whole bunch of reference frames what

2876
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:34,500
a whole bunch of reference frames what
 

2877
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,080
a whole bunch of reference frames what
does it mean right what is the reference

2878
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,090
does it mean right what is the reference
 

2879
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,990
does it mean right what is the reference
in this case first of all these

2880
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,000
in this case first of all these
 

2881
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,310
in this case first of all these
reference names are different than the

2882
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:40,320
reference names are different than the
 

2883
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,350
reference names are different than the
ones you might have be used to let you

2884
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:42,360
ones you might have be used to let you
 

2885
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,550
ones you might have be used to let you
know lots of reference in its route for

2886
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:43,560
know lots of reference in its route for
 

2887
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,170

of reference frame it's a kind of a
 

2907
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,790
of reference frame it's a kind of a

interesting about the reference frames

2910
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:06,300
interesting about the reference frames
 

2911
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,850
interesting about the reference frames
in the brain and we know this because

2912
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:07,860
in the brain and we know this because
 

2913
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,860
in the brain and we know this because

this is known neuroscience in an old
part of the brain the way these cells

00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:17,580
part of the brain the way these cells
 

2923
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,250
part of the brain the way these cells
create reference frames they have no

create reference frames they have no
origin so what it's more like you have

2926
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:22,500
origin so what it's more like you have
 

2927
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,100

00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,110
you have a point your appointment in
 

2929
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,070
you have a point your appointment in
some space and you give it a particular

2930
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,080
some space and you give it a particular
 

2931
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,530
some space and you give it a particular
movement you can then tell what the next

2932
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:30,540
movement you can then tell what the next
 

2933
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,990
movement you can then tell what the next
point should be and you can then tell

2934
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,000
point should be and you can then tell
 

2935
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,630
point should be and you can then tell
what the next point would be and so on

2936
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
what the next point would be and so on
 

2937
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,870
what the next point would be and so on
you can use this to to calculate how to

you can use this to to calculate how to
get from one point to another so how do

side of my cup to the top of the camp
how do I get from the the axioms to the

2948
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:49,340
how do I get from the the axioms to the
 

2949
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,070
how do I get from the the axioms to the
conjecture

2950
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:52,080
conjecture
 

2951
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,930
conjecture
so it's a different type of reference

2952
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:53,940
so it's a different type of reference
 

2953
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,520
so it's a different type of reference
frame and I can if you want I can

2954
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,530
frame and I can if you want I can
 

2955
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,860
frame and I can if you want I can
describe in more detail I can paint a

2956
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:57,870
describe in more detail I can paint a
 

2957
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,240
describe in more detail I can paint a
picture how you might want to think

2958
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,250
picture how you might want to think
 

2959
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,500
picture how you might want to think
about that so really helpful to think

2960
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:00,510
about that so really helpful to think
 

2961
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,300
about that so really helpful to think
it's something you can move through yeah

2962
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,310
it's something you can move through yeah
 

2963
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,860
it's something you can move through yeah
but is there is it is it helpful to

2964
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:06,870
but is there is it is it helpful to
 

2965
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,810
but is there is it is it helpful to
think of it as spatial in some sense or

2966
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:08,820
think of it as spatial in some sense or
 

2967
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,460
think of it as spatial in some sense or
is there something definitely spatial

2968
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,470
is there something definitely spatial
 

2969
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,090
is there something definitely spatial
its spatial in the mathematical sense we

2970
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:14,100
its spatial in the mathematical sense we
 

2971
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,070
its spatial in the mathematical sense we
need to mention can it be crazy numbered

2972
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,080
need to mention can it be crazy numbered
 

2973
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,570
need to mention can it be crazy numbered
well that's an interesting question in

2974
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:17,580
well that's an interesting question in
 

2975
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,860
well that's an interesting question in
the old part of the brain the answer I

2976
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:18,870
the old part of the brain the answer I
 

2977
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:19,610
the old part of the brain the answer I
know cortex

2978
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:19,620
know cortex
 

2979
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,760
know cortex
they studied rats and initially it looks

2980
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:22,770
they studied rats and initially it looks
 

2981
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,140
they studied rats and initially it looks
like oh this is just two-dimensional

2982
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,150
like oh this is just two-dimensional
 

2983
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,540
like oh this is just two-dimensional
it's like the rat is in some box and the

2984
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:26,550
it's like the rat is in some box and the
 

2985
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,980
it's like the rat is in some box and the
maze or whatever and they know where the

2986
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:27,990
maze or whatever and they know where the
 

2987
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,270
maze or whatever and they know where the
rat is using these two-dimensional

2988
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
rat is using these two-dimensional
 

2989
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,770
rat is using these two-dimensional
reference frames and know where it is

2990
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:30,780
reference frames and know where it is
 

2991
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,140
reference frames and know where it is
that's right the maze we saw okay but

2992
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:33,150
that's right the maze we saw okay but
 

2993
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,910
that's right the maze we saw okay but
what about what about bats

2994
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:34,920
what about what about bats
 

2995
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,890
what about what about bats
that's a mammal and they fly in

2996
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900
that's a mammal and they fly in
 

2997
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,110
that's a mammal and they fly in
three-dimensional space how do they do

2998
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:39,120
three-dimensional space how do they do
 

2999
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,370
three-dimensional space how do they do
that they seem to know where they are

3000
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:40,380
that they seem to know where they are
 

3001
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,370
that they seem to know where they are
right so there's this is a current area

3002
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:43,380
right so there's this is a current area
 

3003
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,020
right so there's this is a current area
of active research and it seems like

3004
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,030
of active research and it seems like
 

3005
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,610
of active research and it seems like
somehow the rep the neurons in the in

00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
it there's no it's it's not inherently
 

3029

it there's no it's it's not inherently
limited you can think of it this way if

00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,470
limited you can think of it this way if
 

3031
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,350

you had two-dimensional is the way it

3032
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:18,360
you had two-dimensional is the way it
 

3033
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,220
you had two-dimensional is the way it
works is you add as a bunch of

3034
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,230
works is you add as a bunch of
 

3035
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,050
works is you add as a bunch of
two-dimensional slices that's the way

3036
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:21,060
two-dimensional slices that's the way
 

3037
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,400
two-dimensional slices that's the way
these things work there's a whole bunch

3038
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:22,410
these things work there's a whole bunch
 

3039
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,010
these things work there's a whole bunch
of two-dimensional models and you can

3040
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:25,020
of two-dimensional models and you can
 

3041
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,480
of two-dimensional models and you can
just you can slice up any n-dimensional

3042
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:26,490
just you can slice up any n-dimensional
 

3043
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,040
just you can slice up any n-dimensional
space and with two-dimensional

3044
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,050
space and with two-dimensional
 

3045
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,170
space and with two-dimensional
projections so and you could all have

3046
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,180
projections so and you could all have
 

3047
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,790
projections so and you could all have
one dimensional models it does so

3048
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:31,800
one dimensional models it does so
 

3049
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,440
one dimensional models it does so
there's there's nothing inherent about

3050
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:33,450
there's there's nothing inherent about
 

3051
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,820
there's there's nothing inherent about
the mathematics about the way the

the dimensionality of the space which I
 

3057
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,050
the dimensionality of the space which I
think was important and so obviously I

3058
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:42,060
think was important and so obviously I
 

3059
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,970
think was important and so obviously I
have a three dimensional map of this cup

3060

00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,130
totally new way of thinking about other
new yorker optics work so that is

3102
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:28,140
new yorker optics work so that is
 

3103
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,230
new yorker optics work so that is
appealing it has all these ramifications

3104
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
appealing it has all these ramifications
 

3105
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,200
appealing it has all these ramifications
and with that as a framework for how the

3106
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,210
and with that as a framework for how the
 

3107
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,580
and with that as a framework for how the
brain works you can make all kinds of

3108
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:34,590
brain works you can make all kinds of
 

3109
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:35,510
brain works you can make all kinds of
predictions and solve all kinds of

3110
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
predictions and solve all kinds of
 

3111
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,980
predictions and solve all kinds of
problems now we're trying to work

3112
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:36,990
problems now we're trying to work
 

3113
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,330
problems now we're trying to work
through many of these details right now

3114
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:38,340
through many of these details right now
 

3115
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,890
through many of these details right now
okay how do they neurons actually do

3116
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,900
okay how do they neurons actually do
 

3117
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,570
okay how do they neurons actually do
this well turns out if you think about

3118
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:41,580
this well turns out if you think about
 

3119
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,460
this well turns out if you think about
grid cells and place cells in the old

3120
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:43,470
grid cells and place cells in the old
 

3121
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,590
grid cells and place cells in the old
parts of the brain there's a lot of snow

3122
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:45,600
parts of the brain there's a lot of snow
 

3123
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,520
parts of the brain there's a lot of snow
and about them but there's still some

3124
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:46,530
and about them but there's still some
 

3125
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,930
and about them but there's still some
mysteries there's a lot of debate about

3126
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:47,940
mysteries there's a lot of debate about
 

3127
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,820
mysteries there's a lot of debate about
exactly the details how these work and

3128
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:49,830
exactly the details how these work and
 

3129
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,230
exactly the details how these work and
what are the signs and we have that

3130
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:51,240
what are the signs and we have that
 

3131
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,000
what are the signs and we have that
still that same level of detail the same

3132
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,010
still that same level of detail the same
 

3133
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,610
still that same level of detail the same
level concern what we spend here most of

3134
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:55,620
level concern what we spend here most of
 

3135
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,910
level concern what we spend here most of
our time doing is trying to make a very

00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:58,920
our time doing is trying to make a very
 

3137
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
our time doing is trying to make a very
good list of the things we don't

3138
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:00,930
good list of the things we don't
 

3139
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,650
good list of the things we don't
understand yet that's the key part here

3140
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:03,660
understand yet that's the key part here
 

3141
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,630
understand yet that's the key part here
what are the constraints it's not like

3142
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:05,640
what are the constraints it's not like
 

3143
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,130
what are the constraints it's not like
oh this thing seems work we're done no

3144
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:07,140
oh this thing seems work we're done no
 

3145
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,900
oh this thing seems work we're done no
it's like okay it kind of works but

3146
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:08,910
it's like okay it kind of works but
 

3147
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,370
it's like okay it kind of works but
these are other things we know what has

3148
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:10,380
these are other things we know what has
 

3149
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,470
these are other things we know what has
to do and it's not doing those yet I

3150
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
to do and it's not doing those yet I
 

3151
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,870
to do and it's not doing those yet I
would say we're well on the way here I'm

3152
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
would say we're well on the way here I'm
 

3153
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,530
would say we're well on the way here I'm
not done yet there's a lot of trickiness

3154
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:18,540
not done yet there's a lot of trickiness
 

3155
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,620
not done yet there's a lot of trickiness
to this system but the basic principles

3156
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:21,630
to this system but the basic principles
 

3157
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,360
to this system but the basic principles
about how different layers in the

3158
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:23,370
about how different layers in the
 

3159
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,460
about how different layers in the
neocortex are doing much of this we

3160
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:25,470
neocortex are doing much of this we
 

3161
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,920
neocortex are doing much of this we
understand but there's some fundamental

3162
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:27,930
understand but there's some fundamental
 

3163
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,720
understand but there's some fundamental
parts that we don't understand the sums

3164
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:29,730
parts that we don't understand the sums
 

3165
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,450
parts that we don't understand the sums
so what would you say is one of the

3166
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:32,460
so what would you say is one of the
 

3167
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,880
so what would you say is one of the
harder open problems or one of them ones

3168
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:34,890
harder open problems or one of them ones
 

3169
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,110
harder open problems or one of them ones
that have been bothering you

3170
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:36,120
that have been bothering you
 

3171
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,480
that have been bothering you
Oh keeping you up at night the most oh

3172
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:38,490
Oh keeping you up at night the most oh
 

3173
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,610
Oh keeping you up at night the most oh
well right now this is a detailed thing

3174
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:40,620
well right now this is a detailed thing
 

3175
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,600
well right now this is a detailed thing
that wouldn't apply to most people okay

3176
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:43,610
that wouldn't apply to most people okay
 

3177
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:48,500
that wouldn't apply to most people okay
yeah please we've talked about as if to

3178
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:48,510
yeah please we've talked about as if to
 

3179
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,060
yeah please we've talked about as if to
predict what you're going to sense on

3180
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,070
predict what you're going to sense on
 

3181
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,680
predict what you're going to sense on
this coffee cup I need to know where my

3182
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:51,690
this coffee cup I need to know where my
 

3183
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,880
this coffee cup I need to know where my
finger is gonna be on the coffee cup

3184
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:52,890
finger is gonna be on the coffee cup
 

3185
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,540
finger is gonna be on the coffee cup
that is true but it's insufficient think

3186
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:56,550
that is true but it's insufficient think
 

3187
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,800
that is true but it's insufficient think
about my finger touches the edge of the

3188
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:57,810
about my finger touches the edge of the
 

3189
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,110
about my finger touches the edge of the
coffee cup my finger can touch it at

3190
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,120
coffee cup my finger can touch it at
 

3191
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,910
coffee cup my finger can touch it at
different orientations right I can

3192
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
different orientations right I can
 

3193
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,270
different orientations right I can
rotate my finger around here and that

3194
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
rotate my finger around here and that
 

3195
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,010
rotate my finger around here and that
doesn't change ice I can make that

3196
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:07,020
doesn't change ice I can make that
 

3197
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,200
doesn't change ice I can make that
prediction and somehow so it's not just

3198
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,210
prediction and somehow so it's not just
 

3199
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,540
prediction and somehow so it's not just
the location there's an orientation

3200
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:10,550
the location there's an orientation
 

3201
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:13,850
the location there's an orientation
component of this as well this is known

3202
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:13,860
component of this as well this is known
 

3203
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,990
component of this as well this is known
in the old parts of the brain too

3204
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,000
in the old parts of the brain too
 

3205
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,130
in the old parts of the brain too
there's things called head Direction

3206
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:16,140
there's things called head Direction
 

3207
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,990
there's things called head Direction
cells which which way the rat is facing

3208
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
cells which which way the rat is facing
 

3209
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,890
cells which which way the rat is facing
it's the same kind of base

3210
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:18,900
it's the same kind of base
 

3211
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,430
it's the same kind of base
the idea so my finger were Iraq you know

3212
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:22,440
the idea so my finger were Iraq you know
 

3213
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,049
the idea so my finger were Iraq you know
in three dimensions I have a three

3214
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:24,059
in three dimensions I have a three
 

3215
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,089
in three dimensions I have a three
dimensional orientation and I have a

3216
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:26,099
dimensional orientation and I have a
 

3217
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:27,529
dimensional orientation and I have a
three dimensional location if I was a

3218
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:27,539
three dimensional location if I was a
 

3219
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,089
three dimensional location if I was a
rat I would have it you might think it

3220
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:29,099
rat I would have it you might think it
 

3221
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:30,769
rat I would have it you might think it
was a 2-dimensional location a two

3222
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:30,779
was a 2-dimensional location a two
 

3223
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:31,670
was a 2-dimensional location a two
dimensional orientation or one

3224
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
dimensional orientation or one
 

3225
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,710
dimensional orientation or one
dimensional orientation like just which

3226
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:33,720
dimensional orientation like just which
 

3227
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,890
dimensional orientation like just which
way is it facing so how the the two

3228
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:36,900
way is it facing so how the the two
 

3229
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,720
way is it facing so how the the two
components work together how it is that

3230
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:38,730
components work together how it is that
 

3231
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,569
components work together how it is that
I I combine orientation right the

3232
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:41,579
I I combine orientation right the
 

3233
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:45,700
I I combine orientation right the
orientation my sensor as well as the the

3234
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,710
orientation my sensor as well as the the
 

3235
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:51,079
orientation my sensor as well as the the
location is a tricky problem and I think

3236
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:51,089
location is a tricky problem and I think
 

3237
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:53,450
location is a tricky problem and I think
I've made progress on it though at a

3238
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:53,460
I've made progress on it though at a
 

3239
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,700
I've made progress on it though at a
bigger version of that so prospective

3240
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:55,710
bigger version of that so prospective
 

3241
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,920
bigger version of that so prospective
super interesting but super specific

3242
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:57,930
super interesting but super specific
 

3243
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:02,599
super interesting but super specific
yeah it's really good there's a more

3244
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:02,609
yeah it's really good there's a more
 

3245
00:59:02,609 --> 00:59:05,349
yeah it's really good there's a more
general version of that do you think

3246
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
general version of that do you think
 

3247
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,359
general version of that do you think
context matters the fact that we are in

3248
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:08,369
context matters the fact that we are in
 

3249
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:13,010
context matters the fact that we are in
a building in North America that that we

3250
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:13,020
a building in North America that that we
 

3251
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,650
a building in North America that that we
in the day and age where we have mugs I

3252
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:15,660
in the day and age where we have mugs I
 

3253
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,589
in the day and age where we have mugs I
mean there's all this extra information

3254
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:18,599
mean there's all this extra information
 

3255
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,799
mean there's all this extra information
that you bring to the table about

3256
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:20,809
that you bring to the table about
 

3257
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:22,670
that you bring to the table about
everything else in the room that's

3258
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:22,680
everything else in the room that's
 

3259
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,950
everything else in the room that's
outside of just the coffee cup how does

3260
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
outside of just the coffee cup how does
 

3261
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,069
outside of just the coffee cup how does
it get yeah so Kanab you think yeah and

3262
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079
it get yeah so Kanab you think yeah and
 

3263
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,359
it get yeah so Kanab you think yeah and
that is a another really interesting

3264
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:29,369
that is a another really interesting
 

3265
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:31,400
that is a another really interesting
question I'm gonna throw that under the

3266
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,410
question I'm gonna throw that under the
 

3267
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,799
question I'm gonna throw that under the
the rubric or the name of attentional

3268
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:33,809
the rubric or the name of attentional
 

3269
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:35,990
the rubric or the name of attentional
problems first of all we have this model

3270
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
problems first of all we have this model
 

3271
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,059
problems first of all we have this model
I have many many models so there's a and

3272
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:38,069
I have many many models so there's a and
 

3273
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:39,589
I have many many models so there's a and
also the question doesn't matter because

3274
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:39,599
also the question doesn't matter because
 

3275
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,299
also the question doesn't matter because
well it matters for certain things of

3276
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:41,309
well it matters for certain things of
 

3277
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,940
well it matters for certain things of
course it does maybe what we think of

3278
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:43,950
course it does maybe what we think of
 

3279
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,500
course it does maybe what we think of
that as a coffee cup in another part of

3280
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:45,510
that as a coffee cup in another part of
 

3281
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,700
that as a coffee cup in another part of
the world this commute is something

3282
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:46,710
the world this commute is something
 

3283
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:47,329
the world this commute is something
totally different

3284
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:47,339
totally different
 

3285
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:49,339
totally different
or maybe the our logo which is very

3286
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:49,349
or maybe the our logo which is very
 

3287
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:51,410
or maybe the our logo which is very
benign in this part of the world it

3288
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:51,420
benign in this part of the world it
 

3289
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,490
benign in this part of the world it
means something very different than

3290
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:52,500
means something very different than
 

3291
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,370
means something very different than
another part of the world so those

3292
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:55,380
another part of the world so those
 

3293
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,490
another part of the world so those
things do matter I think the thing the

3294
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:58,500
things do matter I think the thing the
 

3295
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,529
things do matter I think the thing the
way to think about is the following one

3296
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:00,539
way to think about is the following one
 

3297
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:02,299
way to think about is the following one
way to think about it is we have all

3298
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:02,309
way to think about it is we have all
 

3299
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:05,089
way to think about it is we have all
these models of the world ok and we have

3300
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:05,099
these models of the world ok and we have
 

3301
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,680
these models of the world ok and we have
modeled we model everything and as I

3302
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,690
modeled we model everything and as I
 

3303
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,569
modeled we model everything and as I
said earlier it comes snuck it in there

3304
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:08,579
said earlier it comes snuck it in there
 

3305
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,420
said earlier it comes snuck it in there
our models are actually we we build

3306
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:11,430
our models are actually we we build
 

3307
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,269
our models are actually we we build
composite structure so every object is

3308
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:14,279
composite structure so every object is
 

3309
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:15,440
composite structure so every object is
composed of other objects which are

3310
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:15,450
composed of other objects which are
 

3311
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,029
composed of other objects which are
composed of other objects and they

3312
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:17,039
composed of other objects and they
 

3313
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,010
composed of other objects and they
become members of other objects so this

3314
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,020
become members of other objects so this
 

3315
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,599
become members of other objects so this
room is chairs and a table and a room

3316
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:20,609
room is chairs and a table and a room
 

3317
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:22,160
room is chairs and a table and a room
and the walls and so on now we can just

3318
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,170
and the walls and so on now we can just
 

3319
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,079
and the walls and so on now we can just
arrange them in these things a certain

3320
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:24,089
arrange them in these things a certain
 

3321
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:25,339
arrange them in these things a certain
way you go that's the new meta

3322
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:25,349
way you go that's the new meta
 

3323
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:29,160
way you go that's the new meta
conference room so

3324
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:29,170
conference room so
 

3325
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,230
conference room so
so and what we do is when we go around

3326
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:31,240
so and what we do is when we go around
 

3327
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,230
so and what we do is when we go around
the world and we experience the world

3328
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:33,240
the world and we experience the world
 

3329
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,480
the world and we experience the world
we've I walk into a room for example the

3330
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:36,490
we've I walk into a room for example the
 

3331
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,009
we've I walk into a room for example the
first thing I'd like say oh I'm in this

3332
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:38,019
first thing I'd like say oh I'm in this
 

3333
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,569
first thing I'd like say oh I'm in this
room do I recognize the room then I

3334
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:39,579
room do I recognize the room then I
 

3335
01:00:39,579 --> 01:00:41,279
room do I recognize the room then I
could say oh look there's a there's a

3336
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:41,289
could say oh look there's a there's a
 

3337
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:43,740
could say oh look there's a there's a
table here and I by attending to the

3338
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:43,750
table here and I by attending to the
 

3339
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,539
table here and I by attending to the
table I'm then assigning this table in a

3340
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:45,549
table I'm then assigning this table in a
 

3341
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:47,009
table I'm then assigning this table in a
context of the room that's on the table

3342
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:47,019
context of the room that's on the table
 

3343
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,620
context of the room that's on the table
there's a coffee cup oh and on the table

3344
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:49,630
there's a coffee cup oh and on the table
 

3345
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,269
there's a coffee cup oh and on the table
there's a logo and in the logo this is

3346
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:51,279
there's a logo and in the logo this is
 

3347
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:52,769
there's a logo and in the logo this is
the word dementia I look in the logo

3348
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:52,779
the word dementia I look in the logo
 

3349
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:54,720
the word dementia I look in the logo
there's a letter e on look it has an

3350
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:54,730
there's a letter e on look it has an
 

3351
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,210
there's a letter e on look it has an
unusual Seraph and it doesn't actually

3352
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:57,220
unusual Seraph and it doesn't actually
 

3353
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,640
unusual Seraph and it doesn't actually
but my pretend so the point is you your

3354
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:01,650
but my pretend so the point is you your
 

3355
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,349
but my pretend so the point is you your
attention is kind of drilling deep in

3356
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:04,359
attention is kind of drilling deep in
 

3357
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:07,680
attention is kind of drilling deep in
and out of these nested structures and I

3358
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:07,690
and out of these nested structures and I
 

3359
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,240
and out of these nested structures and I
can pop back up and I can pop back down

3360
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:09,250
can pop back up and I can pop back down
 

3361
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,559
can pop back up and I can pop back down
I can pop back up and I can pop back

3362
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:10,569
I can pop back up and I can pop back
 

3363
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,839
I can pop back up and I can pop back
down so I when I attend to the coffee

3364
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:12,849
down so I when I attend to the coffee
 

3365
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:14,579
down so I when I attend to the coffee
cup I haven't lost the context of

3366
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:14,589
cup I haven't lost the context of
 

3367
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:17,120
cup I haven't lost the context of
everything else but but it's sort of

3368
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,130
everything else but but it's sort of
 

3369
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,410
everything else but but it's sort of
nested structure so the attention

3370
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:19,420
nested structure so the attention
 

3371
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,190
nested structure so the attention
filters the reference frame information

3372
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:22,200
filters the reference frame information
 

3373
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,509
filters the reference frame information
for that particular period of time yes

3374
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:24,519
for that particular period of time yes
 

3375
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,339
for that particular period of time yes
it basically a moment-to-moment

3376
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:26,349
it basically a moment-to-moment
 

3377
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,620
it basically a moment-to-moment
you attend the subcomponents and then

3378
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:28,630
you attend the subcomponents and then
 

3379
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,910
you attend the subcomponents and then
you can tend to sub components to sub

3380
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:29,920
you can tend to sub components to sub
 

3381
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,170
you can tend to sub components to sub
component so you can move up and down

3382
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:31,180
component so you can move up and down
 

3383
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,640
component so you can move up and down
you can move up and down then we do that

3384
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:32,650
you can move up and down then we do that
 

3385
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,470
you can move up and down then we do that
all the time you're not even now that

3386
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
all the time you're not even now that
 

3387
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,569
all the time you're not even now that
I'm aware of it I'm very conscious of it

3388
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:36,579
I'm aware of it I'm very conscious of it
 

3389
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:39,089
I'm aware of it I'm very conscious of it
but scintilla but most people don't

3390
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:39,099
but scintilla but most people don't
 

3391
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:40,170
but scintilla but most people don't
don't you think about this you know you

3392
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:40,180
don't you think about this you know you
 

3393
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,190
don't you think about this you know you
don't you just walk in the room and you

3394
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200
don't you just walk in the room and you
 

3395
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,839
don't you just walk in the room and you
don't say oh I looked at the chair and I

3396
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:42,849
don't say oh I looked at the chair and I
 

3397
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:43,950
don't say oh I looked at the chair and I
looked at the board and looked at that

3398
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:43,960
looked at the board and looked at that
 

3399
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,240
looked at the board and looked at that
word on the board and I looked over here

3400
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:45,250
word on the board and I looked over here
 

3401
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,849
word on the board and I looked over here
what's going on right so what percent of

3402
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:47,859
what's going on right so what percent of
 

3403
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,829
what's going on right so what percent of
your day are you deeply aware of this

3404
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
your day are you deeply aware of this
 

3405
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,720
your day are you deeply aware of this
and what part can you actually relax and

3406
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:51,730
and what part can you actually relax and
 

3407
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,579
and what part can you actually relax and
just be Jeff me personally like my

just be Jeff me personally like my
personal day yeah unfortunately I'm

3410

personal day yeah unfortunately I'm
 

3411
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:58,670
personal day yeah unfortunately I'm
afflicted with too much of the former I

3412
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:58,680
afflicted with too much of the former I
 

3413
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,890
afflicted with too much of the former I
[Laughter]

3414

fortunately or unfortunately yeah I
 

3417
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,220
fortunately or unfortunately yeah I
don't think it's useful oh I did useful

3418
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:05,230
don't think it's useful oh I did useful
 

3419
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,499
don't think it's useful oh I did useful
totally useful I think about this stuff

3420
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:07,509
totally useful I think about this stuff
 

3421
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:11,190
totally useful I think about this stuff
almost all the time and I meant one of

3422
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:11,200
almost all the time and I meant one of
 

3423
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,079
almost all the time and I meant one of
my primary ways of thinking is when I'm

3424
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:13,089
my primary ways of thinking is when I'm
 

3425
01:02:13,089 --> 01:02:14,609
my primary ways of thinking is when I'm
in sleep at night I always wake up in

3426
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:14,619
in sleep at night I always wake up in
 

3427
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:16,470
in sleep at night I always wake up in
the middle of the night and then I stay

3428
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
the middle of the night and then I stay
 

3429
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,240
the middle of the night and then I stay
awake for at least an hour with my eyes

3430
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:18,250
awake for at least an hour with my eyes
 

3431
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,549
awake for at least an hour with my eyes
shut in a sort of a half sleep state

3432
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
shut in a sort of a half sleep state
 

3433
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,960
shut in a sort of a half sleep state
thinking about these things I come up

3434
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:21,970
thinking about these things I come up
 

3435
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,789
thinking about these things I come up
with answers to problems very often in

3436
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:23,799
with answers to problems very often in
 

3437
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:25,650
with answers to problems very often in
that sort of half sleeping State I think

3438
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:25,660
that sort of half sleeping State I think
 

3439
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,059
that sort of half sleeping State I think
about on my bike ride I think about on

3440
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:27,069
about on my bike ride I think about on
 

3441
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:28,470
about on my bike ride I think about on
walks I'm just constantly thing about

3442
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
walks I'm just constantly thing about
 

3443
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,579
walks I'm just constantly thing about
this I have to almost a scheduled time

3444
01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:31,589
this I have to almost a scheduled time
 

3445
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:34,109
this I have to almost a scheduled time
to not think about this stuff because

3446
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:34,119
to not think about this stuff because
 

3447
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,109
to not think about this stuff because
it's very it's mentally taxing

3448
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
it's very it's mentally taxing
 

3449
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,120
it's very it's mentally taxing
are you when you think about the

3450
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,130
are you when you think about the
 

3451
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,289
are you when you think about the
stuffy's are you thinking

3452
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:40,299
stuffy's are you thinking
 

3453
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,299
stuffy's are you thinking
introspectively like almost

3454
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:42,309
introspectively like almost
 

3455
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:44,009
introspectively like almost
gonna step outside yourself and trying

3456
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:44,019
gonna step outside yourself and trying
 

3457
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:45,359
gonna step outside yourself and trying
to figure out what is your mind doing

3458
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:45,369
to figure out what is your mind doing
 

3459
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:47,069
to figure out what is your mind doing
right I do that all the time but that's

3460
01:02:47,069 --> 01:02:47,079
right I do that all the time but that's
 

3461
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,920
right I do that all the time but that's
not all I do I've constantly observing

3462
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:49,930
not all I do I've constantly observing
 

3463
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,809
not all I do I've constantly observing
myself so as soon as I started thinking

3464
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:51,819
myself so as soon as I started thinking
 

3465
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:54,509
myself so as soon as I started thinking
about grid cells for example and getting

3466
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:54,519
about grid cells for example and getting
 

3467
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,429
about grid cells for example and getting
into that I started saying oh well grid

3468
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:56,439
into that I started saying oh well grid
 

3469
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,839
into that I started saying oh well grid
cells can't mice place a sense in the

3470
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:57,849
cells can't mice place a sense in the
 

3471
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:58,799
cells can't mice place a sense in the
world you know that's where you know

3472
01:02:58,799 --> 01:02:58,809
world you know that's where you know
 

3473
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,509
world you know that's where you know
where you are and essentially you know

3474
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:00,519
where you are and essentially you know
 

3475
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:01,709
where you are and essentially you know
we always have a sense of where we are

3476
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:01,719
we always have a sense of where we are
 

3477
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,839
we always have a sense of where we are
unless were lost and so I started at

3478
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:03,849
unless were lost and so I started at
 

3479
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:04,979
unless were lost and so I started at
night when I got up to go to the

3480
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:04,989
night when I got up to go to the
 

3481
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,870
night when I got up to go to the
bathroom I would start trying to do a

3482
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
bathroom I would start trying to do a
 

3483
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,069
bathroom I would start trying to do a
complete with my eyes closed all the

3484
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:08,079
complete with my eyes closed all the
 

3485
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,749
complete with my eyes closed all the
time and I would test my sense of pretty

3486
01:03:09,749 --> 01:03:09,759
time and I would test my sense of pretty
 

3487
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:11,849
time and I would test my sense of pretty
cells I would I would walk you know five

3488
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:11,859
cells I would I would walk you know five
 

3489
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:13,829
cells I would I would walk you know five
feet and say okay I think I'm here am I

3490
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
feet and say okay I think I'm here am I
 

3491
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,689
feet and say okay I think I'm here am I
really what's my error yeah and then I

3492
01:03:15,689 --> 01:03:15,699
really what's my error yeah and then I
 

3493
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:16,920
really what's my error yeah and then I
would count in my error again and see

3494
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:16,930
would count in my error again and see
 

3495
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,449
would count in my error again and see
how the errors accumulate so even

3496
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:18,459
how the errors accumulate so even
 

3497
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:19,499
how the errors accumulate so even
something as simple as getting up in the

3498
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:19,509
something as simple as getting up in the
 

3499
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:20,999
something as simple as getting up in the
middle light or the bathroom I'm testing

3500
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:21,009
middle light or the bathroom I'm testing
 

3501
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,249
middle light or the bathroom I'm testing
these theories out it's kind of fun I

3502
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:23,259
these theories out it's kind of fun I
 

3503
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:24,630
these theories out it's kind of fun I
mean the coffee cup is an example of

3504
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
mean the coffee cup is an example of
 

3505
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,229
mean the coffee cup is an example of
that too so I think I find that these

3506
01:03:28,229 --> 01:03:28,239
that too so I think I find that these
 

3507
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,420
that too so I think I find that these
sort of everyday introspections are

3508
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:30,430
sort of everyday introspections are
 

3509
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,449
sort of everyday introspections are
actually quite helpful it doesn't mean

3510
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:33,459
actually quite helpful it doesn't mean
 

3511
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:35,309
actually quite helpful it doesn't mean
you can ignore the science I mean I

3512
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:35,319
you can ignore the science I mean I
 

3513
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:37,289
you can ignore the science I mean I
spend hours every day reading

3514
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:37,299
spend hours every day reading
 

3515
01:03:37,299 --> 01:03:40,529
spend hours every day reading
ridiculously complex papers that's not

3516
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:40,539
ridiculously complex papers that's not
 

3517
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:42,509
ridiculously complex papers that's not
nearly as much fun but you have to sort

3518
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:42,519
nearly as much fun but you have to sort
 

3519
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,819
nearly as much fun but you have to sort
of build up those constraints and the

3520
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:44,829
of build up those constraints and the
 

3521
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:46,199
of build up those constraints and the
knowledge about the field and who's

3522
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:46,209
knowledge about the field and who's
 

3523
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:47,939
knowledge about the field and who's
doing what and what exactly they think

3524
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:47,949
doing what and what exactly they think
 

3525
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,650
doing what and what exactly they think
is cooperating here and then you can sit

3526
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:49,660
is cooperating here and then you can sit
 

3527
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,449
is cooperating here and then you can sit
back and say okay let's try to piece

3528
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:51,459
back and say okay let's try to piece
 

3529
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:53,969
back and say okay let's try to piece
this all together let's come up with

3530
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:53,979
this all together let's come up with
 

3531
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:56,459
this all together let's come up with
some you know I I'm right in this group

3532
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:56,469
some you know I I'm right in this group
 

3533
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,559
some you know I I'm right in this group
here people they know they just I do

3534
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:58,569
here people they know they just I do
 

3535
01:03:58,569 --> 01:03:59,849
here people they know they just I do
this all this time I come in with these

3536
01:03:59,849 --> 01:03:59,859
this all this time I come in with these
 

3537
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:01,589
this all this time I come in with these
introspective ideas and say well do you

3538
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:01,599
introspective ideas and say well do you
 

3539
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:02,880
introspective ideas and say well do you
ever thought about this now watch well

3540
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:02,890
ever thought about this now watch well
 

3541
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:05,279
ever thought about this now watch well
this all do this together and it's

3542
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:05,289
this all do this together and it's
 

3543
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:09,269
this all do this together and it's
helpful it's not if as long as you don't

3544
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:09,279
helpful it's not if as long as you don't
 

3545
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,890
helpful it's not if as long as you don't
be all you did was that then you're just

3546
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:10,900
be all you did was that then you're just
 

3547
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,630
be all you did was that then you're just
making up stuff right but if you're

3548
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,640
making up stuff right but if you're
 

3549
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,910
making up stuff right but if you're
constraining it by the reality of the

3550
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:14,920
constraining it by the reality of the
 

3551
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,910
constraining it by the reality of the
neuroscience then it's really helpful so

3552
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
neuroscience then it's really helpful so
 

3553
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,650
neuroscience then it's really helpful so
let's talk a little bit about deep

3554
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:19,660
let's talk a little bit about deep
 

3555
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:23,549
let's talk a little bit about deep
learning and the successes in the apply

3556
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:23,559
learning and the successes in the apply
 

3557
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,359
learning and the successes in the apply
space of neural networks the ideas of

3558
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:27,369
space of neural networks the ideas of

so where do you think are the

3572
01:04:46,499 --> 01:04:46,509
so where do you think are the
 

3573
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:48,660
so where do you think are the
limitations of those approaches what do

3574
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:48,670
limitations of those approaches what do
 

3575
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:51,359
limitations of those approaches what do
you think our strengths relative to your

3576
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:51,369
you think our strengths relative to your
 

3577
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:54,059
you think our strengths relative to your
major efforts of constructing a theory

3578
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:54,069
major efforts of constructing a theory
 

3579
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:56,040
major efforts of constructing a theory
of human intelligence yeah

3580
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,050
of human intelligence yeah
 

3581
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,870
of human intelligence yeah
well I'm not an expert in this field I'm

3582
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:57,880
well I'm not an expert in this field I'm
 

3583
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,030
well I'm not an expert in this field I'm
somewhat knowledgeable so odd but I love

3584
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:00,040
somewhat knowledgeable so odd but I love
 

3585
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,860

it is in just your intuition what are

3586
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:01,870
it is in just your intuition what are
 

3587
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,270
it is in just your intuition what are
you well I have I have a little bit more

3588
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280
you well I have I have a little bit more
 

3589
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,890
you well I have I have a little bit more
than intuition but you're going to say

3590
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:04,900
than intuition but you're going to say
 

3591
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,380
than intuition but you're going to say
like you know one of the things that you

3592
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:07,390
like you know one of the things that you
 

3593
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:08,640
like you know one of the things that you
asked me do I spend all my time thing

3594
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:08,650
asked me do I spend all my time thing
 

3595
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,170
asked me do I spend all my time thing
about neurons I do that's to the

3596
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:10,180
about neurons I do that's to the
 

3597
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,370
about neurons I do that's to the
exclusion of thinking about things like

3598
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:11,380
exclusion of thinking about things like
 

3599
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,800
exclusion of thinking about things like
convolutional neural networks in you but

3600
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:13,810
convolutional neural networks in you but
 

3601
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,930
convolutional neural networks in you but
I try to stay current so look I think

3602
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:15,940
I try to stay current so look I think
 

3603
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,460
I try to stay current so look I think
it's great the progress they've made

3604
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:17,470
it's great the progress they've made
 

3605
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,650
it's great the progress they've made
it's fantastic and as I mentioned

3606
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:19,660
it's fantastic and as I mentioned
 

3607
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,970
it's fantastic and as I mentioned
earlier it's very highly useful for many

3608
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:20,980
earlier it's very highly useful for many
 

3609
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,870
earlier it's very highly useful for many
things the models that we have today are

3610
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:24,880
things the models that we have today are
 

3611
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,030
things the models that we have today are
actually derived from a lot of

3612
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,040
actually derived from a lot of
 

3613
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,500
actually derived from a lot of
neuroscience principles there are

3614
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:28,510
neuroscience principles there are
 

3615
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,120
neuroscience principles there are
distributed processing systems and

3616
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,130
distributed processing systems and
 

3617
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,440
distributed processing systems and
distributed memory systems and that's

3618
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:31,450
distributed memory systems and that's
 

3619
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,050
distributed memory systems and that's
how the brain works they use things that

3620
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:34,060
how the brain works they use things that
 

3621
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,000
how the brain works they use things that
we we might call them neurons but

3622
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,010
we we might call them neurons but
 

3623
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,320
we we might call them neurons but
they're really not neurons at all so we

3624
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,330
they're really not neurons at all so we
 

3625
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,260
they're really not neurons at all so we
can just they're not really in terrassa

3626
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:39,270
can just they're not really in terrassa
 

3627
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:43,560
can just they're not really in terrassa
distributed processing systems and and

3628
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:43,570
distributed processing systems and and
 

3629
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,330
distributed processing systems and and
that nature of hierarchy that came also

3630
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:45,340
that nature of hierarchy that came also
 

3631
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,640
that nature of hierarchy that came also
from neuroscience and so there's a lot

3632
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:47,650
from neuroscience and so there's a lot
 

3633
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,810
from neuroscience and so there's a lot
of things that the learning rules

3634
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:48,820
of things that the learning rules
 

3635
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,970
of things that the learning rules
basically not backprop but other you

3636
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:50,980
basically not backprop but other you
 

3637
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,320
basically not backprop but other you
know so have you int I don't know I'd be

3638
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,330
know so have you int I don't know I'd be
 

3639
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,390
know so have you int I don't know I'd be
curious to say they're not in your ons

3640
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
curious to say they're not in your ons
 

3641
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,370
curious to say they're not in your ons
at all he described in which way I mean

3642
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:56,380
at all he described in which way I mean
 

3643
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,020
at all he described in which way I mean
it's some of it is obvious but I'd be

3644
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:58,030
it's some of it is obvious but I'd be
 

3645
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,820
it's some of it is obvious but I'd be
curious if if you have specific ways

3646
01:05:59,820 --> 01:05:59,830
curious if if you have specific ways
 

3647
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,220
curious if if you have specific ways
yeah which you think are the biggest

3648
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,230
yeah which you think are the biggest
 

3649
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,410
yeah which you think are the biggest
difference yeah we had a paper in 2016

3650
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:04,420
difference yeah we had a paper in 2016
 

3651
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,940
difference yeah we had a paper in 2016
called why neurons of thousands of

3652
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:05,950
called why neurons of thousands of
 

3653
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,150
called why neurons of thousands of
synapses and it and if you read that

3654
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:09,160
synapses and it and if you read that
 

3655
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,380
synapses and it and if you read that
paper you don't know what I'm talking

3656
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:10,390
paper you don't know what I'm talking
 

3657
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,750
paper you don't know what I'm talking
about here a real neuron in the brain is

3658
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:12,760
about here a real neuron in the brain is
 

3659
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,230
about here a real neuron in the brain is
a complex thing it let's just start with

3660
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
a complex thing it let's just start with
 

3661
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,030
a complex thing it let's just start with
the synapses on it which is a connection

3662
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:18,040
the synapses on it which is a connection
 

3663
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,190
the synapses on it which is a connection
between neurons real neurons can

3664
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:20,200
between neurons real neurons can
 

3665
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,500
between neurons real neurons can
everywhere from five to thirty thousand

3666
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:22,510
everywhere from five to thirty thousand
 

3667
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:27,060
everywhere from five to thirty thousand
synapses on the ones near the cell body

3668
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,070
synapses on the ones near the cell body
 

3669
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,950
synapses on the ones near the cell body
the ones are too close to the the soma

3670
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:28,960
the ones are too close to the the soma
 

3671
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,230
the ones are too close to the the soma
of the cell body those are like the ones

3672
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:31,240
of the cell body those are like the ones
 

3673
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,120
of the cell body those are like the ones
who people model in artificial neurons

3674
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:33,130
who people model in artificial neurons
 

3675
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,250
who people model in artificial neurons
there is a few hundred of those maybe

3676
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:35,260
there is a few hundred of those maybe
 

3677
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,440
there is a few hundred of those maybe
they can affect the cell they can make

3678
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:37,450
they can affect the cell they can make
 

3679
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:40,470
they can affect the cell they can make
the cell become active ninety-five

3680
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480
the cell become active ninety-five
 

3681
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,750
the cell become active ninety-five
percent of the synapses can't do that

3682
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:42,760
percent of the synapses can't do that
 

3683
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,910
percent of the synapses can't do that
they're too far away so if you're

3684
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:44,920
they're too far away so if you're
 

3685
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,110
they're too far away so if you're
actually at one of those synapses it

3686
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:46,120
actually at one of those synapses it
 

3687
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,850
actually at one of those synapses it
just doesn't affect the cell body enough

3688
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:47,860
just doesn't affect the cell body enough
 

3689
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,530
just doesn't affect the cell body enough
to make any difference any one of them

3690
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:49,540
to make any difference any one of them
 

3691
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,450
to make any difference any one of them
individually anyone emanuelly or even if

3692
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:51,460
individually anyone emanuelly or even if
 

3693
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,540
individually anyone emanuelly or even if
you do what mass of them what what we

3694
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:54,550
you do what mass of them what what we
 

3695
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,160
you do what mass of them what what we
but what real neurons do is the

3696
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:56,170
but what real neurons do is the
 

3697
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,250
but what real neurons do is the
following if you activate or they you

3698
01:06:59,250 --> 01:06:59,260
following if you activate or they you
 

3699
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:04,050
following if you activate or they you
get 10 to 20 of them active at the same

3700
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:04,060
get 10 to 20 of them active at the same
 

3701
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,460
get 10 to 20 of them active at the same
time meaning they're all receiving an

3702
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:05,470
time meaning they're all receiving an
 

3703
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,440
time meaning they're all receiving an
input at the same time and those 10 to

3704
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:07,450
input at the same time and those 10 to
 

3705
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,480
input at the same time and those 10 to
20 synapses are forty sensors within a

3706
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:09,490
20 synapses are forty sensors within a
 

3707
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,400
20 synapses are forty sensors within a
very short distance on the dendrite like

3708
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:11,410
very short distance on the dendrite like
 

3709
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,530
very short distance on the dendrite like
40 microns a very small area so if you

3710
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:13,540
40 microns a very small area so if you
 

3711
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,120
40 microns a very small area so if you
activate a bunch of these right next to

3712
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:15,130
activate a bunch of these right next to
 

3713
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,670
activate a bunch of these right next to
each other at some distant place what

3714
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
each other at some distant place what
 

3715
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,710
each other at some distant place what
happens is it creates what's called the

3716
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:19,720
happens is it creates what's called the
 

3717
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,080
happens is it creates what's called the
dendritic spike and then juridic spike

3718
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,090
dendritic spike and then juridic spike
 

3719
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,020
dendritic spike and then juridic spike
travels through the dendrites and can

3720
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,030
travels through the dendrites and can
 

3721
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,680
travels through the dendrites and can
reach the soma or the cell body now when

3722
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:28,690
reach the soma or the cell body now when
 

3723
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,450
reach the soma or the cell body now when
it gets there it changes the voltage

3724
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:30,460
it gets there it changes the voltage
 

3725
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,850
it gets there it changes the voltage
which is sort of like gonna make the

3726
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:32,860
which is sort of like gonna make the
 

3727
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,830
which is sort of like gonna make the
cell fire but never enough to make the

3728
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:34,840
cell fire but never enough to make the
 

3729
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,960
cell fire but never enough to make the
cell fire it's sort of what we call it

3730
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:36,970
cell fire it's sort of what we call it
 

3731
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,670
cell fire it's sort of what we call it
says we depolarize the cell you raise

3732
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:38,680
says we depolarize the cell you raise
 

3733
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,810
says we depolarize the cell you raise
the voltage a little bit but not enough

3734
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:39,820
the voltage a little bit but not enough
 

3735
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,270
the voltage a little bit but not enough
to do anything it's like well good is

3736
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:42,280
to do anything it's like well good is
 

3737
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,170
to do anything it's like well good is
that and then it goes back down again so

3738
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:45,180
that and then it goes back down again so
 

3739
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:48,420
that and then it goes back down again so
we proposed a theory which I'm very

3740
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:48,430
we proposed a theory which I'm very
 

3741
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,690
we proposed a theory which I'm very
confident in basics are is that what's

3742
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:51,700
confident in basics are is that what's
 

3743
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,490
confident in basics are is that what's
happening there is those ninety-five

3744
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:53,500
happening there is those ninety-five
 

3745
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,750
happening there is those ninety-five
percent of those synapses are

3746
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:54,760
percent of those synapses are
 

3747
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,330
percent of those synapses are
recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique

3748
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:57,340
recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique
 

3749
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,190
recognizing dozens to hundreds of unique
patterns they can write you know about

3750
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
patterns they can write you know about
 

3751
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,670
patterns they can write you know about
the 1020 nerve synapses at a time and

3752
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680
the 1020 nerve synapses at a time and
 

3753
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,680
the 1020 nerve synapses at a time and
they're acting like predictions so the

3754
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:04,690
they're acting like predictions so the
 

3755
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,420
they're acting like predictions so the
neuron actually is a predictive engine

3756
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:06,430
neuron actually is a predictive engine
 

3757
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,270
neuron actually is a predictive engine
on its own it it can fire when it gets

3758
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
on its own it it can fire when it gets
 

3759
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,620
on its own it it can fire when it gets
enough what they call approximately

3760
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:10,630
enough what they call approximately
 

3761
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,850
enough what they call approximately
input from those ones near the cell fire

3762
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:11,860
input from those ones near the cell fire
 

3763
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,849
input from those ones near the cell fire
but it can get ready to fire from dozens

3764
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:14,859
but it can get ready to fire from dozens
 

3765
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:16,050
but it can get ready to fire from dozens
to hundreds of patterns that it

3766
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:16,060
to hundreds of patterns that it
 

3767
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,230
to hundreds of patterns that it
recognizes from the other guys and the

3768
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:19,240
recognizes from the other guys and the
 

3769
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,450
recognizes from the other guys and the
advantage of this to the neuron is that

3770
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:21,460
advantage of this to the neuron is that
 

3771
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,519
advantage of this to the neuron is that
when it actually does produce a spike in

3772
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:23,529
when it actually does produce a spike in
 

3773
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,800
when it actually does produce a spike in
action potential it does so slightly

3774
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:25,810
action potential it does so slightly
 

3775
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,390
action potential it does so slightly
sooner than it would have otherwise and

3776
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:27,400
sooner than it would have otherwise and
 

3777
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,820
sooner than it would have otherwise and
so what could is slightly sooner well

3778
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:29,830
so what could is slightly sooner well
 

3779
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,980
so what could is slightly sooner well
the slightly sooner part is it there's

3780
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:31,990
the slightly sooner part is it there's
 

3781
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,630
the slightly sooner part is it there's
it all the neurons in the the excitatory

3782
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:33,640
it all the neurons in the the excitatory
 

3783
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,550
it all the neurons in the the excitatory
neurons in the brain are surrounded by

neurons in the brain are surrounded by
 

3785
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,870
neurons in the brain are surrounded by
these inhibitory neurons and they're

3786
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
these inhibitory neurons and they're
 

3787
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,550
these inhibitory neurons and they're
very fast the inhibitory neurons

3788

very fast the inhibitory neurons
 

3789
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,240
very fast the inhibitory neurons
it's basket cells and if I get my spike

01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,250
it's basket cells and if I get my spike
 

3791

3797
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,160

is a different representation you end up
 

3799
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,510
is a different representation you end up
with a reputation that matches your

prediction it's a it's a sparsa

3802
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,170

representation meaning as fewest known

3804
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:54,790
representation meaning as fewest known
 

3805
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,220
representation meaning as fewest known
or interactive but it's much more

3806
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:56,230
or interactive but it's much more
 

3807
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,550
or interactive but it's much more
specific and so we showed how networks

3808
01:08:59,550 --> 01:08:59,560
specific and so we showed how networks
 

3809
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,780
specific and so we showed how networks
of these neurons can do very

3810
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:00,790
of these neurons can do very
 

3811
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,849
of these neurons can do very
sophisticated temporal prediction

3812
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:02,859
sophisticated temporal prediction
 

3813
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:07,170
sophisticated temporal prediction
basically so so this summarize this real

01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,180
basically so so this summarize this real
 

3815
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,240
basically so so this summarize this real
neurons in the brain are time-based

3816
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:09,250
neurons in the brain are time-based
 

3817
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,300
neurons in the brain are time-based
prediction engines and and they and

01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:19,480
don't think you can mail the brain

don't think you can mail the brain
without them I don't even build

it's its theme it's where large part of

3830
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:24,099
it's its theme it's where large part of
 

3831
01:09:24,099 --> 01:09:26,160
it's its theme it's where large part of
the time comes from it's it's these are

3832
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:26,170
the time comes from it's it's these are
 

3833
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,439
the time comes from it's it's these are
predictive models and the time is in is

3834
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:28,449
predictive models and the time is in is
 

3835
01:09:28,449 --> 01:09:30,629
predictive models and the time is in is
there's a prior and I'm in a you know a

3836
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:30,639
there's a prior and I'm in a you know a
 

3837
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:32,729
there's a prior and I'm in a you know a
prediction and an action and it's

3838
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:32,739
prediction and an action and it's
 

3839
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:34,229
prediction and an action and it's
inherent to every neuron the neocortex

3840
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,239
inherent to every neuron the neocortex
 

3841
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:37,140
inherent to every neuron the neocortex
so so I would say that point neurons

3842
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:37,150
so so I would say that point neurons
 

3843
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:39,329
so so I would say that point neurons
sort of model a piece of that and not

3844
01:09:39,329 --> 01:09:39,339
sort of model a piece of that and not
 

3845
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:41,129
sort of model a piece of that and not
very well with that either but you know

3846
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:41,139
very well with that either but you know
 

3847
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:44,609
very well with that either but you know
like for example synapses are very

3848
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:44,619
like for example synapses are very
 

3849
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:48,329
like for example synapses are very
unreliable and you cannot assign any

3850
01:09:48,329 --> 01:09:48,339
unreliable and you cannot assign any
 

3851
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:50,910
unreliable and you cannot assign any
precision to them so even one digital

3852
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:50,920
precision to them so even one digital
 

3853
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,069
precision to them so even one digital
position is not possible so the way real

3854
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:53,079
position is not possible so the way real
 

3855
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,379
position is not possible so the way real
neurons work is they don't add these

3856
01:09:55,379 --> 01:09:55,389
neurons work is they don't add these
 

3857
01:09:55,389 --> 01:09:56,609
neurons work is they don't add these
they don't change these weights

3858
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:56,619
they don't change these weights
 

3859
01:09:56,619 --> 01:09:58,259
they don't change these weights
accurately like artificial neural

3860
01:09:58,259 --> 01:09:58,269
accurately like artificial neural
 

3861
01:09:58,269 --> 01:10:00,390
accurately like artificial neural
networks do they basically form new

3862
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
networks do they basically form new
 

3863
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,100
networks do they basically form new
synapses and so what you're trying to

3864
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,110
synapses and so what you're trying to
 

3865
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,739
synapses and so what you're trying to
always do is is detect the presence of

3866
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:04,749
always do is is detect the presence of
 

3867
01:10:04,749 --> 01:10:07,859
always do is is detect the presence of
some 10 to 20 active synapses at the

3868
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:07,869
some 10 to 20 active synapses at the
 

3869
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:10,379
some 10 to 20 active synapses at the
same time as opposed and they're almost

3870
01:10:10,379 --> 01:10:10,389
same time as opposed and they're almost
 

3871
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:12,239
same time as opposed and they're almost
binary it's like because you can't

3872
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:12,249
binary it's like because you can't
 

3873
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,649
binary it's like because you can't
really represent anything much finer

3874
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:13,659
really represent anything much finer
 

3875
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:15,569
really represent anything much finer
than that so these are the kind of

3876
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:15,579
than that so these are the kind of
 

3877
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:16,950
than that so these are the kind of
dishes and I think that's actually

3878
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
dishes and I think that's actually
 

3879
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,870
dishes and I think that's actually
another essential component because the

3880
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
another essential component because the
 

3881
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,720
another essential component because the
brain works on sparse patterns and all

3882
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:21,730
brain works on sparse patterns and all
 

3883
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,430
brain works on sparse patterns and all
about all that mechanism is based on

3884
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,440
about all that mechanism is based on
 

3885
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,779
about all that mechanism is based on
sparse patterns and I don't actually

3886
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:24,789
sparse patterns and I don't actually
 

3887
01:10:24,789 --> 01:10:27,020
sparse patterns and I don't actually
think you could build our real brains or

3888
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:27,030
think you could build our real brains or
 

3889
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,669
think you could build our real brains or
machine and tell us about incorporating

3890
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:29,679
machine and tell us about incorporating
 

3891
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,410
machine and tell us about incorporating
some of those ideas it's hard to even

3892
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:31,420
some of those ideas it's hard to even
 

3893
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,149
some of those ideas it's hard to even
think about the complex that emerges

3894
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:33,159
think about the complex that emerges
 

3895
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,339
think about the complex that emerges
from the fact that the timing of the

from the fact that the timing of the
 

3897

firing matters in the brain the fact
 

3899
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:41,430
firing matters in the brain the fact
that you form new new synapses and and

that you form new new synapses and and
 

3901
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,859
that you form new new synapses and and

so we can't what we can do is we can

3952
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:39,460
so we can't what we can do is we can
 

3953
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,110
so we can't what we can do is we can

mathematically some of these concepts

3964
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:53,800
mathematically some of these concepts
 

3965
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,520
mathematically some of these concepts
about the show why the brain is so

3966
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:56,530
about the show why the brain is so
 

3967
01:11:56,530 --> 01:12:00,480
about the show why the brain is so
robust to noise and error and fallout

3968
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:00,490
robust to noise and error and fallout
 

3969
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,530
robust to noise and error and fallout
and so on we can show that

3970
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:01,540
and so on we can show that
 

3971
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,210
and so on we can show that
mathematically as well as empirically in

3972
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:03,220
mathematically as well as empirically in
 

3973
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,300
mathematically as well as empirically in
simulations but the system can't be

3974
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:06,310

3975
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:09,090
simulations but the system can't be
analyzed completely any complex system

3976
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:09,100
analyzed completely any complex system
 

3977
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,150
analyzed completely any complex system
can and so that's out of the realm but

3978
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:12,160
can and so that's out of the realm but
 

3979
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:16,860
can and so that's out of the realm but
there is there are mathematical benefits

3980
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:16,870
there is there are mathematical benefits
 

3981
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,450
there is there are mathematical benefits
and intuitions that can be derived from

3982
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:18,460
and intuitions that can be derived from
 

3983
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,430
and intuitions that can be derived from
mathematics and we try to do that as

3984
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:20,440
mathematics and we try to do that as
 

3985
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,810
mathematics and we try to do that as
well most most of our papers have the

3986
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:21,820
well most most of our papers have the
 

3987
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,790
well most most of our papers have the
section about that so I think it's

3988
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:23,800
section about that so I think it's
 

3989
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,160
section about that so I think it's
refreshing and useful for me to be

3990
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:26,170
refreshing and useful for me to be
 

3991
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,630
refreshing and useful for me to be
talking to you about deep neural

3992
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:27,640
talking to you about deep neural
 

3993
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,120
talking to you about deep neural
networks because your intuition

3994
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,130
networks because your intuition
 

3995
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:32,940
networks because your intuition
basically says that we can't achieve

3996
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:32,950
basically says that we can't achieve
 

3997
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,680
basically says that we can't achieve
anything like intelligence with

4003
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,250
their current form 9/2 can do it in the
ultimate form sure so let me dig into it

4004
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:41,260
ultimate form sure so let me dig into it
 

4005
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,900
ultimate form sure so let me dig into it
and see what your thoughts are they're a

you think that is a criticism or is he
saying this is the prescription of what

saying this is the prescription of what
 

4065
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,080
saying this is the prescription of what
we ought to be doing well it's very

01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,460
difficult he's saying this is what has
worked and yes a prescription with the

worked and yes a prescription with the
 

4071
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:00,870

difficult prescription because it says

only going to be short-term gains so
 

4081
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:13,230
only going to be short-term gains so
this all leads up to a question I guess

4082
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:13,240
this all leads up to a question I guess
 

4083
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,930
this all leads up to a question I guess
on artificial neural networks and maybe

4084
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:15,940
on artificial neural networks and maybe
 

4085
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,610
on artificial neural networks and maybe
our own biological neural networks is

4086
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:19,620
our own biological neural networks is
 

4087
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,260

you think if we just scale things up

4088
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:22,270
you think if we just scale things up
 

4089
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,750
you think if we just scale things up
significantly so take these dumb

4090
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:24,760
significantly so take these dumb
 

4091
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,290
significantly so take these dumb
artificial neurons the point here as I

4092
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:28,300
artificial neurons the point here as I

like that term if we just have a lot

4094
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:31,780
like that term if we just have a lot
 

4095
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,080
like that term if we just have a lot
more of them do you think some of the

4096
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,090
more of them do you think some of the
 

4097
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,840
more of them do you think some of the
elements that we see in the brain may

4098
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:36,850
elements that we see in the brain may
 

4099
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,690
elements that we see in the brain may
start emerging no I don't think so we

4100
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:39,700
start emerging no I don't think so we
 

4101
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,110
start emerging no I don't think so we
can do bigger problems and of the same

4102
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
can do bigger problems and of the same
 

4103
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,760
can do bigger problems and of the same
type I mean it's been pointed out by

01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:44,770
type I mean it's been pointed out by
 

4105
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,320

01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:46,330
many people that today's convolutional
 

4107
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,550

no and that works aren't really much

4108
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:47,560
no and that works aren't really much
 

4109
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,020
no and that works aren't really much
different than the ones we had quite a

4110
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,030
different than the ones we had quite a
 

4111
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,060
different than the ones we had quite a
while ago we just they're bigger and

4112
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,070
while ago we just they're bigger and
 

4113
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,160
while ago we just they're bigger and
train more and we have more label data

4114
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:53,170
train more and we have more label data
 

4115
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:57,840
train more and we have more label data
and so on but I don't think you can get

4116
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:57,850
and so on but I don't think you can get
 

4117
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,300
and so on but I don't think you can get
to the kind of things I know the brain

4118
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:00,310
to the kind of things I know the brain
 

4119
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,500
to the kind of things I know the brain
can do and that we think about as

4120
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:01,510
can do and that we think about as
 

4121
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,200
can do and that we think about as
intelligence by just scaling it up so I

4122
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:04,210

01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,630

that maybe it's a good description of

01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
that maybe it's a good description of
 

4125
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,830
that maybe it's a good description of
what's happened in the past what's

of artificial neural networks it may be

a good prescription for what's going to

4132
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,130
a good prescription for what's going to
 

4133
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,300
a good prescription for what's going to
happen in the short term but I don't

4134
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:18,310
happen in the short term but I don't
 

4135
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,650
happen in the short term but I don't
think that's the path I've said that

4136
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:19,660
think that's the path I've said that
 

4137
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,720
think that's the path I've said that
earlier there's an alternate path I

should mention to you by the way that

4140
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:23,220
should mention to you by the way that
 

4141
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,040
should mention to you by the way that
we've made sufficient progress on our

we've made sufficient progress on our
the whole cortical theory in the last

the whole cortical theory in the last
 

4145
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,920
the whole cortical theory in the last
few years that last year we decided to

4146
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:30,930
few years that last year we decided to
 

4147
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:36,240
few years that last year we decided to
start actively pursuing how do we get

4148
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,250
start actively pursuing how do we get
 

4149
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,100
start actively pursuing how do we get
these ideas embedded into machine

4150
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,110
these ideas embedded into machine
 

4151
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,160
these ideas embedded into machine
learning well that's it again being led

4152
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,170
learning well that's it again being led
 

4153
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,420
learning well that's it again being led
by my colleague just super talked him on

4154
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:42,430
by my colleague just super talked him on
 

4155
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:45,090
by my colleague just super talked him on
and he's more of a machine learning guy

4156
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:45,100
and he's more of a machine learning guy
 

4157
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,780
and he's more of a machine learning guy
am more of a neuroscience guy so this is

4158
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:48,790
am more of a neuroscience guy so this is
 

4159
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,120
am more of a neuroscience guy so this is
now our new is I wouldn't say our focus

4160
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:51,130
now our new is I wouldn't say our focus
 

4161
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,140
now our new is I wouldn't say our focus
but it is now an equal focus

4162
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:53,150
but it is now an equal focus
 

4163
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:56,560
but it is now an equal focus
here because we we need to proselytize

4164
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:56,570
here because we we need to proselytize
 

4165
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:59,020
here because we we need to proselytize
what we've learned and we need to show

4166
01:15:59,020 --> 01:15:59,030
what we've learned and we need to show
 

4167
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:03,399
what we've learned and we need to show
how it's beneficial to - to the Machine

4168
01:16:03,399 --> 01:16:03,409
how it's beneficial to - to the Machine
 

4169
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:04,660
how it's beneficial to - to the Machine
were earlier so we're putting we have a

4170
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:04,670
were earlier so we're putting we have a
 

4171
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,010
were earlier so we're putting we have a
plan in place right now in fact we just

4172
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:06,020
plan in place right now in fact we just
 

4173
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,050
plan in place right now in fact we just
did our first paper on this I can tell

4174
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:08,060
did our first paper on this I can tell
 

4175
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,510
did our first paper on this I can tell
you about that but you know one of the

4176
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:10,520
you about that but you know one of the
 

4177
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,709
you about that but you know one of the
reasons I want to talk to you is because

4178
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:11,719
reasons I want to talk to you is because
 

4179
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:14,260
reasons I want to talk to you is because
I'm trying to get more people in the

4180
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:14,270
I'm trying to get more people in the
 

4181
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,910
I'm trying to get more people in the
machine learning the community say I

4182
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
machine learning the community say I
 

4183
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,770
machine learning the community say I
need to learn about this stuff and maybe

4184
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:17,780
need to learn about this stuff and maybe
 

4185
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,939
need to learn about this stuff and maybe
we should just think about this a bit

4186
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:18,949
we should just think about this a bit
 

4187
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,470
we should just think about this a bit
more about what we've learned about the

4188
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
more about what we've learned about the
 

4189
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,600
more about what we've learned about the
brain and what are those team Aetna

4190
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:22,610
brain and what are those team Aetna
 

4191
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,070
brain and what are those team Aetna
meant - what have they done is that

4192
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
meant - what have they done is that
 

4193
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,870
meant - what have they done is that
useful for us yeah yeah so there is

4194
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:25,880
useful for us yeah yeah so there is
 

4195
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,240
useful for us yeah yeah so there is
there elements of all the the cortical

4196
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,250
there elements of all the the cortical
 

4197
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,560
there elements of all the the cortical
Theory the things we've been talking

4198
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:29,570
Theory the things we've been talking
 

4199
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:31,660
Theory the things we've been talking
about that may be useful in the short

4200
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:31,670
about that may be useful in the short
 

4201
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,729
about that may be useful in the short
term yes in the short term yes this is

4202
01:16:33,729 --> 01:16:33,739
term yes in the short term yes this is
 

4203
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:36,100
term yes in the short term yes this is
the sorry to interrupt the the open

4204
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,110
the sorry to interrupt the the open
 

4205
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:38,200
the sorry to interrupt the the open
question is it it there it certainly

4206
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:38,210
question is it it there it certainly
 

4207
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,700
question is it it there it certainly
feels from my perspective that in the

4208
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:39,710
feels from my perspective that in the
 

4209
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,189
feels from my perspective that in the
long term some of the ideas we've been

4210
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:42,199
long term some of the ideas we've been
 

4211
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:43,630
long term some of the ideas we've been
talking about will be extremely useful

4212
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:43,640
talking about will be extremely useful
 

4213
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,640
talking about will be extremely useful
yeah question is whether in the short

4214
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:45,650
yeah question is whether in the short
 

4215
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,770
yeah question is whether in the short
term well this is a always that what we

4216
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:47,780
term well this is a always that what we
 

4217
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,229
term well this is a always that what we
I would call the entrepreneurs dilemma

4218
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
I would call the entrepreneurs dilemma
 

4219
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,600
I would call the entrepreneurs dilemma
so you have this long term vision oh

4220
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:52,610
so you have this long term vision oh
 

4221
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:55,090
so you have this long term vision oh
we're gonna all be driving electric cars

4222
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:55,100
we're gonna all be driving electric cars
 

4223
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,050
we're gonna all be driving electric cars
or all kind of computers or or whatever

4224
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,060
or all kind of computers or or whatever
 

4225
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,209
or all kind of computers or or whatever
and and you're at some point in time and

4226
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:01,219
and and you're at some point in time and
 

4227
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:02,979
and and you're at some point in time and
you say I can see that long-term vision

4228
01:17:02,979 --> 01:17:02,989
you say I can see that long-term vision
 

4229
01:17:02,989 --> 01:17:04,120
you say I can see that long-term vision
I'm sure it's gonna happen how do I get

4230
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:04,130
I'm sure it's gonna happen how do I get
 

4231
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,770
I'm sure it's gonna happen how do I get
there without killing myself you know

4232
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:05,780
there without killing myself you know
 

4233
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,790
there without killing myself you know
without going out of business right

4234
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
without going out of business right
 

4235
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,340
without going out of business right
that's the challenge that's the dilemma

4236
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:09,350
that's the challenge that's the dilemma
 

4237
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,290
that's the challenge that's the dilemma
it's a really difficult thing to do so

4238
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:11,300
it's a really difficult thing to do so
 

4239
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,959
it's a really difficult thing to do so
we're facing that right now so ideally

4240
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:13,969
we're facing that right now so ideally
 

4241
01:17:13,969 --> 01:17:15,399
we're facing that right now so ideally
what you'd want to do is find some steps

4242
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:15,409
what you'd want to do is find some steps
 

4243
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:16,780
what you'd want to do is find some steps
along the way you can get there

4244
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:16,790
along the way you can get there
 

4245
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:18,729
along the way you can get there
incremental you don't have to like throw

4246
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:18,739
incremental you don't have to like throw
 

4247
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,560
incremental you don't have to like throw
it all out and start over again the

4248
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:20,570
it all out and start over again the
 

4249
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,110
it all out and start over again the
first thing that we've done is we focus

4250
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
first thing that we've done is we focus
 

4251
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,439
first thing that we've done is we focus
on the sparse representations so I just

4252
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:26,449
on the sparse representations so I just
 

4253
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:28,090
on the sparse representations so I just
just in case you don't know what that

4254
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:28,100
just in case you don't know what that
 

4255
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,200
just in case you don't know what that
means or some of the listeners don't

4256
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:29,210
means or some of the listeners don't
 

4257
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,140
means or some of the listeners don't
know what that means in the brain if I

4258
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:32,150
know what that means in the brain if I
 

4259
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,479
know what that means in the brain if I
have like 10,000 neurons what you would

4260
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:34,489
have like 10,000 neurons what you would
 

4261
01:17:34,489 --> 01:17:36,610
have like 10,000 neurons what you would
see is maybe 2% of them active at a time

4262
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:36,620
see is maybe 2% of them active at a time
 

4263
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:38,860
see is maybe 2% of them active at a time
you don't see 50 percent you know 3 30

4264
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:38,870
you don't see 50 percent you know 3 30
 

4265
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:41,560
you don't see 50 percent you know 3 30
percent you might see 2 percent and it's

4266
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:41,570
percent you might see 2 percent and it's
 

4267
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,930
percent you might see 2 percent and it's
always like that for any set of sensory

4268
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:43,940
always like that for any set of sensory
 

4269
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,490
always like that for any set of sensory
input it doesn't matter anything just

4270
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:45,500
input it doesn't matter anything just
 

4271
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,880
input it doesn't matter anything just
about any part of the brain but which

4272
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:48,890
about any part of the brain but which
 

4273
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:52,209
about any part of the brain but which
neurons differs which neurons are active

4274
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:52,219
neurons differs which neurons are active
 

4275
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:55,479
neurons differs which neurons are active
yes I take 10,000 neurons that are

4276
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:55,489
yes I take 10,000 neurons that are
 

4277
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:56,709
yes I take 10,000 neurons that are
representing something though it's

4278
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
representing something though it's
 

4279
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:57,729
representing something though it's
sitting there in a bullet block together

4280
01:17:57,729 --> 01:17:57,739
sitting there in a bullet block together
 

4281
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,020
sitting there in a bullet block together
it's a teeny little blocking around

4282
01:17:59,020 --> 01:17:59,030
it's a teeny little blocking around
 

4283
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,340
it's a teeny little blocking around
10,000 there right and they're

4284
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:00,350
10,000 there right and they're
 

4285
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:01,720
10,000 there right and they're
representing a location they're

4286
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:01,730
representing a location they're
 

4287
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,010
representing a location they're
representing a cop they're representing

4288
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:03,020
representing a cop they're representing
 

4289
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,479
representing a cop they're representing
the input for my sensors I don't know it

4290
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:04,489
the input for my sensors I don't know it
 

4291
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:04,919
the input for my sensors I don't know it
doesn't matter

4292
01:18:04,919 --> 01:18:04,929
doesn't matter
 

4293
01:18:04,929 --> 01:18:08,040
doesn't matter
it's representing something the way the

4294
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:08,050
it's representing something the way the
 

4295
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,750
it's representing something the way the
representations occur it's always a

4296
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
representations occur it's always a
 

4297
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,070
representations occur it's always a
sparse representation meaning it's a

4298
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:11,080
sparse representation meaning it's a
 

4299
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,470
sparse representation meaning it's a
population code so which 200 cells are

4300
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:13,480
population code so which 200 cells are
 

4301
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,260
population code so which 200 cells are
active tells me what's going on it's not

4302
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:15,270
active tells me what's going on it's not
 

4303
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,220
active tells me what's going on it's not
individual cells on it's not important

4304
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:17,230
individual cells on it's not important
 

4305
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,380
individual cells on it's not important
at all it's the population code that

4306
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:19,390
at all it's the population code that
 

4307
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:21,450
at all it's the population code that
matters and when you have sparse

4308
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:21,460
matters and when you have sparse
 

4309
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,060
matters and when you have sparse
population codes then all kinds of

4310
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:24,070
population codes then all kinds of
 

4311
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,399
population codes then all kinds of
beautiful properties come out of them so

4312
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:26,409
beautiful properties come out of them so
 

4313
01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:27,450
beautiful properties come out of them so
the brain used the sparse population

4314
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:27,460
the brain used the sparse population
 

4315
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,340
the brain used the sparse population
codes that we've we've written and

4316
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:29,350
codes that we've we've written and
 

4317
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,229
codes that we've we've written and
described these benefits in some of our

4318
01:18:31,229 --> 01:18:31,239
described these benefits in some of our
 

4319
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:35,070
described these benefits in some of our
papers so they give this tremendous

4320
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:35,080
papers so they give this tremendous
 

4321
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,830
papers so they give this tremendous
robustness to the system student brains

4322
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
robustness to the system student brains
 

4323
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
robustness to the system student brains
are incredibly robust neurons are dying

4324
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:39,850
are incredibly robust neurons are dying
 

4325
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,939
are incredibly robust neurons are dying

01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:43,620
all the time and spasming and synapse is
falling apart and you know that all the

so what simatai and Louise one of our

4332
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:49,570
so what simatai and Louise one of our
 

4333
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:52,790
so what simatai and Louise one of our
other engineers here have done I've

4334
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
other engineers here have done I've
 

4335
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,410
other engineers here have done I've
shown they're introducing sparseness

4336
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:55,420
shown they're introducing sparseness
 

4337
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,820
shown they're introducing sparseness
into accomplished neural networks and

4338
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:56,830
into accomplished neural networks and
 

4339
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,020
into accomplished neural networks and
other people thinking along these lines

4340
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:58,030
other people thinking along these lines
 

4341
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,220
other people thinking along these lines
but we're going about it in a more

4342
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,230
but we're going about it in a more
 

4343
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,770
but we're going about it in a more
principled way I think and we're showing

4344
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:01,780
principled way I think and we're showing
 

4345
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,780
principled way I think and we're showing
that with you enforced sparseness

about it but so that's like a baby step

4396
01:20:02,070 --> 01:20:02,080
about it but so that's like a baby step
 

4397
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,050
about it but so that's like a baby step
okay that's taking something from the

4398
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:04,060
okay that's taking something from the
 

4399
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,459
okay that's taking something from the
brain we know we know about sparseness

4400
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:05,469
brain we know we know about sparseness
 

4401
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:06,930
brain we know we know about sparseness
we know why it's important we know what

4402
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:06,940
we know why it's important we know what
 

4403
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,550
we know why it's important we know what
it gives the brain so let's try to

4404
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,560
it gives the brain so let's try to
 

4405
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,780
it gives the brain so let's try to
enforce that on to this what's your

4406
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:09,790
enforce that on to this what's your
 

4407
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:11,610
enforce that on to this what's your
intuition why sparsity leads to

4408
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:11,620
intuition why sparsity leads to
 

4409
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,140
intuition why sparsity leads to
robustness because it feels like it

4410
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:13,150
robustness because it feels like it
 

4411
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,629
robustness because it feels like it
would be less robust so why why would

4412
01:20:15,629 --> 01:20:15,639
would be less robust so why why would
 

4413
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:18,200
would be less robust so why why would
you feel the Russell bust you

4414
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:18,210
you feel the Russell bust you
 

4415
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:22,470
you feel the Russell bust you
so it just feels like if the fewer

4416
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
so it just feels like if the fewer
 

4417
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,560
so it just feels like if the fewer
neurons are involved the more fragile

4418
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:25,570
neurons are involved the more fragile
 

4419
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,899

I said it's like 200 that's a lot is

4422
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,060
I said it's like 200 that's a lot is
 

4423
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,990
I said it's like 200 that's a lot is
that a lot is yes so here's an intuition

01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
that a lot is yes so here's an intuition

01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,660
will overlap more than just a few so one
way to think about is if I want them

4480
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:39,670
way to think about is if I want them
 

4481
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,459
way to think about is if I want them
fool one of these representations to

4482
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:41,469
fool one of these representations to
 

4483
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:42,540
fool one of these representations to
look like one of those other

4484
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:42,550
look like one of those other
 

4485
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,520
look like one of those other
representations I can't move just one

4486
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:44,530
representations I can't move just one
 

4487
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:46,410
representations I can't move just one
cell or two cells or three cells or four

4488
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:46,420
cell or two cells or three cells or four
 

4489
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:49,250
cell or two cells or three cells or four
cells I have to move a hundred cells and

4490
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:49,260
cells I have to move a hundred cells and
 

4491
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:53,629
cells I have to move a hundred cells and
that makes them robust in terms of

4492
01:21:53,629 --> 01:21:53,639
that makes them robust in terms of
 

4493
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:56,040
that makes them robust in terms of
further so the you mentioned sparsity

4494
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,050
further so the you mentioned sparsity
 

4495
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,260
further so the you mentioned sparsity
well maybe the next thing yeah okay so

4496
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:58,270
well maybe the next thing yeah okay so
 

4497
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,750
well maybe the next thing yeah okay so
what we have we picked one we don't know

4498
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:00,760
what we have we picked one we don't know
 

4499
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,640
what we have we picked one we don't know
if it's going to work well yet so again

4500
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:02,650
if it's going to work well yet so again
 

4501
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,260
if it's going to work well yet so again
we're trying to come up incremental ways

4502
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:04,270
we're trying to come up incremental ways
 

4503
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:07,080
we're trying to come up incremental ways
to moving from brain theory to add

4504
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,090
to moving from brain theory to add
 

4505
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,060

machine learning world and one step at a

4508
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:11,469
machine learning world and one step at a
 

4509
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:13,169
machine learning world and one step at a
time so the next thing we're going to

4510
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:13,179
time so the next thing we're going to
 

4511
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:15,000
time so the next thing we're going to
try to do is sort of incorporate some of

4512
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,010
try to do is sort of incorporate some of
 

4513
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:19,050
try to do is sort of incorporate some of
the ideas of the thousand brains theory

4514
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:19,060
the ideas of the thousand brains theory
 

4515
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,050
the ideas of the thousand brains theory
that you have many many models and that

4516
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,060
that you have many many models and that
 

4517
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,370
that you have many many models and that
are voting now that idea is not new

4518
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:23,380
are voting now that idea is not new
 

4519
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,169
are voting now that idea is not new
there's mixture models has been around

4520
01:22:25,169 --> 01:22:25,179
there's mixture models has been around
 

4521
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:28,530
there's mixture models has been around
for a long time but the way the brain

4522
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:28,540
for a long time but the way the brain
 

4523
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,600
for a long time but the way the brain
does is a little

4524
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:29,610
does is a little
 

4525
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:33,560
does is a little
and and the way it votes is different

4526
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:33,570
and and the way it votes is different
 

4527
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,870
and and the way it votes is different
and the kind of way it represents and

4528
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:35,880
and the kind of way it represents and
 

4529
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,200
and the kind of way it represents and
certain is different so we're just

4530
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,210
certain is different so we're just
 

4531
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,370
certain is different so we're just
starting this work but we're going to

4532
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:40,380
starting this work but we're going to
 

4533
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,170
starting this work but we're going to
try to see if we can sort of incorporate

4534
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:42,180
try to see if we can sort of incorporate
 

4535
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,790
try to see if we can sort of incorporate
some of the principles of voting or

4536
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:43,800
some of the principles of voting or
 

4537
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,160
some of the principles of voting or
principles of thousand brain theory like

4538
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,170
principles of thousand brain theory like
 

4539
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,190
principles of thousand brain theory like
lots of simple models that talk to each

4540
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:49,200
lots of simple models that talk to each
 

4541
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,810
lots of simple models that talk to each
other in this in a very certain way and

4542
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:53,820
other in this in a very certain way and
 

4543
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,690
other in this in a very certain way and
can we build more machines the systems

4544
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:56,700
can we build more machines the systems
 

4545
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,050
can we build more machines the systems
that learn faster and and also well

4546
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:00,060
that learn faster and and also well
 

4547
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,380
that learn faster and and also well
mostly are multimodal and robust to

4548
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:05,390
mostly are multimodal and robust to
 

4549
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:08,240
mostly are multimodal and robust to
multimodal type of issues so the one of

4550
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:08,250
multimodal type of issues so the one of
 

4551
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,180
multimodal type of issues so the one of
the challenges there is you know the

4552
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:11,190
the challenges there is you know the
 

4553
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:12,590
the challenges there is you know the
machine learning computer vision

4554
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:12,600

community has certain sets of benchmarks

4556
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:15,000
community has certain sets of benchmarks
 

4557
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,420
community has certain sets of benchmarks
sets the test would based on which they

4558
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:17,430
sets the test would based on which they
 

4559
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,640
sets the test would based on which they
compete and I would argue especially

4560
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:19,650
compete and I would argue especially
 

4561
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:22,430
compete and I would argue especially
from your perspective that those

4562
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:22,440
from your perspective that those
 

4563
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:26,110
from your perspective that those
benchmarks not that useful for testing

4564
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,120
benchmarks not that useful for testing
 

4565
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,970
benchmarks not that useful for testing
the aspects that the brain is good at or

4566
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:28,980
the aspects that the brain is good at or
 

4567
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,800
the aspects that the brain is good at or
intelligent they're not only testing in

4568
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:30,810
intelligent they're not only testing in
 

4569
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:33,230
intelligent they're not only testing in
Georgia it's a very fine yeah and it's

4570
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:33,240
Georgia it's a very fine yeah and it's
 

4571
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,080
Georgia it's a very fine yeah and it's
been extremely useful for developing

4572
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:36,090
been extremely useful for developing
 

4573
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:38,090
been extremely useful for developing
specific mathematical models but it's

4574
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:38,100
specific mathematical models but it's
 

4575
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,000
specific mathematical models but it's
not useful in the long term for creating

4576
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,010
not useful in the long term for creating
 

4577
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,740
not useful in the long term for creating
intelligence so yeah you think you also

4578
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:42,750
intelligence so yeah you think you also
 

4579
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,550
intelligence so yeah you think you also
have a role in proposing better tests

4580
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
have a role in proposing better tests
 

4581
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,070
have a role in proposing better tests
yeah this is a very you've identified a

4582
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:49,080
yeah this is a very you've identified a
 

4583
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,250
yeah this is a very you've identified a
very serious problem first of all the

4584
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
very serious problem first of all the
 

4585
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,900
very serious problem first of all the
tests that they have are the tests that

4586
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:53,910
tests that they have are the tests that
 

4587
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,490
tests that they have are the tests that
they want not the tests of the other

4588
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:55,500
they want not the tests of the other
 

4589
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,850
they want not the tests of the other
things that we're trying to do right you

4590
01:23:58,850 --> 01:23:58,860
things that we're trying to do right you
 

4591
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,270
things that we're trying to do right you
know what are the so on the second thing

4592
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:02,280
know what are the so on the second thing
 

4593
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,640
know what are the so on the second thing
is sometimes these two could be

4594
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:04,650
is sometimes these two could be
 

4595
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:06,860
is sometimes these two could be
competitive to in these tests you have

4596
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:06,870
competitive to in these tests you have
 

4597
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,660
competitive to in these tests you have
to have huge data sets and huge

4598
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:08,670
to have huge data sets and huge
 

4599
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,900
to have huge data sets and huge
computing power instead you know and we

4600
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:11,910
computing power instead you know and we
 

4601
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,770
computing power instead you know and we
don't have that here

4602
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:12,780
don't have that here
 

4603
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,050
don't have that here
we don't have it as well as other big

4604
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,060
we don't have it as well as other big
 

4605
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,340
we don't have it as well as other big
teams and big companies do so there's

4606
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,350
teams and big companies do so there's
 

4607
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:21,470
teams and big companies do so there's
numerous issues there you know we come

4608
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:21,480
numerous issues there you know we come
 

4609
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,240
numerous issues there you know we come
at it you know where our approach to

4610
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:23,250
at it you know where our approach to
 

4611
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,770
at it you know where our approach to
this is all based on in some sense you

4612
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:24,780
this is all based on in some sense you
 

4613
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,600
this is all based on in some sense you
might argue elegance we're coming at it

4614
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:26,610
might argue elegance we're coming at it
 

4615
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:27,980
might argue elegance we're coming at it
from like a theoretical base that we

4616
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:27,990
from like a theoretical base that we
 

4617
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,210
from like a theoretical base that we
think oh my god this so this is a

4618
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:29,220
think oh my god this so this is a
 

4619
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,530
think oh my god this so this is a
clearly elegant this how brains work

4620
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:30,540
clearly elegant this how brains work
 

4621
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,300
clearly elegant this how brains work
this one told uses but the machine

01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:32,310
this one told uses but the machine

4625
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,790

where they think it doesn't matter

4626
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
where they think it doesn't matter
 

4627
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,680
where they think it doesn't matter
doesn't matter what do you think as long

4628
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:36,690
doesn't matter what do you think as long
 

4629
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,180
doesn't matter what do you think as long
as you do you know point one percent

as you do you know point one percent
 

4631
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,860
as you do you know point one percent
better on this benchmark that's what

4632
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:39,870
better on this benchmark that's what
 

4633
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,200
better on this benchmark that's what
that's all that matters and

4634
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:41,210
that's all that matters and
 

4635
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:44,979
that's all that matters and
and that's a problem you know we have to

4636
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:44,989
and that's a problem you know we have to
 

4637
01:24:44,989 --> 01:24:46,149
and that's a problem you know we have to
figure out how to get around that that's

4638
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
figure out how to get around that that's
 

4639
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,890
figure out how to get around that that's
that's a challenge for us that's it's

4640
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:47,900
that's a challenge for us that's it's
 

4641
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,330
that's a challenge for us that's it's
one of the challenges we have to deal

4642
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:49,340
one of the challenges we have to deal
 

4643
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:52,479
one of the challenges we have to deal
with so I agree you've identified a big

4644
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:52,489
with so I agree you've identified a big
 

4645
01:24:52,489 --> 01:24:55,050
with so I agree you've identified a big
issue it's difficult for those reasons

4646
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:55,060
issue it's difficult for those reasons
 

4647
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,300
issue it's difficult for those reasons
but you know what you know part of the

4648
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:58,310
but you know what you know part of the
 

4649
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,100
but you know what you know part of the
reasons I'm talking to here today is I

4650
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:00,110
reasons I'm talking to here today is I
 

4651
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:01,120
reasons I'm talking to here today is I
hope I'm gonna get some machine learning

4652
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,130
hope I'm gonna get some machine learning
 

4653
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,399
hope I'm gonna get some machine learning
people to say read those papers those

4654
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:03,409
people to say read those papers those
 

4655
01:25:03,409 --> 01:25:04,630
people to say read those papers those
might be some interesting ideas I'll

4656
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:04,640
might be some interesting ideas I'll
 

4657
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,250
might be some interesting ideas I'll
show you I'm trying to doing this point

4658
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:06,260
show you I'm trying to doing this point
 

4659
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,660
show you I'm trying to doing this point
one percent improvement stuff you know

4660
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:07,670
one percent improvement stuff you know
 

4661
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,330
one percent improvement stuff you know
well that's that's why I'm here as well

4662
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:10,340
well that's that's why I'm here as well
 

4663
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,399
well that's that's why I'm here as well
because I think machine learning now as

4664
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:12,409
because I think machine learning now as
 

4665
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:15,070
because I think machine learning now as
a community is it a place where the next

4666
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:15,080
a community is it a place where the next
 

4667
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,399
a community is it a place where the next
step is uh needs to be orthogonal to

4668
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:18,409
step is uh needs to be orthogonal to
 

4669
01:25:18,409 --> 01:25:21,310
step is uh needs to be orthogonal to
what has received success in the past oh

4670
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:21,320
what has received success in the past oh
 

4671
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,780
what has received success in the past oh
you see other leaders saying this

4672
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:22,790
you see other leaders saying this
 

4673
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:25,149
you see other leaders saying this
machine learning and leaders you know

4674
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:25,159
machine learning and leaders you know
 

4675
01:25:25,159 --> 01:25:28,060
machine learning and leaders you know
Geoff Hinton with his capsules idea many

4676
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:28,070
Geoff Hinton with his capsules idea many
 

4677
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,320
Geoff Hinton with his capsules idea many
people have gotten up say you know we're

4678
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:29,330
people have gotten up say you know we're
 

4679
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,419
people have gotten up say you know we're
gonna hit road but maybe we should look

4680
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:31,429
gonna hit road but maybe we should look
 

4681
01:25:31,429 --> 01:25:32,680
gonna hit road but maybe we should look
at the brain you know things like that

4682
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:32,690
at the brain you know things like that
 

4683
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:36,700
at the brain you know things like that
so hopefully that thinking walk occur

4684
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:36,710
so hopefully that thinking walk occur
 

4685
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:39,189
so hopefully that thinking walk occur
organically and then then we're in a

4686
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
organically and then then we're in a
 

4687
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,750
organically and then then we're in a
nice position for people to come and

4688
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:40,760
nice position for people to come and
 

4689
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,040
nice position for people to come and
look at our work and say well welcome

4690
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:42,050
look at our work and say well welcome
 

4691
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,020
look at our work and say well welcome
you learn from these guys yeah MIT is

4692
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,030
you learn from these guys yeah MIT is
 

4693
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:46,419
you learn from these guys yeah MIT is
launching a billion-dollar computing

4694
01:25:46,419 --> 01:25:46,429
launching a billion-dollar computing
 

4695
01:25:46,429 --> 01:25:49,270
launching a billion-dollar computing
College the center on this idea so it's

4696
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,280
College the center on this idea so it's
 

4697
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,669
College the center on this idea so it's
on this idea of what uh well the idea

4698
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:51,679
on this idea of what uh well the idea
 

4699
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,100
on this idea of what uh well the idea
that you know the humanities psychology

4700
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,110
that you know the humanities psychology
 

4701
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:55,780
that you know the humanities psychology
neuroscience have to work all together

4702
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:55,790
neuroscience have to work all together
 

4703
01:25:55,790 --> 01:26:00,189
neuroscience have to work all together
to get to ability s yeah Stanford just

4704
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:00,199
to get to ability s yeah Stanford just
 

4705
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:01,899
to get to ability s yeah Stanford just
did this human-centered a I said yeah

4706
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:01,909
did this human-centered a I said yeah
 

4707
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:03,790
did this human-centered a I said yeah
I'm a little disappointed in these

4708
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:03,800
I'm a little disappointed in these
 

4709
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,300
I'm a little disappointed in these
initiatives because yeah you know

4710
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:07,310
initiatives because yeah you know
 

4711
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:08,800
initiatives because yeah you know
they're they're [\h__\h] is sort of a

4712
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:08,810
they're they're [\h__\h] is sort of a
 

4713
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,240
they're they're [\h__\h] is sort of a
human side of it and it could very

4714
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:10,250
human side of it and it could very
 

4715
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,000
human side of it and it could very
easily slip into how humans interact

4716
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,010
easily slip into how humans interact
 

4717
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,209
easily slip into how humans interact
with intelligent machine interest which

4718
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:16,219
with intelligent machine interest which
 

4719
01:26:16,219 --> 01:26:17,890
with intelligent machine interest which
is nothing wrong with that but that's

4720
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:17,900
is nothing wrong with that but that's
 

4721
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,810
is nothing wrong with that but that's
not that is orthogonal to what we're

4722
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:19,820
not that is orthogonal to what we're
 

4723
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,250
not that is orthogonal to what we're
trying to do we're trying to say like

4724
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:21,260
trying to do we're trying to say like
 

4725
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,930
trying to do we're trying to say like
what is the essence of intelligence I

4726
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:22,940
what is the essence of intelligence I
 

4727
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,790
what is the essence of intelligence I
don't care I think I want to build

4728
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
don't care I think I want to build
 

4729
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,780
don't care I think I want to build
intelligent machines that aren't

4730
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:25,790
intelligent machines that aren't
 

4731
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:28,990
intelligent machines that aren't
emotional that don't smile at you that

4732
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:29,000
emotional that don't smile at you that
 

4733
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,939
emotional that don't smile at you that
you know that aren't trying to tuck you

4734
01:26:30,939 --> 01:26:30,949
you know that aren't trying to tuck you
 

4735
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:33,340
you know that aren't trying to tuck you
in at night yeah there is that pattern

4736
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:33,350
in at night yeah there is that pattern
 

4737
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:35,100
in at night yeah there is that pattern
that you when you talk about

4738
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:35,110
that you when you talk about
 

4739
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,090
that you when you talk about
understanding humans is important for

4740
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:37,100
understanding humans is important for
 

4741
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,830
understanding humans is important for
understanding intelligence you start

4742
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:38,840
understanding intelligence you start
 

4743
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,970
understanding intelligence you start
slipping into topics of ethics or yeah

4744
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:42,980
slipping into topics of ethics or yeah
 

4745
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,770
slipping into topics of ethics or yeah
like you said the interactive elements

4746
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:44,780
like you said the interactive elements
 

4747
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,720
like you said the interactive elements
as opposed to no no no what's the zoom

4748
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:46,730
as opposed to no no no what's the zoom
 

4749
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:49,780
as opposed to no no no what's the zoom
in on the brain study say what the human

4750
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:49,790
in on the brain study say what the human
 

4751
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,939
in on the brain study say what the human
brain the baby the what's funny what a

4752
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:51,949
brain the baby the what's funny what a
 

4753
01:26:51,949 --> 01:26:53,800
brain the baby the what's funny what a
brain dolls does and then we can decide

4754
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:53,810
brain dolls does and then we can decide
 

4755
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:54,680
brain dolls does and then we can decide
which parts of

4756
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:54,690
which parts of
 

4757
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:57,830
which parts of
we want to recreate in some system but

4758
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:57,840
we want to recreate in some system but
 

4759
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,390
we want to recreate in some system but
do you have that theory about what the

4760
01:26:59,390 --> 01:26:59,400
do you have that theory about what the
 

4761
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,590
do you have that theory about what the
brain does what's the point you know

4762
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:00,600
brain does what's the point you know
 

4763
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,390
brain does what's the point you know
it's just you're gonna be wasting time

4764
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,400
it's just you're gonna be wasting time
 

4765
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,050
it's just you're gonna be wasting time
right

4766
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:03,060
right
 

4767
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,550
right
just to break you down on the artificial

4768
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:04,560
just to break you down on the artificial
 

4769
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,410
just to break you down on the artificial
network side maybe you could speak to

4770
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:06,420
network side maybe you could speak to
 

4771
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,750
network side maybe you could speak to
this on and that biologic and you know

4772
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:08,760
this on and that biologic and you know
 

4773
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,520
this on and that biologic and you know
aside the process of learning versus the

4774
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:10,530
aside the process of learning versus the
 

4775
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:13,850
aside the process of learning versus the
process of inference maybe you can

4776
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:13,860
process of inference maybe you can
 

4777
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:17,330
process of inference maybe you can
explain to me what is there a difference

4778
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:17,340
explain to me what is there a difference
 

4779
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,430
explain to me what is there a difference
between you know an artificial neural

4780
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
between you know an artificial neural
 

4781
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,660
between you know an artificial neural
networks there's a difference between

4782
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:20,670
networks there's a difference between
 

4783
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:22,070
networks there's a difference between
the learning stage and the inference

4784
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
the learning stage and the inference
 

4785
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,080
the learning stage and the inference
stage do you see the brain is something

4786
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,090
stage do you see the brain is something
 

4787
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:26,300
stage do you see the brain is something
different one of the one of the big

4788
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:26,310
different one of the one of the big
 

4789
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,970
different one of the one of the big
distinctions that people often say I

4790
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:28,980
distinctions that people often say I
 

4791
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,350
distinctions that people often say I
don't know how correct it is is

4792
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:30,360
don't know how correct it is is
 

4793
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,510
don't know how correct it is is
artificial neural networks need a lot of

4794
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:32,520
artificial neural networks need a lot of
 

4795
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,250
artificial neural networks need a lot of
data they're very inefficient learning

4796
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:34,260
data they're very inefficient learning
 

4797
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,250
data they're very inefficient learning
do you see that as a correct distinction

4798
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:37,260
do you see that as a correct distinction
 

4799
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,400
do you see that as a correct distinction
from the biology of the human brain that

4800
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:40,410
from the biology of the human brain that
 

4801
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:42,200
from the biology of the human brain that
the human brain is very efficient or is

4802
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:42,210
the human brain is very efficient or is
 

4803
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:43,850
the human brain is very efficient or is
that just something we deceive ourselves

4804
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:43,860
that just something we deceive ourselves
 

4805
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,800
that just something we deceive ourselves
no it is efficient obviously we can

4806
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:45,810
no it is efficient obviously we can
 

4807
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:47,810
no it is efficient obviously we can
learn new things almost instantly and so

4808
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:47,820
learn new things almost instantly and so
 

4809
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:50,360
learn new things almost instantly and so
what elements do you think yeah I can

4810
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:50,370
what elements do you think yeah I can
 

4811
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:51,410
what elements do you think yeah I can
talk about that you brought up two

4812
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:51,420
talk about that you brought up two
 

4813
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,900
talk about that you brought up two
issues there so remember I talked early

4814
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:53,910
issues there so remember I talked early
 

4815
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:56,000
issues there so remember I talked early
about the constraints we always feel

4816
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,010
about the constraints we always feel
 

4817
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,500
about the constraints we always feel
well one of those constraints is the

4818
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:57,510
well one of those constraints is the
 

4819
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:59,900
well one of those constraints is the
fact that brains are continually

4820
01:27:59,900 --> 01:27:59,910
fact that brains are continually
 

4821
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:02,060
fact that brains are continually
learning that's not something we said oh

4822
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:02,070
learning that's not something we said oh
 

4823
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:04,280
learning that's not something we said oh
we can add that later that's something

4824
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:04,290
we can add that later that's something
 

4825
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:07,010
we can add that later that's something
that was upfront had to be there from

4826
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:07,020
that was upfront had to be there from
 

4827
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:11,420
that was upfront had to be there from
the start made our problems harder but

4828
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:11,430
the start made our problems harder but
 

4829
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:14,300
the start made our problems harder but
we showed going back to the 2016 paper

4830
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:14,310
we showed going back to the 2016 paper
 

4831
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:16,189
we showed going back to the 2016 paper
on sequence memory we showed how that

4832
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:16,199
on sequence memory we showed how that
 

4833
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:18,439
on sequence memory we showed how that
happens how the brains infer and learn

4834
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:18,449
happens how the brains infer and learn
 

4835
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:21,140
happens how the brains infer and learn
at the same time and our models do that

4836
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,150
at the same time and our models do that
 

4837
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:24,080
at the same time and our models do that
and they're not two separate phases or

4838
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,090
and they're not two separate phases or
 

4839
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,870
and they're not two separate phases or
two separate sets at the time I think

4840
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:26,880
two separate sets at the time I think
 

4841
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,080
two separate sets at the time I think
that's a big big problem in AI at least

4842
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,090
that's a big big problem in AI at least
 

4843
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:33,590
that's a big big problem in AI at least
for many applications not for all so I

4844
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
for many applications not for all so I
 

4845
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,080
for many applications not for all so I
can talk about that there are some that

4846
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,090
can talk about that there are some that
 

4847
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:38,360
can talk about that there are some that
gets detailed there are some parts of

4848
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:38,370
gets detailed there are some parts of
 

4849
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:39,770
gets detailed there are some parts of
the neocortex in the brain where

4850
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:39,780
the neocortex in the brain where
 

4851
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:41,479
the neocortex in the brain where
actually what's going on

4852
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:41,489
actually what's going on
 

4853
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:43,220
actually what's going on
there's these those ease with these

4854
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:43,230
there's these those ease with these
 

4855
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:45,350
there's these those ease with these
cycles uh they're like cycles of

4856
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,360
cycles uh they're like cycles of
 

4857
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,470
cycles uh they're like cycles of
activity in the brain and there's very

4858
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:48,480
activity in the brain and there's very
 

4859
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,660
activity in the brain and there's very
strong evidence that you're doing more

4860
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:50,670
strong evidence that you're doing more
 

4861
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,100
strong evidence that you're doing more
of inference on one part of the phase

4862
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,110
of inference on one part of the phase
 

4863
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:53,689
of inference on one part of the phase
and more of learning on the other part

4864
01:28:53,689 --> 01:28:53,699
and more of learning on the other part
 

4865
01:28:53,699 --> 01:28:54,920
and more of learning on the other part
of the phase so the brain can actually

4866
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:54,930
of the phase so the brain can actually
 

4867
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,240
of the phase so the brain can actually
sort of separate different populations

4868
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:56,250
sort of separate different populations
 

4869
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,590
sort of separate different populations
of cells or going back and forth like

4870
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
of cells or going back and forth like
 

4871
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,650
of cells or going back and forth like
this but in general I would say that's

4872
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:00,660
this but in general I would say that's
 

4873
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,209
this but in general I would say that's
an important problem we have a you know

4874
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:02,219
an important problem we have a you know
 

4875
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:03,620
an important problem we have a you know
all of our networks that we've come up

4876
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:03,630
all of our networks that we've come up
 

4877
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,320
all of our networks that we've come up
with do both and it's it they're

4878
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:06,330
with do both and it's it they're
 

4879
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,330
with do both and it's it they're
learning continuous learning networks

4880
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:08,340
learning continuous learning networks
 

4881
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,640
learning continuous learning networks
and you mentioned benchmarks earlier

4882
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:10,650
and you mentioned benchmarks earlier
 

4883
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:12,290
and you mentioned benchmarks earlier
well there are no benchmarks about that

4884
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:12,300
well there are no benchmarks about that
 

4885
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,660
well there are no benchmarks about that
exactly so so we you know we have to

4886
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:14,670
exactly so so we you know we have to
 

4887
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:16,910
exactly so so we you know we have to
like you know begin our little soapbox

4888
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:16,920
like you know begin our little soapbox
 

4889
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,260
like you know begin our little soapbox
say hey by the way we yeah this is

4890
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:18,270
say hey by the way we yeah this is
 

4891
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,550
say hey by the way we yeah this is
important you know and here's a

4892
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:19,560
important you know and here's a
 

4893
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,470
important you know and here's a
mechanism for doing that but and you

4894
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:21,480
mechanism for doing that but and you
 

4895
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,600
mechanism for doing that but and you
know but until you can prove it to

4896
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:23,610
know but until you can prove it to
 

4897
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:24,920
know but until you can prove it to
someone in some you know commercial

4898
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:24,930
someone in some you know commercial
 

4899
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:26,780
someone in some you know commercial
system or something's a little harder so

4900
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:26,790
system or something's a little harder so
 

4901
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,310
system or something's a little harder so
yeah one of the things I had to linger

4902
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
yeah one of the things I had to linger
 

4903
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,670
yeah one of the things I had to linger
on that is in some ways to learn the

4904
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:31,680
on that is in some ways to learn the
 

4905
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,910
on that is in some ways to learn the
concept of a coffee cup you only need

4906
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:34,920
concept of a coffee cup you only need
 

4907
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,560
concept of a coffee cup you only need
this one coffee cup and maybe some time

4908
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:36,570
this one coffee cup and maybe some time
 

4909
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,840
this one coffee cup and maybe some time
alone in a room with it the first things

4910
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:38,850
alone in a room with it the first things
 

4911
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,880
alone in a room with it the first things
is I when I was imagine I reach my hand

4912
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:40,890
is I when I was imagine I reach my hand
 

4913
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:42,290
is I when I was imagine I reach my hand
into a black box and I'm reaching I'm

4914
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:42,300
into a black box and I'm reaching I'm
 

4915
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,030
into a black box and I'm reaching I'm
trying to touch something yeah I don't

4916
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,040
trying to touch something yeah I don't
 

4917
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,500
trying to touch something yeah I don't
know upfront if it's something I already

4918
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:45,510
know upfront if it's something I already
 

4919
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,110
know upfront if it's something I already
know or if it's a new thing right and I

4920
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:48,120
know or if it's a new thing right and I
 

4921
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,240
know or if it's a new thing right and I
have to I'm doing both at the same time

4922
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:50,250
have to I'm doing both at the same time
 

4923
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,190
have to I'm doing both at the same time
I don't say oh let's see if it's a new

4924
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:52,200
I don't say oh let's see if it's a new
 

4925
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,590
I don't say oh let's see if it's a new
thing oh let's see if it's an old thing

4926
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:54,600
thing oh let's see if it's an old thing
 

4927
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,530
thing oh let's see if it's an old thing
I don't do that I as I go my brain says

4928
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:57,540
I don't do that I as I go my brain says
 

4929
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,750
I don't do that I as I go my brain says
oh it's new or it's not new and if it's

4930
01:29:59,750 --> 01:29:59,760
oh it's new or it's not new and if it's
 

4931
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,540
oh it's new or it's not new and if it's
new I start learning what it is so and

4932
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:02,550
new I start learning what it is so and
 

4933
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,190
new I start learning what it is so and
it by the way it starts learning from

4934
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:04,200
it by the way it starts learning from
 

4935
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,840
it by the way it starts learning from
the get-go even if we couldn't recognize

4936
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:05,850
the get-go even if we couldn't recognize
 

4937
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,880
the get-go even if we couldn't recognize
it so they're they're not separate

4938
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:07,890
it so they're they're not separate
 

4939
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,410
it so they're they're not separate
problems they're in so that's the

4940
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:09,420
problems they're in so that's the
 

4941
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,820
problems they're in so that's the
flinger the other thing you mentioned

4942
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:10,830
flinger the other thing you mentioned
 

4943
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:14,030
flinger the other thing you mentioned
was the fast learning um so I was

4944
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,040
was the fast learning um so I was
 

4945
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,740
was the fast learning um so I was
distorting my continuous learning but

4946
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:15,750
distorting my continuous learning but
 

4947
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,690
distorting my continuous learning but
there's also fast I mean literally I can

4948
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:17,700
there's also fast I mean literally I can
 

4949
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,310
there's also fast I mean literally I can
show you this coffee cup and I say

4950
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:19,320
show you this coffee cup and I say
 

4951
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,390
show you this coffee cup and I say
here's a new coffee cup it's got the

4952
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:20,400
here's a new coffee cup it's got the
 

4953
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,940
here's a new coffee cup it's got the
logo on it take a look at it done you

4954
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:22,950
logo on it take a look at it done you
 

4955
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,830
logo on it take a look at it done you
done you can predict what it's going to

4956
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:24,840
done you can predict what it's going to
 

4957
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,090
done you can predict what it's going to
look like you know in different

4958
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:26,100
look like you know in different
 

4959
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,910
look like you know in different
positions so I can talk about that too

4960
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:28,920
positions so I can talk about that too
 

4961
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,080
positions so I can talk about that too
yes in the brain the way learning occurs

4962
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:33,090
yes in the brain the way learning occurs
 

4963
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,570
yes in the brain the way learning occurs
I mentioned this earlier but I mentioned

4964
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:35,580
I mentioned this earlier but I mentioned
 

4965
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,650
I mentioned this earlier but I mentioned
again the way learning occurs I'm

4966
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:36,660
again the way learning occurs I'm
 

4967
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,510
again the way learning occurs I'm
imagining a mass section of a dendrite

4968
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:38,520
imagining a mass section of a dendrite
 

4969
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,080
imagining a mass section of a dendrite
of a neuron and I want to learn I'm

4970
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:42,090
of a neuron and I want to learn I'm
 

4971
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,760
of a neuron and I want to learn I'm
gonna learn something new I'm just

4972
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:43,770
gonna learn something new I'm just
 

4973
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:44,930
gonna learn something new I'm just
doesn't matter what it is I'm just gonna

4974
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:44,940
doesn't matter what it is I'm just gonna
 

4975
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,970
doesn't matter what it is I'm just gonna
learn something new I I need to

4976
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:46,980
learn something new I I need to
 

4977
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,280
learn something new I I need to
recognize a new pattern so what I'm

4978
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:49,290
recognize a new pattern so what I'm
 

4979
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,850
recognize a new pattern so what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna form new synapses new

4980
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:52,860
gonna do I'm gonna form new synapses new
 

4981
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,070
gonna do I'm gonna form new synapses new
synapses we're gonna rewire the brain on

4982
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:55,080
synapses we're gonna rewire the brain on
 

4983
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,530
synapses we're gonna rewire the brain on
to that section of the dendrite

4984
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:57,540
to that section of the dendrite
 

4985
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,020
to that section of the dendrite
once I've done that everything else that

4986
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,030
once I've done that everything else that
 

4987
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:01,970
once I've done that everything else that
neuron has learned is not affected by it

4988
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:01,980
neuron has learned is not affected by it
 

4989
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:04,580
neuron has learned is not affected by it
that's because it's isolated to that

4990
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:04,590
that's because it's isolated to that
 

4991
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,530
that's because it's isolated to that
small section of the dendrite they're

4992
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:06,540
small section of the dendrite they're
 

4993
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,270
small section of the dendrite they're
not all being added together like a

4994
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:08,280
not all being added together like a
 

4995
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,730
not all being added together like a
point neuron so if I learn something new

4996
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:10,740
point neuron so if I learn something new
 

4997
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,260
point neuron so if I learn something new
on this segment here it doesn't change

4998
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:12,270
on this segment here it doesn't change
 

4999
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,210
on this segment here it doesn't change
anything occur anywhere else in that

5000
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:14,220
anything occur anywhere else in that
 

5001
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,280
anything occur anywhere else in that
neuron so I can add something without

5002
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:16,290
neuron so I can add something without
 

5003
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,860
neuron so I can add something without
affecting previous learning and I can do

5004
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:18,870
affecting previous learning and I can do
 

5005
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,459
affecting previous learning and I can do
it quickly now let's talk

5006
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:21,469
it quickly now let's talk
 

5007
01:31:21,469 --> 01:31:22,569
it quickly now let's talk
we can talk about the quickness how it's

5008
01:31:22,569 --> 01:31:22,579
we can talk about the quickness how it's
 

5009
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:24,640
we can talk about the quickness how it's
done in real neurons you might say well

5010
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:24,650
done in real neurons you might say well
 

5011
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,500
done in real neurons you might say well
doesn't it take time to form synapses

5012
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:26,510
doesn't it take time to form synapses
 

5013
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:29,319
doesn't it take time to form synapses
yes it can take maybe an hour to form a

5014
01:31:29,319 --> 01:31:29,329
yes it can take maybe an hour to form a
 

5015
01:31:29,329 --> 01:31:31,959
yes it can take maybe an hour to form a
new synapse we can form memories quicker

5016
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:31,969
new synapse we can form memories quicker
 

5017
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:33,819
new synapse we can form memories quicker
than that and I can explain that albums

5018
01:31:33,819 --> 01:31:33,829
than that and I can explain that albums
 

5019
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:37,270
than that and I can explain that albums
too if you want but it's getting a bit

5020
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
too if you want but it's getting a bit
 

5021
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,479
too if you want but it's getting a bit
neuroscience II oh that's great but is

5022
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:40,489
neuroscience II oh that's great but is
 

5023
01:31:40,489 --> 01:31:42,609
neuroscience II oh that's great but is
there an understanding of these every

5024
01:31:42,609 --> 01:31:42,619
there an understanding of these every
 

5025
01:31:42,619 --> 01:31:44,410
there an understanding of these every
level yes so from the short-term

5026
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:44,420
level yes so from the short-term
 

5027
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:49,149
level yes so from the short-term
memories in the forming uh well so this

5028
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:49,159
memories in the forming uh well so this
 

5029
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:51,040
memories in the forming uh well so this
idea synaptogenesis the growth of new

5030
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:51,050
idea synaptogenesis the growth of new
 

5031
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:53,290
idea synaptogenesis the growth of new
synapses that's well described as well

5032
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:53,300
synapses that's well described as well
 

5033
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,000
synapses that's well described as well
understood and that's an essential part

5034
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,010
understood and that's an essential part
 

5035
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,250
understood and that's an essential part
of learning that is learning that is

5036
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:57,260
of learning that is learning that is
 

5037
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:01,719
of learning that is learning that is
learning okay you know back you know the

5038
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:01,729
learning okay you know back you know the
 

5039
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:04,330
learning okay you know back you know the
going back many many years people you

5040
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:04,340
going back many many years people you
 

5041
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:07,089
going back many many years people you
know as what's-his-name the psychologist

5042
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:07,099
know as what's-his-name the psychologist
 

5043
01:32:07,099 --> 01:32:09,879
know as what's-his-name the psychologist
who proposed heavy hem Donald Hebb he

5044
01:32:09,879 --> 01:32:09,889
who proposed heavy hem Donald Hebb he
 

5045
01:32:09,889 --> 01:32:11,169
who proposed heavy hem Donald Hebb he
proposed that learning was the

5046
01:32:11,169 --> 01:32:11,179
proposed that learning was the
 

5047
01:32:11,179 --> 01:32:13,479
proposed that learning was the
modification of the strength of a

5048
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:13,489
modification of the strength of a
 

5049
01:32:13,489 --> 01:32:15,729
modification of the strength of a
connection between two neurons people

5050
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:15,739
connection between two neurons people
 

5051
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,250
connection between two neurons people
interpreted that as the modification of

5052
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:18,260
interpreted that as the modification of
 

5053
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,140
interpreted that as the modification of
the strength of a synapse he didn't say

5054
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:20,150
the strength of a synapse he didn't say
 

5055
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:22,060
the strength of a synapse he didn't say
that he just said there's a modification

5056
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,070
that he just said there's a modification
 

5057
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:24,009
that he just said there's a modification
between the effect of one neuron another

5058
01:32:24,009 --> 01:32:24,019
between the effect of one neuron another
 

5059
01:32:24,019 --> 01:32:26,319
between the effect of one neuron another
so synaptogenesis is totally consistent

5060
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:26,329
so synaptogenesis is totally consistent
 

5061
01:32:26,329 --> 01:32:28,750
so synaptogenesis is totally consistent
with Donald Hebb said but anyway there's

5062
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:28,760
with Donald Hebb said but anyway there's
 

5063
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,790
with Donald Hebb said but anyway there's
these mechanisms that growth a new sense

5064
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:30,800
these mechanisms that growth a new sense
 

5065
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,989
these mechanisms that growth a new sense
you can go online you can watch a video

5066
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:31,999
you can go online you can watch a video
 

5067
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:34,029
you can go online you can watch a video
of a synapse growing in real time it's

5068
01:32:34,029 --> 01:32:34,039
of a synapse growing in real time it's
 

5069
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:36,239
of a synapse growing in real time it's
literally you can see this little finger

5070
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:36,249
literally you can see this little finger
 

5071
01:32:36,249 --> 01:32:38,739
literally you can see this little finger
it's pretty impressive yeah so that's

5072
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:38,749
it's pretty impressive yeah so that's
 

5073
01:32:38,749 --> 01:32:40,330
it's pretty impressive yeah so that's
those mechanisms are known now there's

5074
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:40,340
those mechanisms are known now there's
 

5075
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,250
those mechanisms are known now there's
another thing that we've speculated and

5076
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:42,260
another thing that we've speculated and
 

5077
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,709
another thing that we've speculated and
we've written about which is consistent

5078
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:44,719
we've written about which is consistent
 

5079
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,229
we've written about which is consistent
with no neuroscience but it's less

5080
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:47,239
with no neuroscience but it's less
 

5081
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:49,509
with no neuroscience but it's less
proven and this is the idea how do i

5082
01:32:49,509 --> 01:32:49,519
proven and this is the idea how do i
 

5083
01:32:49,519 --> 01:32:51,729
proven and this is the idea how do i
form a memory really really quickly like

5084
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:51,739
form a memory really really quickly like
 

5085
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:53,919
form a memory really really quickly like
instantaneously if it takes an hour to

5086
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:53,929
instantaneously if it takes an hour to
 

5087
01:32:53,929 --> 01:32:55,120
instantaneously if it takes an hour to
grow synapse like that's not

5088
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,130
grow synapse like that's not
 

5089
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:58,509
grow synapse like that's not
instantaneous so there are there are

5090
01:32:58,509 --> 01:32:58,519
instantaneous so there are there are
 

5091
01:32:58,519 --> 01:33:00,810
instantaneous so there are there are
types of synapses called silent synapses

5092
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:00,820
types of synapses called silent synapses
 

5093
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,279
types of synapses called silent synapses
they look like a synapse but they don't

5094
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:03,289
they look like a synapse but they don't
 

5095
01:33:03,289 --> 01:33:04,810
they look like a synapse but they don't
do anything they're just sitting there

5096
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:04,820
do anything they're just sitting there
 

5097
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,450
do anything they're just sitting there
it's like they do a action potential

5098
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:07,460
it's like they do a action potential
 

5099
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,589
it's like they do a action potential
that comes in it doesn't release any

5100
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:08,599
that comes in it doesn't release any
 

5101
01:33:08,599 --> 01:33:10,750
that comes in it doesn't release any
neurotransmitter some parts of the brain

5102
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:10,760
neurotransmitter some parts of the brain
 

5103
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,580
neurotransmitter some parts of the brain
have more of these and others for

5104
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:12,590
have more of these and others for
 

5105
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:13,779
have more of these and others for
example the hippocampus has a lot of

5106
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:13,789
example the hippocampus has a lot of
 

5107
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:16,029
example the hippocampus has a lot of
them which is where we associate most

5108
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:16,039
them which is where we associate most
 

5109
01:33:16,039 --> 01:33:19,899
them which is where we associate most
short to remember with so what we we

5110
01:33:19,899 --> 01:33:19,909
short to remember with so what we we
 

5111
01:33:19,909 --> 01:33:22,209
short to remember with so what we we
speculated again in that 2016 paper we

5112
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:22,219
speculated again in that 2016 paper we
 

5113
01:33:22,219 --> 01:33:25,600
speculated again in that 2016 paper we
proposed that the way we form very quick

5114
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:25,610
proposed that the way we form very quick
 

5115
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,879
proposed that the way we form very quick
memories very short-term memories or

5116
01:33:27,879 --> 01:33:27,889
memories very short-term memories or
 

5117
01:33:27,889 --> 01:33:30,479
memories very short-term memories or
quick memories is that we convert

5118
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:30,489
quick memories is that we convert
 

5119
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:33,379
quick memories is that we convert
silence and synapses into axis enough

5120
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:33,389
silence and synapses into axis enough
 

5121
01:33:33,389 --> 01:33:35,029
silence and synapses into axis enough
it's going it's like seeing a synapse

5122
01:33:35,029 --> 01:33:35,039
it's going it's like seeing a synapse
 

5123
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,000
it's going it's like seeing a synapse
there's a zero weight in a one way but

5124
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,010
there's a zero weight in a one way but
 

5125
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:40,310
there's a zero weight in a one way but
the long-term memory has to be formed by

5126
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
the long-term memory has to be formed by
 

5127
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,080
the long-term memory has to be formed by
synaptogenesis so you can remember

5128
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:42,090
synaptogenesis so you can remember
 

5129
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:43,489
synaptogenesis so you can remember
something really quickly by just

5130
01:33:43,489 --> 01:33:43,499
something really quickly by just
 

5131
01:33:43,499 --> 01:33:44,719
something really quickly by just
flipping a bunch of these guys from

5132
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:44,729
flipping a bunch of these guys from
 

5133
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:47,330
flipping a bunch of these guys from
silent to active it's not like it's not

5134
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:47,340
silent to active it's not like it's not
 

5135
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,250
silent to active it's not like it's not
from point one to point one five it's

5136
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:49,260
from point one to point one five it's
 

5137
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,169
from point one to point one five it's
like doesn't do anything to it releases

5138
01:33:51,169 --> 01:33:51,179
like doesn't do anything to it releases
 

5139
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:52,969
like doesn't do anything to it releases
transmitter and if I do that over a

5140
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:52,979
transmitter and if I do that over a
 

5141
01:33:52,979 --> 01:33:54,830
transmitter and if I do that over a
bunch of these I've got a very quick

5142
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:54,840
bunch of these I've got a very quick
 

5143
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,889
bunch of these I've got a very quick
short-term memory so I guess the lesson

5144
01:33:57,889 --> 01:33:57,899
short-term memory so I guess the lesson
 

5145
01:33:57,899 --> 01:33:59,569
short-term memory so I guess the lesson
behind this is that most neural networks

5146
01:33:59,569 --> 01:33:59,579
behind this is that most neural networks
 

5147
01:33:59,579 --> 01:34:02,270
behind this is that most neural networks
today are fully connected every neuron

5148
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:02,280
today are fully connected every neuron
 

5149
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,770
today are fully connected every neuron
connects every other nerve from layer to

5150
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:03,780
connects every other nerve from layer to
 

5151
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,169
connects every other nerve from layer to
layer that's not correct in the brain we

5152
01:34:06,169 --> 01:34:06,179
layer that's not correct in the brain we
 

5153
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:08,000
layer that's not correct in the brain we
don't want that we actually don't want

5154
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,010
don't want that we actually don't want
 

5155
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,009
don't want that we actually don't want
that it's bad if you want a very sparse

5156
01:34:10,009 --> 01:34:10,019
that it's bad if you want a very sparse
 

5157
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:13,279
that it's bad if you want a very sparse
connectivity so that any neuron connects

5158
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:13,289
connectivity so that any neuron connects
 

5159
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:14,689
connectivity so that any neuron connects
just some subset of the neurons in the

5160
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:14,699
just some subset of the neurons in the
 

5161
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:16,580
just some subset of the neurons in the
other layer and it does so on a on a

5162
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:16,590
other layer and it does so on a on a
 

5163
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:19,100
other layer and it does so on a on a
dendrite by dendrite segment basis so

5164
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:19,110
dendrite by dendrite segment basis so
 

5165
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:20,870
dendrite by dendrite segment basis so
it's a very sparse elated out type of

5166
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
it's a very sparse elated out type of
 

5167
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,169
it's a very sparse elated out type of
thing and and that then learning is not

5168
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:24,179
thing and and that then learning is not
 

5169
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:25,879
thing and and that then learning is not
adjusting all these ways but learning is

5170
01:34:25,879 --> 01:34:25,889
adjusting all these ways but learning is
 

5171
01:34:25,889 --> 01:34:27,589
adjusting all these ways but learning is
just saying okay connect to these 10

01:34:34,219 --> 01:34:34,229
it's a very simple process of back
 

5179
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:37,370
it's a very simple process of back
propagation that adjusts the ways the

propagation that adjusts the ways the
process of synaptogenesis

5182
01:34:40,209 --> 01:34:40,219
process of synaptogenesis
 

5183
01:34:40,219 --> 01:34:43,009

have been learning it's basically saying
 

5203
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:01,459
have been learning it's basically saying
there's a population of cells over here

01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:06,419
right now how do i form connections
 

5211
01:35:06,419 --> 01:35:08,629
right now how do i form connections
between those active cells and it's

between those active cells and it's
 

5213
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,790
between those active cells and it's
literally saying this guy became active

5214

literally saying this guy became active
 

5215
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,859
literally saying this guy became active
this these 100 neurons here became

01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:12,869
this these 100 neurons here became
 

5217
01:35:12,869 --> 01:35:14,479
this these 100 neurons here became
active before this neuron became active

5218
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:14,489
active before this neuron became active
 

5219
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:17,209
active before this neuron became active
so form connections to those ones that's

5220
01:35:17,209 --> 01:35:17,219
so form connections to those ones that's
 

5221
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:17,509
so form connections to those ones that's
it

5222
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:17,519
it
 

5223
01:35:17,519 --> 01:35:19,609

the question that you already answered

5236
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:35,610
the question that you already answered
 

5237
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:38,989
the question that you already answered
and maybe you can answer it again if you

5238
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:38,999
and maybe you can answer it again if you
 

5239
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:40,009
and maybe you can answer it again if you
look at the history of artificial

5240
01:35:40,009 --> 01:35:40,019
look at the history of artificial
 

5241
01:35:40,019 --> 01:35:43,250
look at the history of artificial
intelligence where do you think we stand

5242
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:43,260
intelligence where do you think we stand
 

5243
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,439
intelligence where do you think we stand
how far are we from solving intelligence

5244
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:45,449
how far are we from solving intelligence
 

5245
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,120
how far are we from solving intelligence
you said you were very optimistic

5246
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:47,130
you said you were very optimistic
 

5247
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,250
you said you were very optimistic
yeah can you elaborate on that yeah you

5248
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:49,260
yeah can you elaborate on that yeah you
 

5249
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,560
yeah can you elaborate on that yeah you
know it's just always the the crazy

5250
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:51,570
know it's just always the the crazy
 

5251
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:54,229
know it's just always the the crazy
question to ask because you know no one

5252
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
question to ask because you know no one
 

5253
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,010
question to ask because you know no one
can predict the future

5254
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:55,020
can predict the future
 

5255
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,890
can predict the future
absolutely so I'll tell you a story I

5256
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:57,900
absolutely so I'll tell you a story I
 

5257
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,439
absolutely so I'll tell you a story I
used to I used to run a different

5258
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:00,449
used to I used to run a different
 

5259
01:36:00,449 --> 01:36:01,700
used to I used to run a different
Neuroscience Institute called the red

5260
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:01,710
Neuroscience Institute called the red
 

5261
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,320
Neuroscience Institute called the red
burn neuroscience tattoo and we would we

5262
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:03,330
burn neuroscience tattoo and we would we
 

5263
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,090
burn neuroscience tattoo and we would we
would hold these symposiums we get like

5264
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,100
would hold these symposiums we get like
 

5265
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,979
would hold these symposiums we get like
35 scientists from around the world to

5266
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:06,989
35 scientists from around the world to
 

5267
01:36:06,989 --> 01:36:09,080
35 scientists from around the world to
come together and I used to ask him all

5268
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:09,090
come together and I used to ask him all
 

5269
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:10,970
come together and I used to ask him all
the same question I would say well how

5270
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:10,980
the same question I would say well how
 

5271
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,050
the same question I would say well how
long do you think it'll be before we

5272
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:12,060
long do you think it'll be before we
 

5273
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,570
long do you think it'll be before we
understand his and your cortex works and

5274
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,580
understand his and your cortex works and
 

5275
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:15,709
understand his and your cortex works and
everyone went around the room and they

5276
01:36:15,709 --> 01:36:15,719
everyone went around the room and they
 

5277
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:16,910
everyone went around the room and they
had introduced the name and they have to

5278
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:16,920
had introduced the name and they have to
 

5279
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,090
had introduced the name and they have to
answer that question so I got the the

5280
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,100
answer that question so I got the the
 

5281
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,090
answer that question so I got the the
typical answer was 50 to 100 years some

5282
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:23,100
typical answer was 50 to 100 years some
 

5283
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,189
typical answer was 50 to 100 years some
people would say 500 years some people

5284
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:25,199
people would say 500 years some people
 

5285
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:25,760
people would say 500 years some people
said never

5286
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:25,770
said never
 

5287
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:35,510
said never
I said well your size so you know but it

5288
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
I said well your size so you know but it
 

5289
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,740
I said well your size so you know but it
doesn't work like that as I mentioned

5290
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:36,750
doesn't work like that as I mentioned
 

5291
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:39,110
doesn't work like that as I mentioned
earlier these are not these are step

5292
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,120
earlier these are not these are step
 

5293
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,939
earlier these are not these are step
functions things happen and then bingo

5294
01:36:40,939 --> 01:36:40,949
functions things happen and then bingo
 

5295
01:36:40,949 --> 01:36:43,399
functions things happen and then bingo
they happen you can't predict that I

5296
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:43,409
they happen you can't predict that I
 

5297
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:45,379
they happen you can't predict that I
fill I've already passed a step function

5298
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:45,389
fill I've already passed a step function
 

5299
01:36:45,389 --> 01:36:47,959
fill I've already passed a step function
so if I can do my job correctly over the

5300
01:36:47,959 --> 01:36:47,969
so if I can do my job correctly over the
 

5301
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,959
so if I can do my job correctly over the
next five years

5302
01:36:49,959 --> 01:36:49,969
next five years
 

5303
01:36:49,969 --> 01:36:52,820
next five years
then meaning I can proselytize these

5304
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:52,830
then meaning I can proselytize these
 

5305
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,560
then meaning I can proselytize these
ideas I can convince other people

5306
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:54,570
ideas I can convince other people
 

5307
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:57,169
ideas I can convince other people
they're right we can show that other

5308
01:36:57,169 --> 01:36:57,179
they're right we can show that other
 

5309
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:59,600
they're right we can show that other
people machine learning people should

5310
01:36:59,600 --> 01:36:59,610
people machine learning people should
 

5311
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:02,180
people machine learning people should
pay attention to these ideas then we're

5312
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:02,190
pay attention to these ideas then we're
 

5313
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:03,830
pay attention to these ideas then we're
definitely in an under 20 year time

5314
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
definitely in an under 20 year time
 

5315
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,620
definitely in an under 20 year time
frame if I can do those things if I'm

5316
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:06,630
frame if I can do those things if I'm
 

5317
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:08,180
frame if I can do those things if I'm
not successful in that and this is the

5318
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:08,190
not successful in that and this is the
 

5319
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:10,490
not successful in that and this is the
last time anyone talks to me and no one

5320
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:10,500
last time anyone talks to me and no one
 

5321
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,590
last time anyone talks to me and no one
reads our papers and you know I'm wrong

5322
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:12,600
reads our papers and you know I'm wrong
 

5323
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,229
reads our papers and you know I'm wrong
or something like that then then I don't

5324
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,239
or something like that then then I don't
 

5325
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:18,379
or something like that then then I don't
know but it's it's not 50 years it's it

5326
01:37:18,379 --> 01:37:18,389
know but it's it's not 50 years it's it
 

5327
01:37:18,389 --> 01:37:21,919
know but it's it's not 50 years it's it
you know it'll it'll you know the same

5328
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:21,929
you know it'll it'll you know the same
 

5329
01:37:21,929 --> 01:37:23,390
you know it'll it'll you know the same
thing about electric cars how quickly

5330
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:23,400
thing about electric cars how quickly
 

5331
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,709
thing about electric cars how quickly
are they going to populate the world

5332
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719
are they going to populate the world
 

5333
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,360
are they going to populate the world
which probably takes about a 20 year

5334
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:26,370
which probably takes about a 20 year
 

5335
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:29,149
which probably takes about a 20 year
span it'll be something like that but I

5336
01:37:29,149 --> 01:37:29,159
span it'll be something like that but I
 

5337
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:30,500
span it'll be something like that but I
think if I can do what I said we're

5338
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:30,510
think if I can do what I said we're
 

5339
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:32,720
think if I can do what I said we're
starting it and of course there could be

5340
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:32,730
starting it and of course there could be
 

5341
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:35,300
starting it and of course there could be
other you said step functions

5342
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:35,310
other you said step functions
 

5343
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:38,720
other you said step functions
it could be everybody gives up on your

5344
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:38,730
it could be everybody gives up on your
 

5345
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,950
it could be everybody gives up on your
ideas for 20 years

5346
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:39,960
ideas for 20 years
 

5347
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,540
ideas for 20 years
and then all of a sudden somebody picks

5348
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:41,550
and then all of a sudden somebody picks
 

5349
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:43,280
and then all of a sudden somebody picks
it up again wait that guy was on to

5350
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:43,290
it up again wait that guy was on to
 

5351
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:43,640
it up again wait that guy was on to
something

5352
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:43,650
something
 

5353
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,020
something
yeah so that would be a that would be a

5354
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,030
yeah so that would be a that would be a
 

5355
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:47,450
yeah so that would be a that would be a
failure on my part right you know yeah

5356
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:47,460
failure on my part right you know yeah
 

5357
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,729
failure on my part right you know yeah
think about Charles Babbage you know

5358
01:37:49,729 --> 01:37:49,739
think about Charles Babbage you know
 

5359
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,890
think about Charles Babbage you know
Charles Babbage invented the computer

5360
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:51,900
Charles Babbage invented the computer
 

5361
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,639
Charles Babbage invented the computer
back in the eighteen hundreds

5362
01:37:55,639 --> 01:37:55,649
back in the eighteen hundreds
 

5363
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:58,399
back in the eighteen hundreds
and everyone forgot about it until you

5364
01:37:58,399 --> 01:37:58,409
and everyone forgot about it until you
 

5365
01:37:58,409 --> 01:38:03,949
and everyone forgot about it until you
know but he was ahead of his time I

5366
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:03,959
know but he was ahead of his time I
 

5367
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:06,109
know but he was ahead of his time I
don't think you know like as I said I

5368
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:06,119
don't think you know like as I said I
 

5369
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:08,270
don't think you know like as I said I
recognize this is part of any

5370
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:08,280
recognize this is part of any
 

5371

entrepreneurs challenge I use it

5372
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:10,050
entrepreneurs challenge I use it

trying to sell ideas and this is a
 

5381
01:38:17,129 --> 01:38:19,489
trying to sell ideas and this is a
challenge as to how you get people to

differently based on your ideas so you

5390
01:38:28,009 --> 01:38:28,019
differently based on your ideas so you
 

5391
01:38:28,019 --> 01:38:30,290
differently based on your ideas so you
know we'll see how what we do on them so

5392
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:30,300
know we'll see how what we do on them so
 

5393
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,209
know we'll see how what we do on them so
you know that there's a lot of hype

5394
01:38:32,209 --> 01:38:32,219
you know that there's a lot of hype
 

5395
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:34,159
you know that there's a lot of hype
behind artificial intelligence currently

5396
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:34,169
behind artificial intelligence currently
 

5397
01:38:34,169 --> 01:38:38,989
behind artificial intelligence currently
do you uh as as you look to spread the

5398
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:38,999
do you uh as as you look to spread the
 

5399
01:38:38,999 --> 01:38:41,779
do you uh as as you look to spread the
ideas that are of neocortical theory of

the things you're working on do you

5402
01:38:43,429 --> 01:38:43,439
the things you're working on do you
 

5403
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:45,529
the things you're working on do you
think there's some possibility we'll hit

5404
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:45,539
think there's some possibility we'll hit
 

5405
01:38:45,539 --> 01:38:48,290
think there's some possibility we'll hit
an AI winter once again it's certainly a

5406
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:48,300
an AI winter once again it's certainly a
 

5407
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,449
an AI winter once again it's certainly a
possibility no don't worry about yeah

5408
01:38:50,449 --> 01:38:50,459
possibility no don't worry about yeah
 

5409
01:38:50,459 --> 01:38:53,679
possibility no don't worry about yeah
well I guess do I worry about it I

5410
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:53,689
well I guess do I worry about it I
 

5411
01:38:53,689 --> 01:38:55,909
well I guess do I worry about it I
haven't decided yet if that's good or

5412
01:38:55,909 --> 01:38:55,919
haven't decided yet if that's good or
 

5413
01:38:55,919 --> 01:38:59,359
haven't decided yet if that's good or
bad for my mission that's true yeah very

5414
01:38:59,359 --> 01:38:59,369
bad for my mission that's true yeah very
 

5415
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:01,279
bad for my mission that's true yeah very
true because uh it's almost like you

5416
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:01,289
true because uh it's almost like you
 

5417
01:39:01,289 --> 01:39:03,859
true because uh it's almost like you
need the the winter to refresh the

5418
01:39:03,859 --> 01:39:03,869
need the the winter to refresh the
 

5419
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:06,169
need the the winter to refresh the
palate yeah it's so it's like I want

5420
01:39:06,169 --> 01:39:06,179
palate yeah it's so it's like I want
 

5421
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:08,270
palate yeah it's so it's like I want
here's what you want to have it is you

5422
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:08,280
here's what you want to have it is you
 

5423
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,270
here's what you want to have it is you
want like the extent that everyone is so

5424
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:11,280
want like the extent that everyone is so
 

5425
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,389
want like the extent that everyone is so
thrilled about the current state of

5426
01:39:13,389 --> 01:39:13,399
thrilled about the current state of
 

5427
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:16,520
thrilled about the current state of
machine learning and AI and they don't

5428
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:16,530
machine learning and AI and they don't
 

5429
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:18,139
machine learning and AI and they don't
imagine they need anything else that

5430
01:39:18,139 --> 01:39:18,149
imagine they need anything else that
 

5431
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:20,270
imagine they need anything else that
makes my job harder right if if

5432
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:20,280
makes my job harder right if if
 

5433
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,939
makes my job harder right if if
everything crashed completely and every

5434
01:39:22,939 --> 01:39:22,949
everything crashed completely and every
 

5435
01:39:22,949 --> 01:39:24,589
everything crashed completely and every
student left the field and there was no

5436
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:24,599
student left the field and there was no
 

5437
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:26,359
student left the field and there was no
money for anybody to do anything and it

5438
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:26,369
money for anybody to do anything and it
 

5439
01:39:26,369 --> 01:39:27,830
money for anybody to do anything and it
became an embarrassment to talk about

5440
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
became an embarrassment to talk about
 

5441
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,299
became an embarrassment to talk about
machine intelligence an AI that wouldn't

5442
01:39:29,299 --> 01:39:29,309
machine intelligence an AI that wouldn't
 

5443
01:39:29,309 --> 01:39:31,609
machine intelligence an AI that wouldn't
be good for us either you want you want

5444
01:39:31,609 --> 01:39:31,619
be good for us either you want you want
 

5445
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:33,259
be good for us either you want you want
sort of the soft landing approach right

5446
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:33,269
sort of the soft landing approach right
 

5447
01:39:33,269 --> 01:39:35,959
sort of the soft landing approach right
you want enough people the senior people

5448
01:39:35,959 --> 01:39:35,969
you want enough people the senior people
 

5449
01:39:35,969 --> 01:39:37,729
you want enough people the senior people
in AI and machine learning say you know

5450
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:37,739
in AI and machine learning say you know
 

5451
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,350
in AI and machine learning say you know
we need other approaches we really need

5452
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:39,360
we need other approaches we really need
 

5453
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,029
we need other approaches we really need
other approaches but damn we need two

5454
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:41,039
other approaches but damn we need two
 

5455
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:42,709
other approaches but damn we need two
approaches maybe we should look to the

5456
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
approaches maybe we should look to the
 

5457
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,270
approaches maybe we should look to the
brain okay let's look the brain who's

5458
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:44,280
brain okay let's look the brain who's
 

5459
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,310
brain okay let's look the brain who's
got some brain ideas okay let's let's

5460
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
got some brain ideas okay let's let's
 

5461
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,779
got some brain ideas okay let's let's
start a little project on the side here

5462
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:47,789
start a little project on the side here
 

5463
01:39:47,789 --> 01:39:49,250
start a little project on the side here
trying to do brain idea related stuff

5464
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:49,260
trying to do brain idea related stuff
 

5465
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,679
trying to do brain idea related stuff
that's the ideal outcome we would want

5466
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:51,689
that's the ideal outcome we would want
 

5467
01:39:51,689 --> 01:39:54,500
that's the ideal outcome we would want
so I don't want a total winter and yet I

5468
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:54,510
so I don't want a total winter and yet I
 

5469
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,060
so I don't want a total winter and yet I
don't want it to be sunny all the time

5470
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:56,070
don't want it to be sunny all the time
 

5471
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:58,699
don't want it to be sunny all the time
you know so what do you think it takes

5472
01:39:58,699 --> 01:39:58,709
you know so what do you think it takes
 

5473
01:39:58,709 --> 01:40:01,040
you know so what do you think it takes
to build a system with human level

5474
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:01,050
to build a system with human level
 

5475
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:05,089
to build a system with human level
intelligence where once demonstrated you

5476
01:40:05,089 --> 01:40:05,099
intelligence where once demonstrated you
 

5477
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:07,369
intelligence where once demonstrated you
would be very impressed so does it have

5478
01:40:07,369 --> 01:40:07,379
would be very impressed so does it have
 

5479
01:40:07,379 --> 01:40:08,879
would be very impressed so does it have
to have a body this

5480
01:40:08,879 --> 01:40:08,889
to have a body this
 

5481
01:40:08,889 --> 01:40:12,239
to have a body this
have to have the the the c-word we used

5482
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:12,249
have to have the the the c-word we used
 

5483
01:40:12,249 --> 01:40:17,549
have to have the the the c-word we used
before consciousness as an entirety as a

5484
01:40:17,549 --> 01:40:17,559
before consciousness as an entirety as a
 

5485
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:19,529
before consciousness as an entirety as a
holistic sense first of all I don't

5486
01:40:19,529 --> 01:40:19,539
holistic sense first of all I don't
 

5487
01:40:19,539 --> 01:40:21,779
holistic sense first of all I don't
think the goal is to create a machine at

5488
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:21,789
think the goal is to create a machine at
 

5489
01:40:21,789 --> 01:40:23,939
think the goal is to create a machine at
his human level intelligence I think

5490
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:23,949
his human level intelligence I think
 

5491
01:40:23,949 --> 01:40:25,649
his human level intelligence I think
it's a false goal it back to Turing I

5492
01:40:25,649 --> 01:40:25,659
it's a false goal it back to Turing I
 

5493
01:40:25,659 --> 01:40:27,569
it's a false goal it back to Turing I
think it was a false statement we want

5494
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:27,579
think it was a false statement we want
 

5495
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:29,069
think it was a false statement we want
to understand what intelligence is and

5496
01:40:29,069 --> 01:40:29,079
to understand what intelligence is and
 

5497
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:30,270
to understand what intelligence is and
then we can build intelligent machines

5498
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:30,280
then we can build intelligent machines
 

5499
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,310
then we can build intelligent machines
of all different scales all different

5500
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:32,320
of all different scales all different
 

5501
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,679
of all different scales all different
capabilities you know a dog is

5502
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:34,689
capabilities you know a dog is
 

5503
01:40:34,689 --> 01:40:36,149
capabilities you know a dog is
intelligent I don't need you know that'd

5504
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:36,159
intelligent I don't need you know that'd
 

5505
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,830
intelligent I don't need you know that'd
be pretty good to have a dog yeah you

5506
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
be pretty good to have a dog yeah you
 

5507
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,270
be pretty good to have a dog yeah you
know but what about something that

5508
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
know but what about something that
 

5509
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,009
know but what about something that
doesn't look like an animal at all in

5510
01:40:41,009 --> 01:40:41,019
doesn't look like an animal at all in
 

5511
01:40:41,019 --> 01:40:43,259
doesn't look like an animal at all in
different spaces so my thinking about

5512
01:40:43,259 --> 01:40:43,269
different spaces so my thinking about
 

5513
01:40:43,269 --> 01:40:44,939
different spaces so my thinking about
this is that we want to define what

5514
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:44,949
this is that we want to define what
 

5515
01:40:44,949 --> 01:40:47,279
this is that we want to define what
intelligence says agree upon what makes

5516
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:47,289
intelligence says agree upon what makes
 

5517
01:40:47,289 --> 01:40:49,500
intelligence says agree upon what makes
an intelligence system we can then say

5518
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:49,510
an intelligence system we can then say
 

5519
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,149
an intelligence system we can then say
ok we're now going to build systems that

5520
01:40:51,149 --> 01:40:51,159
ok we're now going to build systems that
 

5521
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:53,339
ok we're now going to build systems that
work on those principles or some subset

5522
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:53,349
work on those principles or some subset
 

5523
01:40:53,349 --> 01:40:55,560
work on those principles or some subset
of them and we can apply them to all

5524
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,570
of them and we can apply them to all
 

5525
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,009
of them and we can apply them to all
different types of problems and the the

5526
01:40:59,009 --> 01:40:59,019
different types of problems and the the
 

5527
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,929
different types of problems and the the
kind of the idea it's not computing we

5528
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:00,939
kind of the idea it's not computing we
 

5529
01:41:00,939 --> 01:41:03,750
kind of the idea it's not computing we
don't ask if I take a little you know

5530
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:03,760
don't ask if I take a little you know
 

5531
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,729
don't ask if I take a little you know
little one ship computer I don't say

5532
01:41:05,729 --> 01:41:05,739
little one ship computer I don't say
 

5533
01:41:05,739 --> 01:41:07,049
little one ship computer I don't say
well that's not a computer because it's

5534
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:07,059
well that's not a computer because it's
 

5535
01:41:07,059 --> 01:41:09,029
well that's not a computer because it's
not as powerful is this you know big

5536
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:09,039
not as powerful is this you know big
 

5537
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:10,290
not as powerful is this you know big
server over here you know no because we

5538
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:10,300
server over here you know no because we
 

5539
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,310
server over here you know no because we
know that what the principles are

5540
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:11,320
know that what the principles are
 

5541
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,509
know that what the principles are
computing are and I can apply those

5542
01:41:12,509 --> 01:41:12,519
computing are and I can apply those
 

5543
01:41:12,519 --> 01:41:13,919
computing are and I can apply those
principles to a small problem into a big

5544
01:41:13,919 --> 01:41:13,929
principles to a small problem into a big
 

5545
01:41:13,929 --> 01:41:14,279
principles to a small problem into a big
problem

5546
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:14,289
problem
 

5547
01:41:14,289 --> 01:41:16,469
problem
insane intelligence needs to get there

5548
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:16,479
insane intelligence needs to get there
 

5549
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:17,639
insane intelligence needs to get there
we have to say these are the principles

5550
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:17,649
we have to say these are the principles
 

5551
01:41:17,649 --> 01:41:19,199
we have to say these are the principles
I can make a small one a big one I can

5552
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:19,209
I can make a small one a big one I can
 

5553
01:41:19,209 --> 01:41:20,279
I can make a small one a big one I can
make them distribute it I can put them

5554
01:41:20,279 --> 01:41:20,289
make them distribute it I can put them
 

5555
01:41:20,289 --> 01:41:21,959
make them distribute it I can put them
on different sensors they don't have to

5556
01:41:21,959 --> 01:41:21,969
on different sensors they don't have to
 

5557
01:41:21,969 --> 01:41:23,699
on different sensors they don't have to
be human like at all now you did bring

5558
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:23,709
be human like at all now you did bring
 

5559
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:24,779
be human like at all now you did bring
up a very interesting questions about

5560
01:41:24,779 --> 01:41:24,789
up a very interesting questions about
 

5561
01:41:24,789 --> 01:41:26,310
up a very interesting questions about
embodiment does that have to have my

5562
01:41:26,310 --> 01:41:26,320
embodiment does that have to have my
 

5563
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:29,250
embodiment does that have to have my
body it has to have some concept of

5564
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:29,260
body it has to have some concept of
 

5565
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,770
body it has to have some concept of
movement it has to be able to move

5566
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:31,780
movement it has to be able to move
 

5567
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,479
movement it has to be able to move
through these reference frames I talked

5568
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:33,489
through these reference frames I talked
 

5569
01:41:33,489 --> 01:41:35,459
through these reference frames I talked
about earlier I whether it's physically

5570
01:41:35,459 --> 01:41:35,469
about earlier I whether it's physically
 

5571
01:41:35,469 --> 01:41:36,929
about earlier I whether it's physically
moving like I need if I'm going to have

5572
01:41:36,929 --> 01:41:36,939
moving like I need if I'm going to have
 

5573
01:41:36,939 --> 01:41:38,909
moving like I need if I'm going to have
a a I that understands coffee cups it's

5574
01:41:38,909 --> 01:41:38,919
a a I that understands coffee cups it's
 

5575
01:41:38,919 --> 01:41:40,560
a a I that understands coffee cups it's
gonna have to pick up the coffee cup and

5576
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:40,570
gonna have to pick up the coffee cup and
 

5577
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:42,149
gonna have to pick up the coffee cup and
touch it and look at it with it with its

5578
01:41:42,149 --> 01:41:42,159
touch it and look at it with it with its
 

5579
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,739
touch it and look at it with it with its
eyes and hands or something equivalent

to that if I have a mathematical AI
 

5583
01:41:47,429 --> 01:41:49,620
to that if I have a mathematical AI
maybe it needs to move through

5584
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:49,630
maybe it needs to move through
 

5585
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,839
maybe it needs to move through
mathematical spaces I could have a

5586
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:51,849
mathematical spaces I could have a
 

5587
01:41:51,849 --> 01:41:55,139

self I was two different topics
 

5621
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:32,489
self I was two different topics
self-awareness or no the very narrow

01:42:40,709 --> 01:42:40,719
yeah the space was yeah yeah basically
 

5629
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,929
yeah the space was yeah yeah basically
the system the system needs to know its

01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:02,649
what why the heck it is that we have a
 

5647
01:43:02,649 --> 01:43:04,799
what why the heck it is that we have a
subjective experience at all yeah I

5648
01:43:04,799 --> 01:43:04,809
subjective experience at all yeah I
 

5649

effect it's interesting to think about I
 

5653
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:12,779
effect it's interesting to think about I
don't think it's useful as a means to

01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:12,789
don't think it's useful as a means to

don't think it's useful as a means to
figure out how to build intelligent

5656
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:14,499
figure out how to build intelligent
 

5657
01:43:14,499 --> 01:43:18,149
figure out how to build intelligent
machines it's it's something that

5658
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:18,159
machines it's it's something that
 

5659
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:21,029
machines it's it's something that
systems do and we can talk about what it

5660
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:21,039
systems do and we can talk about what it
 

5661
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:23,609
systems do and we can talk about what it
is that are like well I build the system

5662
01:43:23,609 --> 01:43:23,619
is that are like well I build the system
 

5663
01:43:23,619 --> 01:43:25,669
is that are like well I build the system
like this then it would be self-aware or

5664
01:43:25,669 --> 01:43:25,679
like this then it would be self-aware or
 

5665
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,719
like this then it would be self-aware or
and if I build it like this it wouldn't

5666
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:27,729
and if I build it like this it wouldn't
 

5667
01:43:27,729 --> 01:43:29,309
and if I build it like this it wouldn't
be self-aware so that's a choice I can

5668
01:43:29,309 --> 01:43:29,319
be self-aware so that's a choice I can
 

5669
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:31,709
be self-aware so that's a choice I can
have it's not like oh my god itself away

5670
01:43:31,709 --> 01:43:31,719
have it's not like oh my god itself away
 

5671
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:35,429
have it's not like oh my god itself away
I can't turn oh I I heard interview

5672
01:43:35,429 --> 01:43:35,439
I can't turn oh I I heard interview
 

5673
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:37,020
I can't turn oh I I heard interview
recently with this philosopher from Yale

5674
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:37,030
recently with this philosopher from Yale
 

5675
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:38,489
recently with this philosopher from Yale
I can't remember his name apologize for

5676
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:38,499
I can't remember his name apologize for
 

5677
01:43:38,499 --> 01:43:40,020
I can't remember his name apologize for
that but he was talking about well if

5678
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,030
that but he was talking about well if
 

5679
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:41,669
that but he was talking about well if
these computers are self-aware then it

5680
01:43:41,669 --> 01:43:41,679
these computers are self-aware then it
 

5681
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,169
these computers are self-aware then it
would be a crime to unplug them I'm like

5682
01:43:43,169 --> 01:43:43,179
would be a crime to unplug them I'm like
 

5683
01:43:43,179 --> 01:43:45,569
would be a crime to unplug them I'm like
oh come on you know I employed myself

5684
01:43:45,569 --> 01:43:45,579
oh come on you know I employed myself
 

5685
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:47,549
oh come on you know I employed myself
every night go to sleep what is that a

5686
01:43:47,549 --> 01:43:47,559
every night go to sleep what is that a
 

5687
01:43:47,559 --> 01:43:50,219
every night go to sleep what is that a
crime you know I plugged myself in again

5688
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:50,229
crime you know I plugged myself in again
 

5689
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:54,689
crime you know I plugged myself in again
in the morning I am so people get kind

5690
01:43:54,689 --> 01:43:54,699
in the morning I am so people get kind
 

5691
01:43:54,699 --> 01:43:56,250
in the morning I am so people get kind
of bent out of shape about this I have

5692
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:56,260
of bent out of shape about this I have
 

5693
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,559
of bent out of shape about this I have
very different very detailed

5694
01:43:58,559 --> 01:43:58,569
very different very detailed
 

5695
01:43:58,569 --> 01:44:01,319
very different very detailed
understanding or opinions about what it

5696
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:01,329
understanding or opinions about what it
 

5697
01:44:01,329 --> 01:44:02,819
understanding or opinions about what it
means to be conscious and what it means

5698
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:02,829
means to be conscious and what it means
 

5699
01:44:02,829 --> 01:44:05,879
means to be conscious and what it means
to be self-aware I don't think it's that

5700
01:44:05,879 --> 01:44:05,889
to be self-aware I don't think it's that
 

5701
01:44:05,889 --> 01:44:07,139
to be self-aware I don't think it's that
interesting a problem you've talked

5702
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:07,149
interesting a problem you've talked
 

5703
01:44:07,149 --> 01:44:08,939
interesting a problem you've talked
about Christoph caulk you know he thinks

5704
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:08,949
about Christoph caulk you know he thinks
 

5705
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:11,250
about Christoph caulk you know he thinks
that's the only problem I didn't

5706
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:11,260
that's the only problem I didn't
 

5707
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,239
that's the only problem I didn't
actually listen to your interview with

5708
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:12,249
actually listen to your interview with
 

5709
01:44:12,249 --> 01:44:15,119
actually listen to your interview with
him but I know him and I know that's the

5710
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:15,129
him but I know him and I know that's the
 

5711
01:44:15,129 --> 01:44:17,099
him but I know him and I know that's the
thing he also thinks intelligence the

5712
01:44:17,099 --> 01:44:17,109
thing he also thinks intelligence the
 

5713
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:19,020
thing he also thinks intelligence the
cautions are disjoint so I mean it's not

5714
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:19,030
cautions are disjoint so I mean it's not
 

5715
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:21,119
cautions are disjoint so I mean it's not
I don't have to have one or the other so

5716
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:21,129
I don't have to have one or the other so
 

5717
01:44:21,129 --> 01:44:22,979
I don't have to have one or the other so
he is I just agree with that I just

5718
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:22,989
he is I just agree with that I just
 

5719
01:44:22,989 --> 01:44:23,729
he is I just agree with that I just
totally agree with that

5720
01:44:23,729 --> 01:44:23,739
totally agree with that
 

5721
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:25,889
totally agree with that
so where's hear your thoughts the

5722
01:44:25,889 --> 01:44:25,899
so where's hear your thoughts the
 

5723
01:44:25,899 --> 01:44:27,149
so where's hear your thoughts the
cautions were doesn't emerge from

5724
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:27,159
cautions were doesn't emerge from
 

5725
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:29,159
cautions were doesn't emerge from
because it is so we then we have to

5726
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:29,169
because it is so we then we have to
 

5727
01:44:29,169 --> 01:44:30,629
because it is so we then we have to
break it down to the two parts okay

5728
01:44:30,629 --> 01:44:30,639
break it down to the two parts okay
 

5729
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,099
break it down to the two parts okay
because consciousness isn't one thing

5730
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:32,109
because consciousness isn't one thing
 

5731
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:33,750
because consciousness isn't one thing
that's part of the problem that term is

5732
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:33,760
that's part of the problem that term is
 

5733
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,679
that's part of the problem that term is
it means different things to different

5734
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:34,689
it means different things to different
 

5735
01:44:34,689 --> 01:44:35,310
it means different things to different
people

5736
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:35,320
people
 

5737
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:37,140
people
and there's different components of it

5738
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:37,150
and there's different components of it
 

5739
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:39,050
and there's different components of it
there is a concept of self-awareness

5740
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:39,060
there is a concept of self-awareness
 

5741
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:42,180
there is a concept of self-awareness
okay that it can be very easily

5742
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:42,190
okay that it can be very easily
 

5743
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:45,359
okay that it can be very easily
explained you have a model of your own

5744
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:45,369
explained you have a model of your own
 

5745
01:44:45,369 --> 01:44:45,780
explained you have a model of your own
body

5746
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:45,790
body
 

5747
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:47,850
body
the your cortex models the things in the

5748
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:47,860
the your cortex models the things in the
 

5749
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,620
the your cortex models the things in the
world and it also models your own body

5750
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:49,630
world and it also models your own body
 

5751
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:53,580
world and it also models your own body
and and then it has a memory it can

5752
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:53,590
and and then it has a memory it can
 

5753
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:56,370
and and then it has a memory it can
remember what you've done okay so it can

5754
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:56,380
remember what you've done okay so it can
 

5755
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,600
remember what you've done okay so it can
remember what you did this morning can

5756
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:57,610
remember what you did this morning can
 

5757
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,680
remember what you did this morning can
remember what you had for breakfast and

5758
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:58,690
remember what you had for breakfast and
 

5759
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:02,180
remember what you had for breakfast and
so on and so I can say to you okay Lex

5760
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:02,190
so on and so I can say to you okay Lex
 

5761
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:04,709
so on and so I can say to you okay Lex
were you conscious this morning when you

5762
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
were you conscious this morning when you
 

5763
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,050
were you conscious this morning when you
know I had your you know bagel and you'd

5764
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:07,060
know I had your you know bagel and you'd
 

5765
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,120
know I had your you know bagel and you'd
say yes I was conscious now what if I

5766
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,130
say yes I was conscious now what if I
 

5767
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:11,220
say yes I was conscious now what if I
could take your brain and revert all the

5768
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:11,230
could take your brain and revert all the
 

5769
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:12,600
could take your brain and revert all the
synapses back to the state they were

5770
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:12,610
synapses back to the state they were
 

5771
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:15,180
synapses back to the state they were
this morning and then I said to you Lex

5772
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:15,190
this morning and then I said to you Lex
 

5773
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:16,890
this morning and then I said to you Lex
were you conscious when you ate the

5774
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:16,900
were you conscious when you ate the
 

5775
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,209
were you conscious when you ate the
bagel you should know and I wasn't hot

5776
01:45:18,209 --> 01:45:18,219
bagel you should know and I wasn't hot
 

5777
01:45:18,219 --> 01:45:19,379
bagel you should know and I wasn't hot
just actually here's a video of eating

5778
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:19,389
just actually here's a video of eating
 

5779
01:45:19,389 --> 01:45:21,240
just actually here's a video of eating
the bagel he's saying I wasn't there I

5780
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:21,250
the bagel he's saying I wasn't there I
 

5781
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,520
the bagel he's saying I wasn't there I
have no I that's not possible because I

5782
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:23,530
have no I that's not possible because I
 

5783
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:24,959
have no I that's not possible because I
was I must have been unconscious at that

5784
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:24,969
was I must have been unconscious at that
 

5785
01:45:24,969 --> 01:45:26,790
was I must have been unconscious at that
time so we can just make this one-to-one

5786
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
time so we can just make this one-to-one
 

5787
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,680
time so we can just make this one-to-one
correlation between memory of your

5788
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:28,690
correlation between memory of your
 

5789
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,419
correlation between memory of your
body's trajectories through the world

5790
01:45:30,419 --> 01:45:30,429
body's trajectories through the world
 

5791
01:45:30,429 --> 01:45:32,520
body's trajectories through the world
over some period of time a memory that

5792
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:32,530
over some period of time a memory that
 

5793
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:34,260
over some period of time a memory that
and the ability to recall that memory is

5794
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:34,270
and the ability to recall that memory is
 

5795
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:36,089
and the ability to recall that memory is
what you would call conscious I was

5796
01:45:36,089 --> 01:45:36,099
what you would call conscious I was
 

5797
01:45:36,099 --> 01:45:37,490
what you would call conscious I was
conscious of that it's a self awareness

5798
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:37,500
conscious of that it's a self awareness
 

5799
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,950
conscious of that it's a self awareness
um and and in any system that can recall

5800
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:40,960
um and and in any system that can recall
 

5801
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,200
um and and in any system that can recall
memorize what it's done recently and

5802
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:43,210
memorize what it's done recently and
 

5803
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:45,660
memorize what it's done recently and
bring that back and invoke it again

5804
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:45,670
bring that back and invoke it again
 

5805
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:48,600
bring that back and invoke it again
would say yeah I'm aware I remember what

5806
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:48,610
would say yeah I'm aware I remember what
 

5807
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,479
would say yeah I'm aware I remember what
I did yeah all right I got it

5808
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:50,489
I did yeah all right I got it
 

5809
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:53,069
I did yeah all right I got it
that's an easy one although some people

5810
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:53,079
that's an easy one although some people
 

5811
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,990
that's an easy one although some people
think that's a hard one the more

5812
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:55,000
think that's a hard one the more
 

5813
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,450
think that's a hard one the more
challenging part of consciousness is

5814
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:57,460
challenging part of consciousness is
 

5815
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,280
challenging part of consciousness is
this one that sometimes you just go by

5816
01:45:59,280 --> 01:45:59,290
this one that sometimes you just go by
 

5817
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:02,339
this one that sometimes you just go by
the word of quality um which is you know

5818
01:46:02,339 --> 01:46:02,349
the word of quality um which is you know
 

5819
01:46:02,349 --> 01:46:05,609
the word of quality um which is you know
why does an object seem red or what is

5820
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:05,619
why does an object seem red or what is
 

5821
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:08,220
why does an object seem red or what is
pain and why just pain feel like

5822
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:08,230
pain and why just pain feel like
 

5823
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:10,530
pain and why just pain feel like
something why do I feel redness so what

5824
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:10,540
something why do I feel redness so what
 

5825
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:12,450
something why do I feel redness so what
do I feel a little pain is in no way and

5826
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:12,460
do I feel a little pain is in no way and
 

5827
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,129
do I feel a little pain is in no way and
then I could say well why does sight

5828
01:46:14,129 --> 01:46:14,139
then I could say well why does sight
 

5829
01:46:14,139 --> 01:46:15,540
then I could say well why does sight
seems different than just hearing you

5830
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:15,550
seems different than just hearing you
 

5831
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,830
seems different than just hearing you
know it's the same problem it's really

5832
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:16,840
know it's the same problem it's really
 

5833
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,810
know it's the same problem it's really
yeah these are all dis neurons and so

5834
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:18,820
yeah these are all dis neurons and so
 

5835
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:21,419
yeah these are all dis neurons and so
how is it that why does looking at you

5836
01:46:21,419 --> 01:46:21,429
how is it that why does looking at you
 

5837
01:46:21,429 --> 01:46:23,310
how is it that why does looking at you
feel different than you know I'm hearing

5838
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:23,320
feel different than you know I'm hearing
 

5839
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,560
feel different than you know I'm hearing
you it feels different but this is noise

5840
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:25,570
you it feels different but this is noise
 

5841
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:26,580
you it feels different but this is noise
in my head they're all doing the same

5842
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:26,590
in my head they're all doing the same
 

5843
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,879
in my head they're all doing the same
thing so that's the interesting question

5844
01:46:28,879 --> 01:46:28,889
thing so that's the interesting question
 

5845
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:31,439
thing so that's the interesting question
the best treatise I've read about this

5846
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:31,449
the best treatise I've read about this
 

5847
01:46:31,449 --> 01:46:32,640
the best treatise I've read about this
is by guy named Oh Reagan

5848
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:32,650
is by guy named Oh Reagan
 

5849
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:36,240
is by guy named Oh Reagan
or Regan he wrote a book called why red

5850
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:36,250
or Regan he wrote a book called why red
 

5851
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:39,229
or Regan he wrote a book called why red
doesn't sound like a bill it's a little

5852
01:46:39,229 --> 01:46:39,239
doesn't sound like a bill it's a little
 

5853
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,970
doesn't sound like a bill it's a little
it's not it's not a trade book easy read

5854
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:41,980
it's not it's not a trade book easy read
 

5855
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:44,370
it's not it's not a trade book easy read
but it and and it's an interesting

5856
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:44,380
but it and and it's an interesting
 

5857
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:47,620
but it and and it's an interesting
question take something like color

5858
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:47,630
question take something like color
 

5859
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:49,120
question take something like color
color really doesn't exist in the world

5860
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:49,130
color really doesn't exist in the world
 

5861
01:46:49,130 --> 01:46:50,589
color really doesn't exist in the world
it's not a property of the world

5862
01:46:50,589 --> 01:46:50,599
it's not a property of the world
 

5863
01:46:50,599 --> 01:46:53,200
it's not a property of the world
property the world that exists is light

5864
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:53,210
property the world that exists is light
 

5865
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:55,750
property the world that exists is light
frequency and that gets turned into we

5866
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:55,760
frequency and that gets turned into we
 

5867
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,939
frequency and that gets turned into we
have certain cells in the retina that

5868
01:46:57,939 --> 01:46:57,949
have certain cells in the retina that
 

5869
01:46:57,949 --> 01:46:59,260
have certain cells in the retina that
respond to different frequencies

5870
01:46:59,260 --> 01:46:59,270
respond to different frequencies
 

5871
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:00,850
respond to different frequencies
different than others and so when they

5872
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:00,860
different than others and so when they
 

5873
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,990
different than others and so when they
enter the brain you have a bunch of

5874
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,000
enter the brain you have a bunch of
 

5875
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,910
enter the brain you have a bunch of
axons that are firing at different rates

5876
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:03,920
axons that are firing at different rates
 

5877
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,000
axons that are firing at different rates
and from that we perceive color but

5878
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,010
and from that we perceive color but
 

5879
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:08,169
and from that we perceive color but
there is no color in the brain I mean

5880
01:47:08,169 --> 01:47:08,179
there is no color in the brain I mean
 

5881
01:47:08,179 --> 01:47:10,089
there is no color in the brain I mean
there's there's no color coming in on

5882
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:10,099
there's there's no color coming in on
 

5883
01:47:10,099 --> 01:47:11,740
there's there's no color coming in on
those synapses it's just a correlation

5884
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:11,750
those synapses it's just a correlation
 

5885
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:14,770
those synapses it's just a correlation
between some some some axons and some

5886
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:14,780
between some some some axons and some
 

5887
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:17,890
between some some some axons and some
property of frequency and that isn't

5888
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:17,900
property of frequency and that isn't
 

5889
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:19,629
property of frequency and that isn't
even color itself frequency doesn't have

5890
01:47:19,629 --> 01:47:19,639
even color itself frequency doesn't have
 

5891
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:22,080
even color itself frequency doesn't have
a color it's just a it's just what it is

5892
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,090
a color it's just a it's just what it is
 

5893
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:25,089
a color it's just a it's just what it is
so then the question is well why does it

5894
01:47:25,089 --> 01:47:25,099
so then the question is well why does it
 

5895
01:47:25,099 --> 01:47:28,120
so then the question is well why does it
even appear to have a color at all just

5896
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:28,130
even appear to have a color at all just
 

5897
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:29,649
even appear to have a color at all just
as you're describing it there seems to

5898
01:47:29,649 --> 01:47:29,659
as you're describing it there seems to
 

5899
01:47:29,659 --> 01:47:30,970
as you're describing it there seems to
be a connection of these those ideas of

5900
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:30,980
be a connection of these those ideas of
 

5901
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:34,379
be a connection of these those ideas of
reference frames I mean it just feels

5902
01:47:34,379 --> 01:47:34,389
reference frames I mean it just feels
 

5903
01:47:34,389 --> 01:47:38,020
reference frames I mean it just feels
like consciousness having the subject

5904
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:38,030
like consciousness having the subject
 

5905
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:41,200
like consciousness having the subject
assigning the feeling of red to the

5906
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:41,210
assigning the feeling of red to the
 

5907
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:45,250
assigning the feeling of red to the
actual color or to the wavelength it's

5908
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:45,260
actual color or to the wavelength it's
 

5909
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:48,850
actual color or to the wavelength it's
useful for intelligent that's a good way

5910
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:48,860
useful for intelligent that's a good way
 

5911
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,010
useful for intelligent that's a good way
putting it it's useful as a predictive

5912
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:51,020
putting it it's useful as a predictive
 

5913
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,240
putting it it's useful as a predictive
mechanism or useful there's a

5914
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:52,250
mechanism or useful there's a
 

5915
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:54,189
mechanism or useful there's a
generalization I did it's a way of

5916
01:47:54,189 --> 01:47:54,199
generalization I did it's a way of
 

5917
01:47:54,199 --> 01:47:55,810
generalization I did it's a way of
grouping things together to say it's

5918
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:55,820
grouping things together to say it's
 

5919
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:58,080
grouping things together to say it's
useful to have a model like this yeah

5920
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,090
useful to have a model like this yeah
 

5921
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:00,850
useful to have a model like this yeah
think about the the the there's a

5922
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:00,860
think about the the the there's a
 

5923
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:03,220
think about the the the there's a
well-known syndrome that people who've

5924
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:03,230
well-known syndrome that people who've
 

5925
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:05,379
well-known syndrome that people who've
lost a limb experience called phantom

5926
01:48:05,379 --> 01:48:05,389
lost a limb experience called phantom
 

5927
01:48:05,389 --> 01:48:10,390
lost a limb experience called phantom
limbs and what they claim is they can

5928
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:10,400
limbs and what they claim is they can
 

5929
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,760
limbs and what they claim is they can
have their arm is removed but they feel

5930
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:12,770
have their arm is removed but they feel
 

5931
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:14,229
have their arm is removed but they feel
their arm that not only feel it they

5932
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
their arm that not only feel it they
 

5933
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:17,080
their arm that not only feel it they
know it's there they it's there I can I

5934
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:17,090
know it's there they it's there I can I
 

5935
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,459
know it's there they it's there I can I
know it's there they'll swear to you

5936
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:18,469
know it's there they'll swear to you
 

5937
01:48:18,469 --> 01:48:19,569
know it's there they'll swear to you
that it's there and then they can feel

5938
01:48:19,569 --> 01:48:19,579
that it's there and then they can feel
 

5939
01:48:19,579 --> 01:48:21,819
that it's there and then they can feel
pain in the arm and feeling their finger

5940
01:48:21,819 --> 01:48:21,829
pain in the arm and feeling their finger
 

5941
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:23,470
pain in the arm and feeling their finger
in it they move their they move their

5942
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:23,480
in it they move their they move their
 

5943
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,419
in it they move their they move their
non-existent arm behind your back then

5944
01:48:25,419 --> 01:48:25,429
non-existent arm behind your back then
 

5945
01:48:25,429 --> 01:48:27,459
non-existent arm behind your back then
they feel the pain behind their back so

5946
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:27,469
they feel the pain behind their back so
 

5947
01:48:27,469 --> 01:48:30,220
they feel the pain behind their back so
this whole idea that your arm exists is

5948
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:30,230
this whole idea that your arm exists is
 

5949
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,350
this whole idea that your arm exists is
a model of your brain it may or may not

5950
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:32,360
a model of your brain it may or may not
 

5951
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,649
a model of your brain it may or may not
really exist and just like but it's

5952
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:35,659
really exist and just like but it's
 

5953
01:48:35,659 --> 01:48:38,649
really exist and just like but it's
useful to have a model of something that

5954
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:38,659
useful to have a model of something that
 

5955
01:48:38,659 --> 01:48:40,120
useful to have a model of something that
sort of correlates to things in the

5956
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:40,130
sort of correlates to things in the
 

5957
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,379
sort of correlates to things in the
world so you can make predictions about

5958
01:48:41,379 --> 01:48:41,389
world so you can make predictions about
 

5959
01:48:41,389 --> 01:48:42,430
world so you can make predictions about
what would happen when those things

5960
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:42,440
what would happen when those things
 

5961
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:44,770
what would happen when those things
occur it's a little bit of a fuzzy but I

5962
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:44,780
occur it's a little bit of a fuzzy but I
 

5963
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:45,970
occur it's a little bit of a fuzzy but I
think you're getting quite towards the

5964
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:45,980
think you're getting quite towards the
 

5965
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,890
think you're getting quite towards the
answer there it's it's useful for the

5966
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:47,900
answer there it's it's useful for the
 

5967
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,129
answer there it's it's useful for the
model of to express things certain ways

5968
01:48:51,129 --> 01:48:51,139
model of to express things certain ways
 

5969
01:48:51,139 --> 01:48:52,689
model of to express things certain ways
that we can then map them into these

5970
01:48:52,689 --> 01:48:52,699
that we can then map them into these
 

5971
01:48:52,699 --> 01:48:54,220
that we can then map them into these
reference frames and make predictions

5972
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:54,230
reference frames and make predictions
 

5973
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:56,830
reference frames and make predictions
about them I need to spend more time on

5974
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:56,840
about them I need to spend more time on
 

5975
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,109
about them I need to spend more time on
this topic it doesn't bother me do you

5976
01:48:59,109 --> 01:48:59,119
this topic it doesn't bother me do you
 

5977
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,080
this topic it doesn't bother me do you
really need to spend more time yeah

5978
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,090
really need to spend more time yeah
 

5979
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:03,480
really need to spend more time yeah
yeah it does feel special that we have

5980
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:03,490
yeah it does feel special that we have
 

5981
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:05,880
yeah it does feel special that we have
subjective experience but I'm yet to

5982
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:05,890
subjective experience but I'm yet to
 

5983
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:08,370
subjective experience but I'm yet to
know why I'm just I'm just personally

5984
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:08,380
know why I'm just I'm just personally
 

5985
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,900
know why I'm just I'm just personally
curious it's not it's not necessary for

5986
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:09,910
curious it's not it's not necessary for
 

5987
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:12,000
curious it's not it's not necessary for
the work we're doing here I don't think

5988
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,010
the work we're doing here I don't think
 

5989
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,440
the work we're doing here I don't think
I need to solve that problem to build

5990
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:13,450
I need to solve that problem to build
 

5991
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:15,210
I need to solve that problem to build
intelligent machines at all not at all

5992
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:15,220
intelligent machines at all not at all
 

5993
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,520
intelligent machines at all not at all
but there is so the the silly notion

5994
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:17,530
but there is so the the silly notion
 

5995
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:21,060
but there is so the the silly notion
that you described briefly that doesn't

5996
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:21,070
that you described briefly that doesn't
 

5997
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:23,370
that you described briefly that doesn't
seem so silly does humans is you know if

5998
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:23,380
seem so silly does humans is you know if
 

5999
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:24,950
seem so silly does humans is you know if
you're successful building intelligent

6000
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
you're successful building intelligent
 

6001
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,070
you're successful building intelligent
machines it feels wrong to then turn

6002
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:29,080
machines it feels wrong to then turn
 

6003
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,850
machines it feels wrong to then turn
them off

6004
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:29,860
them off
 

6005
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,800
them off
because if you're able to build a lot of

6006
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:31,810
because if you're able to build a lot of
 

6007
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:35,690
because if you're able to build a lot of
them it feels wrong to then be able to

6008
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:35,700
them it feels wrong to then be able to
 

6009
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:39,690
them it feels wrong to then be able to
you know to turn off the Y but just be

6010
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:39,700
you know to turn off the Y but just be
 

6011
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:41,820
you know to turn off the Y but just be
let's let's break it down a bit as

6012
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:41,830
let's let's break it down a bit as
 

6013
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:44,100
let's let's break it down a bit as
humans why do we fear death there's

6014
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:44,110
humans why do we fear death there's
 

6015
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:47,130
humans why do we fear death there's
there's two reasons we fear death well

6016
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:47,140
there's two reasons we fear death well
 

6017
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,180
there's two reasons we fear death well
first of all stay when you're dead

6018
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:48,190
first of all stay when you're dead
 

6019
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,380
first of all stay when you're dead
doesn't matter oh okay

6020
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:49,390
doesn't matter oh okay
 

6021
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:51,600
doesn't matter oh okay
you're doing it so why do we fear death

6022
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:51,610
you're doing it so why do we fear death
 

6023
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:53,730
you're doing it so why do we fear death
we fear death for two reasons one is

6024
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:53,740
we fear death for two reasons one is
 

6025
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,460
we fear death for two reasons one is
because we are programmed genetically to

6026
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:56,470
because we are programmed genetically to
 

6027
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:59,580
because we are programmed genetically to
fear death that's a that's a survival

6028
01:49:59,580 --> 01:49:59,590
fear death that's a that's a survival
 

6029
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:03,150
fear death that's a that's a survival
and propagating the genes thing and we

6030
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:03,160
and propagating the genes thing and we
 

6031
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,220
and propagating the genes thing and we
also a program to feel sad when people

6032
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:05,230
also a program to feel sad when people
 

6033
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:06,330
also a program to feel sad when people
we know die

6034
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:06,340
we know die
 

6035
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,010
we know die
we don't feel sad for someone we don't

6036
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:08,020
we don't feel sad for someone we don't
 

6037
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:09,300
we don't feel sad for someone we don't
know dies it's people dying right now

6038
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:09,310
know dies it's people dying right now
 

6039
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:10,680
know dies it's people dying right now
they're always come saying I'm so bad

6040
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:10,690
they're always come saying I'm so bad
 

6041
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,850
they're always come saying I'm so bad
about because I don't know them but I

6042
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:11,860
about because I don't know them but I
 

6043
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:14,400
about because I don't know them but I
knew them I'd feel really bad so again

6044
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:14,410
knew them I'd feel really bad so again
 

6045
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:17,430
knew them I'd feel really bad so again
this these are old brain genetically

6046
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
this these are old brain genetically
 

6047
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,530
this these are old brain genetically
embedded things that we fear death

6048
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:19,540
embedded things that we fear death
 

6049
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:21,900
embedded things that we fear death
there's outside of those those

6050
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:21,910
there's outside of those those

and one day I didn't wake up where what
what pain in the world would there exist

6126
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:56,320
what pain in the world would there exist
 

6127
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,310
what pain in the world would there exist
well so most people that think about

6128
01:51:59,310 --> 01:51:59,320
well so most people that think about
 

6129
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,600
well so most people that think about
this problem would say that you're just

6130
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:00,610
this problem would say that you're just
 

6131
01:52:00,610 --> 01:52:03,030
this problem would say that you're just
deeply enlightened or are completely

6132
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,040
deeply enlightened or are completely
 

6133
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:07,590
deeply enlightened or are completely
delusional but I would say I would say

6134
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:07,600
delusional but I would say I would say
 

6135
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,680
delusional but I would say I would say
that's a very light enlightened way to

6136
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:10,690
that's a very light enlightened way to
 

6137
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:13,530
that's a very light enlightened way to
see the world is that that's the

6138
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:13,540
see the world is that that's the
 

6139
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:16,470
see the world is that that's the
rational rational that's right but the

6140
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,480
rational rational that's right but the
 

6141
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,000
rational rational that's right but the
fact is we don't I mean we really don't

6142
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,010
fact is we don't I mean we really don't
 

6143
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:23,100
fact is we don't I mean we really don't
have an understanding of why the heck it

6144
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,110
have an understanding of why the heck it
 

6145
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:25,260
have an understanding of why the heck it
is were born and why we die and what

6146
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:25,270
is were born and why we die and what
 

6147
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:26,760
is were born and why we die and what
happens after well maybe there isn't a

6148
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:26,770
happens after well maybe there isn't a
 

6149
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,500
happens after well maybe there isn't a
reason maybe there is so I mentioned

6150
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:28,510
reason maybe there is so I mentioned
 

6151
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,330
reason maybe there is so I mentioned
those big problems too right you know

6152
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:30,340
those big problems too right you know
 

6153
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:32,490
those big problems too right you know
you you interviewed max tegmark you know

6154
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:32,500
you you interviewed max tegmark you know
 

6155
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,690
you you interviewed max tegmark you know
and there's people like that right I'm

6156
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:33,700
and there's people like that right I'm
 

6157
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:35,870
and there's people like that right I'm
missing those big problems as well and

6158
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:35,880
missing those big problems as well and
 

6159
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,820
missing those big problems as well and
in fact when I was young I made a list

6160
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:38,830
in fact when I was young I made a list
 

6161
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,980
in fact when I was young I made a list
of the biggest problems I could think of

6162
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:40,990
of the biggest problems I could think of
 

6163
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:44,070
of the biggest problems I could think of
first why is anything exists second why

6164
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:44,080
first why is anything exists second why
 

6165
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,810
first why is anything exists second why
did we have the laws of physics that we

6166
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:45,820
did we have the laws of physics that we
 

6167
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:49,590
did we have the laws of physics that we
have third is life inevitable and why is

6168
01:52:49,590 --> 01:52:49,600
have third is life inevitable and why is
 

6169
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,570
have third is life inevitable and why is
it here fourth is intelligence

6170
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:51,580
it here fourth is intelligence
 

6171
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:53,550
it here fourth is intelligence
inevitable and why is it here I stopped

6172
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:53,560
inevitable and why is it here I stopped
 

6173
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:55,590
inevitable and why is it here I stopped
there because I figured if you can make

6174
01:52:55,590 --> 01:52:55,600
there because I figured if you can make
 

6175
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,500
there because I figured if you can make
a truly intelligent system will be that

6176
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:58,510
a truly intelligent system will be that
 

6177
01:52:58,510 --> 01:52:59,730
a truly intelligent system will be that
will be the quickest way to answer the

6178
01:52:59,730 --> 01:52:59,740
will be the quickest way to answer the
 

6179
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:04,170
will be the quickest way to answer the
first three questions I'm serious yeah

6180
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:04,180
first three questions I'm serious yeah
 

6181
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,290
first three questions I'm serious yeah
and and so I said my mission I mean I

6182
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:07,300
and and so I said my mission I mean I
 

6183
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,730
and and so I said my mission I mean I
you asked me earlier my first missions

6184
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:08,740
you asked me earlier my first missions
 

6185
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,200
you asked me earlier my first missions
understand the brain but I felt that is

6186
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:10,210
understand the brain but I felt that is
 

6187
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:11,550
understand the brain but I felt that is
the shortest way to get to true machine

6188
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:11,560
the shortest way to get to true machine
 

6189
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,050
the shortest way to get to true machine
intelligence and I want to get the true

6190
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:13,060
intelligence and I want to get the true
 

6191
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,820
intelligence and I want to get the true
machine tells us because even if it

6192
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:14,830
machine tells us because even if it
 

6193
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,080
machine tells us because even if it
doesn't occur in my lifetime other

6194
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:16,090
doesn't occur in my lifetime other
 

6195
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,180
doesn't occur in my lifetime other
people will benefit from it because I

6196
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:18,190
people will benefit from it because I
 

6197
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:19,500
people will benefit from it because I
think it'll occur in my lifetime but you

6198
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:19,510
think it'll occur in my lifetime but you
 

6199
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,880
think it'll occur in my lifetime but you
know 20 years it's you never know and

6200
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:22,890
know 20 years it's you never know and
 

6201
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:25,170
know 20 years it's you never know and
but that would be the quickest way for

6202
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,180
but that would be the quickest way for
 

6203
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,120
but that would be the quickest way for
us to you know we can make super

6204
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:27,130
us to you know we can make super
 

6205
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:28,700
us to you know we can make super
mathematicians we can make soup

6206
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:28,710
mathematicians we can make soup
 

6207
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:31,040
mathematicians we can make soup
space explorers we can make super

6208
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:31,050
space explorers we can make super
 

6209
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:33,709
space explorers we can make super
physicists brains that do these things

6210
01:53:33,709 --> 01:53:33,719
physicists brains that do these things
 

6211
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:36,770
physicists brains that do these things
and that can run experiments that we

6212
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:36,780
and that can run experiments that we
 

6213
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,690
and that can run experiments that we
can't run we don't have the abilities to

6214
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:38,700
can't run we don't have the abilities to
 

6215
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,760
can't run we don't have the abilities to
manipulate things and so on but we can

6216
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:40,770
manipulate things and so on but we can
 

6217
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:41,990
manipulate things and so on but we can
build intelligent machines that do all

6218
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:42,000
build intelligent machines that do all
 

6219
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,670
build intelligent machines that do all
those things and with the ultimate goal

6220
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:43,680
those things and with the ultimate goal
 

6221
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,940
those things and with the ultimate goal
of finding out the answers to the other

6222
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:46,950
of finding out the answers to the other
 

6223
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:49,640
of finding out the answers to the other
questions let me ask you know the

6224
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:49,650
questions let me ask you know the
 

6225
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:51,680
questions let me ask you know the
depressing and difficult question which

6226
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:51,690
depressing and difficult question which
 

6227
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:56,780
depressing and difficult question which
is once we achieved that goal do you of

6228
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:56,790
is once we achieved that goal do you of
 

6229
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:59,390
is once we achieved that goal do you of
creating it over know of understanding

6230
01:53:59,390 --> 01:53:59,400
creating it over know of understanding
 

6231
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,300
creating it over know of understanding
intelligence do you think we would be

6232
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,310
intelligence do you think we would be
 

6233
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:04,729
intelligence do you think we would be
happier more fulfilled as a species

6234
01:54:04,729 --> 01:54:04,739
happier more fulfilled as a species
 

6235
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,320
happier more fulfilled as a species
the understand intelligent understanding

6236
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:06,330
the understand intelligent understanding
 

6237
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:07,520
the understand intelligent understanding
the answers to the big questions

6238
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:07,530
the answers to the big questions
 

6239
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:10,220
the answers to the big questions
understanding intelligence Oh totally

6240
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:10,230
understanding intelligence Oh totally
 

6241
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:14,060
understanding intelligence Oh totally
totally for more fun place to live you

6242
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:14,070
totally for more fun place to live you
 

6243
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:17,959
totally for more fun place to live you
think so oh yeah I mean beside this you

6244
01:54:17,959 --> 01:54:17,969
think so oh yeah I mean beside this you
 

6245
01:54:17,969 --> 01:54:21,470
think so oh yeah I mean beside this you
know terminator nonsense and and and and

6246
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:21,480
know terminator nonsense and and and and
 

6247
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:24,470
know terminator nonsense and and and and
just think about you can think about we

6248
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:24,480
just think about you can think about we
 

6249
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,910
just think about you can think about we
can talk about the risk of AI if you

6250
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:25,920
can talk about the risk of AI if you
 

6251
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,120
can talk about the risk of AI if you
want I'd love to so let's uh I think

6252
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:29,130
want I'd love to so let's uh I think
 

6253
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:30,590
want I'd love to so let's uh I think
world's before better knowing things

6254
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:30,600
world's before better knowing things
 

6255
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,180
world's before better knowing things
we're always better than no things do

6256
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:32,190
we're always better than no things do
 

6257
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:34,130
we're always better than no things do
you think it's better better place to

6258
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:34,140
you think it's better better place to
 

6259
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:36,229
you think it's better better place to
work the living that I know that our

6260
01:54:36,229 --> 01:54:36,239
work the living that I know that our
 

6261
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:37,880
work the living that I know that our
planet is one of many in the solar

6262
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:37,890
planet is one of many in the solar
 

6263
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:39,290
planet is one of many in the solar
system and the soleus is one of many of

6264
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:39,300
system and the soleus is one of many of
 

6265
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,030
system and the soleus is one of many of
the calluses I think it's a more I I

6266
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:41,040
the calluses I think it's a more I I
 

6267

01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:42,930
dread I used to I sometimes think like
 

6269
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:44,720
dread I used to I sometimes think like
God what would be like the list three

6270
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:44,730
God what would be like the list three
 

6271
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:45,830
God what would be like the list three
hundred years ago I'd be looking at the

6272
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:45,840
hundred years ago I'd be looking at the
 

6273
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,510
hundred years ago I'd be looking at the
sky god I can't understand anything oh

6274
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:47,520
sky god I can't understand anything oh
 

6275
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,830
sky god I can't understand anything oh
my god I'd be like throwing a bit of

6276
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:48,840
my god I'd be like throwing a bit of
 

6277
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,330
my god I'd be like throwing a bit of
light going what's going on here well I

6278
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:50,340
light going what's going on here well I
 

6279
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,640
light going what's going on here well I
mean in some sense I agree with you but

6280
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:52,650
mean in some sense I agree with you but
 

6281
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:55,370
mean in some sense I agree with you but
I'm not exactly sure that I'm also a

6282
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:55,380
I'm not exactly sure that I'm also a
 

6283
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:57,200
I'm not exactly sure that I'm also a
scientist so I have I share you've used

6284
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:57,210
scientist so I have I share you've used
 

6285
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:59,840
scientist so I have I share you've used
but I'm not we're like rolling down the

6286
01:54:59,840 --> 01:54:59,850
but I'm not we're like rolling down the
 

6287
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:03,380
but I'm not we're like rolling down the
hill together oh oh what's down the hill

6288
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:03,390
hill together oh oh what's down the hill
 

6289
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:05,600
hill together oh oh what's down the hill
I feel for climbing a hill whatever

6290
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:05,610
I feel for climbing a hill whatever
 

6291
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:06,950
I feel for climbing a hill whatever
anything cooler getting closer to

6295
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,810

we're climbing we're getting pulled up a

6296
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:11,820
we're climbing we're getting pulled up a
 

6297
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:14,360
we're climbing we're getting pulled up a
hill the way you're putting our polio

6298
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:14,370
hill the way you're putting our polio
 

6299
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:15,860
hill the way you're putting our polio
studies put we're pulling ourselves up

6300
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:15,870
studies put we're pulling ourselves up
 

6301
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:16,910
studies put we're pulling ourselves up
the hill by our curiosity

6302
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:16,920
the hill by our curiosity
 

6303
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,650
the hill by our curiosity
yeah Sisyphus is doing the same thing

6304
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:18,660
yeah Sisyphus is doing the same thing
 

6305
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:20,720
yeah Sisyphus is doing the same thing
with the rock yeah yeah

6306
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:20,730
with the rock yeah yeah
 

6307
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:23,330
with the rock yeah yeah
but okay our happiness decide do you

6308
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:23,340
but okay our happiness decide do you
 

6309
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:26,180
but okay our happiness decide do you
have concerns about you know you talk

6310
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:26,190
have concerns about you know you talk
 

6311
01:55:26,190 --> 01:55:28,930
have concerns about you know you talk
about sam harris you know a musk of

6312
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:28,940
about sam harris you know a musk of
 

6313
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:31,130
about sam harris you know a musk of
existential threats of

6314
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:31,140
existential threats of
 

6315
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,479
existential threats of
intelligence no I'm not worried about

6316
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:32,489
intelligence no I'm not worried about
 

6317
01:55:32,489 --> 01:55:35,060
intelligence no I'm not worried about
exercise there are there are some things

6318
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:35,070
exercise there are there are some things
 

6319
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:36,470
exercise there are there are some things
we really do need to worry about even

6320
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,480
we really do need to worry about even
 

6321
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,510
we really do need to worry about even
today's things we have to worry about we

6322
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:38,520
today's things we have to worry about we
 

6323
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,950
today's things we have to worry about we
have to worry about privacy and about

6324
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:39,960
have to worry about privacy and about
 

6325
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,530
have to worry about privacy and about
how impacts false beliefs in the world

6326
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:42,540
how impacts false beliefs in the world
 

6327
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:46,040
how impacts false beliefs in the world
and and we have real problems that and

6328
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:46,050
and and we have real problems that and
 

6329
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:48,470
and and we have real problems that and
things to worry about with today's AI

6330
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
things to worry about with today's AI
 

6331
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,270
things to worry about with today's AI
and that will continue as we create more

6332
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:50,280
and that will continue as we create more
 

6333
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:52,010
and that will continue as we create more
intelligent systems there's no question

6334
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:52,020
intelligent systems there's no question
 

6335
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,080
intelligent systems there's no question
you know the whole issue about you know

6336
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,090
you know the whole issue about you know
 

6337
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:56,930
you know the whole issue about you know
making intelligent armament and weapons

6338
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:56,940
making intelligent armament and weapons
 

6339
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:58,459
making intelligent armament and weapons
it's something that really we have to

6340
01:55:58,459 --> 01:55:58,469
it's something that really we have to
 

6341
01:55:58,469 --> 01:56:00,440
it's something that really we have to
think about carefully I don't think of

6342
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:00,450
think about carefully I don't think of
 

6343
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:02,150
think about carefully I don't think of
those as existential threats I think

6344
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:02,160
those as existential threats I think
 

6345
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,770
those as existential threats I think
those are the kind of threats we always

6346
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:03,780
those are the kind of threats we always
 

6347
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:05,660
those are the kind of threats we always
face and we all have to face them here

6348
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:05,670
face and we all have to face them here
 

6349
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:09,170
face and we all have to face them here
and hope to deal with them

6350
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:09,180
and hope to deal with them
 

6351
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,120
and hope to deal with them
the ie we can we could talk about what

6352
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:11,130
the ie we can we could talk about what
 

6353
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,190
the ie we can we could talk about what
people think are the existential threats

6354
01:56:13,190 --> 01:56:13,200
people think are the existential threats
 

6355
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,890
people think are the existential threats
but when I hear people talking about

6356
01:56:15,890 --> 01:56:15,900
but when I hear people talking about
 

6357
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,900
but when I hear people talking about
them they all sound hollow to me they're

6358
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:17,910
them they all sound hollow to me they're
 

6359
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:19,640
them they all sound hollow to me they're
based on ideas they're based on people

6360
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:19,650
based on ideas they're based on people
 

6361
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:20,930
based on ideas they're based on people
who really have no idea what

6362
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:20,940
who really have no idea what
 

6363
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,870
who really have no idea what
intelligence is and and if they knew

6364
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:23,880
intelligence is and and if they knew
 

6365
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,400
intelligence is and and if they knew
what intelligence was they wouldn't say

6366
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:25,410
what intelligence was they wouldn't say
 

6367
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,920
what intelligence was they wouldn't say
those things so those are not experts in

6368
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:27,930
those things so those are not experts in
 

6369
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:30,800
those things so those are not experts in
the field in at home so yeah so there's

6370
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:30,810
the field in at home so yeah so there's
 

6371
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:33,020
the field in at home so yeah so there's
two right there's so one is like super

6372
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:33,030
two right there's so one is like super
 

6373
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:34,790
two right there's so one is like super
intelligence so a system that becomes

6374
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:34,800
intelligence so a system that becomes
 

6375
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:41,200
intelligence so a system that becomes
far far superior in reasoning ability

6376
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:41,210
far far superior in reasoning ability
 

6377
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:43,640
far far superior in reasoning ability
than us humans how is that an

6378
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:43,650
than us humans how is that an
 

6379
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:48,080
than us humans how is that an
existential threat then so there's a lot

6380
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:48,090
existential threat then so there's a lot
 

6381
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:49,820
existential threat then so there's a lot
of ways in which it could be one way as

6382
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:49,830
of ways in which it could be one way as
 

6383
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:53,120
of ways in which it could be one way as
us humans are actually irrational

6384
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,130
us humans are actually irrational
 

6385
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:59,750
us humans are actually irrational
inefficient and get in the way of of not

6386
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
inefficient and get in the way of of not
 

6387
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,250
inefficient and get in the way of of not
happiness but whatever the objective

6388
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:01,260
happiness but whatever the objective
 

6389
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,470
happiness but whatever the objective
function is of maximizing that objective

6390
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:03,480
function is of maximizing that objective
 

6391
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,090
function is of maximizing that objective
function yeah super intelligent

6392
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:05,100
function yeah super intelligent
 

6393
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,979
function yeah super intelligent
paperclip problem things like but so the

6394
01:57:06,979 --> 01:57:06,989
paperclip problem things like but so the
 

6395
01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:08,630
paperclip problem things like but so the
paperclip problem but with a super

6396
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:08,640
paperclip problem but with a super
 

6397
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:12,260
paperclip problem but with a super
intelligent yeah so we already face this

6398
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:12,270
intelligent yeah so we already face this
 

6399
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:15,159
intelligent yeah so we already face this
threat in some sense

6400
01:57:15,159 --> 01:57:15,169
threat in some sense
 

6401
01:57:15,169 --> 01:57:17,589
threat in some sense
they're called bacteria these are

6402
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
they're called bacteria these are
 

6403
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,389
they're called bacteria these are
organisms in the world that would like

6404
01:57:19,389 --> 01:57:19,399
organisms in the world that would like
 

6405
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:21,129
organisms in the world that would like
to turn everything into bacteria and

6406
01:57:21,129 --> 01:57:21,139
to turn everything into bacteria and
 

6407
01:57:21,139 --> 01:57:23,139
to turn everything into bacteria and
they're constantly morphing they're

6408
01:57:23,139 --> 01:57:23,149
they're constantly morphing they're
 

6409
01:57:23,149 --> 01:57:25,000
they're constantly morphing they're
constantly changing to evade our

6410
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,010
constantly changing to evade our
 

6411
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:28,089
constantly changing to evade our
protections and in the past they have

6412
01:57:28,089 --> 01:57:28,099
protections and in the past they have
 

6413
01:57:28,099 --> 01:57:31,479
protections and in the past they have
killed huge swathes of populations of

6414
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:31,489
killed huge swathes of populations of
 

6415
01:57:31,489 --> 01:57:33,850
killed huge swathes of populations of
humans on this planet so if you want to

6416
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:33,860
humans on this planet so if you want to
 

6417
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:34,929
humans on this planet so if you want to
worry about something that's going to

6418
01:57:34,929 --> 01:57:34,939
worry about something that's going to
 

6419
01:57:34,939 --> 01:57:39,159
worry about something that's going to
multiply endlessly we have it and I'm

6420
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:39,169
multiply endlessly we have it and I'm
 

6421
01:57:39,169 --> 01:57:40,989
multiply endlessly we have it and I'm
far more worried in that regard I'm far

6422
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:40,999
far more worried in that regard I'm far
 

6423
01:57:40,999 --> 01:57:42,729
far more worried in that regard I'm far
more worried that some scientists in a

6424
01:57:42,729 --> 01:57:42,739
more worried that some scientists in a
 

6425
01:57:42,739 --> 01:57:44,679
more worried that some scientists in a
laboratory will create a super virus or

6426
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:44,689
laboratory will create a super virus or
 

6427
01:57:44,689 --> 01:57:46,290
laboratory will create a super virus or
a super bacteria that we cannot control

6428
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:46,300
a super bacteria that we cannot control
 

6429
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:49,959
a super bacteria that we cannot control
that is a more existential strep putting

6430
01:57:49,959 --> 01:57:49,969
that is a more existential strep putting
 

6431
01:57:49,969 --> 01:57:52,060
that is a more existential strep putting
putting in its halogen thing on top of

6432
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:52,070
putting in its halogen thing on top of
 

6433
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:53,259
putting in its halogen thing on top of
it actually seems to make it less

6434
01:57:53,259 --> 01:57:53,269
it actually seems to make it less
 

6435
01:57:53,269 --> 01:57:55,569
it actually seems to make it less
existential to me it's like it's it

6436
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:55,579
existential to me it's like it's it
 

6437
01:57:55,579 --> 01:57:57,429
existential to me it's like it's it
limits its power is limits where it can

6438
01:57:57,429 --> 01:57:57,439
limits its power is limits where it can
 

6439
01:57:57,439 --> 01:57:58,569
limits its power is limits where it can
go and limits the number of things that

6440
01:57:58,569 --> 01:57:58,579
go and limits the number of things that
 

6441
01:57:58,579 --> 01:58:00,399
go and limits the number of things that
can do in many ways a bacteria is

6442
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:00,409
can do in many ways a bacteria is
 

6443
01:58:00,409 --> 01:58:02,020
can do in many ways a bacteria is
something you can't you can't even see

6444
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:02,030
something you can't you can't even see
 

6445
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:04,209
something you can't you can't even see
so that's the only one of those problems

6446
01:58:04,209 --> 01:58:04,219
so that's the only one of those problems
 

6447
01:58:04,219 --> 01:58:07,810
so that's the only one of those problems
yes exactly so the the other one just in

6448
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:07,820
yes exactly so the the other one just in
 

6449
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:09,729
yes exactly so the the other one just in
your intuition about intelligent you

6450
01:58:09,729 --> 01:58:09,739
your intuition about intelligent you
 

6451
01:58:09,739 --> 01:58:12,549
your intuition about intelligent you
think about intelligence as humans do

6452
01:58:12,549 --> 01:58:12,559
think about intelligence as humans do
 

6453
01:58:12,559 --> 01:58:15,399
think about intelligence as humans do
you think of that as something if you

6454
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:15,409
you think of that as something if you
 

6455
01:58:15,409 --> 01:58:17,080
you think of that as something if you
look at intelligence on a spectrum from

6456
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:17,090
look at intelligence on a spectrum from
 

6457
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:19,929
look at intelligence on a spectrum from
zero to us humans do you think you can

6458
01:58:19,929 --> 01:58:19,939
zero to us humans do you think you can
 

6459
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:22,209
zero to us humans do you think you can
scale that to something far superior

6460
01:58:22,209 --> 01:58:22,219
scale that to something far superior
 

6461
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:24,969
scale that to something far superior
yeah all the mechanisms with me I want

6462
01:58:24,969 --> 01:58:24,979
yeah all the mechanisms with me I want
 

6463
01:58:24,979 --> 01:58:26,109
yeah all the mechanisms with me I want
to make another point here that Lex

6464
01:58:26,109 --> 01:58:26,119
to make another point here that Lex
 

6465
01:58:26,119 --> 01:58:29,229
to make another point here that Lex
before I get there sure intelligence is

6466
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:29,239
before I get there sure intelligence is
 

6467
01:58:29,239 --> 01:58:32,310
before I get there sure intelligence is
the neocortex it is not the entire brain

6468
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:32,320
the neocortex it is not the entire brain
 

6469
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,649
the neocortex it is not the entire brain
if I the goal is not to be make a human

6470
01:58:35,649 --> 01:58:35,659
if I the goal is not to be make a human
 

6471
01:58:35,659 --> 01:58:37,569
if I the goal is not to be make a human
the goal is not to make an emotional

6472
01:58:37,569 --> 01:58:37,579
the goal is not to make an emotional
 

6473
01:58:37,579 --> 01:58:39,369
the goal is not to make an emotional
system the goal is not to make a system

6474
01:58:39,369 --> 01:58:39,379
system the goal is not to make a system
 

6475
01:58:39,379 --> 01:58:41,379
system the goal is not to make a system
that wants to have sex and reproduce

6476
01:58:41,379 --> 01:58:41,389
that wants to have sex and reproduce
 

6477
01:58:41,389 --> 01:58:43,299
that wants to have sex and reproduce
why would I build that if I want to have

6478
01:58:43,299 --> 01:58:43,309
why would I build that if I want to have
 

6479
01:58:43,309 --> 01:58:44,619
why would I build that if I want to have
a system that wants to reproduce enough

6480
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:44,629
a system that wants to reproduce enough
 

6481
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:46,959
a system that wants to reproduce enough
sex make bacteria make computer viruses

6482
01:58:46,959 --> 01:58:46,969
sex make bacteria make computer viruses
 

6483
01:58:46,969 --> 01:58:49,600
sex make bacteria make computer viruses
those are bad things don't do that just

6484
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:49,610
those are bad things don't do that just
 

6485
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:51,100
those are bad things don't do that just
those are really bad don't do those

6486
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:51,110
those are really bad don't do those
 

6487
01:58:51,110 --> 01:58:54,549
those are really bad don't do those
things regulate those but if I just say

6488
01:58:54,549 --> 01:58:54,559
things regulate those but if I just say
 

6489
01:58:54,559 --> 01:58:56,560
things regulate those but if I just say
I want to intelligent system why does it

6490
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:56,570
I want to intelligent system why does it
 

6491
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:58,600
I want to intelligent system why does it
have to have any human like emotions why

6492
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:58,610
have to have any human like emotions why
 

6493
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:00,069
have to have any human like emotions why
couldn't I does he even care if it lives

6494
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:00,079
couldn't I does he even care if it lives
 

6495
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:02,589
couldn't I does he even care if it lives
why does it even care if it has food it

6496
01:59:02,589 --> 01:59:02,599
why does it even care if it has food it
 

6497
01:59:02,599 --> 01:59:03,909
why does it even care if it has food it
doesn't care about those things it's

6498
01:59:03,909 --> 01:59:03,919
doesn't care about those things it's
 

6499
01:59:03,919 --> 01:59:06,069
doesn't care about those things it's
just you know it's just in a trance

6500
01:59:06,069 --> 01:59:06,079
just you know it's just in a trance
 

6501
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:07,989
just you know it's just in a trance
thinking about mathematics or it's out

6502
01:59:07,989 --> 01:59:07,999
thinking about mathematics or it's out
 

6503
01:59:07,999 --> 01:59:09,279
thinking about mathematics or it's out
there just trying to build the space

6504
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:09,289
there just trying to build the space
 

6505
01:59:09,289 --> 01:59:13,479
there just trying to build the space
plant you know for it on Mars it's C we

6506
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:13,489
plant you know for it on Mars it's C we
 

6507
01:59:13,489 --> 01:59:15,699
plant you know for it on Mars it's C we
don't that's a choice we make don't make

6508
01:59:15,699 --> 01:59:15,709
don't that's a choice we make don't make
 

6509
01:59:15,709 --> 01:59:18,100
don't that's a choice we make don't make
human-like things don't make replicating

6510
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:18,110
human-like things don't make replicating
 

6511
01:59:18,110 --> 01:59:19,299
human-like things don't make replicating
things don't make things which have

6512
01:59:19,299 --> 01:59:19,309
things don't make things which have
 

6513
01:59:19,309 --> 01:59:21,069
things don't make things which have
emotions just stick to the neocortex so

6514
01:59:21,069 --> 01:59:21,079
emotions just stick to the neocortex so
 

6515
01:59:21,079 --> 01:59:22,239
emotions just stick to the neocortex so
that's that's a view actually that I

6516
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:22,249
that's that's a view actually that I
 

6517
01:59:22,249 --> 01:59:24,399
that's that's a view actually that I
shared but not everybody shares in the

6518
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:24,409
shared but not everybody shares in the
 

6519
01:59:24,409 --> 01:59:26,949
shared but not everybody shares in the
sense that you have faith and optimism

6520
01:59:26,949 --> 01:59:26,959
sense that you have faith and optimism
 

6521
01:59:26,959 --> 01:59:28,420
sense that you have faith and optimism
about us

6522
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:28,430
about us
 

6523
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:30,700
about us
years of systems humans as builders of

6524
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:30,710
years of systems humans as builders of
 

6525
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:34,030
years of systems humans as builders of
systems got to to do not put in stupid

6526
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:34,040
systems got to to do not put in stupid
 

6527
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,430
systems got to to do not put in stupid
not so this is why I mentioned the

6528
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:36,440
not so this is why I mentioned the
 

6529
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,190
not so this is why I mentioned the
bacteria one yeah because you might say

6530
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:39,200
bacteria one yeah because you might say
 

6531
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,780
bacteria one yeah because you might say
well some person's gonna do that well

6532
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:40,790
well some person's gonna do that well
 

6533
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:42,280
well some person's gonna do that well
some person today could create a

6534
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:42,290
some person today could create a
 

6535
01:59:42,290 --> 01:59:44,730
some person today could create a
bacteria that's resistant to all the non

6536
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:44,740
bacteria that's resistant to all the non
 

6537
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:48,520
bacteria that's resistant to all the non
antibacterial agents so we already have

6538
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:48,530
antibacterial agents so we already have
 

6539
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:50,200
antibacterial agents so we already have
that threat we already knows this is

6540
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:50,210
that threat we already knows this is
 

6541
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:53,800
that threat we already knows this is
going on it's not a new threat so just

6542
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:53,810
going on it's not a new threat so just
 

6543
01:59:53,810 --> 01:59:55,600
going on it's not a new threat so just
accept that and then we have to deal

6544
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:55,610
accept that and then we have to deal
 

6545
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:57,700
accept that and then we have to deal
with it right yeah so my point has

6546
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:57,710
with it right yeah so my point has
 

6547
01:59:57,710 --> 01:59:59,590
with it right yeah so my point has
nothing to do with intelligence it

6548
01:59:59,590 --> 01:59:59,600
nothing to do with intelligence it
 

6549
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,750
nothing to do with intelligence it
intelligence is the separate component

6550
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:01,760
intelligence is the separate component
 

6551
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,460
intelligence is the separate component
that you might apply to a system that

6552
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:03,470
that you might apply to a system that
 

6553
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:05,130
that you might apply to a system that
wants to reproduce and do stupid things

6554
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:05,140
wants to reproduce and do stupid things
 

6555
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:07,840
wants to reproduce and do stupid things
let's not do that and in fact it is a

6556
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:07,850
let's not do that and in fact it is a
 

6557
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:09,340
let's not do that and in fact it is a
mystery why people haven't done that

6558
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:09,350
mystery why people haven't done that
 

6559
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:11,980
mystery why people haven't done that
yeah my my dad is a physicist believes

6560
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:11,990
yeah my my dad is a physicist believes
 

6561
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:15,430
yeah my my dad is a physicist believes
that the reason you so for some nuclear

6562
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:15,440
that the reason you so for some nuclear
 

6563
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,400
that the reason you so for some nuclear
weapons haven't proliferated amongst

6564
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:18,410
weapons haven't proliferated amongst
 

6565
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:20,800
weapons haven't proliferated amongst
evil people so one is one belief that I

6566
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:20,810
evil people so one is one belief that I
 

6567
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:23,590
evil people so one is one belief that I
share is that there's not that many evil

6568
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:23,600
share is that there's not that many evil
 

6569
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:28,210
share is that there's not that many evil
people in the world that would that that

6570
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:28,220
people in the world that would that that
 

6571
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:30,430
people in the world that would that that
would use Spectre whether it's bacteria

6572
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:30,440
would use Spectre whether it's bacteria
 

6573
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:31,780
would use Spectre whether it's bacteria
and you clear weapons or maybe the

6574
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:31,790
and you clear weapons or maybe the
 

6575
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:35,320
and you clear weapons or maybe the
future AI systems to do bad so the

6576
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:35,330
future AI systems to do bad so the
 

6577
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:37,030
future AI systems to do bad so the
fraction is small and the second is that

6578
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:37,040
fraction is small and the second is that
 

6579
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,950
fraction is small and the second is that
it's actually really hard technically

6580
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:38,960
it's actually really hard technically
 

6581
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,740
it's actually really hard technically
yeah so the the intersection between

6582
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:41,750
yeah so the the intersection between
 

6583
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:44,860
yeah so the the intersection between
evil and competent is small in terms and

6584
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:44,870
evil and competent is small in terms and
 

6585
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,930
evil and competent is small in terms and
otherwise it really annihilate humanity

6586
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:46,940
otherwise it really annihilate humanity
 

6587
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:49,000
otherwise it really annihilate humanity
you'd have to have you know sort of the

6588
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:49,010
you'd have to have you know sort of the
 

6589
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:50,890
you'd have to have you know sort of the
the nuclear winter phenomena which is

6590
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:50,900
the nuclear winter phenomena which is
 

6591
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,990
the nuclear winter phenomena which is
not one person shooting you know or even

6592
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,000
not one person shooting you know or even
 

6593
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,120
not one person shooting you know or even
ten bombs you'd have to have some

6594
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:55,130
ten bombs you'd have to have some
 

6595
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,430
ten bombs you'd have to have some
automated system that you know detonates

6596
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:57,440
automated system that you know detonates
 

6597
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,470
automated system that you know detonates
a million bombs or whatever many

6598
02:00:59,470 --> 02:00:59,480
a million bombs or whatever many
 

6599
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:01,870
a million bombs or whatever many
thousands we have extreme evil combined

6600
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:01,880
thousands we have extreme evil combined
 

6601
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,430
thousands we have extreme evil combined
with extreme competence and it's just

6602
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:03,440
with extreme competence and it's just
 

6603
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,320
with extreme competence and it's just
like only some stupid system that would

6604
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:05,330
like only some stupid system that would
 

6605
02:01:05,330 --> 02:01:07,240
like only some stupid system that would
automatically you know dr. Strangelove

6606
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:07,250
automatically you know dr. Strangelove
 

6607
02:01:07,250 --> 02:01:11,200
automatically you know dr. Strangelove
type of thing you know I mean look we

6608
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:11,210
type of thing you know I mean look we
 

6609
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:13,150
type of thing you know I mean look we
could have some nuclear bomb go off in

6610
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:13,160
could have some nuclear bomb go off in
 

6611
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,560
could have some nuclear bomb go off in
some major city in the world like no I

6612
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:14,570
some major city in the world like no I
 

6613
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:16,450
some major city in the world like no I
think that's actually quite likely even

6614
02:01:16,450 --> 02:01:16,460
think that's actually quite likely even
 

6615
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:17,680
think that's actually quite likely even
in my lifetime I don't think that's on I

6616
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:17,690
in my lifetime I don't think that's on I
 

6617
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:20,680
in my lifetime I don't think that's on I
like to think and it'd be a tragedy but

6618
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:20,690
like to think and it'd be a tragedy but
 

6619
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:23,140
like to think and it'd be a tragedy but
it won't be an existential threat and

6620
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:23,150
it won't be an existential threat and
 

6621
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:25,440
it won't be an existential threat and
it's the same as you know the virus of

6622
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:25,450
it's the same as you know the virus of
 

6623
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:28,120
it's the same as you know the virus of
1917 whatever it was you know the

6624
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:28,130
1917 whatever it was you know the
 

6625
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:30,940
1917 whatever it was you know the
influenza these bad things can happen

6626
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:30,950
influenza these bad things can happen
 

6627
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:34,600
influenza these bad things can happen
and the plague and so on we can't always

6628

and the plague and so on we can't always
 

6629
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:36,640
and the plague and so on we can't always
prevent them we always to always try but

6630
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:36,650
prevent them we always to always try but
 

6631
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:37,960
prevent them we always to always try but
we can't but they're not existential

6632
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:37,970
we can't but they're not existential
 

6633
02:01:37,970 --> 02:01:39,760
we can't but they're not existential
threats until we combine all those crazy

6634
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:39,770
threats until we combine all those crazy
 

6635
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:40,890

things together one

6636
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:40,900
things together one
 

6637
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,780
things together one
so on the on the spectrum of

6638
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:42,790
so on the on the spectrum of
 

6639
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:45,600
so on the on the spectrum of
intelligence from zero to human do you

6640
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:45,610
intelligence from zero to human do you
 

6641
02:01:45,610 --> 02:01:47,940
intelligence from zero to human do you
have a sense of if whether it's possible

6642
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:47,950
have a sense of if whether it's possible
 

6643
02:01:47,950 --> 02:01:51,630
have a sense of if whether it's possible
to create several orders of magnitude or

6644
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:51,640
to create several orders of magnitude or
 

6645
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:54,090
to create several orders of magnitude or
at least double that of human

6646
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:54,100
at least double that of human
 

6647
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:55,920
at least double that of human
intelligence type on your cortex

intelligence type on your cortex
 

6649
02:01:55,930 --> 02:01:57,990
intelligence type on your cortex
I think the wrong thing to say double

6650
02:01:57,990 --> 02:01:58,000
I think the wrong thing to say double
 

6651
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,790
I think the wrong thing to say double
the intelligence you break it down into

6652
02:01:59,790 --> 02:01:59,800
the intelligence you break it down into
 

6653
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,980
the intelligence you break it down into
different components can I make

6654
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:01,990
different components can I make
 

6655
02:02:01,990 --> 02:02:03,390
different components can I make
something that's a million times faster

6656
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:03,400
something that's a million times faster
 

6657
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,470
something that's a million times faster
than a human brain

6658
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480
than a human brain
 

6659
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:07,020
than a human brain
yes I can do that could I make something

6660
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:07,030
yes I can do that could I make something
 

6661
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:10,410
yes I can do that could I make something
that is has a lot more storage than the

6662
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:10,420
that is has a lot more storage than the
 

6663
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:12,960
that is has a lot more storage than the
human brain yes I could more common more

6664
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:12,970
human brain yes I could more common more
 

6665
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:14,280
human brain yes I could more common more
copies of comp can I make something that

6666
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:14,290
copies of comp can I make something that
 

6667
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:15,690
copies of comp can I make something that
attaches the different sensors than

6668
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:15,700
attaches the different sensors than
 

6669
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:17,430
attaches the different sensors than
human brain yes I can do that could I

6670
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:17,440
human brain yes I can do that could I
 

6671
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,440
human brain yes I can do that could I
make something that's distributed so

6672
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:19,450
make something that's distributed so
 

6673
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:21,180
make something that's distributed so
these people yet we talked early about

6674
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:21,190
these people yet we talked early about
 

6675
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:22,680
these people yet we talked early about
that important in your cortex voting's

6676
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:22,690
that important in your cortex voting's
 

6677
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:23,880
that important in your cortex voting's
well they don't have to be co-located

6678
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:23,890
well they don't have to be co-located
 

6679
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:25,290
well they don't have to be co-located
why you know they can be all around the

6680
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:25,300
why you know they can be all around the
 

6681
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:29,670
why you know they can be all around the
places I could do that too those are the

6682
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:29,680
places I could do that too those are the
 

6683
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:32,400
places I could do that too those are the
levers I have but is it more intelligent

6684
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:32,410
levers I have but is it more intelligent
 

6685
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:33,990
levers I have but is it more intelligent
what depends what I train it on what is

6686
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
what depends what I train it on what is
 

6687
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,840
what depends what I train it on what is
it doing if it's oh here's the thing so

6688
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:36,850
it doing if it's oh here's the thing so
 

6689
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,780
it doing if it's oh here's the thing so
let's say larger neocortex and or

6690
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:39,790
let's say larger neocortex and or
 

6691
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:44,790
let's say larger neocortex and or
whatever size that allows for higher and

6692
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:44,800
whatever size that allows for higher and
 

6693
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,670
whatever size that allows for higher and
higher hierarchies yeah to form right

6694
02:02:47,670 --> 02:02:47,680
higher hierarchies yeah to form right
 

6695
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,680

we're talking about rains in canto I

6696
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:49,690
we're talking about rains in canto I
 

6697
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:51,330
we're talking about rains in canto I
could could I have something as a super

6698
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:51,340
could could I have something as a super
 

6699
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,070
could could I have something as a super
physicist or a super mathematician yes

6700
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:53,080
physicist or a super mathematician yes
 

6701
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:55,110
physicist or a super mathematician yes
and the question is once you have a

6702
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:55,120
and the question is once you have a
 

6703
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:57,450
and the question is once you have a
super physicist will they be able to

6704
02:02:57,450 --> 02:02:57,460
super physicist will they be able to
 

6705
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:01,050
super physicist will they be able to
understand something do a sense that

6706
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:01,060
understand something do a sense that
 

6707
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03,090
understand something do a sense that
it'll be orders to make like us compared

6708
02:03:03,090 --> 02:03:03,100
it'll be orders to make like us compared
 

6709
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:06,500
it'll be orders to make like us compared
to ever understand it yeah most people

6710
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:06,510
to ever understand it yeah most people
 

6711
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:11,220
to ever understand it yeah most people
cannot understand general relativity

6712
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:11,230
cannot understand general relativity
 

6713
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:13,290
cannot understand general relativity
right it's a really hard thing together

6714
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:13,300
right it's a really hard thing together
 

6715
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:16,230
right it's a really hard thing together
I mean paint in a fuzzy picture stretchy

6716
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:16,240
I mean paint in a fuzzy picture stretchy

intuitions are really really hard and

6722
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:23,460
intuitions are really really hard and
 

6723
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:26,670

I've tried I unable to do it is to get
you know it's easy to get special

6726
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:28,420
you know it's easy to get special
 

6727
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:29,820
you know it's easy to get special
relativity general that's it man that's

6728
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:29,830
relativity general that's it man that's
 

6729
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:33,930
relativity general that's it man that's
too much and so we already live with

6730
02:03:33,930 --> 02:03:33,940
too much and so we already live with
 

6731
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,640
too much and so we already live with
this to some extent the vast majority of

this to some extent the vast majority of
 

6733
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,230
this to some extent the vast majority of

the vast majority other people actually
 

6737
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:41,430
the vast majority other people actually
know we're just either we don't have the

6738
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
know we're just either we don't have the
 

6739
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,380
know we're just either we don't have the
effort to or we can't or it on time are

6741
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:47,250
effort to or we can't or it on time are
just not smart enough whatever so but we

6742
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:47,260
just not smart enough whatever so but we
 

6743
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:48,510
just not smart enough whatever so but we
have ways of communicating

Einstein has spoken in a way that I can

6746
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:50,380
Einstein has spoken in a way that I can
 

6747
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:53,040
Einstein has spoken in a way that I can
understand he's given me analogies that

6748
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:53,050
understand he's given me analogies that
 

6749
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:54,390
understand he's given me analogies that
are useful

6750
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:54,400
are useful
 

6751
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,550
are useful
I can use those analogies from my own

6752
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:56,560
I can use those analogies from my own
 

6753
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,950
I can use those analogies from my own
work and think about you know concepts

6754
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
work and think about you know concepts
 

6755
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,250

that are similar it's not stupid it's

6756
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:02,260
that are similar it's not stupid it's
 

6757
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,930
that are similar it's not stupid it's
not like he's existed some other plane

with me crepe machine intelligence that

with me crepe machine intelligence that
 

6771
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:18,629
with me crepe machine intelligence that
think a million times faster than us

6772
02:04:18,629 --> 02:04:18,639
think a million times faster than us
 

6773
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,490
think a million times faster than us
that it'll be so far we can't make the

6774
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:20,500
that it'll be so far we can't make the
 

6775
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,260
that it'll be so far we can't make the

everything that seems really really hard

6778
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:25,510
everything that seems really really hard
 

6779
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:26,910
everything that seems really really hard
to figure out in the world when you

6780
02:04:26,910 --> 02:04:26,920
to figure out in the world when you
 

6781
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,350
to figure out in the world when you
actually figure it out it's not that

6782
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:28,360
actually figure it out it's not that
 

6783
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,060
actually figure it out it's not that
hard you know we can everyone most

6784
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:30,070
hard you know we can everyone most
 

6785
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:32,070
hard you know we can everyone most
everyone can understand the multiverses

6786
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:32,080
everyone can understand the multiverses
 

6787
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:33,689
everyone can understand the multiverses
and most everyone can understand quantum

6788
02:04:33,689 --> 02:04:33,699
and most everyone can understand quantum
 

6789
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,520
and most everyone can understand quantum
physics we can understand these basic

6790
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:35,530
physics we can understand these basic
 

6791
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:37,410
physics we can understand these basic
things even though hardly any baby

6792
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:37,420
things even though hardly any baby
 

6793
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:38,760
things even though hardly any baby
people could figure those things out

6794
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:38,770
people could figure those things out
 

6795
02:04:38,770 --> 02:04:42,870
people could figure those things out
yeah but really understand so only a few

6796
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:42,880
yeah but really understand so only a few
 

6797
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,250
yeah but really understand so only a few
people really understand you need to

6798
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:44,260
people really understand you need to
 

6799
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:47,970
people really understand you need to
only understand the the projections the

6800
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:47,980
only understand the the projections the
 

6801
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:50,939
only understand the the projections the
sprinkles of the useful my example of

6802
02:04:50,939 --> 02:04:50,949
sprinkles of the useful my example of
 

6803
02:04:50,949 --> 02:04:52,620
sprinkles of the useful my example of
Einstein right his general theory of

6804
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:52,630
Einstein right his general theory of
 

6805
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:54,540
Einstein right his general theory of
relativity is one thing that very very

6806
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:54,550
relativity is one thing that very very
 

6807
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:57,060
relativity is one thing that very very
very few people can get and what if we

6808
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:57,070
very few people can get and what if we
 

6809
02:04:57,070 --> 02:04:58,320
very few people can get and what if we
just said those other few people are

6810
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:58,330
just said those other few people are
 

6811
02:04:58,330 --> 02:05:01,260
just said those other few people are
also artificial intelligences how bad is

6812
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:01,270
also artificial intelligences how bad is
 

6813
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:03,660
also artificial intelligences how bad is
that in some sense they right yeah they

6814
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:03,670
that in some sense they right yeah they
 

6815
02:05:03,670 --> 02:05:05,339
that in some sense they right yeah they
say already you mean Einstein wasn't a

6816
02:05:05,339 --> 02:05:05,349
say already you mean Einstein wasn't a
 

6817
02:05:05,349 --> 02:05:06,899
say already you mean Einstein wasn't a
very normal person he had a lot of where

6818
02:05:06,899 --> 02:05:06,909
very normal person he had a lot of where
 

6819
02:05:06,909 --> 02:05:08,729
very normal person he had a lot of where
the quirks and so the other people who

6820
02:05:08,729 --> 02:05:08,739
the quirks and so the other people who
 

6821
02:05:08,739 --> 02:05:10,620
the quirks and so the other people who
work with him so you know maybe they

6822
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:10,630
work with him so you know maybe they
 

6823
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:12,689
work with him so you know maybe they
already were sort of this astral plane

6824
02:05:12,689 --> 02:05:12,699
already were sort of this astral plane
 

6825
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:14,879
already were sort of this astral plane
of intelligence that we live with it

6826
02:05:14,879 --> 02:05:14,889
of intelligence that we live with it
 

6827
02:05:14,889 --> 02:05:17,640
of intelligence that we live with it
already it's not a problem it's still

6828
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:17,650
already it's not a problem it's still
 

6829
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:21,180
already it's not a problem it's still
useful and you know so do you think we

6830
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:21,190
useful and you know so do you think we
 

6831
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:23,100
useful and you know so do you think we
are the only intelligent life out there

6832
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:23,110
are the only intelligent life out there
 

6833
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:25,530
are the only intelligent life out there
in the universe I would say that

6834
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:25,540
in the universe I would say that
 

6835
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:28,770
in the universe I would say that
intelligent life has and will exist

6836
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:28,780
intelligent life has and will exist
 

6837
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,649
intelligent life has and will exist
elsewhere in the universe I'll say that

6838
02:05:30,649 --> 02:05:30,659
elsewhere in the universe I'll say that
 

6839
02:05:30,659 --> 02:05:32,300
elsewhere in the universe I'll say that
there is a question about

6840
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:32,310
there is a question about
 

6841
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:34,169
there is a question about
contemporaneous intelligence life which

6842
02:05:34,169 --> 02:05:34,179
contemporaneous intelligence life which
 

6843
02:05:34,179 --> 02:05:35,910
contemporaneous intelligence life which
is hard to even answer when we think

6844
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:35,920
is hard to even answer when we think
 

6845
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,830
is hard to even answer when we think
about relativity in the the nature of

6846
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:37,840
about relativity in the the nature of
 

6847
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,560
about relativity in the the nature of
space-time you can't say what exactly is

6848
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:40,570
space-time you can't say what exactly is
 

6849
02:05:40,570 --> 02:05:42,229
space-time you can't say what exactly is
this time someplace else in the world

6850
02:05:42,229 --> 02:05:42,239
this time someplace else in the world
 

6851
02:05:42,239 --> 02:05:44,700
this time someplace else in the world
but I think it's it's you know I do

6852
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:44,710
but I think it's it's you know I do
 

6853
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:48,300
but I think it's it's you know I do
worry a lot about the the filter idea

6854
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:48,310
worry a lot about the the filter idea
 

6855
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:51,030
worry a lot about the the filter idea
which is that perhaps intelligent

6856
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:51,040
which is that perhaps intelligent
 

6857
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,780
which is that perhaps intelligent
species don't last very long

6858
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:53,790
species don't last very long
 

6859
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:55,370
species don't last very long
and so we haven't been around very long

6860
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:55,380
and so we haven't been around very long
 

6861
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:56,960
and so we haven't been around very long
you know as a technological species

6862
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:56,970
you know as a technological species
 

6863
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:59,240
you know as a technological species
we've been around for almost nothing man

6864
02:05:59,240 --> 02:05:59,250
we've been around for almost nothing man
 

6865
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:01,070
we've been around for almost nothing man
you know what 200 years I'm like that

6866
02:06:01,070 --> 02:06:01,080
you know what 200 years I'm like that
 

6867
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:04,520
you know what 200 years I'm like that
and we don't have any data a good data

6868
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:04,530
and we don't have any data a good data
 

6869
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:06,229
and we don't have any data a good data
point on whether it's likely they will

6870
02:06:06,229 --> 02:06:06,239
point on whether it's likely they will
 

6871
02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:09,979
point on whether it's likely they will
survive or not so do I think that there

6872
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:09,989
survive or not so do I think that there
 

6873
02:06:09,989 --> 02:06:11,270
survive or not so do I think that there
have been intelligent life elsewhere in

6874
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
have been intelligent life elsewhere in
 

6875
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:12,530
have been intelligent life elsewhere in
the universe almost certain that of

6876
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:12,540
the universe almost certain that of
 

6877
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:15,640
the universe almost certain that of
course in the past in the future yes

6878
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:15,650
course in the past in the future yes
 

6879
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:18,080
course in the past in the future yes
does it survive for a long time I don't

6880
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:18,090
does it survive for a long time I don't
 

6881
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:18,410
does it survive for a long time I don't
know

6882
02:06:18,410 --> 02:06:18,420
know
 

6883
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,330
know
this is another reason I'm excited about

6884
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:20,340
this is another reason I'm excited about
 

6885
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:22,250
this is another reason I'm excited about
our work is our work meaning that

6886
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:22,260
our work is our work meaning that
 

6887
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:26,150
our work is our work meaning that
general Worlds of AI and I think we can

6888
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:26,160
general Worlds of AI and I think we can
 

6889
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:29,600
general Worlds of AI and I think we can
build intelligent machines that outlast

6890
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:29,610
build intelligent machines that outlast
 

6891
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:33,320
build intelligent machines that outlast
us and you know they don't have to be

6892
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:33,330
us and you know they don't have to be
 

6893
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:35,210
us and you know they don't have to be
tied to earth they don't have to you

6894
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:35,220
tied to earth they don't have to you
 

6895
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,220
tied to earth they don't have to you
know I'm not saying that recreating you

6896
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:37,230
know I'm not saying that recreating you
 

6897
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:39,590
know I'm not saying that recreating you
know you know aliens I'm just saying

6898
02:06:39,590 --> 02:06:39,600
know you know aliens I'm just saying
 

6899
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,380
know you know aliens I'm just saying
well if I asked myself and this might be

6900
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:42,390
well if I asked myself and this might be
 

6901
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:44,630
well if I asked myself and this might be
a good point to end on here if I asked

6902
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:44,640
a good point to end on here if I asked
 

6903
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,890
a good point to end on here if I asked
myself you know what's special about our

6904
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:45,900
myself you know what's special about our
 

6905
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:47,960
myself you know what's special about our
species we're not particularly

don't fly we're not good swimmers we're
not very fast from that very strong you

know it's our brain that's the only

know it's our brain that's the only
 

6915
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:56,810
know it's our brain that's the only

don't do it it's just on and that is

6938
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:16,770
don't do it it's just on and that is
 

6939
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:18,560
don't do it it's just on and that is

genes it's knowledge and if I asked me

6942
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:21,120
genes it's knowledge and if I asked me
 

6943
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,660

what is the legacy of humanity what what

what is the legacy of humanity what what
 

6945
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:25,370
what is the legacy of humanity what what
what should our legacy be it should be

what should our legacy be it should be
 

6947
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:26,630

knowledge in a way that it can exist
 

6951
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:31,430
knowledge in a way that it can exist
beyond us and I think the best way of

02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
beyond us and I think the best way of
 

6953
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,140
beyond us and I think the best way of
doing that in fact you have to do it is

doing that in fact you have to do it is

it's a very broad idea but we should be

other planets but even beyond that I
mean our solar system will disappear
