absolutely necessary first is you have
to be someone who sizes up the person on

of the presidency
 

1233
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,070
of the presidency
as the modern presidency the fact that

1234
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
as the modern presidency the fact that
 

1235
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,909
as the modern presidency the fact that
we continued the war in afghanistan and

1236

we continued the war in afghanistan and
 

1237
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,990
we continued the war in afghanistan and
different engagements

1238
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
different engagements
 

1239
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,390
different engagements
in military conflicts do you think

1240
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
in military conflicts do you think
 

1241
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,230
in military conflicts do you think
barack obama could have stopped that

1242
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
barack obama could have stopped that
 

1243
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,710
barack obama could have stopped that
do you put the responsibility on that

1244
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
do you put the responsibility on that
 

1245
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,070
do you put the responsibility on that
expansion on

1246
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
expansion on
 

1247
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,150
expansion on
him because of the implied power that

1248
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
him because of the implied power that
 

1249
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,590
him because of the implied power that
the presidency has

1250
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
the presidency has
 

1251
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,149
the presidency has
or is this power just sits there and if

1252
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
or is this power just sits there and if
 

1253
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,470
or is this power just sits there and if
a president chooses to take it they do

1254
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
a president chooses to take it they do
 

1255
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,190
a president chooses to take it they do
and if they don't they don't almost like

1256
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
and if they don't they don't almost like
 

1257
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,230
and if they don't they don't almost like
you don't want to

1258
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
you don't want to
 

1259
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,310
you don't want to
get take on the responsibility because

1260
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
get take on the responsibility because
 

1261
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,870
get take on the responsibility because
of the the burden of that responsibility

1262
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
of the the burden of that responsibility
 

1263
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,510
of the the burden of that responsibility
so a lot of my research is about this

1264
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
so a lot of my research is about this
 

1265
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,590
so a lot of my research is about this
exact question not just with obama

1266
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
exact question not just with obama
 

1267
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,270
exact question not just with obama
and my conclusion and i think the

1268
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
and my conclusion and i think the
 

1269
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,110
and my conclusion and i think the
research is pretty clear on this is that

1270
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
research is pretty clear on this is that
 

1271
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,430
research is pretty clear on this is that
structure has a lot more effect on us

1272
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
structure has a lot more effect on us
 

1273
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,789
structure has a lot more effect on us
than we like to admit

1274
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
than we like to admit
 

1275
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,630
than we like to admit
which is to say that the circumstances

1276
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
which is to say that the circumstances
 

1277
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,630
which is to say that the circumstances
the institutions around us drive our

1278
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
the institutions around us drive our
 

1279
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,430
the institutions around us drive our
behavior

1280
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
behavior
 

1281
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,950
behavior
more than we like to think so barack

1282
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
more than we like to think so barack
 

1283
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,470
more than we like to think so barack

so you are pushed by the circumstances
 

1357
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,789
so you are pushed by the circumstances
you're in

1358

you're in
to do this and it's very hard to resist

1360
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
to do this and it's very hard to resist
 

1361
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,310
to do this and it's very hard to resist
so that's

1362
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
so that's
 

1363
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,630
so that's
i think the criticism of obama the fair

1364
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
i think the criticism of obama the fair
 

1365
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,310
i think the criticism of obama the fair
one would be that he didn't resist the

1366
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
one would be that he didn't resist the
 

1367
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,950
one would be that he didn't resist the
pressures

1368
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
pressures
 

1369
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,549
pressures
that were there but he did not make

1370
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
that were there but he did not make
 

1371
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,990
that were there but he did not make
those pressures so

1372
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
those pressures so
 

1373
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,190
those pressures so
is there something about the putting the

1374
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
is there something about the putting the
 

1375
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,070
is there something about the putting the
responsibility on the president to

1376
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
responsibility on the president to
 

1377
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,870
responsibility on the president to
to form the structure around him locally

1378
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
to form the structure around him locally
 

1379
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,470
to form the structure around him locally
such that he can

1380
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
such that he can
 

1381
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,870
such that he can
make the policy that the that matches

1382
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
make the policy that the that matches
 

1383
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,470
make the policy that the that matches
the rhetoric so

1384
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
the rhetoric so
 

1385
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,510
the rhetoric so

if you're reacting to a crisis you're
 

1437
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,549
if you're reacting to a crisis you're
not controlling access because the

1438
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
not controlling access because the
 

1439
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,149
not controlling access because the

those adjustments until we go
 

1497
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,269
those adjustments until we go
into such bad circumstances that we have

re-examines what role it plays so it's
 

1551
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,470
re-examines what role it plays so it's
not just about whether we're in

1552
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
not just about whether we're in
 

1553
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,149
not just about whether we're in
afghanistan or not the question we have

afghanistan or not the question we have

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,350
afghanistan or not the question we have
to ask is

1556
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
to ask is
 

1557
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,110
to ask is
when we look at our toolbox of what we

1558
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
when we look at our toolbox of what we
 

1559
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,430
when we look at our toolbox of what we
can do in our foreign policy

are there other tools we should build up
 

1563
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,789
are there other tools we should build up
and therefore some tools in the military

1564
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
and therefore some tools in the military
 

1565
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,830
and therefore some tools in the military
we should reduce

1566
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
we should reduce

it's hard and you can't ask all the
right questions and there is a legal

1838
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
right questions and there is a legal
 

1839
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,230
right questions and there is a legal
hazard if you know things

1840
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
hazard if you know things
 

1841
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,470
hazard if you know things
at certain times but i think you can

1842
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,480
at certain times but i think you can
 

1843
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,990
at certain times but i think you can
back to your point on hiring you can

1844
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
back to your point on hiring you can
 

1845
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,350
back to your point on hiring you can
hire people who will do that in their

1846
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
hire people who will do that in their
 

1847

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
and then you have to trust that when
 

1851
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,190
and then you have to trust that when
they think it's something that's a

1852
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
they think it's something that's a

in that sense it feels like history has
all the lessons

2216
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
all the lessons
 

2217
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,109
all the lessons
whether we're talking about wars whether

2218
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
whether we're talking about wars whether
 

2219
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,630
whether we're talking about wars whether
we're talking about corruption

we're talking about corruption
 

2221
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,829

i think there's a difference between um

2224
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
i think there's a difference between um
 

2225
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,470
i think there's a difference between um
history and antiquarianism

2226
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
history and antiquarianism
 

2227
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,630
history and antiquarianism
so antiquarianism which some people call

2228
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
so antiquarianism which some people call
 

2229
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,990
so antiquarianism which some people call
history

2230
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
history
 

2231
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,990
history
is the desire to go back to the past or

2232
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
is the desire to go back to the past or
 

2233
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,910
is the desire to go back to the past or
stay stuck in the past so antiquarianism

2234
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
stay stuck in the past so antiquarianism
 

2235
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,349
stay stuck in the past so antiquarianism
is the desire to have

2236
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
is the desire to have
 

2237
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,109
is the desire to have
the desk that abraham lincoln sat at

2238
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
the desk that abraham lincoln sat at
 

2239
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,109
the desk that abraham lincoln sat at
wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk

2240
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk
 

2241
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,470
wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk
i'd love to have that desk if i had a

2242
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
i'd love to have that desk if i had a
 

2243
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,230
i'd love to have that desk if i had a
few extra million dollars i'd acquire it

2244
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,240
few extra million dollars i'd acquire it
 

2245
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,790
few extra million dollars i'd acquire it
right

2246
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
right
 

2247
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,510
right
so in a way uh that's antiquarianism

2248
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
so in a way uh that's antiquarianism
 

2249
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,589
so in a way uh that's antiquarianism
that's trying to capture and hold on

2250
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
that's trying to capture and hold on
 

2251
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,190
that's trying to capture and hold on
hold on to the past the past is a

2252
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,200
hold on to the past the past is a
 

2253
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,990
hold on to the past the past is a
talisman for antiquarians

2254
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
talisman for antiquarians
 

2255
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,870
talisman for antiquarians
um what history is is the study of

2256
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
um what history is is the study of
 

2257
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,390
um what history is is the study of
change over time that's the real

2258
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
change over time that's the real
 

2259
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,829
change over time that's the real
definition of historical

2260
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
definition of historical
 

2261
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,470
definition of historical
study and historical thinking and so

2262
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
study and historical thinking and so
 

2263
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,589
study and historical thinking and so
what we're studying is

2264
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
what we're studying is
 

2265
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,829
what we're studying is
change and so a historian should never

2266
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
change and so a historian should never
 

2267
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,950
change and so a historian should never
say

2268
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
say
 

2269
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,790
say
um we have to do things the way we've

2270
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
um we have to do things the way we've
 

2271
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,990
um we have to do things the way we've
done them in the past the historians

2272
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
done them in the past the historians
 

2273
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,030
done them in the past the historians
should say we can't

2274
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
should say we can't
 

2275
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,870
should say we can't
do them the way we did them in the past

2276
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
do them the way we did them in the past
 

2277
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,950
do them the way we did them in the past
we can't step in the same river twice

2278
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
we can't step in the same river twice
 

2279
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,270
we can't step in the same river twice

01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,790
thereafter so that that speaks to the
very pragmatic

4470

versus the idealistic approach uh

4476
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
versus the idealistic approach uh

world politics
 

4485
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,390
world politics
so realpolitik for kissinger is um

4486
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:42,400
so realpolitik for kissinger is um
 

4487
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,510
so realpolitik for kissinger is um
really focusing on the power centers in

4488
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
really focusing on the power centers in
 

4489
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,870
really focusing on the power centers in
the world

4490
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
the world
 

4491
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,110
the world
and trying as best you can to manipulate

4492
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
and trying as best you can to manipulate
 

4493
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,709
and trying as best you can to manipulate
those power centers to serve the

4494
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
those power centers to serve the
 

4495
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,390
those power centers to serve the
interests of your own country

4496
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
interests of your own country
 

4497
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,229
interests of your own country
and so that's why he's a multilateralist

4498
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:54,239
and so that's why he's a multilateralist
 

4499
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,830
and so that's why he's a multilateralist
he's not a unilateralist

4500
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:55,840
he's not a unilateralist
 

4501
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,990
he's not a unilateralist
he believes the united states should put

4502
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
he believes the united states should put
 

4503
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,990
he believes the united states should put
itself at the center of negotiations

4504
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
itself at the center of negotiations
 

4505
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,830
itself at the center of negotiations
between other powerful countries

4506
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
between other powerful countries
 

4507
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,350
between other powerful countries
but that's also why he pays very little

4508
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
but that's also why he pays very little
 

4509
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,870
but that's also why he pays very little
attention to countries that are less

4510
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
attention to countries that are less
 

4511
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,390
attention to countries that are less
powerful and this is why he's often

4512
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400
powerful and this is why he's often
 

4513
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,870
powerful and this is why he's often
criticized by human rights activists

4514
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
criticized by human rights activists
 

4515
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,590

a point in the war on terror
 

5329
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,910
a point in the war on terror
where what we were doing was actually

5330
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
where what we were doing was actually
 

5331
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,709
where what we were doing was actually
creating more terrorists

5332
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:42,719
creating more terrorists
 

5333
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,910
creating more terrorists
and that's when you have to stop

5334
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920

 

5335
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,510

well some of that is in the data but

5336
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:47,520
well some of that is in the data but
 

5337
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,270
well some of that is in the data but
some of it there's a leap of faith

5338
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
some of it there's a leap of faith
 

5339
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,270
some of it there's a leap of faith
so from a parenting perspective let me

no uh it does seem
 

5351
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,590
no uh it does seem
that it's a very difficult thing to do

5352
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
that it's a very difficult thing to do
 

5353
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,910
that it's a very difficult thing to do
to um

5354
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
to um
 

5355
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,950
to um
even though you know that your

5356
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
even though you know that your
 

5357
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,270
even though you know that your
kid was making a mistake to let them

5358
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
kid was making a mistake to let them
 

5359
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,790
kid was making a mistake to let them
make a mistake to give them the freedom

5360

make a mistake to give them the freedom
 

5361
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,270
make a mistake to give them the freedom
to make the mistakes sure

5362
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
to make the mistakes sure
 

5363
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,270
to make the mistakes sure
i don't know what to do but i mean

5364
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
i don't know what to do but i mean
 

5365
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,470
i don't know what to do but i mean
that's a very kind of

5366
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
that's a very kind of
 

5367
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,870
that's a very kind of
light-hearted way of phrasing the

5368
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
light-hearted way of phrasing the
 

5369
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,870
light-hearted way of phrasing the
following which is

5370
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
following which is
 

5371
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,830
following which is
when you look at some of the places in

5372
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
when you look at some of the places in
 

5373
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,510
when you look at some of the places in
the world like afghanistan which is

5374
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
the world like afghanistan which is
 

5375
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,430
the world like afghanistan which is
not doing well right to move out

5376
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
not doing well right to move out
 

5377
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,110
not doing well right to move out
knowing that there's going to be a lot

5378
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:35,120
knowing that there's going to be a lot
 

5379
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,550
knowing that there's going to be a lot
of suffering

5380
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:36,560
of suffering
 

5381
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,910
of suffering
economic suffering injustices

5382
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:39,920
economic suffering injustices
 

5383
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,790
economic suffering injustices
terrorist organizations growing that

5384
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
terrorist organizations growing that
 

5385
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,790
terrorist organizations growing that
committing crimes on its own people and

5386
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:44,800
committing crimes on its own people and
 

5387
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,550
committing crimes on its own people and
potentially committing crimes

5388
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
potentially committing crimes
 

5389
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,070
potentially committing crimes
against allies violence against allies

5390
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,080
against allies violence against allies
 

5391
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,590
against allies violence against allies
violence against the united states

5392
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:53,600
violence against the united states
 

5393
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,790
violence against the united states
um how do you know what to do in that

5394
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
um how do you know what to do in that
 

5395
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,830
um how do you know what to do in that
case well

5396
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
case well
 

5397
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,510
case well
again it's an art not a science which is

5398
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,520
again it's an art not a science which is
 

5399
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,950
again it's an art not a science which is
what makes it hard for you know an

5400
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
what makes it hard for you know an
 

5401
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,910
what makes it hard for you know an
engineer to

5402
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:03,920
engineer to
 

5403
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,350
engineer to
to think about this is what what makes

5404
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,360
to think about this is what what makes
 

5405
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,030
to think about this is what what makes
it endlessly fascinating for me yeah

5406
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,040
it endlessly fascinating for me yeah
 

5407
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,629
it endlessly fascinating for me yeah
and i think the real intellectual work

5408
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
and i think the real intellectual work
 

5409
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,310
and i think the real intellectual work
is at the level of the art

5410
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
is at the level of the art
 

5411
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,229
is at the level of the art
right and i think probably engineering

5412
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
right and i think probably engineering
 

5413
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,669
right and i think probably engineering
at its highest level becomes an art as

5414
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
at its highest level becomes an art as
 

5415
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:13,990
at its highest level becomes an art as
well

5416
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:14,000
well
 

5417
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,390
well
right so policy making you never you

5418
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:16,400
right so policy making you never you
 

5419
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,030
right so policy making you never you
never know

5420
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
never know
 

5421
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,350
never know
um but i will say this i'll say you have

5422
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
um but i will say this i'll say you have
 

5423
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,950
um but i will say this i'll say you have
to ask yourself and look in the mirror

5424
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
to ask yourself and look in the mirror
 

5425
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,910
to ask yourself and look in the mirror
and say

5426
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:21,920
and say
 

5427
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,430
and say
is all the effort i'm putting in

5428
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
is all the effort i'm putting in
 

5429
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,350
is all the effort i'm putting in
actually making this better

5430
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,360
actually making this better
 

5431
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,590
actually making this better
and in afghanistan you look at the 20

5432
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:27,600
and in afghanistan you look at the 20
 

5433
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,629
and in afghanistan you look at the 20
years and

5434
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
years and
 

5435
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,510
years and
two plus trillion dollars that the u.s

5436
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:31,520
two plus trillion dollars that the u.s
 

5437
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,629
two plus trillion dollars that the u.s
has put in

5438
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
has put in
 

5439
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,790
has put in
and the fact that as you said correctly

5440
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
and the fact that as you said correctly
 

5441
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,390
and the fact that as you said correctly
it's not doing well right now after 20

5442
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
it's not doing well right now after 20
 

5443
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,390
it's not doing well right now after 20
years of that investment

5444
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:38,400
years of that investment
 

5445
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,629
years of that investment
you know i might like a company that i

5446
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
you know i might like a company that i
 

5447
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:41,590
you know i might like a company that i
invest in

5448
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
invest in
 

5449
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,270
invest in
but after 20 years of my throwing money

5450
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
but after 20 years of my throwing money
 

5451
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,950
but after 20 years of my throwing money
in that company

5452
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
in that company
 

5453
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,470
in that company
you know it's time to get out well in

5454
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
you know it's time to get out well in
 

5455
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,629
you know it's time to get out well in
some sense getting out now

5456
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:48,639
some sense getting out now
 

5457
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,830
some sense getting out now
is um that's kind of obvious i'm more

5458
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:51,840
is um that's kind of obvious i'm more
 

5459
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,590
is um that's kind of obvious i'm more
interested in how we figure out in the

5460
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
interested in how we figure out in the
 

5461
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,149
interested in how we figure out in the
future

5462
01:28:54,149 --> 01:28:54,159
future
 

5463
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,950
future
how to get out earlier then i mean at

5464
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:56,960
how to get out earlier then i mean at
 

5465
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,590
how to get out earlier then i mean at
this point

5466
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
this point
 

5467
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,189
this point
we've stayed too long and it's obvious

5468
01:28:59,189 --> 01:28:59,199
we've stayed too long and it's obvious
 

5469
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,189
we've stayed too long and it's obvious
the data the the investment

5470
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,199
the data the the investment
 

5471
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:04,229
the data the the investment
nothing is working you know it's very

5472
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
nothing is working you know it's very
 

5473
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,470
nothing is working you know it's very
the very little data points to us

5474
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:06,480
the very little data points to us
 

5475
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,350
the very little data points to us
is staying there i'm more interested in

5476
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
is staying there i'm more interested in
 

5477
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:09,990
is staying there i'm more interested in
uh

5478
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
uh
 

5479
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,229
uh
you know being in a relation let me take

5480
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
you know being in a relation let me take
 

5481
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,910
you know being in a relation let me take
it back to a safer place again being in

5482
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
it back to a safer place again being in
 

5483
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,590
it back to a safer place again being in
a relationship and getting out of that

5484
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
a relationship and getting out of that
 

5485
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,270
a relationship and getting out of that
relationship while things are still good

5486
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
relationship while things are still good
 

5487
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,709
relationship while things are still good
but you have a sense that it's not going

5488
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719

so your senses and started to interrupt
 

5697
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,910
so your senses and started to interrupt
but your sense is

but your sense is
the the conflict of the cold war was

the the conflict of the cold war was
 

5701
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,709
the the conflict of the cold war was
between two ideologies

between two ideologies
 

5703
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,189
between two ideologies
and not just two big countries with

and not just two big countries with
 

5705
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,310
and not just two big countries with
nuclear weapons

nuclear weapons
 

5707
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,510
nuclear weapons
i think it was about two different ways

5708
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
i think it was about two different ways

reading of stalin is he really tried to

5718
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
reading of stalin is he really tried to
 

5719
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,110
reading of stalin is he really tried to
go there that and khrushchev

5720
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
go there that and khrushchev
 

5721
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,950
go there that and khrushchev
really believed gorbachev thought he was

5722
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960
really believed gorbachev thought he was
 

5723
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,550
really believed gorbachev thought he was
going to reform the soviet union so you

5724
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
going to reform the soviet union so you
 

5725
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,149
going to reform the soviet union so you
would go back to a kind of bukhar and

5726
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
would go back to a kind of bukhar and
 

5727
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:06,950
would go back to a kind of bukhar and
lenin

5728
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:06,960
lenin
 

5729
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,830
lenin
communism right so um i do think that

5730
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:09,840
communism right so um i do think that
 

5731
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,110
communism right so um i do think that
mattered i do think that mattered

5732
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:11,120
mattered i do think that mattered
 

5733
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,310
mattered i do think that mattered
enormously and from the united states

5734
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
enormously and from the united states
 

5735
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,350
enormously and from the united states
point of view

5736
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
point of view
 

5737
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,990
point of view
um the view was that communism and

5738
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,000
um the view was that communism and
 

5739
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:16,629
um the view was that communism and
fascism

5740
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
fascism
 

5741
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,590
fascism
were these totalitarian threats to

5742
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
were these totalitarian threats to
 

5743
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,350
were these totalitarian threats to
liberal democracy and capitalism which

5744
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
liberal democracy and capitalism which
 

5745
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,550
liberal democracy and capitalism which
went hand in hand

5746
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:22,560
went hand in hand
 

5747
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,990
went hand in hand
so i do think that's what the struggle

5748
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
so i do think that's what the struggle
 

5749
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,590
so i do think that's what the struggle
was about and in a certain way liberal

5750
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,600
was about and in a certain way liberal
 

5751
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,470
was about and in a certain way liberal
capitalism

5752
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:26,480
capitalism
 

5753
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,229
capitalism
proved to be the more enduring system in

5754
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:28,239
proved to be the more enduring system in
 

5755
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,310
proved to be the more enduring system in
the united states played a key role

5756
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:30,320
the united states played a key role
 

5757
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,470
the united states played a key role
in that that that's the reality of the

5758
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,480
in that that that's the reality of the
 

5759
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,350
in that that that's the reality of the
cold war

5760
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
cold war
 

5761
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,870
cold war
but i think it means different things

5762
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
but i think it means different things
 

5763
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,709
but i think it means different things
now to my students

5764
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:36,719
now to my students
 

5765
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:39,750
now to my students
and others they focus uh

5766
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
and others they focus uh
 

5767
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,350
and others they focus uh
very much on the expansion of american

5768
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
very much on the expansion of american
 

5769
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:43,910
very much on the expansion of american

power
 

5771
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,189
power
and the challenges of managing

5772
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
and the challenges of managing
 

5773
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,390
and the challenges of managing
they're looking at it from the

5774
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,400
they're looking at it from the
 

5775
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,229
they're looking at it from the
perspective of not

5776
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:50,239
perspective of not
 

5777
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,790
perspective of not
will we survive but did we waste our

5778
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:52,800
will we survive but did we waste our
 

5779
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,590
will we survive but did we waste our
resources

5780
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:53,600
resources
 

5781
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,110
resources
on some elements of it it doesn't mean

5782
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
on some elements of it it doesn't mean
 

5783
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,790
on some elements of it it doesn't mean
they were against what america

5784
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:56,800
they were against what america
 

5785
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,550
they were against what america
did but there is a question of the

5786
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
did but there is a question of the
 

5787
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,550
did but there is a question of the
resources that went into the cold war

5788
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
resources that went into the cold war
 

5789
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,790
resources that went into the cold war
and the opportunity costs

5790
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,800
and the opportunity costs
 

5791
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,390
and the opportunity costs
and you see this when you look at the

5792
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
and you see this when you look at the
 

5793
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,910
and you see this when you look at the
sort of health care systems that other

5794
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:05,920
sort of health care systems that other
 

5795
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,350
sort of health care systems that other
countries build and you compare them to

5796
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,360
countries build and you compare them to
 

5797
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,550
countries build and you compare them to
the united states

5798
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,560
the united states
 

5799
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,510
the united states
race issues also um so they they look at

5800
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,520
race issues also um so they they look at
 

5801
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,870
race issues also um so they they look at
the costs which i think

5802
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
the costs which i think
 

5803
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,709
the costs which i think
often happens after a project is done

5804
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
often happens after a project is done
 

5805
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,390
often happens after a project is done
you look back at that

5806
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,400
you look back at that
 

5807
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,550
you look back at that
second i think um they're also more

5808
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:18,560
second i think um they're also more
 

5809
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,750
second i think um they're also more
inclined

5810
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760

6043
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,990
again we can learn that and see that see
how we can

6044
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:08,000
how we can
 

6045
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,629
how we can
reform capitalism today and and and get

6046

6142
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:52,840
it doesn't make any sense but
 

6143

individualism which is deeply ingrained
 

6205
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,790
individualism which is deeply ingrained
uh in our culture in our society and it

6206
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:56,800
uh in our culture in our society and it
 

6207
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,669
uh in our culture in our society and it
means that

6208
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679

the kinds of bad things that happen are

6210
01:40:59,270 --> 01:40:59,280
the kinds of bad things that happen are
 

6211
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,830
the kinds of bad things that happen are
different usually not as bad but

6212
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:01,840
different usually not as bad but
 

6213
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,229
different usually not as bad but
but our individualism often covers up

6214
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
but our individualism often covers up
 

6215
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:04,950
but our individualism often covers up
for

6216
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
for
 

6217
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,310
for
um vigilante activity and individual

violence toward people that you wouldn't
 

6221
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,590
violence toward people that you wouldn't
have in a more collective culture

um so in the soviet union it was at a
 

6225
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,790
um so in the soviet union it was at a
much worse scale and it was done by

6226
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:14,800
much worse scale and it was done by
 

6227
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,270
much worse scale and it was done by
by government organizations in the

6228
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
by government organizations in the
 

6229
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,229
by government organizations in the
united states it's

6230
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:18,239
united states it's
 

6231
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,669
united states it's
you know individuals the history of

6232
01:41:19,669 --> 01:41:19,679
you know individuals the history of
 

6233
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,910
you know individuals the history of
lynching in our country for example

6234
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:21,920
lynching in our country for example
 

6235
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,430
lynching in our country for example
sometimes it's individual police

6236

again the vast majority police officers
 

6241
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,470
again the vast majority police officers
are good people don't do harm to people

6242
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
are good people don't do harm to people

but there are
these examples and they they're able to

01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:31,840
these examples and they they're able to
 

6247
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,870
these examples and they they're able to
fester

6248
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:32,880
fester
 

6249
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,910
fester
in our society because of our

which is what i think you're getting at

6270
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:50,239
which is what i think you're getting at
 

6271
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:50,790
which is what i think you're getting at
here

6272
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,800
here
 

6273
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,629
here
that you should not be completely

6274
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
that you should not be completely
 

6275
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,550
that you should not be completely
dependent for your defense

6276
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
dependent for your defense
 

6277
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,629
dependent for your defense
on an entity that might not be there for

6278
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
on an entity that might not be there for
 

6279
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,149
on an entity that might not be there for
you you should be able to defend

6280
01:41:58,149 --> 01:41:58,159
you you should be able to defend
 

6281
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:01,590
you you should be able to defend
yourself and guns symbolize that um

6282
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,600
yourself and guns symbolize that um
 

6283
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,669
yourself and guns symbolize that um
i think that's a fair point but i think

6284
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
i think that's a fair point but i think
 

6285
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,910
i think that's a fair point but i think
it's also a fair point to say

6286
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:05,920
it's also a fair point to say
 

6287
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,629
it's also a fair point to say
that as with everything uh defining what

6288
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:08,639
that as with everything uh defining what
 

6289
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,470
that as with everything uh defining what
self-defense is is really important

6290
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
self-defense is is really important
 

6291
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,310
self-defense is is really important
so does self-defense mean i can have a

6292
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
so does self-defense mean i can have a
 

6293
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,790
so does self-defense mean i can have a
bazooka does it mean i can have weapons

6294
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
bazooka does it mean i can have weapons
 

6295
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,910
bazooka does it mean i can have weapons
that are designed

6296
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:15,920
that are designed
 

6297
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,629
that are designed
for a military battlefield to mass kill

6298
01:42:18,629 --> 01:42:18,639
for a military battlefield to mass kill
 

6299
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,149
for a military battlefield to mass kill

so let's have that conversation i think
 

6345
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,350
so let's have that conversation i think
it would be useful as a society

6346
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
it would be useful as a society
 

6347

6477
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,550
uh rapid technological innovation
of the last 20 to 30 years uh how we

6478
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
of the last 20 to 30 years uh how we
 

6479

created a whole
 

6481
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,109
created a whole
virtual universe we didn't have before

6482

virtual universe we didn't have before
 

6483
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,470
virtual universe we didn't have before
and of course that's going to go in

6484
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
and of course that's going to go in
 

6485
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,310
and of course that's going to go in
directions you and i can't imagine 50

6486
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:26,320
directions you and i can't imagine 50
 

6487
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,270
directions you and i can't imagine 50
years from now

that this will be seen as that origin
 

6491
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,709
that this will be seen as that origin
moment that when we went from

6492

moment that when we went from
 

6493
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:32,470
moment that when we went from
playing below the rim to playing above

the rim right to being
 

6497
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,550
the rim right to being
all in person to having a whole virtual

world and in a strange way the pandemic
 

6501
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,310
world and in a strange way the pandemic
was a provocation to move even further

6502
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:42,320
was a provocation to move even further
 

6503
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,669
was a provocation to move even further
in that direction and we're never going

6504
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
in that direction and we're never going
 

6505
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:43,990
in that direction and we're never going
back

6506

and the virtual personas
 

6523
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:00,229

01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,310
arc of history
it'll see it'll it'll be seen as an

6622
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
it'll see it'll it'll be seen as an
 

6623
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,270
it'll see it'll it'll be seen as an
outstanding

6624
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
outstanding
 

6625
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,830
outstanding
accomplishment and as a you know a step

6626
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
accomplishment and as a you know a step
 

6627
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,350
accomplishment and as a you know a step
toward whatever maybe they're doing

6628
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
toward whatever maybe they're doing
 

6629
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,030
toward whatever maybe they're doing
vaccines or something that replaces the

6630
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:47,040
vaccines or something that replaces the
 

6631
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:48,790
vaccines or something that replaces the
vaccine in 10 seconds you know at that

6632
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:48,800
vaccine in 10 seconds you know at that
 

6633
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,550
vaccine in 10 seconds you know at that
point right yeah it'll be seen as a step

6634
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:50,560
point right yeah it'll be seen as a step
 

6635
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,070
point right yeah it'll be seen as a step
those will be some of the positives

6636
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:52,080
those will be some of the positives
 

6637
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,510
those will be some of the positives
i think one of the negatives they will

6638
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,520
i think one of the negatives they will
 

6639
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,430
i think one of the negatives they will
point to will be um

6640
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
point to will be um
 

6641
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,709
point to will be um
our inability at least at this moment to

6642
01:47:58,709 --> 01:47:58,719
our inability at least at this moment to
 

6643
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,709
our inability at least at this moment to
manage our environment better how we're

6644
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:00,719
manage our environment better how we're
 

6645
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,629
manage our environment better how we're
destroying our living space

6646
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:02,639
destroying our living space
 

6647
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,229
destroying our living space
and not doing enough even though we have

6648
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:04,239
and not doing enough even though we have
 

6649
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,149
and not doing enough even though we have
the capabilities to do more to preserve

6650
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
the capabilities to do more to preserve
 

6651
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:06,790
the capabilities to do more to preserve
or at least

6652
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:06,800
or at least
 

6653
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,510
or at least
allow a sustainable living space i'm

6654
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
allow a sustainable living space i'm
 

6655
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,590
allow a sustainable living space i'm
confident because i'm an optimist

6656
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:11,600
confident because i'm an optimist
 

6657
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,870
confident because i'm an optimist
that we will get through this and we

6658
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:12,880
that we will get through this and we
 

6659
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,709
that we will get through this and we
will be better at sustaining our

6660
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:14,719
will be better at sustaining our
 

6661
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,550
will be better at sustaining our
environment in future decades

6662
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
environment in future decades
 

6663
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,629
environment in future decades
and so in terms of environmental policy

6664
01:48:18,629 --> 01:48:18,639
and so in terms of environmental policy
 

6665
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:19,590
and so in terms of environmental policy
they'll see this

6666
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:19,600
they'll see this
 

6667
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,470
they'll see this
moment as a dark age or the beginnings

6668
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:22,480
moment as a dark age or the beginnings
 

6669
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:26,070
moment as a dark age or the beginnings
of a better age maybe as a renaissance

6670
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
of a better age maybe as a renaissance
 

6671
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,830
of a better age maybe as a renaissance
or maybe uh as a as the last time

6672
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:29,840
or maybe uh as a as the last time
 

6673
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,149
or maybe uh as a as the last time
most people lived on earth when a couple

centuries afterwards were all dissipated

6676
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,000
centuries afterwards were all dissipated
 

6677
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,350

we shouldn't forget that what this age
 

6695

more than anything
 

6705
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,070
more than anything
because it feels like there's a lot of

because it feels like there's a lot of
 

6707
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,350
because it feels like there's a lot of
weapons that could be yet to be

6708
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:05,360
weapons that could be yet to be
 

6709
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,070
weapons that could be yet to be
developed

6710

developed
 

6711
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,669
developed
in that space but i tend to believe that

6712
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:09,679
in that space but i tend to believe that
 

6713
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:11,910
in that space but i tend to believe that
i'm excited about by two avenues one is

6714
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:11,920
i'm excited about by two avenues one is
 

6715
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,310
i'm excited about by two avenues one is
artificial intelligence

6716
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
artificial intelligence
 

6717
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,149
artificial intelligence
the kind of um the kind of systems we'll

6718
01:49:18,149 --> 01:49:18,159
the kind of um the kind of systems we'll
 

6719
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,830
the kind of um the kind of systems we'll
create in this digital space that you

6720
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:19,840
create in this digital space that you
 

6721
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,270
create in this digital space that you
mentioned we're moving to

6722
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,280
mentioned we're moving to
 

6723
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,350
mentioned we're moving to
and then the other of course this could

6724
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
and then the other of course this could
 

6725
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,109
and then the other of course this could
be the product of the cold war but i'm

we were
enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s

6736
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s
 

6737
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:35,750
enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s
when it was a cold war competition and

6738
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:35,760
when it was a cold war competition and
 

6739
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,750
when it was a cold war competition and
then after the 70s we sort of gave up on

6740
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:37,760
then after the 70s we sort of gave up on
 

6741

6749
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,510
i think there's so much to be gained
from the power of exploration

6750
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,520
from the power of exploration
 

6751
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,990

about mannerism
about assumptions uh the very fact that

6944

6961
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,430
right that's just one example
uh the fact that um you know that

6962
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
uh the fact that um you know that
 

6963
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:07,189
uh the fact that um you know that
germans have such a wider vocabulary

6964
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
germans have such a wider vocabulary
 

6965

about the culture right language
 

6971
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,030
about the culture right language
is an artifact of the culture the

6972
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:15,040
is an artifact of the culture the
 

6973
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,310
is an artifact of the culture the
culture makes the language

6974
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:16,320
culture makes the language
 

6975

culture makes the language
it's fascinating to explore i mean even

6976
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:17,840
it's fascinating to explore i mean even
 

6977
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,149
it's fascinating to explore i mean even
just exactly what you just said

6978
01:53:22,149 --> 01:53:22,159

 

6979
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:25,109

which is there's a fascinating

6980
01:53:25,109 --> 01:53:25,119
which is there's a fascinating
 

6981
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:26,550
which is there's a fascinating
transition

6982
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:26,560
transition
 

6983
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,470
transition
so i guess in english we just have you

6984
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480
so i guess in english we just have you
 

6985
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,990
so i guess in english we just have you
yeah

6986
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:30,000
yeah
 

6987
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,709
yeah
there's a there's a fascinating

6988
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
there's a there's a fascinating
 

6989
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,709
there's a there's a fascinating
transition that persists to this day

6990
01:53:34,709 --> 01:53:34,719
transition that persists to this day
 

6991
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,990
transition that persists to this day
is is of formalism and politeness

6992
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,000
is is of formalism and politeness
 

6993
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,709
is is of formalism and politeness
where it's an initial kind of dance of

6994
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:40,719
where it's an initial kind of dance of
 

6995
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,229
where it's an initial kind of dance of
interaction that's

6996
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
interaction that's
 

6997
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:45,270
interaction that's
uh different methods

6998
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,280
uh different methods
 

6999
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,950
uh different methods
of signaling respect i guess we don't

7000
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:48,960
of signaling respect i guess we don't
 

7001
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,790
of signaling respect i guess we don't
then language provides that and in the

7002
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
then language provides that and in the
 

7003
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,109
then language provides that and in the
united in the english language

7004
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:53,119
united in the english language
 

7005
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:54,870
united in the english language
there's fewer tools to show that kind of

7006
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880
there's fewer tools to show that kind of
 

7007
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,149
there's fewer tools to show that kind of
respect which has

7008
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,159
respect which has
 

7009
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,910
respect which has
potentially positive or negative effects

7010
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:57,920
potentially positive or negative effects
 

7011
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,310
potentially positive or negative effects
and it flattens the society where like a

7012
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:00,320
and it flattens the society where like a
 

7013
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,470
and it flattens the society where like a
teenager could talk to an older person

7014
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:02,480
teenager could talk to an older person
 

7015
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:06,070
teenager could talk to an older person
and show like uh like a difference

7016
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:06,080
and show like uh like a difference
 

7017
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,030
and show like uh like a difference
i mean but at the same time i mean it

7018
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:09,040
i mean but at the same time i mean it
 

7019
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,030
i mean but at the same time i mean it
creates a certain kind of dynamic a

7020
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:11,040
creates a certain kind of dynamic a
 

7021
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,629
creates a certain kind of dynamic a
certain kind of society

7022
01:54:12,629 --> 01:54:12,639
certain kind of society
 

7023
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:14,390
certain kind of society
and it's funny to think of just like

7024
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
and it's funny to think of just like
 

7025
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,070
and it's funny to think of just like
those few words can have any

7026
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:16,080
those few words can have any
 

7027
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,070
those few words can have any
like a ripple effect through the whole

7028
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
like a ripple effect through the whole
 

7029
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,750
like a ripple effect through the whole
culture and we don't have a history in

7030
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:19,760
culture and we don't have a history in
 

7031
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,629
culture and we don't have a history in
the united states of

7032
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
the united states of
 

7033
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,669
the united states of
of aristocracy yeah the these uh

7034
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:23,679
of aristocracy yeah the these uh
 

7035
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:25,669
of aristocracy yeah the these uh
elements of language reflect aristocracy

7036
01:54:25,669 --> 01:54:25,679
elements of language reflect aristocracy
 

7037
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:26,709
elements of language reflect aristocracy
the the the surf

7038
01:54:26,709 --> 01:54:26,719
the the the surf
 

7039
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,470
the the the surf
would never refer to the master even if

7040
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480
would never refer to the master even if
 

7041
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,149
would never refer to the master even if
the master is younger

7042
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
the master is younger
 

7043
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,470
the master is younger
it's always void right of it's always

7044
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:32,480
it's always void right of it's always
 

7045
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,669
it's always void right of it's always
right i mean and so

7046
01:54:33,669 --> 01:54:33,679
right i mean and so
 

7047
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,229
right i mean and so
it's um yeah so it tells you something

7048
01:54:36,229 --> 01:54:36,239
it's um yeah so it tells you something
 

7049
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:37,510
it's um yeah so it tells you something
about the history that's why to your

7050
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:37,520
about the history that's why to your
 

7051
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,030
about the history that's why to your
question which was a great question it's

7052
01:54:39,030 --> 01:54:39,040
question which was a great question it's
 

7053
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,229
question which was a great question it's
so crucial

7054
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:40,239
so crucial
 

7055
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:41,990
so crucial
to try to penetrate the language i'll

7056
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
to try to penetrate the language i'll
 

7057
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,350
to try to penetrate the language i'll
also say something else

7058
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
also say something else
 

7059
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,870
also say something else
and this is a problem for many americans

7060
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:44,880
and this is a problem for many americans
 

7061
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,990
and this is a problem for many americans
who haven't learned a foreign language

who haven't learned a foreign language
 

7063
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,350
who haven't learned a foreign language
we're very bad at teaching foreign

7064
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
we're very bad at teaching foreign
 

7065
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,149
we're very bad at teaching foreign
languages

7066

languages
 

7067
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:50,149
languages
if you've never taught yourself a

7068
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:50,159
if you've never taught yourself a
 

7069

you have closed yourself off to certain
 

7073
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,950
you have closed yourself off to certain
kinds of empathy

7074

kinds of empathy
 

7075
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,950
kinds of empathy
because you have basically trained your

7076
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:56,960
because you have basically trained your
 

7077
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,510
because you have basically trained your
brain to only look at the world one way

7078

the very act of learning another
language i think tells your brain

7082
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
language i think tells your brain
 

7083
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,270
language i think tells your brain
that words and concepts don't translate

7084
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:07,280
that words and concepts don't translate
 

7085
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:07,990
that words and concepts don't translate
one to one

maybe you have an insight about what's
 

7741
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:07,030
maybe you have an insight about what's
the meaning of life

7742
02:05:07,030 --> 02:05:07,040
the meaning of life
 

7743
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,030
the meaning of life
why do you ever ask when you look at

7744
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,040
why do you ever ask when you look at
 

7745
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,149
why do you ever ask when you look at
history the why

7746
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:10,159
history the why
 

7747
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:11,990
history the why
yeah i do all the time and i don't have

7748
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
yeah i do all the time and i don't have
 

7749
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,589
yeah i do all the time and i don't have
i don't have a i don't have an answer

7750
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:13,599
i don't have a i don't have an answer
 

7751
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,750
i don't have a i don't have an answer
it's it's the mystery that we can't uh

7752
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:15,760
it's it's the mystery that we can't uh
 

7753
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,350
it's it's the mystery that we can't uh
answer i i do think um what it means is

7754
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:19,360
answer i i do think um what it means is
 

7755
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:19,990
answer i i do think um what it means is
what we make of

7756
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
what we make of
 

7757
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,109
what we make of
it there's no universal

7758
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
it there's no universal
 

7759
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:25,030
it there's no universal
every every period i've studied and i've

7760
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,040
every every period i've studied and i've
 

7761
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,310
every every period i've studied and i've
studied a little bit of a lot of periods

7762
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:26,320
studied a little bit of a lot of periods
 

7763
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:27,830
studied a little bit of a lot of periods
and a lot of a few periods

7764
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:27,840
and a lot of a few periods
 

7765
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,270
and a lot of a few periods
every period people struggle with this

7766
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,280
every period people struggle with this
 

7767
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,030
every period people struggle with this
and there's no they don't come to

7768
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:31,040
and there's no they don't come to
 

7769
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,750
and there's no they don't come to
wiser people than us don't come to a

7770
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:33,760
wiser people than us don't come to a
 

7771
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:34,470
wiser people than us don't come to a
firm answer

7772
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:34,480
firm answer
 

7773
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:37,350
firm answer
except it's what you make of it meaning

7774
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:37,360
except it's what you make of it meaning
 

7775
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,790
except it's what you make of it meaning
is what you make of it so

7776
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:38,800
is what you make of it so
 

7777
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,750
is what you make of it so
think about what what you want to care

7778
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
think about what what you want to care
 

7779
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,030
think about what what you want to care
about and make that

7780
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:43,040
about and make that
 

7781
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,270
about and make that
the meaning in your life um i wonder how

7782
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:45,280
the meaning in your life um i wonder how
 

7783
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,990
the meaning in your life um i wonder how
that changes throughout human history

7784
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
that changes throughout human history
 

7785
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,790
that changes throughout human history
whether there's a constant like that's i

7786
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:50,800
whether there's a constant like that's i
 

7787
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,430
whether there's a constant like that's i
often

7788
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:51,440
often
 

7789
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,910
often
think especially when you study

7790
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:53,920
think especially when you study
 

7791
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,910
think especially when you study
evolutionary biology and you just

7792
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:55,920
evolutionary biology and you just
 

7793
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,830
evolutionary biology and you just
see our origins from life and as it

7794
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
see our origins from life and as it
 

7795
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,109
see our origins from life and as it
evolves

7796
02:05:59,109 --> 02:05:59,119
evolves
 

7797
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:02,149
evolves
it's like it makes you wonder if

7798
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
it's like it makes you wonder if
 

7799
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,310
it's like it makes you wonder if
it feels like there's a thread that

7800
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:04,320
it feels like there's a thread that
 

7801
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,790
it feels like there's a thread that
connects all of it

7802
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:06,800
connects all of it
 

7803
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,950
connects all of it
that we're headed somewhere

7804
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:10,960
that we're headed somewhere
 

7805
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:15,350
that we're headed somewhere
we're trying to actualize some greater

7806
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,360
we're trying to actualize some greater
 

7807
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,390
we're trying to actualize some greater
purpose you know like there there seems

7808
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:18,400
purpose you know like there there seems
 

7809
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,149
purpose you know like there there seems
to be a direction to this thing

7810
02:06:20,149 --> 02:06:20,159
to be a direction to this thing
 

7811
02:06:20,159 --> 02:06:21,589
to be a direction to this thing
and we're all kind of stumbling in the

7812
02:06:21,589 --> 02:06:21,599
and we're all kind of stumbling in the
 

7813
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:23,910
and we're all kind of stumbling in the
dark trying to figure it out

7814
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:23,920
dark trying to figure it out
 

7815
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:26,149
dark trying to figure it out
but it feels like we eventually will

7816
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:26,159
but it feels like we eventually will
 

7817
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:28,229
but it feels like we eventually will
find an answer

7818
02:06:28,229 --> 02:06:28,239
find an answer
 

7819
02:06:28,239 --> 02:06:30,709
find an answer
i hope so yeah maybe i mean i do think

7820
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
i hope so yeah maybe i mean i do think
 

7821
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:31,270
i hope so yeah maybe i mean i do think
we all

7822
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
we all
 

7823
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,790
we all
um we all want

7824
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:34,800
um we all want
 

7825
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,149
um we all want
our families to do better we are we we

7826
02:06:38,149 --> 02:06:38,159
our families to do better we are we we
 

7827
02:06:38,159 --> 02:06:38,950
our families to do better we are we we
are

7828
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:38,960
are
 

7829
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,390
are
familiar and family doesn't just mean

7830
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,400
familiar and family doesn't just mean
 

7831
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,990
familiar and family doesn't just mean
biological family you can have all kinds

7832
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:42,000
biological family you can have all kinds
 

7833
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,149
biological family you can have all kinds
of ways you define family and community

7834
02:06:44,149 --> 02:06:44,159
of ways you define family and community
 

7835
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:47,589
of ways you define family and community
and i think i think we are moving slowly

7836
02:06:47,589 --> 02:06:47,599
and i think i think we are moving slowly
 

7837
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:47,990
and i think i think we are moving slowly
and

7838
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:48,000
and
 

7839
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,030
and
in a very messy way toward a larger

7840
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,040
in a very messy way toward a larger
 

7841
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,750
in a very messy way toward a larger
world community to include all of

7842
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:53,760
world community to include all of
 

7843
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:54,790
world community to include all of
biological life

7844
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:54,800
biological life
 

7845
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:57,990
biological life
and eventually uh artificial life

7846
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
and eventually uh artificial life
 

7847
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,830
and eventually uh artificial life
as well and so that this

7848
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:01,840
as well and so that this
 

7849
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,589
as well and so that this
to uh to expand the lesson to the advice

7850
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
to uh to expand the lesson to the advice
 

7851
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:08,149
to uh to expand the lesson to the advice
that uh your grandmother taught you is i

7852
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:08,159
that uh your grandmother taught you is i
 

7853
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:09,189
that uh your grandmother taught you is i
think we should treat

7854
02:07:09,189 --> 02:07:09,199
think we should treat
 

7855
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:12,629
think we should treat
robots and ai systems uh good

7856
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639
robots and ai systems uh good
 

7857
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:14,390
robots and ai systems uh good
as well even if they're currently not

7858
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:14,400
as well even if they're currently not
 

7859
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,750
as well even if they're currently not
very intelligent because

7860
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,760
very intelligent because
 

7861
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,350
very intelligent because
one day they might be right right i

7862
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,360
one day they might be right right i
 

7863
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:18,950
one day they might be right right i
think that's exactly right and and we

7864
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
think that's exactly right and and we
 

7865
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,709
think that's exactly right and and we
should think through

7866
02:07:20,709 --> 02:07:20,719
should think through
 

7867
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,109
should think through
exactly exactly as a humanist how i

7868
02:07:23,109 --> 02:07:23,119
exactly exactly as a humanist how i
 

7869
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:24,390
exactly exactly as a humanist how i
would approach that issue

7870
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:24,400
would approach that issue
 

7871
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,790
would approach that issue
we need to think through the kinds of

7872
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800
we need to think through the kinds of
 

7873
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,109
we need to think through the kinds of
behavior patterns we want to establish

7874
02:07:29,109 --> 02:07:29,119
behavior patterns we want to establish
 

7875
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:31,910
behavior patterns we want to establish
with these new forms of life artificial

7876
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:31,920
with these new forms of life artificial
 

7877
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:32,709
with these new forms of life artificial

um for ourselves also to your point so

7880
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
um for ourselves also to your point so
 

7881
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,350
um for ourselves also to your point so
we behave the right way so we don't

7882
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:37,360
we behave the right way so we don't
 

7883
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,830
we behave the right way so we don't
misuse this

7884
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:39,840
misuse this
 

7885
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:42,229
misuse this
