time that forms the knowledge i think of

time that forms the knowledge i think of
 

181
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,990
time that forms the knowledge i think of
understanding more like a um

182
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
understanding more like a um
 

183
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,670
understanding more like a um
think of it more like the ground you

184
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
think of it more like the ground you
 

185
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,110
think of it more like the ground you
stand on

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
stand on
 

187
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,190
stand on
which

188
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
which
 

189
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,949
which
could be very shaky could be very unsafe

190
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
could be very shaky could be very unsafe
 

191
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,670
could be very shaky could be very unsafe
but most of the time is not because

192
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
but most of the time is not because
 

193
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,869
but most of the time is not because
underneath it is more ground

194
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
underneath it is more ground

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,789
to think about it you rarely need to

count on it but occasionally you do

count on it but occasionally you do
and

00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
and
 

209
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,550
and
i've never used this analogy before so

210
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
i've never used this analogy before so
 

211
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,789
i've never used this analogy before so
bear with me but i think the same thing

212
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
bear with me but i think the same thing
 

213
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,509
bear with me but i think the same thing
is true in in terms of getting computers

uh you ask

218
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
uh you ask
 

219
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,429
uh you ask
a computer a question for instance alexa

220
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
a computer a question for instance alexa
 

221

a computer a question for instance alexa
or

222
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
or
 

223
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,390
or
some robot or something and

224
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
some robot or something and
 

225
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,190
some robot or something and
um maybe it gets the right answer

226
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
um maybe it gets the right answer
 

227
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,990
um maybe it gets the right answer
but if you were asking that of a human

228
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
but if you were asking that of a human
 

229
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,429
but if you were asking that of a human
you could also say things like why

230
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
you could also say things like why
 

231
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,309
you could also say things like why
or how might you be wrong about this or

232
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
or how might you be wrong about this or
 

233
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,789
or how might you be wrong about this or
something like that and the person you

234
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
something like that and the person you
 

235
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,110
something like that and the person you
know would would answer you and you know

236
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
know would would answer you and you know
 

237
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,550
know would would answer you and you know
it might be a little annoying if you

238
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
it might be a little annoying if you
 

239
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,469
it might be a little annoying if you
have a small child and they keep asking

have a small child and they keep asking
 

241
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,350
have a small child and they keep asking
why questions in series eventually you

242
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
why questions in series eventually you
 

243
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,870
why questions in series eventually you
get to the point where you throw up your

244
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
get to the point where you throw up your
 

245
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,469
get to the point where you throw up your
hands and say i don't know it's just the

246
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
hands and say i don't know it's just the
 

247
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,469
hands and say i don't know it's just the
way the world is but for many layers you

way the world is but for many layers you
 

249
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,469
way the world is but for many layers you
actually have that that layered solid

actually have that that layered solid

need it

need it
you can count on it and when do you need

you can count on it and when do you need

it may be

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,390
it may be
fine to have a small program a small set

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
fine to have a small program a small set
 

267
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,830
fine to have a small program a small set
of rules that cover you know 99 of the

you really need to draw on common sense

274
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
you really need to draw on common sense

for instance um my wife and i were

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
for instance um my wife and i were

and there was a trash truck in front of
 

281
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,110
and there was a trash truck in front of
us

282

us
 

283
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,749
us
and i guess they had packed it too full

284
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
and i guess they had packed it too full
 

285
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,270
and i guess they had packed it too full
and the back exploded and trash bags

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
and the back exploded and trash bags
 

287
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,029
and the back exploded and trash bags
went everywhere

288
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
went everywhere
 

289
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,189
went everywhere
and we had to you know make a split

290
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
and we had to you know make a split
 

291
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,270
and we had to you know make a split
second decision are we going to slam on

292
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
second decision are we going to slam on

another lane are we going to just run it

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
another lane are we going to just run it
 

297
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,310
another lane are we going to just run it
over

298
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
over
 

299
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,710
over
because there are cars all around us

300
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
because there are cars all around us
 

301
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,990
because there are cars all around us
and you know in front of us was a large

302
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
and you know in front of us was a large
 

303
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,150
and you know in front of us was a large
trash bag and we know what we throw away

304
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
trash bag and we know what we throw away
 

305
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,990
trash bag and we know what we throw away
in trash bags probably not a safe thing

306
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
in trash bags probably not a safe thing
 

307
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,510
in trash bags probably not a safe thing
to run over um over on the the left was

308
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
to run over um over on the the left was
 

309
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,550
to run over um over on the the left was
um a bunch of fast food restaurant um

310
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
um a bunch of fast food restaurant um
 

311
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,390
um a bunch of fast food restaurant um
trash bags and it's like oh well those

312
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
trash bags and it's like oh well those
 

313
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,990
trash bags and it's like oh well those
things are just like styrofoam and

314
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
things are just like styrofoam and
 

315
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,550
things are just like styrofoam and
leftover food we'll run over that and so

316
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
leftover food we'll run over that and so
 

317
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,029
leftover food we'll run over that and so
that was a safe thing for us to to do

318
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
that was a safe thing for us to to do
 

319
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,230
that was a safe thing for us to to do
now that's the kind of thing that's

320
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
now that's the kind of thing that's
 

321
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,590
now that's the kind of thing that's
going to happen maybe once in your life

00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
going to happen maybe once in your life
 

323
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,110
going to happen maybe once in your life
and um

00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
and um
 

325
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,430
and um
but the point is that there's almost no

00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
but the point is that there's almost no

336
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
but see when you sit on that mountain
 

337
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,230
but see when you sit on that mountain
or that ground that goes deep of

338
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
or that ground that goes deep of
 

339
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,510
or that ground that goes deep of

in order to make a split-second decision
about fast food trash or random trash

344
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
about fast food trash or random trash
 

345
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,710
about fast food trash or random trash
from the back of a

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
from the back of a
 

347
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,909

trash truck

348
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919

 

349
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,990

you need to be able to leverage that

350
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
you need to be able to leverage that
 

351
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,670
you need to be able to leverage that
ground you stand on in some way it's not

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
merely
 

355
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,430
merely
you know it's not enough to just have a

you know it's not enough to just have a
 

357
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,749
you know it's not enough to just have a
lot of ground to stand on it's your

00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
lot of ground to stand on it's your
 

359
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,189
lot of ground to stand on it's your
ability to leverage it to utilize in a

make that split second decision
 

365
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,350
make that split second decision
and i i suppose

366
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
and i i suppose
 

367
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,390

understanding isn't just

368
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
understanding isn't just
 

369
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,150
understanding isn't just
having uh

370
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
having uh

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,469
having uh
common sense knowledge to access

372
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
common sense knowledge to access
 

373
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,950
common sense knowledge to access
it's the act of accessing accessing it

374
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
it's the act of accessing accessing it
 

375
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,270
it's the act of accessing accessing it
somehow like correctly

376
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280

 

377
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,270

filtering out the parts of the knowledge

378
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
filtering out the parts of the knowledge
 

379
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,589
filtering out the parts of the knowledge
are not useful selecting only the useful

380
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
are not useful selecting only the useful
 

381
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,510
are not useful selecting only the useful
parts and uh

382
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
parts and uh
 

383
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,230

effectively making conclusive decisions

384
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
effectively making conclusive decisions
 

385
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,230
effectively making conclusive decisions
so let's tease apart

386
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
so let's tease apart
 

387
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,230
so let's tease apart
two different tasks really both of which

388
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
two different tasks really both of which
 

389
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,150
two different tasks really both of which
are incredibly important and even

390
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
are incredibly important and even
 

391
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,430
are incredibly important and even
necessary

392
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
necessary
 

393
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,629
necessary
if you're going to have this in a usable

394
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
if you're going to have this in a usable
 

395
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,029
if you're going to have this in a usable
useful usable fashion as opposed to say

396
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
useful usable fashion as opposed to say
 

397
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,670
useful usable fashion as opposed to say
like library books sitting on a shelf

398
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
like library books sitting on a shelf
 

399
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,870
like library books sitting on a shelf
and so on

400
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
and so on
 

401
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,950
and so on
where the knowledge might be there but

402
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
where the knowledge might be there but
 

403
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,430
where the knowledge might be there but
you know if a fire comes the books are

404
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
you know if a fire comes the books are
 

405
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,189
you know if a fire comes the books are
going to burn because they don't know

406
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
going to burn because they don't know
 

407
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,029
going to burn because they don't know
what's in them and they're just going to

408
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
what's in them and they're just going to
 

409
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,430
what's in them and they're just going to
sit there while they burn um so there

410
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
sit there while they burn um so there
 

411
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,029
sit there while they burn um so there
are two there are two

412
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
are two there are two
 

413
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,309
are two there are two
aspects of using the knowledge one is a

414
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
aspects of using the knowledge one is a
 

415
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,469
aspects of using the knowledge one is a
kind of a theoretical

416
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
kind of a theoretical
 

417
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,550
kind of a theoretical
how is it possible at all

418
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
how is it possible at all
 

419
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,469
how is it possible at all
and then the second aspect of what you

420
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
and then the second aspect of what you
 

421
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,869
and then the second aspect of what you
said is how can you do it quickly enough

422
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
said is how can you do it quickly enough
 

423
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,589
said is how can you do it quickly enough
right um so how can you do it at all is

424
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
right um so how can you do it at all is
 

425
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,230
right um so how can you do it at all is
something that philosophers have

426
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
something that philosophers have
 

427
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,390
something that philosophers have
grappled with and fortunately

428
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
grappled with and fortunately
 

429
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,270
grappled with and fortunately
philosophers 100 years ago and even

430
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
philosophers 100 years ago and even
 

431
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,950
philosophers 100 years ago and even
earlier

432
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
earlier
 

433
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,110
earlier
developed a kind of

434
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
developed a kind of
 

435
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,790
developed a kind of
formal language

436
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
formal language
 

437
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,550
formal language
like english

438
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
like english
 

439
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,629
like english
it's called

440
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
it's called
 

441
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,830
it's called
predicate logic or first order logic or

442
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
predicate logic or first order logic or
 

443
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,830
predicate logic or first order logic or
something like predicate calculus and so

444
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
something like predicate calculus and so
 

445
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,070
something like predicate calculus and so
on so there's a way of representing

446
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
on so there's a way of representing
 

447
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,270
on so there's a way of representing
things

448
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
things
 

449
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,510
things
in this formal language

450
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
in this formal language
 

451
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,029
in this formal language
which

452
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
which
 

453
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,550
which
enables a mechanical procedure to sort

454
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
enables a mechanical procedure to sort
 

455
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,469
enables a mechanical procedure to sort
of grind through

456
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
of grind through
 

457
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,110
of grind through
and algorithmically produce all of the

458
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
and algorithmically produce all of the
 

459
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,029
and algorithmically produce all of the
same logical

460
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
same logical
 

461
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,870
same logical
entailments all the same logical

462
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
entailments all the same logical
 

463
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,350
entailments all the same logical
conclusions that you or i would from

464
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
conclusions that you or i would from
 

465
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,709
conclusions that you or i would from
that same set of pieces of information

466
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
that same set of pieces of information
 

467
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,029
that same set of pieces of information
that are represented that way

468
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
that are represented that way
 

469
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,550
that are represented that way
um so um that that sort of raises um a

470
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
um so um that that sort of raises um a
 

471
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,949
um so um that that sort of raises um a
couple questions one is how do you get

472
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
couple questions one is how do you get
 

473
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,590
couple questions one is how do you get
all this information from say

474
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
all this information from say
 

475
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,230
all this information from say
observations and english and so on into

476
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
observations and english and so on into
 

477
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,030
observations and english and so on into
this logical form right and secondly how

478
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
this logical form right and secondly how
 

479
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,990
this logical form right and secondly how
can you then efficiently um run these

480
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
can you then efficiently um run these
 

481
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
can you then efficiently um run these
algorithms to actually get the

00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
algorithms to actually get the
 

483
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,070
algorithms to actually get the
information you need in in the case i

484
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
information you need in in the case i

mentioned in a tenth of a second rather

486
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
mentioned in a tenth of a second rather
 

487
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,829
mentioned in a tenth of a second rather
than say i'm in you know 10 hours or 10

488
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
than say i'm in you know 10 hours or 10

000 years of computation
 

491
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,829
000 years of computation
um and those are both really important

492
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
um and those are both really important
 

493
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,630
um and those are both really important
um

494
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
um
 

495
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,590
um
uh questions and like a corollary

496
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
uh questions and like a corollary
 

497
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,710
uh questions and like a corollary
addition to the first one is how many

498
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
addition to the first one is how many
 

499
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,829
addition to the first one is how many
such

500
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
such
 

501
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,590
such
things do you need to gather for it to

502
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
things do you need to gather for it to
 

503
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,470
things do you need to gather for it to
be useful in certain contexts

504
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
be useful in certain contexts
 

505
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,750
be useful in certain contexts
so like what

506
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
so like what
 

507
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,590
so like what
in order you mention philosophers in

508
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
in order you mention philosophers in
 

509
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,110
in order you mention philosophers in
order to capture this world and

510
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
order to capture this world and
 

511
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,389
order to capture this world and
represent it

512
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
represent it
 

513
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,910
represent it
in a logical way and with a formal logic

514
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
in a logical way and with a formal logic
 

515
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,790
in a logical way and with a formal logic
like

516
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
like
 

517
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,430
like
how many statements are required is it

518
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
how many statements are required is it
 

519
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,630
how many statements are required is it
five is it ten is it ten trillion is it

520
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
five is it ten is it ten trillion is it
 

521
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,910
five is it ten is it ten trillion is it
like that that's

522
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
like that that's
 

523
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
like that that's
as far as i understand is uh probably

524
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
as far as i understand is uh probably
 

525
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,389
as far as i understand is uh probably
still an open question it may forever be

526
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
still an open question it may forever be
 

527
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,470
still an open question it may forever be
an open question uh

528
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
an open question uh
 

529
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,269
an open question uh
just to say like definitively about

530
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
just to say like definitively about
 

531
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,509
just to say like definitively about
to describe the universe perfectly well

532
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
to describe the universe perfectly well
 

533
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,389
to describe the universe perfectly well
how many facts do you need

534
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
how many facts do you need
 

535
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,150
how many facts do you need
i i guess i'm going to disappoint you by

536
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
i i guess i'm going to disappoint you by
 

537
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,670
i i guess i'm going to disappoint you by
giving you an actual answer to your

538
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
giving you an actual answer to your
 

539
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,389
giving you an actual answer to your
question okay um well no this sounds

540
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
question okay um well no this sounds
 

541
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,350
question okay um well no this sounds
exciting

542
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
exciting
 

543
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,829
exciting
yes okay so so now we have like um three

544
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
yes okay so so now we have like um three
 

545
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,069
yes okay so so now we have like um three
three things to talk about we'll keep

546
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
three things to talk about we'll keep
 

547
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,829
three things to talk about we'll keep
adding more that's okay the first and

548
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
adding more that's okay the first and
 

549
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,470
adding more that's okay the first and
the third are related yes um so let's

550
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
the third are related yes um so let's
 

551
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,190
the third are related yes um so let's
leave the efficiency question aside for

552
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
leave the efficiency question aside for
 

553
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,630
leave the efficiency question aside for
now so um how how does all this

554
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
now so um how how does all this
 

555
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,190
now so um how how does all this
information get represented in

556
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
information get represented in
 

557
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,269
information get represented in
logical form so that these algorithms

558
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
logical form so that these algorithms
 

559
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,110
logical form so that these algorithms
resolution theorem proving and other

560
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
resolution theorem proving and other
 

561
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,670
resolution theorem proving and other
algorithms can actually grind through

562
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
algorithms can actually grind through
 

563
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,670
algorithms can actually grind through
all the logical consequences of what you

564
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
all the logical consequences of what you
 

565
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,710
all the logical consequences of what you
said

566
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
said
 

567
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,710
said
and that ties into your question about

568
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
and that ties into your question about
 

569
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,150
and that ties into your question about
well how many of these things do you

570
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
well how many of these things do you
 

571
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,670
well how many of these things do you
need

572
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
need
 

573
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,310
need
because if the answer is small enough

574
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
because if the answer is small enough
 

575
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,389
because if the answer is small enough
then by hand you could write them out

576
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
then by hand you could write them out
 

577
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,630
then by hand you could write them out
one at a time

578
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
one at a time
 

579
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,750
one at a time
so

580
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
so
 

581
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,110
so
in

582
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
in
 

583
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,150
in
the

584
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
the
 

585
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,350
the
19 early 1984

586
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
19 early 1984
 

587
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,710
19 early 1984
i held a meeting at stanford where i was

588
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
i held a meeting at stanford where i was
 

589
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,910
i held a meeting at stanford where i was
a

590
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
a
 

591
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,509
a
faculty member there

592
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
faculty member there
 

593
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,990
faculty member there
where we assembled

594
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
where we assembled
 

595
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,230
where we assembled
about half a dozen of the smartest

596
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
about half a dozen of the smartest
 

597
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,710
about half a dozen of the smartest
people i know

598
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
people i know
 

599
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,230
people i know
people like

600
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
people like
 

601
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,269
people like
alan newell and marvin minsky and alan

602
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
alan newell and marvin minsky and alan
 

603
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,150
alan newell and marvin minsky and alan
kaye

604
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
kaye
 

605
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,030
kaye
and

606
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
and
 

607
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,990
and
um um a few others was firemen there by

608
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
um um a few others was firemen there by
 

609
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,910
um um a few others was firemen there by
chance because he he liked your he

610
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
chance because he he liked your he
 

611
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,829
chance because he he liked your he
commented about your system urisco at

612
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
commented about your system urisco at
 

613
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,230
commented about your system urisco at
the time no no he he wasn't part of this

614
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
the time no no he he wasn't part of this
 

615
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,069
the time no no he he wasn't part of this
meeting um but that's a heck of a

616
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
meeting um but that's a heck of a
 

617
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,230
meeting um but that's a heck of a
meeting anyway i think ed feigenbaum was

618
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
meeting anyway i think ed feigenbaum was
 

619
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,269
meeting anyway i think ed feigenbaum was
there i think um josh lederberg was

620
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
there i think um josh lederberg was
 

621
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,990
there i think um josh lederberg was
there so we we have um

622
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
there so we we have um
 

623
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,230
there so we we have um
all these different um smart people and

624
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
all these different um smart people and
 

625
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,829
all these different um smart people and
we were um

626
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
we were um
 

627
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,269
we were um
we came together

628
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
we came together
 

629
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,069
we came together
to

630
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
to
 

631
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,670
to
address the question

632
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
address the question
 

633
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,670
address the question
that that you raised which is if it's

634
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
that that you raised which is if it's
 

635
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,509
that that you raised which is if it's
important to represent common sense

636
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
important to represent common sense
 

637
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,590
important to represent common sense
knowledge and world knowledge in order

638
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
knowledge and world knowledge in order
 

639
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,150
knowledge and world knowledge in order
for ais to not be brittle

640
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
for ais to not be brittle
 

641
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
for ais to not be brittle
in order for ais not to just have the

642
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
in order for ais not to just have the
 

643
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,030
in order for ais not to just have the
veneer of intelligence well how many

644
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
veneer of intelligence well how many
 

645
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,310
veneer of intelligence well how many
pieces

646
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
pieces
 

647
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,910
pieces
of common sense how many if then rules

648
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
of common sense how many if then rules
 

649
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,509
of common sense how many if then rules
for instance would we have to actually

650
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
for instance would we have to actually
 

651
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,550
for instance would we have to actually
write in order to essentially cover what

652
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
write in order to essentially cover what
 

653
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,310
write in order to essentially cover what
what people expect

654
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
what people expect
 

655
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,150
what people expect
perfect strangers to already know about

656
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
perfect strangers to already know about
 

657
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,670
perfect strangers to already know about
the world

658
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
the world
 

659
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,790
the world
and

660
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
and
 

661
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,870
and
i expected there would be an enormous

662
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
i expected there would be an enormous
 

663
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,949
i expected there would be an enormous
divergence of opinion um and computation

664
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
divergence of opinion um and computation
 

665
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,430
divergence of opinion um and computation
but amazingly everyone got an answer

666
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
but amazingly everyone got an answer
 

667
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,550
but amazingly everyone got an answer
which was around a million

668
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
which was around a million
 

669
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,829
which was around a million
and one person one person got the answer

670
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
and one person one person got the answer
 

671
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,509
and one person one person got the answer
by saying well

672
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
by saying well
 

673
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,990
by saying well
look you can only burn into human

674
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
look you can only burn into human
 

675
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,310
look you can only burn into human
long-term memory a certain number of

676
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
long-term memory a certain number of
 

677
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,470
long-term memory a certain number of
things per unit time like maybe one

678
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
things per unit time like maybe one
 

679
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,870
things per unit time like maybe one
every 30 seconds or something and other

680
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
every 30 seconds or something and other
 

681
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,710
every 30 seconds or something and other
than that it's just short-term memory

682
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
than that it's just short-term memory
 

683
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,190
than that it's just short-term memory
and it flows away like water and so on

684
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
and it flows away like water and so on
 

685
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,509
and it flows away like water and so on
so by the time you're say 10 years old

686
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
so by the time you're say 10 years old
 

687
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,509
so by the time you're say 10 years old
or so um how many things could you

688
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
or so um how many things could you
 

689
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,990
or so um how many things could you
possibly have burned into your long-term

690
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
possibly have burned into your long-term
 

691
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,310
possibly have burned into your long-term
memory and it's like about a million

692
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
memory and it's like about a million
 

693
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,150
memory and it's like about a million
another person went a completely

694
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
another person went a completely
 

695
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,389
another person went a completely
different direction and said well if you

696
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
different direction and said well if you
 

697
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,110
different direction and said well if you
look at the number of words

698
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
look at the number of words
 

699
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,230
look at the number of words
in a

700
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
in a
 

701
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,069
in a
dictionary not a whole dictionary but

702
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
dictionary not a whole dictionary but
 

703
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,829
dictionary not a whole dictionary but
for someone to

704
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
for someone to
 

705
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,230
for someone to
essentially be considered to be fluent

706
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
essentially be considered to be fluent
 

707
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,389
essentially be considered to be fluent
in a language how many words would they

708
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
in a language how many words would they
 

709
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,790
in a language how many words would they
need to know and then about how many

710
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
need to know and then about how many
 

711
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,030
need to know and then about how many
things about each word would you have to

712
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
things about each word would you have to
 

713
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,790
things about each word would you have to
tell it and so they got to a million

714
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
tell it and so they got to a million
 

715
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,710
tell it and so they got to a million
that way

716
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
that way
 

717
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,590
that way
another another person said well let's

718
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
another another person said well let's
 

719
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,790
another another person said well let's
actually look at one single

720
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
actually look at one single
 

721
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,750
actually look at one single
short one volume desk encyclopedia

722
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
short one volume desk encyclopedia
 

723
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,030
short one volume desk encyclopedia
article

724
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
article
 

725
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,110
article
and so we'll look at you know what was

726
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
and so we'll look at you know what was
 

727
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,829
and so we'll look at you know what was
like a um a four paragraph article or

728
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
like a um a four paragraph article or
 

729
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,990
like a um a four paragraph article or
something i think about grebes grebes

730
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
something i think about grebes grebes
 

731
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,310
something i think about grebes grebes
are a type of waterfowl

732
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
are a type of waterfowl
 

733
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,310
are a type of waterfowl
and if we were going to sit there and

734
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
and if we were going to sit there and
 

735
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,030
and if we were going to sit there and
represent every single thing that was

736
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
represent every single thing that was
 

737
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,710
represent every single thing that was
there um how many assertions or rules or

738
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
there um how many assertions or rules or
 

739
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,150
there um how many assertions or rules or
statements would we have to write in

740
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
statements would we have to write in
 

741
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,310
statements would we have to write in
this logical language and so on and then

742
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
this logical language and so on and then
 

743
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,389
this logical language and so on and then
multiply that by all of the number of

744
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
multiply that by all of the number of
 

745
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,710
multiply that by all of the number of
articles that there were and so on

746
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
articles that there were and so on
 

747
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,629
articles that there were and so on
so all of these estimates came out with

748
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
so all of these estimates came out with
 

749
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,910
so all of these estimates came out with
a million

750
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
a million
 

751
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,030
a million
and so

752
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
and so
 

753
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,030
and so
if you do the math it turns out that

754
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
if you do the math it turns out that
 

755
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,230
if you do the math it turns out that
like oh well then maybe in

756
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
like oh well then maybe in
 

757
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,670
like oh well then maybe in
something like

758
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
something like
 

759
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,829
something like
a hundred

760
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
a hundred
 

761
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,590
a hundred
years

762
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
years
 

763
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,550
years
in one or two person centuries we could

764
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
in one or two person centuries we could
 

765
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,910
in one or two person centuries we could
actually get

766
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
actually get
 

767
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,269
actually get
this written down by hand and

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
coincidence an opportunity existed right
 

773
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,350
coincidence an opportunity existed right
at that point in time the early 1980s

774
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
at that point in time the early 1980s
 

775
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,509
at that point in time the early 1980s
there was something called the japanese

776
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
there was something called the japanese
 

777
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,629
there was something called the japanese
fifth generation computing effort japan

779
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,389
fifth generation computing effort japan
had threatened to do in computing and ai

780
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
had threatened to do in computing and ai
 

781
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,389
had threatened to do in computing and ai
and hardware what they had just finished

and hardware what they had just finished
 

783
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,230
and hardware what they had just finished
doing in consumer electronics on the

good news and bad news the bad news is

904
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
good news and bad news the bad news is
 

905
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,350
good news and bad news the bad news is
that all of us were off by an order of

906
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
that all of us were off by an order of
 

907
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,550
that all of us were off by an order of
magnitude

908
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
magnitude
 

909
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,389
magnitude
that it turns out what you need are tens

910
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
that it turns out what you need are tens
 

911
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,189
that it turns out what you need are tens
of millions of these

912
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
of millions of these
 

913
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,670
of millions of these
pieces of knowledge about on every day

914
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
pieces of knowledge about on every day
 

915
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,470
pieces of knowledge about on every day
sort of like if you have a coffee cup

916
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
sort of like if you have a coffee cup
 

917
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,990
sort of like if you have a coffee cup
with stuff in it and you turn it upside

918
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
with stuff in it and you turn it upside
 

919
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,470
with stuff in it and you turn it upside
down the stuff in it's going to fall out

920
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
down the stuff in it's going to fall out
 

921
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,389
down the stuff in it's going to fall out
so you need tens of millions of pieces

922
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
so you need tens of millions of pieces
 

923
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,790
so you need tens of millions of pieces
of knowledge like that even if you take

924
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
of knowledge like that even if you take
 

925
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,509
of knowledge like that even if you take
trouble to make each one as general as

926
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
trouble to make each one as general as
 

927
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,829
trouble to make each one as general as
it possibly could be

928
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
it possibly could be
 

929
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,949
it possibly could be
but

930
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
but
 

931
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,590
but
the good news was that thanks to

932
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
the good news was that thanks to
 

933
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,590
the good news was that thanks to
initially the fifth generation effort

934
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
initially the fifth generation effort
 

935
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,949
initially the fifth generation effort
and then later

936
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
and then later
 

937
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,710
and then later
u.s government

939
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,949
u.s government
agency funding and so on we were able to

940
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
agency funding and so on we were able to
 

941
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,829
agency funding and so on we were able to
get enough funding not for a couple

942
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
get enough funding not for a couple
 

943
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,309
get enough funding not for a couple
person centuries of time but for a

944
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
person centuries of time but for a
 

945
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,789
person centuries of time but for a
couple person millennia of time which is

946
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
couple person millennia of time which is
 

947
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,350
couple person millennia of time which is
what we've spent since 1984

948
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
what we've spent since 1984
 

949
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,909
what we've spent since 1984
getting psych to contain the tens of

950
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
getting psych to contain the tens of
 

951
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,310
getting psych to contain the tens of
millions of rules that it needs in order

952
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
millions of rules that it needs in order
 

953
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,990
millions of rules that it needs in order
to really capture uh and span uh sort of

954
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
to really capture uh and span uh sort of
 

955
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,150
to really capture uh and span uh sort of
not all of human knowledge but the

956
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
not all of human knowledge but the
 

957
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,630
not all of human knowledge but the
things that you assume other people the

958
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
things that you assume other people the
 

959
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,070
things that you assume other people the
things you count on other people knowing

960
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
things you count on other people knowing
 

961
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,110
things you count on other people knowing
and

962
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
and
 

963
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,590
and
so by now we've done that

964
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
so by now we've done that
 

965
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,710
so by now we've done that
and the good news is since you've waited

966
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,720
and the good news is since you've waited
 

967
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,710
and the good news is since you've waited
38 years just about to talk to me

968
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
38 years just about to talk to me
 

969
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,150
38 years just about to talk to me
we're about at the

970
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
we're about at the
 

971
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,909
we're about at the
at the end of that process so most of

972
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
at the end of that process so most of
 

973
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,830
at the end of that process so most of
what we're doing now is not putting in

974
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
what we're doing now is not putting in
 

975
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,270
what we're doing now is not putting in
even what you would consider common

976
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
even what you would consider common
 

977
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,390
even what you would consider common
sense but more putting in

978
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:05,400
sense but more putting in
 

979
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,830

whatever the applications happen to be
 

991
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,310
whatever the applications happen to be
so we've almost come full circle and

992
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
so we've almost come full circle and
 

993
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,830
so we've almost come full circle and
we're doing things very much like the

994
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
we're doing things very much like the
 

995
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,630
we're doing things very much like the
expert systems of the 1970s and the

they can fall back on more and more and

1010
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
they can fall back on more and more and
 

1011
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,029
they can fall back on more and more and
more general principles

1012

more general principles
 

1013
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,310
more general principles
eventually bottoming out in things like

1014
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
eventually bottoming out in things like
 

1015
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,830
eventually bottoming out in things like
for instance if we have a problem with

1016
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
for instance if we have a problem with
 

1017
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,669
for instance if we have a problem with
the microphone one of the things you'll

1018
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
the microphone one of the things you'll
 

1019
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,950
the microphone one of the things you'll
do is

1020
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
do is
 

1021
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,190
do is
unplug it plug it in again and hope for

1022
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
unplug it plug it in again and hope for
 

1023
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,190
unplug it plug it in again and hope for
the best right because that's one of the

1024
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
the best right because that's one of the
 

1025
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,789
the best right because that's one of the
general pieces of knowledge you have in

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
general pieces of knowledge you have in
 

1027
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,789
general pieces of knowledge you have in
dealing with electronic equipment or

dealing with electronic equipment or
 

1029

1031
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,230
software systems or
things like that is there a basic

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
things like that is there a basic
 

1033
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,070
things like that is there a basic
principle like that like is it possible

1034
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
principle like that like is it possible
 

1035
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,310
principle like that like is it possible
to encode something that generally

1036
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
to encode something that generally
 

1037
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,710
to encode something that generally
captures this idea of

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,549
captures this idea of
turn it off and turn it back on and see

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
turn it off and turn it back on and see

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,789
turn it off and turn it back on and see
if it fixes oh absolutely that's one of

the things that
 

1045
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,230
the things that
that's like news that's actually one of

that's like news that's actually one of
 

1047
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,070
that's like news that's actually one of

laws of nature i believe
 

1051
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,350
laws of nature i believe
i wouldn't i wouldn't call it a law it's

1052
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
i wouldn't i wouldn't call it a law it's
 

1053
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,350
i wouldn't i wouldn't call it a law it's
it's more like a um

it's more like a um
 

1055
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,150
it's more like a um
it seems to work every time so it sure

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
it seems to work every time so it sure
 

1057
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,510
it seems to work every time so it sure
sure is like looks like a law i don't

1058
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
sure is like looks like a law i don't
 

1059
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,190
sure is like looks like a law i don't
know so that um that basically um

1060
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
know so that um that basically um
 

1061
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,750
know so that um that basically um
covered the um the resources needed and

1062
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
covered the um the resources needed and
 

1063
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,590
covered the um the resources needed and
then we had to devise a method to

1064
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
then we had to devise a method to
 

1065
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,830
then we had to devise a method to
actually figure out well what are the

1066
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
actually figure out well what are the
 

1067
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,750
actually figure out well what are the
tens of millions of things that we need

1068
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
tens of millions of things that we need
 

1069
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,789
tens of millions of things that we need
to tell the system and for that we found

1070
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
to tell the system and for that we found
 

1071
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,150
to tell the system and for that we found
a few

1072
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
a few
 

1073
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,789
a few
techniques which worked really well one

1074
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
techniques which worked really well one
 

1075
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,390
techniques which worked really well one
is to take um any piece of text almost

1076
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
is to take um any piece of text almost

and the beginning of the other so like
 

1127
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,310
and the beginning of the other so like
if the sentence says

if the sentence says
 

1129

and so on if my next sentence starts out

1146
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
and so on if my next sentence starts out
 

1147
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,350

with something like the judge dot dot
 

1149
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,750
with something like the judge dot dot
dot um then you assume it's the judge at

dot um then you assume it's the judge at
 

1151

dot um then you assume it's the judge at
his trial if my next sentence starts out

his trial if my next sentence starts out

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,830
his trial if my next sentence starts out
something like the arresting officer dot

1154
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
something like the arresting officer dot
 

1155
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,590
something like the arresting officer dot
dot dot you assumed that it was the

1156
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
dot dot you assumed that it was the
 

1157
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,430
dot dot you assumed that it was the
police officer who arrested him after he

1158
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
police officer who arrested him after he
 

1159
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,149
police officer who arrested him after he
committed the crime and so on so um

1160
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
committed the crime and so on so um
 

1161
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,070
committed the crime and so on so um
that's it those are two techniques for

1162
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
that's it those are two techniques for
 

1163
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,669
that's it those are two techniques for
getting um

1164
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
getting um
 

1165
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,510
getting um
that knowledge the the other thing we

1166
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
that knowledge the the other thing we
 

1167
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,230
that knowledge the the other thing we
sometimes look at is uh sort of like

1168
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
sometimes look at is uh sort of like
 

1169
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,430
sometimes look at is uh sort of like
fake news or uh sort of humorous um

1170
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
fake news or uh sort of humorous um
 

1171
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,110
fake news or uh sort of humorous um
onion headlines or um headlines in um

1172
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
onion headlines or um headlines in um
 

1173
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,870
onion headlines or um headlines in um
the weekly world news if you know what

1174
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
the weekly world news if you know what
 

1175
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,029
the weekly world news if you know what
that is or the national enquirer where

1176
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
that is or the national enquirer where
 

1177
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,430
that is or the national enquirer where
it's like oh we don't believe this then

1178
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
it's like oh we don't believe this then
 

1179
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,430
it's like oh we don't believe this then
we introspect on why don't we believe it

1180
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
we introspect on why don't we believe it
 

1181
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,430
we introspect on why don't we believe it
so they're things like um

1182
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
so they're things like um
 

1183
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,870
so they're things like um
b17 lands on the moon you know it's like

1184
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
b17 lands on the moon you know it's like
 

1185
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,470
b17 lands on the moon you know it's like
why don't we what do we know about the

1186
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
why don't we what do we know about the
 

1187
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,230
why don't we what do we know about the
world that causes us to believe that

1188
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
world that causes us to believe that
 

1189
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,870
world that causes us to believe that
that's just silly or uh something like

1190
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
that's just silly or uh something like
 

1191
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,510
that's just silly or uh something like
that or um another thing we look for are

1192
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
that or um another thing we look for are
 

1193
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,149
that or um another thing we look for are
contradictions um where with things

1194
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
contradictions um where with things
 

1195
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,950
contradictions um where with things
which can't both be true um and we say

1196
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
which can't both be true um and we say
 

1197
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,950
which can't both be true um and we say
to like what is it that we know that

1198
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
to like what is it that we know that
 

1199
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,549
to like what is it that we know that
causes us to know that both of these

1200
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
causes us to know that both of these
 

1201
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,710
causes us to know that both of these
can't be true at the same at the same

1202
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
can't be true at the same at the same
 

1203
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,110
can't be true at the same at the same
time for instance in one of the weekly

1204
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
time for instance in one of the weekly
 

1205
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,710
time for instance in one of the weekly
world news um

1206
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
world news um
 

1207
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,950
world news um
editions in one article it talked about

1208
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
editions in one article it talked about
 

1209
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,070
editions in one article it talked about
how elvis was cited um you know even

1210
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
how elvis was cited um you know even
 

1211
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,990
how elvis was cited um you know even
though he was uh you know getting on in

1212
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
though he was uh you know getting on in
 

1213
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,310
though he was uh you know getting on in
years and so on and another article in

1214
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
years and so on and another article in
 

1215
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,310
years and so on and another article in
the same one talked about people seeing

1216
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
the same one talked about people seeing
 

1217
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,830
the same one talked about people seeing
elvis ghost

1218
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
elvis ghost
 

1219
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,070
elvis ghost
okay so it's like why why do we believe

1220
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
okay so it's like why why do we believe
 

1221
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,830
okay so it's like why why do we believe
that at least one of these articles you

1222
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
that at least one of these articles you
 

1223
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,430
that at least one of these articles you
know must be wrong

1224
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
know must be wrong
 

1225
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,149
know must be wrong
and so on so um so we have a series of

1226
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
and so on so um so we have a series of
 

1227
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,990
and so on so um so we have a series of
techniques like that that enable our

1228
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
techniques like that that enable our
 

1229
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,029
techniques like that that enable our
people um and by now uh we have about 50

1230
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
people um and by now uh we have about 50
 

1231
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,710
people um and by now uh we have about 50
people working full-time on this and

1232
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
people working full-time on this and
 

1233
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,270
people working full-time on this and
have for for decades so we've put in the

1234
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
have for for decades so we've put in the
 

1235
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,110
have for for decades so we've put in the
thousands of person years of effort

1236
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
thousands of person years of effort
 

1237
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,350
thousands of person years of effort
we've built up these tens of millions of

1238
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
we've built up these tens of millions of
 

1239
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,830
we've built up these tens of millions of
rules we constantly

1240
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
rules we constantly
 

1241
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,630
rules we constantly
police the system to make sure that

1242
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
police the system to make sure that
 

1243
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,789
police the system to make sure that
we're saying things as generally as we

1244
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
we're saying things as generally as we
 

1245
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,630
we're saying things as generally as we
possibly can

1246
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
possibly can
 

1247
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,070
possibly can
so

1248
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
so
 

1249
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,390
so
you don't want to say things like um no

1250
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
you don't want to say things like um no
 

1251
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,950
you don't want to say things like um no
mouse is also a moose

1252
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
mouse is also a moose
 

1253
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,190
mouse is also a moose
because if you said things like that

1254
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
because if you said things like that
 

1255
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,029
because if you said things like that
then you'd have to add another one or

1256
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
then you'd have to add another one or
 

1257
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,470
then you'd have to add another one or
two or three zeros onto the number of

1258
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
two or three zeros onto the number of
 

1259
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,390
two or three zeros onto the number of
assertions you'd actually have to have

1260
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
assertions you'd actually have to have
 

1261
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,190
assertions you'd actually have to have
so

1262
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
so
 

1263
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,430
so
at some point we generalize things more

1264
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
at some point we generalize things more
 

1265
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,789
at some point we generalize things more
and more and we get to a point where we

1266
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
and more and we get to a point where we
 

1267
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,430
and more and we get to a point where we
say oh yeah for any two biological

1268
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
say oh yeah for any two biological
 

1269
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,390
say oh yeah for any two biological
taxons if we don't know explicitly that

1270
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
taxons if we don't know explicitly that
 

1271
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,870
taxons if we don't know explicitly that
one is a generalization of another then

1272
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
one is a generalization of another then
 

1273
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,029
one is a generalization of another then
almost certainly they're disjoint

1274
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
almost certainly they're disjoint
 

1275
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,630
almost certainly they're disjoint
a member of one is not going to be a

1276
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
a member of one is not going to be a
 

1277
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,470
a member of one is not going to be a
member of the other and so on so and the

1278
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
member of the other and so on so and the
 

1279
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,070
member of the other and so on so and the
same thing with the elvis and the ghost

1280
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
same thing with the elvis and the ghost
 

1281
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,990
same thing with the elvis and the ghost
it has nothing to do with elvis it's

1282
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
it has nothing to do with elvis it's
 

1283
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,269
it has nothing to do with elvis it's
more about

1284
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
more about
 

1285
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,029
more about
the human nature and then the the

1286
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
the human nature and then the the
 

1287
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,590
the human nature and then the the
mortality and well right in general

1288
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
mortality and well right in general
 

1289
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,430
mortality and well right in general
things are not both alive and dead at

1290
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
things are not both alive and dead at
 

1291
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,390
things are not both alive and dead at
the same time yeah and unless special

1292
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
the same time yeah and unless special
 

1293
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,430
the same time yeah and unless special
cats in in theoretical physics examples

1294
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
cats in in theoretical physics examples
 

1295
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,830
cats in in theoretical physics examples
well that raises um a couple important

1296
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
well that raises um a couple important
 

1297
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,750
well that raises um a couple important
points well that's the onion headline

1298
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
points well that's the onion headline
 

1299
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,669
points well that's the onion headline
situation type of thing okay sorry but

1300
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
situation type of thing okay sorry but
 

1301
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,590
situation type of thing okay sorry but
no no so so what you bring up is this

1302
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
no no so so what you bring up is this
 

1303
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,029
no no so so what you bring up is this
really important point of like well how

1304
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
really important point of like well how
 

1305
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,830
really important point of like well how
do you handle exceptions and

1306
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
do you handle exceptions and
 

1307
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,510
do you handle exceptions and
inconsistencies

1308
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
inconsistencies
 

1309
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,230
inconsistencies
and so on um and one of the hardest

1310
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
and so on um and one of the hardest
 

1311
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,630
and so on um and one of the hardest
lessons for us to learn it took us about

1312
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
lessons for us to learn it took us about
 

1313
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,430
lessons for us to learn it took us about
five years to to really grit our teeth

1314
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
five years to to really grit our teeth
 

1315
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,390
five years to to really grit our teeth
and

1316
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
and
 

1317
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,470
and
learned to love it

1318
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
learned to love it
 

1319
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,350
learned to love it
is we had to give up global consistency

1320
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
is we had to give up global consistency
 

1321
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,070
is we had to give up global consistency
so the knowledge base can no longer be

1322
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
so the knowledge base can no longer be
 

1323
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,310
so the knowledge base can no longer be
consistent so this is a kind of scary

1324
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
consistent so this is a kind of scary
 

1325
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,549
consistent so this is a kind of scary
thought i grew up watching star trek and

1326
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
thought i grew up watching star trek and
 

1327
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,870
thought i grew up watching star trek and
anytime a computer was inconsistent it

1328
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
anytime a computer was inconsistent it
 

1329
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,510
anytime a computer was inconsistent it
would either freeze up or explode or

1330
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
would either freeze up or explode or
 

1331
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,510
would either freeze up or explode or
take over the world or something bad

1332
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
take over the world or something bad
 

1333
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,710
take over the world or something bad
would happen

1334
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
would happen
 

1335
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,310
would happen
or if you come from a mathematics

1336
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
or if you come from a mathematics
 

1337
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,190
or if you come from a mathematics
background once you can prove false you

1338
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
background once you can prove false you
 

1339
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,669
background once you can prove false you
can prove anything so that's not good

1340
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
can prove anything so that's not good
 

1341
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,110
can prove anything so that's not good
and so on so

1342
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
and so on so
 

1343
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,710
and so on so
that's why on the

1344
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
that's why on the
 

1345
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,190
that's why on the
old knowledge-based systems were all

1346
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
old knowledge-based systems were all
 

1347
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,750
old knowledge-based systems were all
very very consistent but the trouble is

1348
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
very very consistent but the trouble is
 

1349
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,190
very very consistent but the trouble is
that

1350
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
that
 

1351
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,510
that
by and large our models of the world the

1352
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
by and large our models of the world the
 

1353
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,350
by and large our models of the world the
way we talk about the world and so on

1354
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
way we talk about the world and so on
 

1355
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,070
way we talk about the world and so on
there are all sorts of inconsistencies

1356
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
there are all sorts of inconsistencies
 

1357
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,070
there are all sorts of inconsistencies
that creep in here and there

1358
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
that creep in here and there
 

1359
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,830
that creep in here and there
that will sort of kill some attempt to

1360
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
that will sort of kill some attempt to
 

1361
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,549
that will sort of kill some attempt to
build some enormous globally consistent

1362
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
build some enormous globally consistent
 

1363
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,149
build some enormous globally consistent
knowledge base and so what we had to

1364
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
knowledge base and so what we had to
 

1365
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,510
knowledge base and so what we had to
move to

1366
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
move to
 

1367
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,630
move to
was a system of local consistency so a

1368
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
was a system of local consistency so a
 

1369
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,789
was a system of local consistency so a
good analogy is you know that the

1370
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
good analogy is you know that the
 

1371
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,549
good analogy is you know that the
surface of the earth is more or less

1372
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
surface of the earth is more or less
 

1373
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,230
surface of the earth is more or less
spherical

1374
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
spherical
 

1375
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,830
spherical
globally

1376
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
globally
 

1377
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,029
globally
but you live your life every day as

1378
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
but you live your life every day as
 

1379
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,549
but you live your life every day as
though the surface of the earth were

1380
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
though the surface of the earth were
 

1381
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,310
though the surface of the earth were
flat you know when you're talking to

1382
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
flat you know when you're talking to
 

1383
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,070
flat you know when you're talking to
someone in australia you don't think of

1384
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
someone in australia you don't think of
 

1385
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,070
someone in australia you don't think of
them as being oriented upside down to

1386
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
them as being oriented upside down to
 

1387
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,310
them as being oriented upside down to
you when you're planning a trip you know

1388
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
you when you're planning a trip you know
 

1389
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,630
you when you're planning a trip you know
even if it's a thousand miles away

1390
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
even if it's a thousand miles away
 

1391
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,149
even if it's a thousand miles away
you may think a little bit about time

1392
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
you may think a little bit about time
 

1393
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,750
you may think a little bit about time
zones but you rarely think about the

1394
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
zones but you rarely think about the
 

1395
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,909
zones but you rarely think about the
curvature of the earth and so on and for

1396
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
curvature of the earth and so on and for
 

1397
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,830
curvature of the earth and so on and for
most purposes you can live your whole

1398
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
most purposes you can live your whole
 

1399
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,230
most purposes you can live your whole
life without really worrying about that

1400
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
life without really worrying about that
 

1401
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,190
life without really worrying about that
because the earth is locally flat

1402
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
because the earth is locally flat
 

1403
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,510
because the earth is locally flat
in much the same way the psych knowledge

1404
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
in much the same way the psych knowledge
 

1405
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,070
in much the same way the psych knowledge
base is divided up into almost like

1406
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
base is divided up into almost like
 

1407
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,549
base is divided up into almost like
tectonic plates which are individual

1408
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
tectonic plates which are individual
 

1409
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,190
tectonic plates which are individual
contexts and each context

1410
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
contexts and each context
 

1411
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,350
contexts and each context
is more or less consistent but there can

1412
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
is more or less consistent but there can
 

1413
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,149
is more or less consistent but there can
be

1414
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
be
 

1415
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,630
be
small inconsistencies at the boundary

1416
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
small inconsistencies at the boundary
 

1417
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,269
small inconsistencies at the boundary
between one context and the next one and

1418
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
between one context and the next one and
 

1419
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,470
between one context and the next one and
so on and so by the time you move say 20

1420
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
so on and so by the time you move say 20
 

1421
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,190
so on and so by the time you move say 20
contexts over there could be glaring

1422
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
contexts over there could be glaring
 

1423
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,990
contexts over there could be glaring
inconsistencies so eventually you get

1424
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
inconsistencies so eventually you get
 

1425
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,230
inconsistencies so eventually you get
from the normal modern real world

1426
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
from the normal modern real world
 

1427
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,230
from the normal modern real world
context that we're in right now to

1429
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,110

cartoon context where physics is very

1432
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
cartoon context where physics is very
 

1433
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,990
cartoon context where physics is very
different and in fact life and death are

1434
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
different and in fact life and death are
 

1435
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,510
different and in fact life and death are
very different because no matter how

1436
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
very different because no matter how
 

1437
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,510
very different because no matter how
many times he's killed you know the

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
many times he's killed you know the
 

1439
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,750

coyote comes back in the next scene and

1440
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
coyote comes back in the next scene and
 

1441
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,110
coyote comes back in the next scene and
and so on

1442
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
and so on
 

1443
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,669
and so on
so um that that was a hard lesson to

1444
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
so um that that was a hard lesson to
 

1445
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,750
so um that that was a hard lesson to
learn and we had to make sure that our

1446
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
learn and we had to make sure that our
 

1447
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,149
learn and we had to make sure that our
representation language the way we the

00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
representation language the way we the
 

1449
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,510
representation language the way we the
way that we actually encode the

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
way that we actually encode the
 

1451
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,350
way that we actually encode the
knowledge and represent it was

1452
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
knowledge and represent it was
 

1453
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,870
knowledge and represent it was
expressive enough that we could talk

1454
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
expressive enough that we could talk
 

1455
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,510
expressive enough that we could talk
about things being true in one context

1456
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
about things being true in one context
 

1457
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,430
about things being true in one context
and false in another things that are

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
person's belief system
 

1469
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,750
person's belief system
but false in another person's belief

1470
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
but false in another person's belief
 

1471
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,830
but false in another person's belief
system things that are true at one level

1472
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
system things that are true at one level
 

1473
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,149
system things that are true at one level
of abstraction and false at another for

1474
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
of abstraction and false at another for
 

1475
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,390
of abstraction and false at another for
instance at one level of abstraction

1476
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
instance at one level of abstraction
 

1477
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,070
instance at one level of abstraction
you think of this table as a solid

1478
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
you think of this table as a solid
 

1479
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,590
you think of this table as a solid
object but at you know down at the

1480
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
object but at you know down at the
 

1481
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,830
object but at you know down at the
atomic level it's mostly empty space and

1482
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
atomic level it's mostly empty space and
 

1483
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,710
atomic level it's mostly empty space and
so on so then that's fascinating and but

1484
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
so on so then that's fascinating and but
 

1485
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,430
so on so then that's fascinating and but
it puts a lot of pressure on context to

1486
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
it puts a lot of pressure on context to
 

1487
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,470
it puts a lot of pressure on context to
do a lot of work so you say tectonic

1488
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
do a lot of work so you say tectonic
 

1489
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,870
do a lot of work so you say tectonic
plates is it possible to formulate

1490
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
plates is it possible to formulate
 

1491
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,430
plates is it possible to formulate
contacts that are general and big

1492
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
contacts that are general and big
 

1493
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,909
contacts that are general and big
that do this kind of capture of

1494
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
that do this kind of capture of
 

1495
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,269
that do this kind of capture of
knowledge bases

1496
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
knowledge bases
 

1497
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,510
knowledge bases
or do you then get turtles on top of

1498
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
or do you then get turtles on top of
 

1499
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,070
or do you then get turtles on top of
turtles again where there's just a huge

1500
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
turtles again where there's just a huge
 

1501
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,549
turtles again where there's just a huge
number of contexts so it's good you ask

1502
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
number of contexts so it's good you ask
 

1503
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,070
number of contexts so it's good you ask
that question because

1504
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
that question because
 

1505
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,669
that question because
you're pointed in the right direction

1506
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
you're pointed in the right direction
 

1507
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,029
you're pointed in the right direction
which is

1508
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
which is
 

1509
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,190
which is
you want context to be

1510
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
you want context to be
 

1511
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,110
you want context to be
first class objects

1512
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
first class objects
 

1513
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,950
first class objects
in your system's knowledge base in

1514
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
in your system's knowledge base in
 

1515
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,590
in your system's knowledge base in
particular in sykes knowledge base

1516
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
particular in sykes knowledge base
 

1517
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,990
particular in sykes knowledge base
and by first class object i mean that

1518
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
and by first class object i mean that
 

1519
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,590
and by first class object i mean that
it should we should be able to have

1520
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
it should we should be able to have
 

1521
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,510
it should we should be able to have
psych think about and talk about and

1522
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
psych think about and talk about and
 

1523
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,110
psych think about and talk about and
reason about

1524
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
reason about
 

1525
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,269
reason about
one context or another context the same

1526
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279
one context or another context the same
 

1527
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,590
one context or another context the same
way it reasons about coffee cups and

1528
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
way it reasons about coffee cups and
 

1529
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,669
way it reasons about coffee cups and
tables and people and fishing and so on

1530
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
tables and people and fishing and so on
 

1531
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,870
tables and people and fishing and so on
and so contexts are just terms in its

1532
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
and so contexts are just terms in its
 

1533
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,950
and so contexts are just terms in its
language just like the ones i mentioned

1534
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
language just like the ones i mentioned
 

1535
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,830
language just like the ones i mentioned
and so psych can reason about

1536
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
and so psych can reason about
 

1537
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,590
and so psych can reason about
context context can arrange

1538
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
context context can arrange
 

1539
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,990
context context can arrange
hierarchically and so on

1540
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
hierarchically and so on
 

1541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,190
hierarchically and so on
and so you can say things about let's

1542
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
and so you can say things about let's
 

1543
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,549
and so you can say things about let's
say

1544
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
say
 

1545
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,750
say
things that are true in the modern era

1546
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
things that are true in the modern era
 

1547
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,669
things that are true in the modern era
things that are true in a particular

1548
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
things that are true in a particular
 

1549
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,830
things that are true in a particular
year would then be a sub context of the

1550
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
year would then be a sub context of the
 

1551
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,310
year would then be a sub context of the
the things that are true in um abroad

1552
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
the things that are true in um abroad
 

1553
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,310
the things that are true in um abroad
let's say a century or a millennium or

1554
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
let's say a century or a millennium or
 

1555
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,149
let's say a century or a millennium or
something like that things that are true

1556
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
something like that things that are true
 

1557
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,870
something like that things that are true
in austin texas are generally going to

1558
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
in austin texas are generally going to
 

1559
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,430
in austin texas are generally going to
be a specialization of

1560
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
be a specialization of
 

1561
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,830
be a specialization of
things that are true in texas which is

1562
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:49,840
things that are true in texas which is
 

1563
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,430
things that are true in texas which is
going to be a specialization of things

1564
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
going to be a specialization of things
 

1565
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,350
going to be a specialization of things
that are true in the united states and

1566
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
that are true in the united states and
 

1567
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,310
that are true in the united states and
so on

1568
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
so on
 

1569
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,310
so on
and so you don't have to say things over

1570
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
and so you don't have to say things over
 

1571
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,110
and so you don't have to say things over
and over over again at all these levels

1572
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
and over over again at all these levels
 

1573
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,669
and over over again at all these levels
you just say things at the most general

1574
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
you just say things at the most general
 

1575
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,830
you just say things at the most general
level that it applies to and you only

1576
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
level that it applies to and you only
 

1577
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,510
level that it applies to and you only
have to say it once and then it

1578
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
have to say it once and then it
 

1579
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,669
have to say it once and then it
essentially inherits to all these more

00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
inheritance a tree or a graph oh you
 

1589
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,950
inheritance a tree or a graph oh you
definitely have to think of it as a

1590
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960
definitely have to think of it as a
 

1591
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,070
definitely have to think of it as a

graph
 

1593
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,710

so we could talk about for instance why

1594
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
so we could talk about for instance why
 

1595
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,630
so we could talk about for instance why
the japanese fifth generation computing

1596
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
the japanese fifth generation computing
 

1597
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,710
the japanese fifth generation computing
effort failed there were about half a

1598
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
effort failed there were about half a
 

1599
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,789
effort failed there were about half a
dozen different reasons one of the

1600
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
dozen different reasons one of the
 

1601
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,269
dozen different reasons one of the
reasons they failed was because they

1602
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
reasons they failed was because they
 

1603
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,149
reasons they failed was because they
tried to represent knowledge as a tree

1604
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
tried to represent knowledge as a tree
 

1605
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,149
tried to represent knowledge as a tree
rather than as a graph

1606
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
rather than as a graph
 

1607
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,110
rather than as a graph
and so each node in their

1608
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
and so each node in their
 

1609
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,269
and so each node in their
representation

1610
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
representation
 

1611
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,590
representation
could only have one parent

1612
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
could only have one parent
 

1613
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,149
could only have one parent
node so if you had a table that was a

1614
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
node so if you had a table that was a
 

1615
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,710
node so if you had a table that was a
wooden object a black object a flat

1616
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
wooden object a black object a flat
 

1617
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,590
wooden object a black object a flat
object and so you have to choose one and

1618
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
object and so you have to choose one and
 

1619
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,549
object and so you have to choose one and
that's the only parent it could have

1620
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
that's the only parent it could have
 

1621
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,549
that's the only parent it could have
when of course you know depending on

1622
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
when of course you know depending on
 

1623
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,470
when of course you know depending on
what it is you need to reason about it

1624
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
what it is you need to reason about it
 

1625
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,909
what it is you need to reason about it
sometimes it's important to know that

1626
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
sometimes it's important to know that
 

1627
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,430
sometimes it's important to know that
it's made out of wood like if we're

1628
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,440
it's made out of wood like if we're
 

1629
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,510
it's made out of wood like if we're
talking about a fire sometimes it's

1630
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
talking about a fire sometimes it's
 

1631
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,269
talking about a fire sometimes it's
important to know that it's flat if

1632
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
important to know that it's flat if
 

1633
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,950
important to know that it's flat if
we're talking about resting something on

1634
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
we're talking about resting something on
 

1635
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,830
we're talking about resting something on
it and so on so

1636
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
it and so on so
 

1637
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,990
it and so on so
um one of the one of the problems was

1638
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
um one of the one of the problems was
 

1639
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,389
um one of the one of the problems was
that they wanted a kind of dewey decimal

1640
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
that they wanted a kind of dewey decimal
 

1641
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,630
that they wanted a kind of dewey decimal
numbering system for all of their

1642
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
numbering system for all of their
 

1643
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,870
numbering system for all of their
concepts which meant that each node

1644
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:16,880
concepts which meant that each node
 

1645
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,029
concepts which meant that each node
could only have at most

1646
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
could only have at most
 

1647
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,350
could only have at most
10 children and each node could only

1648
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
10 children and each node could only
 

1649
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,430
10 children and each node could only
have one parent

1650
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
have one parent
 

1651
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,389
have one parent
and

1652
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
and
 

1653
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,190
and
while that does enable the dewey decimal

1654
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,200
while that does enable the dewey decimal
 

1655
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,549
while that does enable the dewey decimal
type

1656
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559

1657
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,789

it prevents you from representing all

1662
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
it prevents you from representing all
 

1663
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,630
it prevents you from representing all
the things you need to about objects in

1664
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
the things you need to about objects in
 

1665
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,630
the things you need to about objects in
our in our world and that was one of the

1666
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
our in our world and that was one of the
 

1667
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,190
our in our world and that was one of the
things which um they never were able to

1668
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
things which um they never were able to
 

1669
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,029
things which um they never were able to
overcome and i think that was one of the

1670
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
overcome and i think that was one of the
 

1671
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,590
overcome and i think that was one of the
main reasons that that project failed so

1672
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
main reasons that that project failed so
 

1673
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,110
main reasons that that project failed so
we'll return to some of the doors you've

1674
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
we'll return to some of the doors you've
 

1675
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,950
we'll return to some of the doors you've
opened but if we can go back to that

1676
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
opened but if we can go back to that
 

1677
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,990
opened but if we can go back to that
room in 1984 around there with marvin

1679
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,190

minsky yeah

1680
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
minsky yeah
 

1681
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,029
minsky yeah
but by the way i should mention that

1682
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
but by the way i should mention that
 

1683
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,310
but by the way i should mention that
marvin um wouldn't do his estimate until

1684
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
marvin um wouldn't do his estimate until
 

1685
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,710
marvin um wouldn't do his estimate until
someone brought him an envelope so that

1686
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
someone brought him an envelope so that
 

1687
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,630
someone brought him an envelope so that
he could literally do a back of the

1688
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
he could literally do a back of the
 

1689
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,789
he could literally do a back of the
envelope calculations to come up with

1690
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
envelope calculations to come up with
 

1691
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,269
envelope calculations to come up with
his number

1692
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
his number
 

1693
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,830
his number
well because i i feel like

1694
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
well because i i feel like
 

1695
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,750
well because i i feel like

that equation will get even more uh
 

1725
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,830
that equation will get even more uh
valuable because then we'll get be able

i think in that same way a conversation
 

1739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,470
i think in that same way a conversation
of just how many facts

1740
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
of just how many facts
 

1741
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,149
of just how many facts
are required to capture the basic common

good guessing things which are usually
 

1773
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,029
good guessing things which are usually
true and which help you to make sense of

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
projections of those ideas you read an
 

1789
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,070
projections of those ideas you read an
article about the fact that elvis died

1790
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
article about the fact that elvis died
 

1791
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,310
article about the fact that elvis died
that's a projection of the idea that uh

1792
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
that's a projection of the idea that uh
 

1793
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,470
that's a projection of the idea that uh
humans are mortal and like you know very

1794
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
humans are mortal and like you know very
 

1795
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,870
humans are mortal and like you know very
few wikipedia articles will write humans

1796
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
few wikipedia articles will write humans
 

1797
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,149
few wikipedia articles will write humans
are immortal

1798
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
are immortal
 

1799
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,909
are immortal
exactly and that's what i meant about

1800
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
exactly and that's what i meant about
 

1801
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,389
exactly and that's what i meant about
ferreting out the unstated things in

1802
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
ferreting out the unstated things in
 

1803
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,149
ferreting out the unstated things in
texas what are all the things that were

1804
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
texas what are all the things that were
 

1805
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,029
texas what are all the things that were
assumed and so those are things like um

1806
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
assumed and so those are things like um
 

1807
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,549
assumed and so those are things like um
if you have a problem with something

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,430
if you have a problem with something
turning it off and on um often fixes it

turning it off and on um often fixes it
 

1811
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,110
turning it off and on um often fixes it

flowing uphill and water flowing
 

1823
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,149
flowing uphill and water flowing
downhill you'll find more references for

1824
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
downhill you'll find more references for
 

1825
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,549
downhill you'll find more references for
water flowing uphill because it's used

water flowing uphill because it's used
 

1827
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,630
water flowing uphill because it's used
as a kind of a

thing because of course everyone already

knows that water flows downhill so why

1834
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
knows that water flows downhill so why
 

1835
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,909
knows that water flows downhill so why
would anyone bother saying that do you

1836
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
would anyone bother saying that do you
 

1837
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,149
would anyone bother saying that do you
have a word you prefer

1838
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
have a word you prefer
 

1839
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,669
have a word you prefer
because we said facts isn't the right

1840
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
because we said facts isn't the right
 

1841
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,990
because we said facts isn't the right
word is there a word like concepts i

1842
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000
word is there a word like concepts i
 

1843
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,830
word is there a word like concepts i
would say assertions

1844
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840
would say assertions
 

1845
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,990
would say assertions
assertions or rules because i'm not

1846
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
assertions or rules because i'm not
 

1847
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,990
assertions or rules because i'm not
talking about rigid rules but rules of

1848
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
talking about rigid rules but rules of
 

1849
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,149
talking about rigid rules but rules of
thumb but assertions

1850
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
thumb but assertions
 

1851
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,389
thumb but assertions
is a nice one that covers

1852
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:58,399
is a nice one that covers
 

1853
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,269
is a nice one that covers
all of these things yeah as a programmer

1854
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
all of these things yeah as a programmer
 

1855
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,710
all of these things yeah as a programmer
to me a cert

1856
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:02,720
to me a cert
 

1857
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,909
to me a cert
has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel

1858
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:05,919
has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel
 

1859
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,760
has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel
to them i'm sorry

1860
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:06,770
to them i'm sorry
 

1861
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,149
to them i'm sorry
[Laughter]

1862
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
[Laughter]
 

1863
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,030
[Laughter]
i'm so sorry okay but assertions works

1864
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
i'm so sorry okay but assertions works
 

1865
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,270
i'm so sorry okay but assertions works
okay so if we go back to that room with

1866
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
okay so if we go back to that room with
 

1867
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,109
okay so if we go back to that room with
marvel minsky with you

1868
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
marvel minsky with you
 

1869
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,589
marvel minsky with you
all these seminal figures uh

1870
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:17,599
all these seminal figures uh
 

1871
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,990
all these seminal figures uh
uh ed foggy mom

1872
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
uh ed foggy mom
 

1873
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,510
uh ed foggy mom
thinking about

1874
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
thinking about
 

1875
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,710
thinking about
this very

1876
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
this very
 

1877
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,950
this very
philosophical but also engineering

1878
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
philosophical but also engineering
 

1879
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,629
philosophical but also engineering
question

1880
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
question
 

1881
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,030
question
we can also go back a couple of decades

1882
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
we can also go back a couple of decades
 

1883
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,869
we can also go back a couple of decades
before then and thinking about

1884
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
before then and thinking about
 

1885
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,629
before then and thinking about
artificial intelligence broadly when

1886
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
artificial intelligence broadly when
 

1887
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,869
artificial intelligence broadly when
people were thinking about you know how

1888
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:34,879
people were thinking about you know how
 

1889
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,750
people were thinking about you know how
do you create super intelligent systems

1890
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
do you create super intelligent systems
 

1891
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,349
do you create super intelligent systems
general intelligence

1892
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
general intelligence
 

1893
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,270
general intelligence
and i think people's intuition was

1894
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,280
and i think people's intuition was
 

1895
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,149
and i think people's intuition was
off

1896
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
off
 

1897
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,510
off
at the time

1898
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
at the time
 

1899
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,589
at the time
and i mean this continues to be the case

1900
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
and i mean this continues to be the case
 

1901
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,869
and i mean this continues to be the case
that we're not

1902
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
that we're not
 

1903
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,950
that we're not
when we're grappling with these

1904
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
when we're grappling with these
 

1905
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,790
when we're grappling with these
exceptionally difficult ideas we're not

1906
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
exceptionally difficult ideas we're not
 

1907
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,950
exceptionally difficult ideas we're not
always it's very difficult to

1908
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
always it's very difficult to
 

1909
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,190
always it's very difficult to
truly understand ourselves when we're

1910
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
truly understand ourselves when we're
 

1911
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,190
truly understand ourselves when we're
thinking about the human mind

1912
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
thinking about the human mind
 

1913
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,230
thinking about the human mind
to to introspect how difficult it is to

1914
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
to to introspect how difficult it is to
 

1915
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,310
to to introspect how difficult it is to
engineer intelligence to solve

1916
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,320
engineer intelligence to solve
 

1917
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,829
engineer intelligence to solve
intelligence we're not very good at

1918
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
intelligence we're not very good at
 

1919
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,190
intelligence we're not very good at
estimating that

1920
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
estimating that
 

1921
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,990
estimating that
and

1922
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
and
 

1923
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,550
and
you are somebody who has really stayed

1924
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
you are somebody who has really stayed
 

1925
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,750
you are somebody who has really stayed
with this question for decades

1926
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
with this question for decades
 

1927
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,670
with this question for decades
do you what's your sense

1928
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
do you what's your sense
 

1929
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,550
do you what's your sense
from the 1984 to today

1930
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,560
from the 1984 to today
 

1931
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,790
from the 1984 to today
have you gotten a stronger

1932
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
have you gotten a stronger
 

1933
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,870
have you gotten a stronger
sense of just how much knowledge is

1934
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:22,880
sense of just how much knowledge is
 

1935
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,670
sense of just how much knowledge is
required so you've kind of said

1936
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
required so you've kind of said
 

1937
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,270
required so you've kind of said
with some level of certainty that's

1938
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
with some level of certainty that's
 

1939
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,190
with some level of certainty that's
still on the order of magnitude of tens

1940
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
still on the order of magnitude of tens
 

1941
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,109
still on the order of magnitude of tens
of millions right but for the first

1942
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
of millions right but for the first
 

1943
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,630
of millions right but for the first
several years i would have said that it

1944
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
several years i would have said that it
 

1945
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,829
several years i would have said that it
was on the order of one or two million

1946
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
was on the order of one or two million
 

1947
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,030
was on the order of one or two million
yeah and so um it took it took us about

1948
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
yeah and so um it took it took us about
 

1949
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,030
yeah and so um it took it took us about
five or six years to realize that we

1950
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
five or six years to realize that we
 

1951
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,069
five or six years to realize that we
were off

1952
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
were off
 

1953
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,390
were off
um by by a factor of 10. but i guess

1954
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
um by by a factor of 10. but i guess
 

1955
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,190
um by by a factor of 10. but i guess
what i'm asking you know marvin miska is

1956
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
what i'm asking you know marvin miska is
 

1957
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,270
what i'm asking you know marvin miska is
very confident in the 60s when you say

1958
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
very confident in the 60s when you say
 

1959
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,630
very confident in the 60s when you say
yes right

1960
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
yes right
 

1961
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,069
yes right
what's your

1962
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
what's your
 

1963
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,750
what's your
sense

1964
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
sense
 

1965
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,030
sense
if you

1966
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040

 

1967
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,430

you know 200 years from now

1968
00:35:59,430 --> 00:35:59,440
you know 200 years from now
 

1969
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,550
you know 200 years from now
you're still

1970
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
you're still
 

1971
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,550
you're still
you know you're you're not going to be

1972
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
you know you're you're not going to be
 

1973
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,950
you know you're you're not going to be
any longer in this particular biological

1974
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
any longer in this particular biological
 

1975
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,030
any longer in this particular biological
body but your brain will still be

1976
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,040
body but your brain will still be
 

1977
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,349
body but your brain will still be
uh in the digital form and you'll be

1978
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
uh in the digital form and you'll be
 

1979
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,550
uh in the digital form and you'll be
looking back

1980
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
looking back
 

1981
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,470
looking back
would you think you were

1982
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
would you think you were
 

1983
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,990
would you think you were
smart today

1984
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,000
smart today
 

1985
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,990
smart today
like your intuition was right or do you

1986
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
like your intuition was right or do you
 

1987
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,790
like your intuition was right or do you
think

1988
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
think
 

1989
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,109
think
you may be really off

1990
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:19,119
you may be really off
 

1991
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,310
you may be really off
so i i think i'm i'm right enough and

1992
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
so i i think i'm i'm right enough and
 

1993
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,550
so i i think i'm i'm right enough and
let me explain what i mean by that which

1994
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:24,560
let me explain what i mean by that which
 

1995
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,270
let me explain what i mean by that which
is

1996
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,280
is
 

1997
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
is
um

1998
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
um
 

1999
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,069
um
sometimes like if you have an

2000
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
sometimes like if you have an
 

2001
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,150
sometimes like if you have an
old-fashioned pump you have to prime the

2002
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
old-fashioned pump you have to prime the
 

2003
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,630
old-fashioned pump you have to prime the
pump yeah and then eventually it starts

2004
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:32,640
pump yeah and then eventually it starts
 

2005
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,589
pump yeah and then eventually it starts
so

2006
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
so
 

2007
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,589
so
i think i'm i'm right enough in the

2008
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
i think i'm i'm right enough in the
 

2009
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,950
i think i'm i'm right enough in the
sense that

2010
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
sense that
 

2011
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,349
sense that
what we what we've built yeah even if it

2012
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
what we what we've built yeah even if it
 

2013
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,390
what we what we've built yeah even if it
isn't so to speak everything you need

2014
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
isn't so to speak everything you need
 

2015
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,270
isn't so to speak everything you need
it's primed the knowledge pump enough

2016
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
it's primed the knowledge pump enough
 

2017
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,630
it's primed the knowledge pump enough
that

2018
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
that
 

2019
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,870
that
psych can now itself

2020
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
psych can now itself
 

2021
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,150
psych can now itself
help to

2022
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
help to
 

2023
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,470
help to
learn more and more automatically on its

2024
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
learn more and more automatically on its
 

2025
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,030
learn more and more automatically on its
own by reading things and understanding

2026
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
own by reading things and understanding
 

2027
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,430
own by reading things and understanding
and occasionally asking questions like a

2028
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
and occasionally asking questions like a
 

2029
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,990
and occasionally asking questions like a
student would or something and by doing

2030
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
student would or something and by doing
 

2031
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,750
student would or something and by doing
experiments and discovering things on

2032
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
experiments and discovering things on
 

2033
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,829
experiments and discovering things on
its own and so on so through a

2034
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
its own and so on so through a
 

2035
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,069
its own and so on so through a
combination of

2036
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
combination of
 

2037
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,670
combination of
psych-powered discovery and

2038
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
psych-powered discovery and
 

2039
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,750
psych-powered discovery and
psych-powered reading

2040
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
psych-powered reading
 

2041
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,390
psych-powered reading
it will be able to bootstrap itself

2042
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
it will be able to bootstrap itself
 

2043
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,230
it will be able to bootstrap itself
maybe it's the final two percent maybe

2044
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
maybe it's the final two percent maybe
 

2045
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,230
maybe it's the final two percent maybe
it's the final 99

2046
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,240
it's the final 99
 

2047
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,630
it's the final 99
so even if i'm if i'm wrong

2048
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,640
so even if i'm if i'm wrong
 

2049
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,670
so even if i'm if i'm wrong
all i really need to build is a system

2050
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
all i really need to build is a system
 

2051
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,550
all i really need to build is a system
which has primed the pump enough that it

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
which has primed the pump enough that it

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,150
which has primed the pump enough that it

why um

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,510
why um
humans today know so much more than

2070
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
humans today know so much more than
 

2071
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,190
humans today know so much more than
humans a hundred thousand years ago

2072
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
humans a hundred thousand years ago
 

2073
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,109
humans a hundred thousand years ago
we're not really that much smarter than

2074
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,119
we're not really that much smarter than
 

2075
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,109
we're not really that much smarter than
people were a hundred thousand years ago

2076
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
people were a hundred thousand years ago
 

2077
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,630
people were a hundred thousand years ago
but there's so much more knowledge and

2078
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
but there's so much more knowledge and
 

2079
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,870
but there's so much more knowledge and
we have language and we can communicate

2080
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
we have language and we can communicate
 

2081
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,270
we have language and we can communicate
we can check things on google and so on

2082
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,280
we can check things on google and so on
 

2083
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,589
we can check things on google and so on
so effectively we have this enormous

2084
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
so effectively we have this enormous
 

2085
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,750
so effectively we have this enormous
power at our fingertips

2086
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
power at our fingertips
 

2087
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,069
power at our fingertips
and there's almost no limit to how much

2088
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
and there's almost no limit to how much
 

2089
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,990
and there's almost no limit to how much
you could learn if you wanted to because

2090
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,000
you could learn if you wanted to because
 

2091
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,150
you could learn if you wanted to because
you've already gotten to a certain level

2092
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,160
you've already gotten to a certain level
 

2093
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,069
you've already gotten to a certain level
of understanding of the world that

2094
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
of understanding of the world that
 

2095
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,310
of understanding of the world that
enables you to read all these articles

2096
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
enables you to read all these articles
 

2097
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,390
enables you to read all these articles
and understand them that enables you to

2098
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
and understand them that enables you to
 

2099
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,390
and understand them that enables you to
go out and if necessary do experiments

2100
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:14,400
go out and if necessary do experiments
 

2101
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,470
go out and if necessary do experiments
although that's slower as a way of

2102
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
although that's slower as a way of
 

2103
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,589
although that's slower as a way of
gathering data and so on and and i think

2104
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
gathering data and so on and and i think
 

2105
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,670
gathering data and so on and and i think
this is really an important point which

2106
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:21,680
this is really an important point which
 

2107
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,710
this is really an important point which
is

2108
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720
is
 

2109
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,349
is
if we have artificial intelligence real

2110
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:25,359
if we have artificial intelligence real
 

2111
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,349
if we have artificial intelligence real

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
level artificial intelligence
 

2115
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,710
level artificial intelligence
then

2116
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
then
 

2117
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,430
then
people will become smarter

2118
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
people will become smarter
 

2119
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,750
people will become smarter
um it's not so much that it'll be us

2120
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
um it's not so much that it'll be us
 

2121
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,470
um it's not so much that it'll be us
versus the ais it's more like us and the

2122
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,480
versus the ais it's more like us and the
 

2123
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,270
versus the ais it's more like us and the
ais together we'll be able to do things

2124
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
ais together we'll be able to do things
 

2125
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,510
ais together we'll be able to do things
that require more creativity

2126
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
that require more creativity
 

2127
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,510
that require more creativity
that would take too long right now but

2128
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,520
that would take too long right now but
 

2129
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,109
that would take too long right now but
we'll be able to do lots of things in

2130
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
we'll be able to do lots of things in
 

2131
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,510
we'll be able to do lots of things in
parallel we'll be able to misunderstand

2132
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
parallel we'll be able to misunderstand
 

2133
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,750
parallel we'll be able to misunderstand
each other less

2134
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:50,760

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
there's all sorts of

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,470
there's all sorts of

2140
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
value that effectively for an individual
 

2141
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,030
value that effectively for an individual
would mean that individual will for all

2142
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
would mean that individual will for all
 

2143
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,190
would mean that individual will for all

2144
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200
intents and purposes be smarter
 

2145
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,190
intents and purposes be smarter
and that means that humanity as a

2146
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
and that means that humanity as a
 

2147
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,069
and that means that humanity as a
species will be smarter and when was the

2148
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:06,079
species will be smarter and when was the
 

2149
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,710
species will be smarter and when was the
last time that any invention

2150

made a huge difference in human
 

2155
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,790
made a huge difference in human
intelligence um you have to go back a

2156
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
intelligence um you have to go back a
 

2157
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,790
intelligence um you have to go back a
long ways it wasn't like the internet or

2158
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,800
long ways it wasn't like the internet or
 

2159
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,510
long ways it wasn't like the internet or
the computer or mathematics or something

2160
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,520
the computer or mathematics or something
 

2161
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,390
the computer or mathematics or something
it was all the way back to the

2162
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,400
it was all the way back to the
 

2163
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,030
it was all the way back to the
development of language we sort of look

2164
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
development of language we sort of look
 

2165
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,349
development of language we sort of look
back on pre-linguistic cavemen as well

2166
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
back on pre-linguistic cavemen as well
 

2167
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,109
back on pre-linguistic cavemen as well
you know they they weren't really

2168
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
you know they they weren't really
 

2169
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,109
you know they they weren't really
intelligent were they they weren't

2170
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
intelligent were they they weren't
 

2171
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,990
intelligent were they they weren't
really human were they and i think that

2172
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
really human were they and i think that
 

2173
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,990
really human were they and i think that
um as you said 50 100 200 years from now

2174
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
um as you said 50 100 200 years from now
 

2175
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,790
um as you said 50 100 200 years from now
people will look back on people today

2176
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
people will look back on people today
 

2177
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,829
people will look back on people today
um

2178
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
um
 

2179
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,870
um
right before the advent of these sort of

2180
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
right before the advent of these sort of
 

2181
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,349
right before the advent of these sort of
lifelong general ai muses

2182
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
lifelong general ai muses
 

2183
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,589
lifelong general ai muses
and say you know those poor those poor

2184
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
and say you know those poor those poor
 

2185
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,270
and say you know those poor those poor
people they weren't really human were

exactly so you said a lot of really

2190
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
exactly so you said a lot of really
 

2191
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,550
exactly so you said a lot of really
interesting things by the way i would

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
interesting things by the way i would
 

2193
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,230
interesting things by the way i would
maybe

2194
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,240
maybe
 

2195
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,109
maybe
uh try to argue that the internet

2196
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
uh try to argue that the internet
 

2197
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,910
uh try to argue that the internet
is on is on the order of

2198
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
is on is on the order of
 

2199
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,870
is on is on the order of
um

2200
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
um
 

2201
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,790
um
the kind of big leap in improvement that

2202
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
the kind of big leap in improvement that
 

2203
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,790
the kind of big leap in improvement that
the invention of language was it's

2204
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
the invention of language was it's
 

2205
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,390
the invention of language was it's
certainly a big leap in one direction

2206
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
certainly a big leap in one direction
 

2207
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,829
certainly a big leap in one direction
we're not sure whether it's upward or

2208
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839
we're not sure whether it's upward or
 

2209
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,470
we're not sure whether it's upward or
downward well i i mean very specific

2210
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480
downward well i i mean very specific
 

2211
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,150
downward well i i mean very specific
parts of the internet which is access to

2212
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
parts of the internet which is access to
 

2213
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,510
parts of the internet which is access to
information like a website like

so very quickly so i i could take either

2222
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:30,960
so very quickly so i i could take either
 

2223
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,870
so very quickly so i i could take either
side of this argument and since you just

2224
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
side of this argument and since you just
 

2225
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,870
side of this argument and since you just
took one side i'll give you the other

2226
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:34,880
took one side i'll give you the other
 

2227
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,790
took one side i'll give you the other
side which is that

2228
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
side which is that
 

2229
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,069
side which is that
almost nothing has done more harm

2230
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
almost nothing has done more harm
 

2231
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,470
almost nothing has done more harm
than something like the internet and

2232
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
than something like the internet and
 

2233
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,470
than something like the internet and
access to that information

2234
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
access to that information
 

2235
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,950
access to that information
in two ways one is it's made people more

2236
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
in two ways one is it's made people more
 

2237
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,950
in two ways one is it's made people more
globally ignorant

2238
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
globally ignorant
 

2239
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,510
globally ignorant
in the same way that calculators

2240
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
in the same way that calculators
 

2241
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,950
in the same way that calculators
made us

2242
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
made us
 

2243
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,829
made us
more or less innumerate so when i was

2244
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
more or less innumerate so when i was
 

2245
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,829
more or less innumerate so when i was
growing up we had to use slide rules we

2246
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
growing up we had to use slide rules we
 

2247
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,309
growing up we had to use slide rules we
had to be able to estimate yeah and so

2248
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
had to be able to estimate yeah and so
 

2249
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,069
had to be able to estimate yeah and so
on today

2250
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
on today
 

2251
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,470
on today
people don't really understand numbers

2252
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
people don't really understand numbers
 

2253
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,150
people don't really understand numbers
they don't really understand math they

2254
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
they don't really understand math they
 

2255
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,950
they don't really understand math they
don't really estimate very well at all

2256
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
don't really estimate very well at all
 

2257
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,870
don't really estimate very well at all
and so on they don't really understand

2258
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
and so on they don't really understand
 

2259
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,390
and so on they don't really understand
the difference between trillions and

2260
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
the difference between trillions and
 

2261
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,309
the difference between trillions and
billions and millions and so on very

2262
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:16,319
billions and millions and so on very
 

2263
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,230
billions and millions and so on very
well

2264
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
well
 

2265
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,030
well
because calculators do that all for us

2266
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
because calculators do that all for us
 

2267
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,550
because calculators do that all for us
um and um thanks to uh things like the

2268
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
um and um thanks to uh things like the
 

2269
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,349
um and um thanks to uh things like the
internet and search engines um

2270
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
internet and search engines um
 

2271
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,630
internet and search engines um
that same kind of juvenilism

enough with this words and books and
 

2313
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,750
enough with this words and books and
it's you're you're not actually

it's you're you're not actually

experiencing like if you read a book
 

2317
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,030

you're not experiencing the thing this
 

2319
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,190
you're not experiencing the thing this
is nonsense that's right if you read a

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
the same as if you had to like learn it
 

2325
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,150
the same as if you had to like learn it
and do it yourself exactly

and do it yourself exactly
 

2327
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,990
and do it yourself exactly
and so on so so let's just say that

2328
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
and so on so so let's just say that
 

2329
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,589
and so on so so let's just say that

yes
 

2655
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,030
yes
the full spectrum well let me um sort of

2656
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
the full spectrum well let me um sort of
 

2657
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,470
the full spectrum well let me um sort of
because you mentioned so many

2658
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
because you mentioned so many
 

2659
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,150
because you mentioned so many
fascinating things let me jump back to

2660
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
fascinating things let me jump back to
 

2661
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,030
fascinating things let me jump back to
the

2662
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
the
 

2663
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,270
the
idea of automated reasoning

2664
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
idea of automated reasoning
 

2665
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,990
idea of automated reasoning
so

2666
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
so
 

2667
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,549
so
the acquisition of new knowledge

2668
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:32,559
the acquisition of new knowledge
 

2669
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,150
the acquisition of new knowledge
has been done in this very interesting

2670
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
has been done in this very interesting
 

2671
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,109
has been done in this very interesting
way

2672
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
way
 

2673
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,910
way
but primarily by humans

2674
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:37,920
but primarily by humans
 

2675
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,390
but primarily by humans
doing this um yes you can think of

2676
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
doing this um yes you can think of
 

2677
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,910
doing this um yes you can think of
monks in their cells in medieval europe

2678
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
monks in their cells in medieval europe
 

2679
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,309
monks in their cells in medieval europe
um you know carefully illuminating

2680
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
um you know carefully illuminating
 

2681
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,390
um you know carefully illuminating
manuscripts and so on it's a very

2682
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
manuscripts and so on it's a very
 

2683
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,790
manuscripts and so on it's a very
difficult and amazing process actually

2684
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
difficult and amazing process actually
 

2685
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,109
difficult and amazing process actually
because it allows you to truly ask the

2686
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
because it allows you to truly ask the
 

2687
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,390
because it allows you to truly ask the
question about

2688
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,400
question about
 

2689
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,190
question about
the

2690
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
the
 

2691
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,150
the
in the white space what is assumed i

2692
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
in the white space what is assumed i
 

2693
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,390
in the white space what is assumed i
think this exercise

2694
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,400
think this exercise
 

2695
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,670
think this exercise
is um like very few people do this right

2696
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
is um like very few people do this right
 

2697
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,950
is um like very few people do this right
they just

2698
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:04,960
they just
 

2699
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,190
they just
do it subconsciously they perform by

2700
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
do it subconsciously they perform by
 

2701
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,430
do it subconsciously they perform by
definition but because because those

2702
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
definition but because because those
 

2703
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,750
definition but because because those
pieces of elided of omitted information

2704
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
pieces of elided of omitted information
 

2705
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,630
pieces of elided of omitted information
of those missing steps as it were

2706
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
of those missing steps as it were
 

2707
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,950
of those missing steps as it were
are pieces of common sense if you

2708
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
are pieces of common sense if you
 

2709
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,430
are pieces of common sense if you
actually included all of them it would

2710
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:21,440
actually included all of them it would
 

2711
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,430
actually included all of them it would
it would almost be offensive or

2712
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
it would almost be offensive or
 

2713
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,510
it would almost be offensive or
confusing to the readers like why are

2714
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
confusing to the readers like why are
 

2715
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,950
confusing to the readers like why are
they telling me all these of course i

2716
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:26,960
they telling me all these of course i
 

2717
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,109
they telling me all these of course i
know that you know all these things

2718
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,119
know that you know all these things
 

2719
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,710
know that you know all these things
and so um

2720
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
and so um
 

2721
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,950
and so um
so it's one of these things which almost

2722
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960
so it's one of these things which almost
 

2723
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,549
so it's one of these things which almost
by its very nature

2724
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
by its very nature
 

2725
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,470
by its very nature
um has has

2726
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:36,480
um has has
 

2727
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,630
um has has

down anywhere
 

2731
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,270
down anywhere
because

2732
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,280
because
 

2733
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,190
because
by the time you're old enough to talk to

2734
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,200
by the time you're old enough to talk to
 

2735
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,589
by the time you're old enough to talk to
other people and so on um you know if

2736
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:45,599
other people and so on um you know if
 

2737
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,549
other people and so on um you know if
you survived to that age presumably you

2738
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:48,559
you survived to that age presumably you
 

2739
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,870
you survived to that age presumably you
already got pieces of common sense like

2740
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
already got pieces of common sense like
 

2741
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,349
already got pieces of common sense like
um you know if something causes you pain

2742
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
um you know if something causes you pain
 

2743
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,190
um you know if something causes you pain
whenever you do it probably not a good

2744
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
whenever you do it probably not a good
 

2745
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,349
whenever you do it probably not a good
idea to keep doing it

2746
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
idea to keep doing it
 

2747
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,790
idea to keep doing it
uh so

2748
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
uh so
 

2749
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,790
uh so
what ideas do you have given how

2750
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
what ideas do you have given how
 

2751
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,549
what ideas do you have given how
difficult this step is

2752
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:02,559
difficult this step is
 

2753
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,430
difficult this step is
what ideas are there for how to do it

2754
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
what ideas are there for how to do it
 

2755
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,349
what ideas are there for how to do it
automatically without

2756
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
automatically without
 

2757
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,790
automatically without
using humans or at least not um

2758
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
using humans or at least not um
 

2759
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,270
using humans or at least not um
you know doing like a large percentage

2760
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
you know doing like a large percentage
 

2761
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,950
you know doing like a large percentage
of the work for humans and then humans

2762
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:14,960
of the work for humans and then humans
 

2763
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,150
of the work for humans and then humans
only do the

2764
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
only do the
 

2765
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,630
only do the
very high level supervisory work

2766
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
very high level supervisory work
 

2767
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,750
very high level supervisory work
so we have um uh in fact

2768
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,760
so we have um uh in fact
 

2769
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,589
so we have um uh in fact
two directions we're pushing on very

2770
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
two directions we're pushing on very
 

2771
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,750
two directions we're pushing on very
very heavily uh currently at sitecore

2772
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
very heavily uh currently at sitecore
 

2773
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,829
very heavily uh currently at sitecore
and one involves natural language

2774
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
and one involves natural language
 

2775
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,589
and one involves natural language
understanding and the ability to read

2776
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:29,599
understanding and the ability to read
 

2777
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,750

what people have explicitly written down

2778
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
what people have explicitly written down
 

2779
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,030
what people have explicitly written down
and and to to pull knowledge in that way

2780
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,040
and and to to pull knowledge in that way
 

2781
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,390
and and to to pull knowledge in that way
but the other is

2782
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
but the other is
 

2783
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,510
but the other is
to build a series of

00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
suite of software tools if you want
 

2797
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,030

something that will help people to more

2798
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040

expand and extend the system um

2802
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,160
expand and extend the system um
 

2803
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,309
expand and extend the system um
in areas where for instance they want to

2804
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
in areas where for instance they want to
 

2805
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,750
in areas where for instance they want to
build some app have it do some

2806
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
build some app have it do some
 

2807
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,829

application or something
 

2809
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,430
application or something
like that so i'll give you an example of

2810
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
like that so i'll give you an example of
 

2811
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,230
like that so i'll give you an example of
one

2812
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,240
one
 

2813
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,230
one
which is something called

2814
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
which is something called
 

2815
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,549
which is something called
abduction so you've probably heard of

2816
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559
abduction so you've probably heard of
 

2817
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,349
abduction so you've probably heard of
like deduction

2818
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
like deduction
 

2819
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,309
like deduction
and

2820
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
and
 

2821
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,109
and
induction and so on but abduction is

2822
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
induction and so on but abduction is
 

2823
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,430
induction and so on but abduction is
unlike this abduction is not

2824
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
unlike this abduction is not
 

2825
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,549
unlike this abduction is not
sound

2826
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
sound
 

2827
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,710
sound
it's just useful so

2828
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
it's just useful so
 

2829
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,430
it's just useful so
uh for instance um

2830
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
uh for instance um
 

2831
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,150
uh for instance um
deductively if someone is out in the

2832
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
deductively if someone is out in the
 

2833
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,309
deductively if someone is out in the
rain and they're going to get all wet

2834
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
rain and they're going to get all wet
 

2835
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,030
rain and they're going to get all wet
and

2836
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,040
and
 

2837
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,870
and
when they enter room they might be all

2838
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:36,880
when they enter room they might be all
 

2839
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,710
when they enter room they might be all
wet and so on

2840
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
wet and so on
 

2841
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,030
wet and so on
so that's deduction

2842
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
so that's deduction
 

2843
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,950
so that's deduction
but if someone were to walk into the

2844
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
but if someone were to walk into the
 

2845
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,309
but if someone were to walk into the
room right now

2846
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,319
room right now
 

2847
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,710
room right now
and they were dripping wet

2848
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
and they were dripping wet
 

2849
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,710
and they were dripping wet
we would immediately look outside to say

2850
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
we would immediately look outside to say
 

2851
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,790
we would immediately look outside to say
oh did it start to rain or something

2852
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
oh did it start to rain or something
 

2853
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,790
oh did it start to rain or something
like that now

2854
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
like that now
 

2855
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,109
like that now
why did we say maybe it started to rain

2856
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
why did we say maybe it started to rain
 

2857
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,230
why did we say maybe it started to rain
that's not a sound logical inference but

2858
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
that's not a sound logical inference but
 

2859
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,430
that's not a sound logical inference but
it's certainly a reasonable

2860
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:01,440
it's certainly a reasonable
 

2861
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,790
it's certainly a reasonable
abductive

2862
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:02,800
abductive
 

2863
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,950
abductive
leap to say well one of the most common

2864
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
leap to say well one of the most common
 

2865
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,589
leap to say well one of the most common
ways that a person would have gotten

2866
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
ways that a person would have gotten
 

2867
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,670
ways that a person would have gotten
dripping wet is if they had gotten

2868
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
dripping wet is if they had gotten
 

2869
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,430
dripping wet is if they had gotten
caught out in the rain or something like

2870
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:11,440
caught out in the rain or something like
 

2871
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,549
caught out in the rain or something like
that um so um

2872
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
that um so um
 

2873
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,910
that um so um
what what does that have to do with what

2874
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:15,920
what what does that have to do with what
 

2875
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,270
what what does that have to do with what
we were talking about so suppose you're

2876
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,280
we were talking about so suppose you're
 

2877
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,829
we were talking about so suppose you're
building one of these applications and

2878
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
building one of these applications and
 

2879
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,309
building one of these applications and
the system gets some answer wrong

2880
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
the system gets some answer wrong
 

2881
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,630
the system gets some answer wrong
and you say oh yeah the answer to this

2882
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
and you say oh yeah the answer to this
 

2883
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,549
and you say oh yeah the answer to this
question is

2884
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
question is
 

2885
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,950
question is
this one not the one you came up with

2886
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
this one not the one you came up with
 

2887
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,109
this one not the one you came up with
then what the system can do is it can

2888
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:31,119
then what the system can do is it can
 

2889
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,510
then what the system can do is it can
use everything it already knows about

2890
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
use everything it already knows about
 

2891
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,349
use everything it already knows about
common sense general knowledge the

2892
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:35,359
common sense general knowledge the
 

2893
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,870
common sense general knowledge the

about
 

2897
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,230
about
and context like we talked about and so

2898
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,240
and context like we talked about and so
 

2899
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,190
and context like we talked about and so
on and say well here are

2900
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
on and say well here are
 

2901
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,910
on and say well here are
seven alternatives each of which i

2902
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:45,920
seven alternatives each of which i
 

2903
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,790
seven alternatives each of which i
believe is plausible given everything i

2904
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:48,800
believe is plausible given everything i
 

2905
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,109
believe is plausible given everything i
already know and if any of these seven

2906
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
already know and if any of these seven
 

2907
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,270
already know and if any of these seven
things were true i would have come up

2908
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
things were true i would have come up
 

2909
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,109
things were true i would have come up
with the answer you just gave me instead

2910
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
with the answer you just gave me instead
 

2911
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,109
with the answer you just gave me instead
of the wrong answer i came up with is

2912
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
of the wrong answer i came up with is
 

2913
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,670
of the wrong answer i came up with is
one of these seven things true and then

2914
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
one of these seven things true and then
 

2915
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,990
one of these seven things true and then
you the expert will look at those

2916
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
you the expert will look at those
 

2917
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,750
you the expert will look at those
on seven things and say oh yeah number

2918
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:03,760
on seven things and say oh yeah number
 

2919
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,150
on seven things and say oh yeah number
five is actually true and so without

2920
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,160
five is actually true and so without
 

2921
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,710
five is actually true and so without
actually having to tinker down at the

2922
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
actually having to tinker down at the
 

2923
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,390
actually having to tinker down at the
level of logical assertions and so on um

2924
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
level of logical assertions and so on um
 

2925
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,549
level of logical assertions and so on um
you'll be able to educate

2926
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
you'll be able to educate
 

2927
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,910
you'll be able to educate
the system in the same way that you

2928
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:15,920
the system in the same way that you
 

2929
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,549
the system in the same way that you
would help educate another person who

2930
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
would help educate another person who
 

2931
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,549
would help educate another person who
you were trying to apprentice or

2932
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
you were trying to apprentice or
 

2933
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,630
you were trying to apprentice or
something like that so that that

2934
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
something like that so that that
 

2935
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,670
something like that so that that
significantly reduces the mental effort

2936
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
significantly reduces the mental effort
 

2937
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,270
significantly reduces the mental effort
or significantly increases the

2938
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
or significantly increases the
 

2939
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,670
or significantly increases the
efficiency of the teacher the human

2940
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
efficiency of the teacher the human
 

2941
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,510
efficiency of the teacher the human
teacher exactly and it makes more or

2942
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,520
teacher exactly and it makes more or
 

2943
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,549
teacher exactly and it makes more or
less anyone able to to be a teacher um

2944
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
less anyone able to to be a teacher um
 

2945
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,190
less anyone able to to be a teacher um
in that um in that way so that's that's

2946
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
in that um in that way so that's that's
 

2947
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,190
in that um in that way so that's that's
part of the the answer and then the

2948
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
part of the the answer and then the
 

2949
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,630
part of the the answer and then the
other is that

2950
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
other is that
 

2951
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,990
other is that
the system on its own will be able to um

2952
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
the system on its own will be able to um
 

2953
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,829
the system on its own will be able to um
through reading through

2954
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
through reading through
 

2955
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,230
through reading through
conversations with other people and so

2956
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
conversations with other people and so
 

2957
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,510
conversations with other people and so
on um learn the same way that um you or

2958
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
on um learn the same way that um you or
 

2959
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,470
on um learn the same way that um you or
i or other humans do

2960
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
i or other humans do
 

2961
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,990
i or other humans do
first of all that's that's a beautiful

2962
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,000
first of all that's that's a beautiful
 

2963
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,990
first of all that's that's a beautiful
vision um i'll have to ask you about

2964
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
vision um i'll have to ask you about
 

2965
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,990
vision um i'll have to ask you about
semantic webinar in a second here but

2966
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
semantic webinar in a second here but
 

2967
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,950
semantic webinar in a second here but
first uh

2968
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:02,960

 

2969
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,910

are there

2970
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
are there
 

2971
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,750
are there
when we talk about specific techniques

2972
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,760
when we talk about specific techniques
 

2973
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,750
when we talk about specific techniques
do you find something inspiring or

2974
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
do you find something inspiring or
 

2975
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,470
do you find something inspiring or
directly useful from the whole space of

2976
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
directly useful from the whole space of
 

2977
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,630
directly useful from the whole space of
machine learning deep learning these

2978
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
machine learning deep learning these
 

2979
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,270
machine learning deep learning these
kinds of spaces of techniques that have

2980
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
kinds of spaces of techniques that have
 

2981
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,870
kinds of spaces of techniques that have
been shown effective for certain kinds

2982
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
been shown effective for certain kinds
 

2983
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,430
been shown effective for certain kinds
of problems in the recent uh

2984
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440
of problems in the recent uh
 

2985
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,710
of problems in the recent uh
now decade and a half i i think of the

2986
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
now decade and a half i i think of the
 

2987
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,870
now decade and a half i i think of the
machine learning work

2988
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
machine learning work
 

2989
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,510
machine learning work
as more or less what our right brain

2990
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:27,520
as more or less what our right brain
 

2991
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,710
as more or less what our right brain
hemispheres

2992
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
hemispheres
 

2993
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,870
hemispheres
do so

2994
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:30,880
do so
 

2995
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,870
do so
being able to

2996
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
being able to
 

2997
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,750
being able to
take a bunch of data and recognize

2998
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:35,760
take a bunch of data and recognize
 

2999
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,630
take a bunch of data and recognize
patterns being able to statistically

3000
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
patterns being able to statistically
 

3001
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,109
patterns being able to statistically
infer things and so on

3002
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
infer things and so on
 

3003
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,109
infer things and so on
and

3004
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
and
 

3005
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,870
and
you know i certainly wouldn't want to

3006
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:44,880
you know i certainly wouldn't want to
 

3007
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,510
you know i certainly wouldn't want to
not have a right brain hemisphere but

3008
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:47,520
not have a right brain hemisphere but
 

3009
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,349
not have a right brain hemisphere but
i'm also glad that i have a left brain

3010
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:49,359
i'm also glad that i have a left brain
 

3011
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,670
i'm also glad that i have a left brain
hemisphere as well something that can

3012
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:51,680
hemisphere as well something that can
 

3013
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,230
hemisphere as well something that can
metaphorically sit back and puff on its

3014
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
metaphorically sit back and puff on its
 

3015
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,470
metaphorically sit back and puff on its
pipe and think about

3016
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:56,480
pipe and think about
 

3017
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,910
pipe and think about
this thing over here it's like why might

3018
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
this thing over here it's like why might
 

3019
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,349
this thing over here it's like why might
this have been true

3020
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
this have been true
 

3021
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,950
this have been true
and

3022
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
and
 

3023
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,470
and
what are the implications of it how

3024
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480
what are the implications of it how
 

3025
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,549
what are the implications of it how
should i feel about that and why and so

3026
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
should i feel about that and why and so
 

3027
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,950
should i feel about that and why and so
on so i'm thinking more deeply and

3028
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
on so i'm thinking more deeply and
 

3029
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,030
on so i'm thinking more deeply and
slowly um

3030
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,040
slowly um
 

3031
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,109
slowly um
what kahneman called thinking slowly

3032
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
what kahneman called thinking slowly
 

3033
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,670
what kahneman called thinking slowly
versus thinking quickly whereas you want

3034
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
versus thinking quickly whereas you want
 

3035
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,430
versus thinking quickly whereas you want
machine learning to think quickly but

3036
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
machine learning to think quickly but
 

3037
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,069
machine learning to think quickly but
you want the ability to think deeply

3038
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
you want the ability to think deeply
 

3039
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,549
you want the ability to think deeply
even if it's a little slower

3040
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
even if it's a little slower
 

3041
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,470
even if it's a little slower
so i'll give you an example of a project

3042
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
so i'll give you an example of a project
 

3043
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,750
so i'll give you an example of a project
we did recently with nih involving the

3044
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
we did recently with nih involving the
 

3045
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,750
we did recently with nih involving the
cleveland clinic and

3046
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
cleveland clinic and
 

3047
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,190
cleveland clinic and
a couple other

3048
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
a couple other
 

3049
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,549
a couple other
institutions that we ran a project for

3050
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
institutions that we ran a project for
 

3051
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,349
institutions that we ran a project for
and what it did was it took um guasa's

3052
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
and what it did was it took um guasa's
 

3053
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,549
and what it did was it took um guasa's
genome-wide association studies um those

3054
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
genome-wide association studies um those
 

3055
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,990
genome-wide association studies um those
are sort of big databases of

3056
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
are sort of big databases of
 

3057
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,789
are sort of big databases of
patients that came into a hospital

3058
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
patients that came into a hospital
 

3059
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,910
patients that came into a hospital
they got their dna sequenced because the

3060
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:47,920
they got their dna sequenced because the
 

3061
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,230
they got their dna sequenced because the
cost of doing that has gone from

3062
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
cost of doing that has gone from
 

3063
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,109
cost of doing that has gone from
infinity to billions of dollars to 100

3064
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:53,119
infinity to billions of dollars to 100
 

3065
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,870
infinity to billions of dollars to 100
dollars or so

3066
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
dollars or so
 

3067
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,789
dollars or so
and so now patients routinely get their

3068
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
and so now patients routinely get their
 

3069
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,789
and so now patients routinely get their
dna sequence so you have these big

3070
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
dna sequence so you have these big
 

3071
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,710
dna sequence so you have these big
databases of

3072
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
databases of
 

3073
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,789
databases of
the snips the single nucleotide

3074
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:02,799
the snips the single nucleotide
 

3075
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,270
the snips the single nucleotide
polymorphisms the point mutations in a

3076
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
polymorphisms the point mutations in a
 

3077
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,030
polymorphisms the point mutations in a
patient's dna

3078
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
patient's dna
 

3079
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,190
patient's dna
and the disease that happened to bring

3080
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
and the disease that happened to bring
 

3081
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,710
and the disease that happened to bring
them into the hospital

3082
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
them into the hospital
 

3083
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,349
them into the hospital
so now you can do correlation studies

3084
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
so now you can do correlation studies
 

3085
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,230
so now you can do correlation studies
machine learning studies of which

3086
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
machine learning studies of which
 

3087
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,789
machine learning studies of which
mutations

3088
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
mutations
 

3089
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,430
mutations
are associated with and led to which

3090
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440
are associated with and led to which
 

3091
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,990
are associated with and led to which
physiological problems and diseases and

3092
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
physiological problems and diseases and
 

3093
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,630
physiological problems and diseases and
so on like getting arthritis and and so

3094
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
so on like getting arthritis and and so
 

3095
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,430
so on like getting arthritis and and so
on and the problem is that those

3096
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
on and the problem is that those
 

3097
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,190
on and the problem is that those
correlations turn out to be very

3098
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
correlations turn out to be very
 

3099
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,470
correlations turn out to be very
spurious they turn out to be very noisy

3100
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
spurious they turn out to be very noisy
 

3101
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,910
spurious they turn out to be very noisy
very many of them

3102
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
very many of them
 

3103
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,789
very many of them
have led doctors onto wild goose chases

3104
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:38,799
have led doctors onto wild goose chases
 

3105
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,950
have led doctors onto wild goose chases
and so on and so they wanted a way of

3106
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
and so on and so they wanted a way of
 

3107
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,750
and so on and so they wanted a way of
eliminating or the bad ones are focusing

3108
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:43,760
eliminating or the bad ones are focusing
 

3109
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,430
eliminating or the bad ones are focusing
on the good ones and so

3110
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
on the good ones and so
 

3111
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,750
on the good ones and so
this is where psych comes in which is

3112
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
this is where psych comes in which is
 

3113
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,750
this is where psych comes in which is
psych takes those sort of a to z

3114
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
psych takes those sort of a to z
 

3115
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,510
psych takes those sort of a to z
correlations between point mutations and

3116
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
correlations between point mutations and
 

3117
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,430
correlations between point mutations and
um medical condition that needs

3118
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
um medical condition that needs
 

3119
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,870
um medical condition that needs
treatment

3120
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
treatment
 

3121
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,190
treatment
and we say okay let's use all this

3122
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,200
and we say okay let's use all this
 

3123
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,270
and we say okay let's use all this
public knowledge and common sense

3124
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:01,280
public knowledge and common sense
 

3125
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,390
public knowledge and common sense
knowledge um about what reactions occur

3126
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
knowledge um about what reactions occur
 

3127
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,230
knowledge um about what reactions occur
where in the human body

3128
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
where in the human body
 

3129
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,789
where in the human body
what polymerizes what what catalyzes

3130
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:08,799
what polymerizes what what catalyzes
 

3131
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,109
what polymerizes what what catalyzes
what reactions and so on and let's try

3132
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:11,119
what reactions and so on and let's try
 

3133
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,390
what reactions and so on and let's try
to put together

3134
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:12,400
to put together
 

3135
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,109
to put together
a 10 or 20 or 30 step causal explanation

3136
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:17,119
a 10 or 20 or 30 step causal explanation
 

3137
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,390
a 10 or 20 or 30 step causal explanation
of why that mutation might have caused

3138
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
of why that mutation might have caused
 

3139
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,030
of why that mutation might have caused
that medical condition and so psych

3140
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
that medical condition and so psych
 

3141
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,710
that medical condition and so psych
would put together in some sense some

3142
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,720
would put together in some sense some
 

3143
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,630
would put together in some sense some
rube goldberg like

3144
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
rube goldberg like
 

3145
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,349
rube goldberg like
chain that would say oh yeah that

3146
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
chain that would say oh yeah that
 

3147
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,870
chain that would say oh yeah that
mutation

3148
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
mutation
 

3149
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,549
mutation
if it got expressed would be this um

3150
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
if it got expressed would be this um
 

3151
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,109
if it got expressed would be this um
altered protein which because of that if

3152
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119
altered protein which because of that if
 

3153
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,710
altered protein which because of that if
it got to this part of the body would

3154
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
it got to this part of the body would
 

3155
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,030
it got to this part of the body would
catalyze this reaction and by the way

3156
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
catalyze this reaction and by the way
 

3157
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,870
catalyze this reaction and by the way
that would cause more bioactive vitamin

3158
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
that would cause more bioactive vitamin
 

3159
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,349
that would cause more bioactive vitamin
d in the person's blood and anyway ten

3160
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
d in the person's blood and anyway ten
 

3161
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,990
d in the person's blood and anyway ten
steps later that screws screws up bone

3162
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
steps later that screws screws up bone
 

3163
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,910
steps later that screws screws up bone
resorption and that's why this person

3164
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
resorption and that's why this person
 

3165
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,710
resorption and that's why this person
got osteoporosis early in life and so on

3166
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
got osteoporosis early in life and so on
 

3167
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,230
got osteoporosis early in life and so on
so that's human interpretable or at

3168
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
so that's human interpretable or at
 

3169
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,430
so that's human interpretable or at
least doctor humanity exactly yeah and

3170
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
least doctor humanity exactly yeah and
 

3171
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,910
least doctor humanity exactly yeah and
the important thing even more than that

3172
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
the important thing even more than that
 

3173
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,589
the important thing even more than that
is

3174
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
is
 

3175
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,510
is
you shouldn't really trust that 20-step

3176
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
you shouldn't really trust that 20-step
 

3177
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,589
you shouldn't really trust that 20-step
rube goldberg chain any more than you

3178
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
rube goldberg chain any more than you
 

3179
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,390
rube goldberg chain any more than you
trust

3180
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
trust
 

3181
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,950
trust
that initial a to z correlation except

3182
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
that initial a to z correlation except
 

3183
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,270
that initial a to z correlation except
two things one if you can't even think

3184
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
two things one if you can't even think
 

3185
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,470
two things one if you can't even think
of one

3186
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
of one
 

3187
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,589
of one
causal chain to explain this

3188
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:17,599
causal chain to explain this
 

3189
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,150
causal chain to explain this
then that correlation probably was just

3190
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
then that correlation probably was just
 

3191
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,710
then that correlation probably was just
noise to begin with and secondly and

3192
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
noise to begin with and secondly and
 

3193
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,829
noise to begin with and secondly and
even more powerfully along the way that

3194
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
even more powerfully along the way that
 

3195
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,309
even more powerfully along the way that
causal chain will make predictions like

3196
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:28,319
causal chain will make predictions like
 

3197
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,470
causal chain will make predictions like
the one about having more bioactive

3198
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
the one about having more bioactive
 

3199
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,710
the one about having more bioactive
vitamin d in your blood so you can now

3200
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:32,720
vitamin d in your blood so you can now
 

3201
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,430
vitamin d in your blood so you can now
go back to the data about these patients

3202
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:35,440
go back to the data about these patients
 

3203
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,030
go back to the data about these patients
and say by the way

3204
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:37,040
and say by the way
 

3205
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,910
and say by the way
did they have slightly elevated levels

3206
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
did they have slightly elevated levels
 

3207
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,990
did they have slightly elevated levels
of bioactive vitamin d in their blood

3208
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
of bioactive vitamin d in their blood
 

3209
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,390
of bioactive vitamin d in their blood
and so on and if the answer is no that

3210
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
and so on and if the answer is no that
 

3211
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,470
and so on and if the answer is no that
strongly disconfirms

3212
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:46,480
strongly disconfirms
 

3213
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,309
strongly disconfirms
your whole causal chain and if the

3214
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
your whole causal chain and if the
 

3215
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,789
your whole causal chain and if the
answer is yes that somewhat confirms

3216
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:50,799
answer is yes that somewhat confirms
 

3217
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,190
answer is yes that somewhat confirms
that causal chain and so using that we

3218
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
that causal chain and so using that we
 

3219
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,109
that causal chain and so using that we
were able to take this on these

3220
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
were able to take this on these
 

3221
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,069
were able to take this on these
correlations from this gloss database

3222
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,079
correlations from this gloss database
 

3223
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,390
correlations from this gloss database
and we were able to um

3224
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,400
and we were able to um
 

3225
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,270
and we were able to um
essentially focus the the doctors

3226
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,280
essentially focus the the doctors
 

3227
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,670
essentially focus the the doctors
focused the researchers attention on the

3228
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
focused the researchers attention on the
 

3229
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,390
focused the researchers attention on the
very small percentage of correlations

3230
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
very small percentage of correlations
 

3231
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,990
very small percentage of correlations
that had

3232
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
that had
 

3233
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,069
that had
some explanation and even better some

3234
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:12,079
some explanation and even better some
 

3235
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,589
some explanation and even better some
explanation that also made some

3236
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
explanation that also made some
 

3237
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,349
explanation that also made some
independent prediction that they could

3238
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
independent prediction that they could
 

3239
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,430
independent prediction that they could
confirm or disconfirm by looking at the

3240
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440
confirm or disconfirm by looking at the
 

3241
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,510
confirm or disconfirm by looking at the
data so think of it like this kind of

3242
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:19,520
data so think of it like this kind of
 

3243
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,150
data so think of it like this kind of
synergy where you want the right brain

3244
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,160
synergy where you want the right brain
 

3245
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,309

at the fringe of what you know already

at the fringe of what you know already
you learn this new thing is similar to

you learn this new thing is similar to

you learn this new thing is similar to

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,750

01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
to learn about it and so on so the more
 

3355
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,950

if you don't really know anything
 

3363
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,390
if you don't really know anything
then it's really hard to learn anything

3364
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
then it's really hard to learn anything
 

3365
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,589
then it's really hard to learn anything
and so

3366
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
and so

if you're not careful if you start out

it never really takes off and so that's

01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
it never really takes off and so that's
 

3375
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,630
it never really takes off and so that's
why i view this as a pump priming

where um yes it may be helpful
 

3439
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,870
where um yes it may be helpful
most of the time it may even be correct

3440
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
most of the time it may even be correct
 

3441
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,789
most of the time it may even be correct
most of the time but if it doesn't

3442
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
most of the time but if it doesn't
 

3443
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,349
most of the time but if it doesn't
really understand what it's saying and

3444
01:02:59,349 --> 01:02:59,359
really understand what it's saying and
 

3445
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,029
really understand what it's saying and
if it doesn't really understand why

3446
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:01,039
if it doesn't really understand why
 

3447
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,230
if it doesn't really understand why
things are true and doesn't really

3448
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
things are true and doesn't really
 

3449
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,390
things are true and doesn't really
understand how the world world works

3450
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
understand how the world world works
 

3451
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,309
understand how the world world works
then some fraction of the time it's

3452
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
then some fraction of the time it's
 

3453
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,870
then some fraction of the time it's
going to be wrong now if your only goal

3454
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
going to be wrong now if your only goal
 

3455
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,990
going to be wrong now if your only goal
is to sort of find relevant information

3456
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
is to sort of find relevant information
 

3457
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,390
is to sort of find relevant information
like search engines do

3458
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
like search engines do
 

3459
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,549
like search engines do
then being right 90 of the time is

3460
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
then being right 90 of the time is
 

3461
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,510
then being right 90 of the time is
fantastic that's unbelievably great okay

3462
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:19,520
fantastic that's unbelievably great okay
 

3463
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,230
fantastic that's unbelievably great okay
however if your goal is to like um you

3464
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,240
however if your goal is to like um you
 

3465
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,710
however if your goal is to like um you
know save the the life of your child who

has some medical problem or your goal is
to uh be able to drive you know for the

3470
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
to uh be able to drive you know for the
 

3471
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,069
to uh be able to drive you know for the
next 10 000 hours of driving without

3472
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:32,079
next 10 000 hours of driving without
 

3473
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,710
next 10 000 hours of driving without
getting into a fatal accident and so on

3474
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
getting into a fatal accident and so on
 

3475
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,549
getting into a fatal accident and so on
then you know

3476
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:36,559
then you know
 

3477
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,190
then you know
error rates down at the 10 level or even

3478
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
error rates down at the 10 level or even
 

3479
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,069
error rates down at the 10 level or even
the 1 level not really acceptable

3480
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
the 1 level not really acceptable
 

3481
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,430
the 1 level not really acceptable
i like the model of with that learning

3482
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:45,440
i like the model of with that learning
 

3483
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,670
i like the model of with that learning
happens at the edge and then you kind of

3484
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
happens at the edge and then you kind of
 

3485
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,069
happens at the edge and then you kind of
think of knowledge as this fear

3486
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
think of knowledge as this fear
 

3487
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,510
think of knowledge as this fear
so uh

3488
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
so uh
 

3489
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,510
so uh
if you want a large sphere because the

3490
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
if you want a large sphere because the
 

3491
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,270
if you want a large sphere because the
uh the learning is happening on the

3492
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:55,280
uh the learning is happening on the
 

3493
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,390
uh the learning is happening on the
surface

3494
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
surface
 

3495
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,029
surface
exactly so you have the the what you can

3496
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
exactly so you have the the what you can
 

3497
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,390
exactly so you have the the what you can
learn next increases quadratically as

3498
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400
learn next increases quadratically as
 

3499
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,190
learn next increases quadratically as
the diameter of that sphere um goes up

3500
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
the diameter of that sphere um goes up
 

3501
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,950
the diameter of that sphere um goes up
it's nice because you think when you

3502
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
it's nice because you think when you
 

3503
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,390
it's nice because you think when you
know nothing

3504
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
know nothing
 

3505
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,230
know nothing
it's like you can learn anything but the

3506
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
it's like you can learn anything but the
 

3507
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,470
it's like you can learn anything but the
reality not really

3508
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
reality not really
 

3509
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,829
reality not really
right if you know if you know nothing

3510
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:13,839
right if you know if you know nothing
 

3511
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,829
right if you know if you know nothing
you can really learn nothing

3512
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:15,839
you can really learn nothing
 

3513
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,430
you can really learn nothing
you can appear to learn so i'll also um

3514
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
you can appear to learn so i'll also um
 

3515
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,150
you can appear to learn so i'll also um
one of the anecdotes i could go back and

01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:12,960
mycin which was a medical diagnosis
 

3567
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,510
mycin which was a medical diagnosis
program that happened to specialize

3568
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,520
program that happened to specialize
 

3569
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,789
program that happened to specialize
in

3570
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
in
 

3571
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,750
in
blood infections like meningitis and so

3572
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
blood infections like meningitis and so
 

3573
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,750
blood infections like meningitis and so
he had privileges at stanford hospital

3574
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
he had privileges at stanford hospital
 

3575
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,910
he had privileges at stanford hospital
because he was also an md

3576
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,920
because he was also an md
 

3577
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,390
because he was also an md
and so we got hold of her chart and we

3578
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:26,400
and so we got hold of her chart and we
 

3579
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,630
and so we got hold of her chart and we
put in her case and it came up with

3580
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:28,640
put in her case and it came up with
 

3581
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,190
put in her case and it came up with
exactly the same diagnoses and exactly

3582
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
exactly the same diagnoses and exactly
 

3583
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,670
exactly the same diagnoses and exactly
the same therapy recommendations but the

3584
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
the same therapy recommendations but the
 

3585
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,430
the same therapy recommendations but the
difference was because it was a

3586
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:35,440
difference was because it was a
 

3587
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,270
difference was because it was a
knowledge-based system a rule-based

3588
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:37,280
knowledge-based system a rule-based
 

3589
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,990
knowledge-based system a rule-based
system it was able to tell us step by

3590
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
system it was able to tell us step by
 

3591
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,150
system it was able to tell us step by
step by step

3592
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160
step by step
 

3593
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,270
step by step
why

3594
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,280
why
 

3595
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,630
why
this was the diagnosis and step by step

3596
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
this was the diagnosis and step by step
 

3597
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,710
this was the diagnosis and step by step
why this was the best

3598
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
why this was the best
 

3599
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,390
why this was the best
on therapy the best

3600
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
on therapy the best
 

3601
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,230
on therapy the best
procedure to um

3602
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
procedure to um
 

3603
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,870
procedure to um
to to do for her and so on and there was

3604
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:54,880
to to do for her and so on and there was
 

3605
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,789
to to do for her and so on and there was
a real epiphany because that made all

3606
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
a real epiphany because that made all
 

3607
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,630
a real epiphany because that made all
the difference in the world instead of

3608
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
the difference in the world instead of
 

3609
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,190
the difference in the world instead of
blindly having to trust in authority we

3610
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
blindly having to trust in authority we
 

3611
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,150
blindly having to trust in authority we
were able to understand what was

3612
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
were able to understand what was
 

3613
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,309
were able to understand what was
actually going on and

3614
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
actually going on and
 

3615
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,390
actually going on and
so at that at that time i realized that

3616
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
so at that at that time i realized that
 

3617
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,990
so at that at that time i realized that
that really is what was missing in

3618
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
that really is what was missing in
 

3619
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,390
that really is what was missing in
computer programs was that even if they

3620
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:12,400
computer programs was that even if they
 

3621
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,829
computer programs was that even if they
got things right

3622
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:13,839
got things right
 

3623
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,870
got things right
because they didn't really understand

3624
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
because they didn't really understand
 

3625
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,870
because they didn't really understand
the way the world works and why things

3626
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
the way the world works and why things
 

3627
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,870
the way the world works and why things
are the way they are they weren't able

3628
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
are the way they are they weren't able
 

3629
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,069
are the way they are they weren't able
to give explanations of their answer um

3630
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:24,079
to give explanations of their answer um
 

3631
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,150
to give explanations of their answer um
you know and you know it's one thing to

3632
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
you know and you know it's one thing to
 

3633
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,069
you know and you know it's one thing to
to use a machine learning system that

3634
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
to use a machine learning system that
 

3635
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,069
to use a machine learning system that
says this is what you should you know i

3636
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,079
says this is what you should you know i
 

3637
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,910
says this is what you should you know i
i think you should get this operation

3638
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:31,920
i think you should get this operation
 

3639
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,829
i think you should get this operation
and you say why and it says you know

3640
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
and you say why and it says you know
 

3641
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,710
and you say why and it says you know
0.83 and you say no in more detail why

3642
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
0.83 and you say no in more detail why
 

3643
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,349
0.83 and you say no in more detail why
and it says 0.831 you know

3644
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:39,359
and it says 0.831 you know
 

3645
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,109
and it says 0.831 you know
that's not really very compelling and

3646
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:41,119
that's not really very compelling and
 

3647
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,109
that's not really very compelling and
that's not really very helpful

3648
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
that's not really very helpful
 

3649
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,470
that's not really very helpful
there's this idea of the semantic web

3650
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,480
there's this idea of the semantic web
 

3651
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,549
there's this idea of the semantic web
and when i first heard about

3652
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
and when i first heard about
 

3653
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,150
and when i first heard about
i just fell in love with the idea it was

3654
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
i just fell in love with the idea it was
 

3655
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,230
i just fell in love with the idea it was
the obvious next step for the internet

3656
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,240
the obvious next step for the internet
 

3657
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,029
the obvious next step for the internet
sure

3658
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
sure
 

3659
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,270
sure
and maybe you can speak about what is

3660
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:55,280
and maybe you can speak about what is
 

3661
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,270
and maybe you can speak about what is
the semantic web what are your thoughts

3662
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
the semantic web what are your thoughts
 

3663
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,309
the semantic web what are your thoughts
about it

3664
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:58,319
about it
 

3665
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,549
about it
how your vision and mission and goals

3666
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
how your vision and mission and goals
 

3667
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,430
how your vision and mission and goals
with psych are connected integrated

3668
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,440
with psych are connected integrated
 

3669
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,750
with psych are connected integrated
like are they dance partners are they

3670
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
like are they dance partners are they
 

3671
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,230
like are they dance partners are they
aligned what are your thoughts there so

3672
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
aligned what are your thoughts there so
 

3673
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,069
aligned what are your thoughts there so
think of the semantic web

3674
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
think of the semantic web
 

3675
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,309
think of the semantic web
as a kind of knowledge graph and google

3676
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:12,319
as a kind of knowledge graph and google
 

3677
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,150
as a kind of knowledge graph and google
already has something they call

3678
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
already has something they call
 

3679
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,950
already has something they call
knowledge graph for example

3680
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
knowledge graph for example
 

3681
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,910
knowledge graph for example
which is sort of like a node and link

3682
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
which is sort of like a node and link
 

3683
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,029
which is sort of like a node and link
diagram so you have these

3684
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
diagram so you have these
 

3685
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,670
diagram so you have these
nodes that represent concepts or words

3686
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
nodes that represent concepts or words
 

3687
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,270
nodes that represent concepts or words
or terms

3688
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
or terms
 

3689
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,750
or terms
and then there are some arcs

3690
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
and then there are some arcs
 

3691
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,549
and then there are some arcs
that connect them that might be labeled

3692
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
that connect them that might be labeled
 

3693
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,950
that connect them that might be labeled
and so you might have a node

3694
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
and so you might have a node
 

3695
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,190
and so you might have a node
with like one person that represents one

3696
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
with like one person that represents one
 

3697
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,870
with like one person that represents one
person and

3698
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880

 

3699
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,390

let's say a um a husband link

3700
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
let's say a um a husband link
 

3701
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,109
let's say a um a husband link
that then points to that person's

3702
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
that then points to that person's
 

3703
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,430
that then points to that person's
husband and so there'd be then another

3704
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
husband and so there'd be then another
 

3705
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,750
husband and so there'd be then another
link that went from that person labeled

3706
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:51,760
link that went from that person labeled
 

3707
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,630
link that went from that person labeled
wife that went back to the um first node

3708
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
wife that went back to the um first node
 

3709
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,470
wife that went back to the um first node
and so on so

3710
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
and so on so
 

3711
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,990
and so on so
having having this kind of

3712
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,000
having having this kind of
 

3713
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,990
having having this kind of
representation is really good if you

3714
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,000
representation is really good if you
 

3715
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,710
representation is really good if you
want to represent

3716
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:02,720
want to represent
 

3717
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,470
want to represent
binary relations

3718
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480

 

3719
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,589

essentially relations between two things

3720
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
essentially relations between two things
 

3721
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,710
essentially relations between two things
and if you so if you have um

3722
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
and if you so if you have um
 

3723
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,589
and if you so if you have um
equivalent of like three word sentences

3724
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:15,599
equivalent of like three word sentences
 

3725
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,590
equivalent of like three word sentences
um you know like uh

3726
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:17,600
um you know like uh
 

3727
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,070
um you know like uh
fred's wife is wilma

3728
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,080
fred's wife is wilma
 

3729
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,910
fred's wife is wilma
or something like that you can represent

3730
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:21,920
or something like that you can represent
 

3731
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,550
or something like that you can represent
that very nicely using

3732
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,560
that very nicely using
 

3733
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,470
that very nicely using
these kinds of

3734
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
these kinds of
 

3735
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,709
these kinds of
graph structures or using something like

3736
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719
graph structures or using something like
 

3737
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,789
graph structures or using something like
the semantic web and

3738
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
the semantic web and
 

3739
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,789
the semantic web and
and so on but the

3740
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:32,799
and so on but the
 

3741
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,470
and so on but the
the problem is that

3742
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480

 

3743
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,550

very often what you want to be able to

3744
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:38,560
very often what you want to be able to
 

3745
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,709
very often what you want to be able to
express

3746
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:40,719
express
 

3747
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,590
express
takes a lot more than three words and a

3748
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
takes a lot more than three words and a
 

3749
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,669
takes a lot more than three words and a
lot more than simple

3750
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
lot more than simple
 

3751
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,309
lot more than simple
graph structures like that to represent

3752
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:48,319
graph structures like that to represent
 

3753
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,110
graph structures like that to represent
so for instance um

3754
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
so for instance um
 

3755
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,390
so for instance um
if you've

3756
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,400
if you've
 

3757
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,590

01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
could say to you something like
 

3761
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,630
could say to you something like
uh remember when juliet drank the potion

and you could basically understand what

3778
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
and you could basically understand what
 

3779
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,950
and you could basically understand what
i'm saying you could understand the

3780
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
i'm saying you could understand the
 

3781
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,630
i'm saying you could understand the
question you could probably remember the

3782
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:18,640
question you could probably remember the
 

3783
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,309
question you could probably remember the
answer was well she thought that

3784
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
answer was well she thought that
 

3785
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,470
answer was well she thought that
this friar would have gotten a message

3786
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480
this friar would have gotten a message
 

3787
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,470
this friar would have gotten a message
to romeo saying that she was going to do

3788
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
to romeo saying that she was going to do
 

3789
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,149
to romeo saying that she was going to do
this but the friar didn't and so so

3790
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
this but the friar didn't and so so
 

3791
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,510
this but the friar didn't and so so
you're able to represent and reason with

what the semantic web can represent and
 

3805
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,390
what the semantic web can represent and
really what knowledge graphs can

really what knowledge graphs can
 

3807
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,149
really what knowledge graphs can
represent if you could step back for a

at that at that level so so we should

3826
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800
at that at that level so so we should
 

3827
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,510
at that at that level so so we should
say like what is the semantic web i mean

3828
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,520
say like what is the semantic web i mean
 

3829
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,310
say like what is the semantic web i mean
you could say a lot of things but it

3830
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
you could say a lot of things but it
 

3831
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,990
you could say a lot of things but it
might not be obvious to a lot of people

when they do a google search
 

3835

that just like you said while there
 

3837
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,510

might be something that's called a

3891
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,750
anecdote
uh and then i'll answer your question

3892
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
uh and then i'll answer your question
 

3893
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,350
uh and then i'll answer your question
so there's a search engine you've

3894
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
so there's a search engine you've
 

3895
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,030
so there's a search engine you've
probably never heard of called northern

3896
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,040
probably never heard of called northern
 

3897
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,149
probably never heard of called northern

3898
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
light
 

3899
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,470
light
and um

3900
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
and um
 

3901
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,910
and um
it went out of business but the way it

3902
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
it went out of business but the way it
 

3903
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,310
it went out of business but the way it
worked it was a kind of vampiric

3904
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
worked it was a kind of vampiric
 

3905
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,630
worked it was a kind of vampiric
search engine and what it did was um it

3906
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
search engine and what it did was um it
 

3907
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,030
search engine and what it did was um it
didn't index

3908
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
didn't index
 

3909
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,870
didn't index
the internet at all

3910
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880
the internet at all
 

3911
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,790
the internet at all
all it did was it

3912
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
all it did was it
 

3913
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,350
all it did was it
negotiated and got access to

3914
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
negotiated and got access to
 

3915
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,390
negotiated and got access to
data

3916
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
data
 

3917
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,189
data
from the big search engine companies

3918
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
from the big search engine companies
 

3919
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:53,030
from the big search engine companies
about what query was typed in

3920
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:53,040
about what query was typed in
 

3921
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,709
about what query was typed in
and where the user ended up

3922
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
and where the user ended up
 

3923
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,430
and where the user ended up
being happy and actually um then you

3924
01:11:59,430 --> 01:11:59,440
being happy and actually um then you
 

3925
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,030
being happy and actually um then you
know they type in a completely different

3926
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040
know they type in a completely different
 

3927
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,350
know they type in a completely different
query unrelated query and so on so it

3928
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
query unrelated query and so on so it
 

3929
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,070
query unrelated query and so on so it
just went from query to

3930
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,080
just went from query to
 

3931
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,390
just went from query to
the web page that seemed to satisfy them

3932
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
the web page that seemed to satisfy them
 

3933
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,830
the web page that seemed to satisfy them
eventually

3934
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:11,840
eventually
 

3935
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,149
eventually
and that's all so it had actual no

3936
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
and that's all so it had actual no
 

3937
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,630
and that's all so it had actual no
understanding of what was being typed in

3938
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:16,640
understanding of what was being typed in
 

3939
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,709
understanding of what was being typed in
it had no statistical data other than

3940
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
it had no statistical data other than
 

3941
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,310
it had no statistical data other than
what i just mentioned and it did a

3942
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:20,320
what i just mentioned and it did a
 

3943
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,110
what i just mentioned and it did a
fantastic job it did such a good job

3944
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
fantastic job it did such a good job
 

3945
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,790
fantastic job it did such a good job
that the big search engine company said

3946
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
that the big search engine company said
 

3947
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,310
that the big search engine company said
oh we're not going to sell you this data

3948
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
oh we're not going to sell you this data
 

3949
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,310
oh we're not going to sell you this data
anymore so then it went out of business

3950
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
anymore so then it went out of business
 

3951
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,390
anymore so then it went out of business
because it had no other way of

3952
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:30,400
because it had no other way of
 

3953
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,070
because it had no other way of
taking users to where they would want to

3954
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
taking users to where they would want to
 

3955
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,229
taking users to where they would want to
go and so on and of course the search

3956
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
go and so on and of course the search
 

3957
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,350
go and so on and of course the search
engines

3958
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
engines
 

3959
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,149
engines
are now using that kind of idea yes

3960
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
are now using that kind of idea yes
 

3961
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,310
are now using that kind of idea yes
so um let's go back to what you said

3962
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:40,320
so um let's go back to what you said
 

3963
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,270
so um let's go back to what you said
about the semantic web so the dream tim

3964
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
about the semantic web so the dream tim
 

3965
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,229
about the semantic web so the dream tim
berners-lee and others

3966
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
berners-lee and others
 

3967
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,149
berners-lee and others
dream about the semantic web at a

3968
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
dream about the semantic web at a
 

3969
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,390
dream about the semantic web at a
general level

3970
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
general level
 

3971
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,630
general level
is of course

3972
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:52,640
is of course
 

3973
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,350
is of course
exciting and powerful and in a sense the

3974
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
exciting and powerful and in a sense the
 

3975
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,229
exciting and powerful and in a sense the
right

3976
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
right
 

3977
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,790
right
dream to have which is to

3978
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:58,800
dream to have which is to
 

3979
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,550
dream to have which is to
replace the

3980
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
replace the
 

3981
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,830
replace the
the kind of

3982
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:02,840
the kind of
 

3983
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,390
the kind of
um

3984
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
um
 

3985
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,350
um
statistically

3986
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,360

 

3987
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,990

statistically mapped

3988
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
statistically mapped
 

3989
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,189
statistically mapped
linkages

3990
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
linkages
 

3991
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,790
linkages
on the internet

3992
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:12,800
on the internet
 

3993
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,790
on the internet
into something that's more meaningful

3994
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
into something that's more meaningful
 

3995
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,030
into something that's more meaningful
and semantic and actually gets at the

3996
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
and semantic and actually gets at the
 

3997
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,229
and semantic and actually gets at the
understanding of the content and so on

3998
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:20,239
understanding of the content and so on
 

3999
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,910
understanding of the content and so on
and

4000
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
and
 

4001
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,390
and
eventually if you say well how can we do

4002
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:24,400
eventually if you say well how can we do
 

4003
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,750
eventually if you say well how can we do
that

4004
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:25,760
that
 

4005
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,270
that
there's um

4006
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:27,280
there's um
 

4007
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,669
there's um
sort of a low road which is what the

4008
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
sort of a low road which is what the
 

4009
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,630
sort of a low road which is what the
knowledge graphs are doing and and so on

4010
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
knowledge graphs are doing and and so on
 

4011
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,110
knowledge graphs are doing and and so on
which is to say well if we just use

4012
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
which is to say well if we just use
 

4013
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,669
which is to say well if we just use
these simple binary relations we can

4014
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:37,679
these simple binary relations we can
 

4015
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,830
these simple binary relations we can
actually get some fraction of the way

4016
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
actually get some fraction of the way
 

4017
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,550
actually get some fraction of the way
toward understanding um and do something

4018
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:42,560
toward understanding um and do something
 

4019
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,189
toward understanding um and do something
where you know in the in the land of the

4020
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
where you know in the in the land of the
 

4021
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,149
where you know in the in the land of the
the blind the one-eyed man is king

4022
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
the blind the one-eyed man is king
 

4023
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,550
the blind the one-eyed man is king
kind of thing and so being able to even

4024
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
kind of thing and so being able to even
 

4025
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,229
kind of thing and so being able to even
just have a toe in the water in the

4026
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:52,239
just have a toe in the water in the
 

4027
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,310
just have a toe in the water in the
right direction is fantastically

4028
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,320
right direction is fantastically
 

4029
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,790
right direction is fantastically
powerful um and so that's where a lot of

4030
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
powerful um and so that's where a lot of
 

4031
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,110
powerful um and so that's where a lot of
people stop um but then you could say

4032
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
people stop um but then you could say
 

4033
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,390
people stop um but then you could say
well what if we really wanted to

4034
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
well what if we really wanted to
 

4035
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,590
well what if we really wanted to
represent

4036
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
represent
 

4037
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,189
represent
um and reason with um the full meaning

4038
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
um and reason with um the full meaning
 

4039
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,270
um and reason with um the full meaning
of what's there for instance

4040
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,280
of what's there for instance
 

4041
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,390
of what's there for instance
about um romeo and juliet

4042
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,400
about um romeo and juliet
 

4043
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,229
about um romeo and juliet
with reasoning about what juliet

4044
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239
with reasoning about what juliet
 

4045
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,910
with reasoning about what juliet
believes that romeo will believe that

4046
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
believes that romeo will believe that
 

4047
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,390
believes that romeo will believe that
juliet believed you know and so on or if

4048
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
juliet believed you know and so on or if
 

4049
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,030
juliet believed you know and so on or if
you look at on the news what um you know

4050
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
you look at on the news what um you know
 

4051
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,510
you look at on the news what um you know
president biden believed that

4052
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520

language this higher order logic so

4096
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
language this higher order logic so
 

4097
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,630
language this higher order logic so
first we were led to first order logic

4098
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
first we were led to first order logic
 

4099
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,830
first we were led to first order logic
and then second order and then

4100
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
and then second order and then
 

4101
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,750
and then second order and then
eventually higher order so you can

4102
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
eventually higher order so you can
 

4103
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,390
eventually higher order so you can
represent things like modals like

4104
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
represent things like modals like
 

4105
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,189
represent things like modals like

01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
you can represent
 

4113
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,030
you can represent

4115
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,430
the process you're going through in
trying to answer the question so you can

4116
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
trying to answer the question so you can
 

4117
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,110
trying to answer the question so you can
say things like

4118
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
say things like
 

4119
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,870

oh yeah if you're trying to do this

4120
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
oh yeah if you're trying to do this
 

4121
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,470
oh yeah if you're trying to do this
problem by integration by parts

4122
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:44,480
problem by integration by parts
 

4123
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,430
problem by integration by parts
and

4124
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
and
 

4125
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,350
and
you recursively get a problem that's

4126
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
you recursively get a problem that's
 

4127
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,590
you recursively get a problem that's
solved by integration by parts that's

4128
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
solved by integration by parts that's
 

4129
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,590
solved by integration by parts that's
actually okay but if that happens a

4130
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
actually okay but if that happens a
 

4131
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,390
actually okay but if that happens a
third time you're probably off on a wild

4132
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
third time you're probably off on a wild
 

4133
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,550
third time you're probably off on a wild
goose chase or something like that so

4134
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
goose chase or something like that so
 

4135
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,470
goose chase or something like that so
being able to talk about the problem

4136
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
being able to talk about the problem
 

4137
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,390
being able to talk about the problem
solving process as you're going through

4138
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
solving process as you're going through
 

4139
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,470
solving process as you're going through
the problem solving process um it's

4140
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
the problem solving process um it's
 

4141
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,550
the problem solving process um it's
called reflection and so um that's

4142
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
called reflection and so um that's
 

4143
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,790
called reflection and so um that's
another so it's important to be able to

4144
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:06,800
another so it's important to be able to
 

4145
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,550
another so it's important to be able to
represent that exactly you need to be

4146
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,560
represent that exactly you need to be
 

4147
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,510
represent that exactly you need to be
able to represent all of these things um

4148
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
able to represent all of these things um
 

4149
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,750
able to represent all of these things um
because in fact people do represent them

4150
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
because in fact people do represent them
 

4151
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,669
because in fact people do represent them
they do talk about them they do try and

4152
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:15,679
they do talk about them they do try and
 

4153
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,350
they do talk about them they do try and
teach them to other people you do have

4154
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,360
teach them to other people you do have
 

4155
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,910
teach them to other people you do have
rules of thumb that key off of them and

4156
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:19,920
rules of thumb that key off of them and
 

4157
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,310
rules of thumb that key off of them and
so on if you can't represent it um then

4158
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
so on if you can't represent it um then
 

4159
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,910
so on if you can't represent it um then
it's sort of like someone with a limited

4160
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
it's sort of like someone with a limited
 

4161
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,070
it's sort of like someone with a limited
vocabulary who can't understand as

4162
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:26,080
vocabulary who can't understand as
 

4163
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,110
vocabulary who can't understand as
easily

4164
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
easily
 

4165
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,950
easily
what you're trying to to tell them and

4166
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:28,960
what you're trying to to tell them and
 

4167
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,350
what you're trying to to tell them and
so that's that's really why i think that

4168
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
so that's that's really why i think that
 

4169
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,070
so that's that's really why i think that
the

4170
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,080
the
 

4171
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,550

the general dream the original dream of

4172
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
the general dream the original dream of
 

4173
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,470
the general dream the original dream of
semantic web is exactly right on um but

4174
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
semantic web is exactly right on um but
 

4175
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,030
semantic web is exactly right on um but
the implementations that we've seen

4176
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,040
the implementations that we've seen
 

4177
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,149
the implementations that we've seen
um are sort of these toe in a wa in the

4178
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
um are sort of these toe in a wa in the
 

4179
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,270
um are sort of these toe in a wa in the

4180
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280

01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
little tiny baby steps in the right
 

4183
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,830
little tiny baby steps in the right
direction you should just dive in

4184
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
direction you should just dive in
 

4185
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,790

01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
and
 

4187
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,030
and
and you know if if no one else is diving

4188
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
and you know if if no one else is diving
 

4189
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,430
and you know if if no one else is diving
in then yes taking a baby step in the

01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
in then yes taking a baby step in the
 

4191
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,510
in then yes taking a baby step in the
right direction is better than nothing

4192
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:57,520
right direction is better than nothing
 

4193
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,990
right direction is better than nothing
but it's not going to be sufficient to

but it's not going to be sufficient to
 

4195
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,270
but it's not going to be sufficient to
actually get you the um the realization

4196
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
actually get you the um the realization
 

4197
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,110
actually get you the um the realization
of the semantic web dream which is what

then a system will be able to
mechanically reason

mechanically reason
 

4375
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,390
mechanically reason

offering and so if it understands that

4382
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
offering and so if it understands that
 

4383
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,669

there's a free day in geneva

4384
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
there's a free day in geneva
 

4385

switzerland
 

4387
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,510
switzerland
then

4388
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
then
 

4389
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,229
then
if the person coming in happens to let's

4390
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
if the person coming in happens to let's
 

4391
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,110
if the person coming in happens to let's
say

4392
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
say
 

4393
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,910
say
be a nurse or something like that

01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:47,920
be a nurse or something like that
 

4395
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,910
be a nurse or something like that
then even though you didn't mention it

4396
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920
then even though you didn't mention it
 

4397
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,990
then even though you didn't mention it
if it can look up the fact that that's

4398
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
if it can look up the fact that that's
 

4399
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,310
if it can look up the fact that that's
where the international red cross museum

4400
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
where the international red cross museum
 

4401
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,790
where the international red cross museum
is and so on what that means and so on

4402
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
is and so on what that means and so on
 

4403
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,870
is and so on what that means and so on
then it can basically say hey you might

4404
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
then it can basically say hey you might
 

4405
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,430
then it can basically say hey you might
be interested in this trip because while

4406
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
be interested in this trip because while
 

4407
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,110
be interested in this trip because while
you have a free day in geneva you might

4408
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
you have a free day in geneva you might
 

4409
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,229
you have a free day in geneva you might
want to visit that red cross museum and

01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,120
now
 

4413
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,590
now
even though it's not very deep reasoning

4414
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
even though it's not very deep reasoning
 

4415
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,590
even though it's not very deep reasoning
little tiny factors like that may very

4416
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
little tiny factors like that may very
 

4417
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,669
little tiny factors like that may very

interface the design of the interface
 

4433
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,430
interface the design of the interface
makes a huge difference

4434
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:29,440

4501
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,510

in our lives

4502
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
in our lives
 

4503
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,030
in our lives
is that we thought we understood

4504
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
is that we thought we understood
 

4505
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,070
is that we thought we understood
something

4506
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
something
 

4507
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,830
something
but then we found we really only

4508
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:49,840
but then we found we really only
 

4509
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,070
but then we found we really only
understood it when we had to teach it or

4510
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,080
understood it when we had to teach it or
 

4511
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,149
understood it when we had to teach it or
explain it to someone or help our child

4512
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
explain it to someone or help our child
 

4513

01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
like that
 

4517
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,189
like that
despite the universality of that kind of

4518
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
despite the universality of that kind of
 

4519
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,590
despite the universality of that kind of
experience if you look at educational

4520
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
experience if you look at educational
 

4521
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,270
experience if you look at educational
software today

4522
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
software today
 

4523
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,830
software today
almost all of it has the computer

4524
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:07,840
almost all of it has the computer
 

4525
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,390
almost all of it has the computer
playing the role of the teacher

4526
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,400
playing the role of the teacher
 

4527
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,470
playing the role of the teacher
and the student plays the role of the

4528
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
and the student plays the role of the
 

4529
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,910
and the student plays the role of the
student

4530
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:13,920
student
 

4531
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,229
student
but as i just mentioned

4532
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:16,239
but as i just mentioned
 

4533
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,830
but as i just mentioned
you can get a lot of learning to happen

4534
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:19,840
you can get a lot of learning to happen
 

4535
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,950
you can get a lot of learning to happen
better and as you said more enjoyably if

4536
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
better and as you said more enjoyably if
 

4537
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,430
better and as you said more enjoyably if
you are the mentor or the teacher and so

4538
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:25,440
you are the mentor or the teacher and so
 

4539
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,830
you are the mentor or the teacher and so
on so we developed a program called math

4540
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
on so we developed a program called math
 

4541
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,709
on so we developed a program called math
craft to help sixth graders better

4542
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:30,719
craft to help sixth graders better
 

4543
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,830
craft to help sixth graders better
understand math

4544
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:33,840
understand math
 

4545
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,709
understand math
it doesn't actually try to teach you the

anything what it does is it casts you in

4550
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
anything what it does is it casts you in
 

4551
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,950
anything what it does is it casts you in
the role of

4552
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
the role of
 

4553
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,669
the role of
a student essentially who has classmates

4554
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
a student essentially who has classmates
 

4555
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,070
a student essentially who has classmates
who are having trouble and your job is

4556
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,080
who are having trouble and your job is
 

4557
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,310
who are having trouble and your job is
to watch them as they struggle with some

4558
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
to watch them as they struggle with some
 

4559
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,550
to watch them as they struggle with some
math problem watch what they're doing

4560
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:54,560
math problem watch what they're doing
 

4561
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,030
math problem watch what they're doing
and try to give them good advice to get

4562
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
and try to give them good advice to get
 

4563
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,790
and try to give them good advice to get
them to understand what they're doing

4564
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
them to understand what they're doing
 

4565
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,709
them to understand what they're doing
wrong and so on

4566
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
wrong and so on
 

4567
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:01,830
wrong and so on
and

4568
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
and
 

4569
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,669
and
the trick from the point of view of

4570
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
the trick from the point of view of
 

4571
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,629
the trick from the point of view of
psych is it has to make mistakes it has

4572
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:06,639
psych is it has to make mistakes it has
 

4573
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,390
psych is it has to make mistakes it has
to play the role of the student who

4574
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,400
to play the role of the student who
 

4575
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,149
to play the role of the student who
makes mistakes but it has to pick

4576
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
makes mistakes but it has to pick
 

4577
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,110
makes mistakes but it has to pick
mistakes which are just at the fringe of

4578
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
mistakes which are just at the fringe of
 

4579
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,510
mistakes which are just at the fringe of
what you actually understand and don't

4580
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
what you actually understand and don't
 

4581
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,350
what you actually understand and don't
understand and so on so it pulls you

4582
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
understand and so on so it pulls you
 

4583
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,350
understand and so on so it pulls you
into a deeper and deeper level of

4584
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
into a deeper and deeper level of
 

4585
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,990
into a deeper and deeper level of
understanding of the subject and so if

4586
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
understanding of the subject and so if
 

4587
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,629
understanding of the subject and so if
you give it good advice about what it

4588
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
you give it good advice about what it
 

4589
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,229
you give it good advice about what it
should have done instead of what it did

4590
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
should have done instead of what it did
 

4591
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,350
should have done instead of what it did
and so on

4592
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
and so on
 

4593
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,390
and so on
then

4594
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:30,400
then
 

4595
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,270
then
psych knows that you now understand that

4596
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
psych knows that you now understand that
 

4597
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,790
psych knows that you now understand that
mistake you won't make that kind of

4598
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
mistake you won't make that kind of
 

4599
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,950
mistake you won't make that kind of
mistake yourself as much anymore so

4600
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
mistake yourself as much anymore so
 

4601
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,870
mistake yourself as much anymore so
psych stops making that mistake because

4602
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
psych stops making that mistake because
 

4603
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,990
psych stops making that mistake because
there's no pedagogical usefulness to it

4604
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
there's no pedagogical usefulness to it
 

4605
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,149
there's no pedagogical usefulness to it
so from your point of view as the player

4606
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:44,159
so from your point of view as the player
 

4607
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,310
so from your point of view as the player
you feel like you've taught it something

4608
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,320
you feel like you've taught it something
 

4609
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,910
you feel like you've taught it something
because it used to make this mistake and

4610
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
because it used to make this mistake and
 

4611
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,910
because it used to make this mistake and
now it doesn't and so on so this

4612
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
now it doesn't and so on so this
 

4613
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,470
now it doesn't and so on so this
tremendous um reinforcement and

4614
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,480
tremendous um reinforcement and
 

4615
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,189
tremendous um reinforcement and
engagement um because of that and so on

4616
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:55,199
engagement um because of that and so on
 

4617
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,510
engagement um because of that and so on
so having a system that plays the role

4618
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
so having a system that plays the role
 

4619
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,790
so having a system that plays the role
of

4620
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
of
 

4621
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,990
of
a student and having the player play the

4622
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,000
a student and having the player play the
 

4623
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,189
a student and having the player play the
role of the mentor is enormously

4624
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
role of the mentor is enormously
 

4625
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:06,229
role of the mentor is enormously
powerful

4626
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:06,239
powerful
 

4627
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,149
powerful
type of

4628
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
type of
 

4629
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,950
type of
metaphor just important

4630
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
metaphor just important
 

4631
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,510
metaphor just important
way of having this sort of interface

4632
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520
way of having this sort of interface
 

4633
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,709
way of having this sort of interface
designed in a way which will facilitate

4634
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
designed in a way which will facilitate
 

4635
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,350
designed in a way which will facilitate
exactly the kind of learning by teaching

4636
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
exactly the kind of learning by teaching
 

4637
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,709
exactly the kind of learning by teaching
that

4638
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:22,719
that
 

4639
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:25,910
that
that goes on all the time in our lives

4640
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:25,920
that goes on all the time in our lives
 

4641
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,990
that goes on all the time in our lives
and yet which is not reflected anywhere

4642
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,000
and yet which is not reflected anywhere
 

4643
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,189
and yet which is not reflected anywhere
almost in a modern education system it

4644
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:31,199
almost in a modern education system it
 

4645
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,709
almost in a modern education system it
was reflected in the education system

4646
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:34,719
was reflected in the education system
 

4647
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,310
was reflected in the education system
that existed in europe in the 17 and

4648
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
that existed in europe in the 17 and
 

4649
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,990
that existed in europe in the 17 and
1800s monitorial and lancastrian

4650
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
1800s monitorial and lancastrian
 

4651
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,550
1800s monitorial and lancastrian
education systems it occurred in the

4652
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
education systems it occurred in the
 

4653
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,189
education systems it occurred in the
one-room schoolhouse in the american

4654
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
one-room schoolhouse in the american
 

4655
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,149
one-room schoolhouse in the american
west

4656
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:48,159
west
 

4657
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:52,229
west
in the 1800s and so on where you had one

4658
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239
in the 1800s and so on where you had one
 

4659
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,550
in the 1800s and so on where you had one
school room with one teacher and it was

4660
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:54,560
school room with one teacher and it was
 

4661
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,030
school room with one teacher and it was
basically you know five-year-olds to 18

4662
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,040
basically you know five-year-olds to 18
 

4663
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,149
basically you know five-year-olds to 18
year olds

4664
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
year olds
 

4665
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,070
year olds
who were students and so while the

4666
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
who were students and so while the
 

4667
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,910
who were students and so while the
teacher was doing something

4668
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
teacher was doing something
 

4669
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,149
teacher was doing something
half the half of the students would have

4670
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
half the half of the students would have
 

4671
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,310
half the half of the students would have
to be mentoring the younger kids

4672
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
to be mentoring the younger kids
 

4673
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,070
to be mentoring the younger kids
and so on and that turned out to of

4674
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,080
and so on and that turned out to of
 

4675
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,910
and so on and that turned out to of
course

4676
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:11,920
course
 

4677
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,110
course
with scaling up of education

4678
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
with scaling up of education
 

4679
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,830
with scaling up of education
that all went away and that incredibly

4680
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
that all went away and that incredibly
 

4681
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,629
that all went away and that incredibly
powerful experience just went away from

4682
01:26:20,629 --> 01:26:20,639
powerful experience just went away from
 

4683
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,110
powerful experience just went away from
the whole education

4684
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,120
the whole education
 

4685
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,149

you know it's not it's not like a
 

4747
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,510
you know it's not it's not like a
it's not like a singer who has to keep

4748
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
it's not like a singer who has to keep
 

4749

you know it's not like bruce springsteen
 

4751
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,149
you know it's not like bruce springsteen
having to to sing his greatest hits over

4752
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
having to to sing his greatest hits over

having to to sing his greatest hits over
and over again at different concerts

4754
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
and over again at different concerts
 

4755
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,470
and over again at different concerts
it's more like

4756
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:48,480
it's more like
 

4757
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,950
it's more like
a painter creating

4758
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:50,960
a painter creating
 

4759
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,669
a painter creating
a work of art once and then

4760
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:53,679
a work of art once and then
 

4761
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:55,830
a work of art once and then
that's enough it doesn't have to be

4762
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
that's enough it doesn't have to be
 

4763
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,750
that's enough it doesn't have to be
created again and so i really get the

4764
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:57,760
created again and so i really get the
 

4765
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,030
created again and so i really get the
sense of

4766
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
sense of
 

4767
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,030
sense of
we're telling the system

4768
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
we're telling the system
 

4769
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,390
we're telling the system
things that

4770
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400
things that
 

4771
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,390
things that
it's useful for it to know it's useful

4772
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:04,400
it's useful for it to know it's useful
 

4773
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,669
it's useful for it to know it's useful
for a computer to know for an ai to know

4774
01:28:07,669 --> 01:28:07,679
for a computer to know for an ai to know
 

4775
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,910
for a computer to know for an ai to know
and if we do our jobs right when we do

4776
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
and if we do our jobs right when we do
 

4777

no one will ever have to do this again
for this particular piece of knowledge

4782
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:16,960
for this particular piece of knowledge
 

4783
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,189
for this particular piece of knowledge
it's very very exciting

4803
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,950
number of children and a lot of parents
get to experience that joy of teaching

4804
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:38,960
get to experience that joy of teaching
 

4805

01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
with ai systems
 

4809
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,830
with ai systems
you know

4810
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
you know
 

4811
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,790

uh
 

4813
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,790
uh
they at least the current constructions

4814
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
they at least the current constructions
 

4815
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,870
they at least the current constructions
they remember

4816
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
they remember
 

4817
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,629

you know you don't get to experience the
 

4819
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,830
you know you don't get to experience the
joy of teaching um a machine millions of

4820
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:53,840
joy of teaching um a machine millions of
 

4821
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,669
joy of teaching um a machine millions of
times better come work for us before

4822
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
times better come work for us before
 

4823
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,030
times better come work for us before
it's too late then exactly that's a good

4824
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,040
it's too late then exactly that's a good
 

4825
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,750
it's too late then exactly that's a good
that's a good hiring pitch yeah

4826
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:01,760
that's a good hiring pitch yeah
 

4827
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,709
that's a good hiring pitch yeah
um yeah it's true but then there's also

4828
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:04,719
um yeah it's true but then there's also
 

4829
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,310
um yeah it's true but then there's also
you know

4830

you know
 

4831
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,229
you know
it's a project that continues forever in

4832
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:08,239
it's a project that continues forever in
 

4833
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:10,629
it's a project that continues forever in
some sense just like wikipedia yes you

4834
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
some sense just like wikipedia yes you
 

4835
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,590
some sense just like wikipedia yes you
get to a stable base of knowledge but

4836
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,600
get to a stable base of knowledge but
 

4837
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,550
get to a stable base of knowledge but
knowledge grows knowledge evolves

4838
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,560
knowledge grows knowledge evolves
 

4839
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,270
knowledge grows knowledge evolves
we learn as a

4840
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280
we learn as a
 

4841
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,830
we learn as a
you know as a human species

4842
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:21,840
you know as a human species
 

4843
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,430
you know as a human species
as science as an organism constantly

4844
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
as science as an organism constantly
 

4845
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,350
as science as an organism constantly
grows and evolves and changes and then

4846
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:29,360
grows and evolves and changes and then
 

4847
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,950
grows and evolves and changes and then
empower that with the tools of

4848
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
empower that with the tools of
 

4849
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,709
empower that with the tools of
artificial intelligence and that's going

4850
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:32,719
artificial intelligence and that's going
 

4851
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,790
artificial intelligence and that's going
to keep growing and growing and growing

4852
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
to keep growing and growing and growing
 

4853
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,910
to keep growing and growing and growing
and many of

4854
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:35,920
and many of
 

4855
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,709
and many of
the

4856

assertions that you held previously
 

4859
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,070
assertions that you held previously
uh may need to be significantly expanded

4860
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
uh may need to be significantly expanded
 

4861
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,990
uh may need to be significantly expanded
modified all those kinds of things so it

4862
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
modified all those kinds of things so it
 

4863
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,229
modified all those kinds of things so it
could be like a living organism versus

4864
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
could be like a living organism versus
 

4865
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,030
could be like a living organism versus
uh

4866
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,040
uh
 

4867
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,550
uh
the analogy i think we started this

4868
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:50,560
the analogy i think we started this
 

4869
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,070
the analogy i think we started this
conversation with which is like the

4870
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
conversation with which is like the
 

4871
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,149
conversation with which is like the
solid ground

4872
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:54,159
solid ground
 

4873
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,790
solid ground
the the other

4874
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:56,800
the the other
 

4875
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,070
the the other
beautiful

4876
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
beautiful
 

4877
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,629
beautiful
experience that we have with our system

4878
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:00,639
experience that we have with our system
 

4879
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:01,430
experience that we have with our system
is

4880
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,440
is
 

4881
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,229
is
when it asks clarifying questions

4882
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:04,239
when it asks clarifying questions
 

4883
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,189
when it asks clarifying questions
which

4884
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:05,199
which
 

4885
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:08,310
which
inadvertently turn out to be

4886
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,320
inadvertently turn out to be
 

4887
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,149
inadvertently turn out to be
emotional to us

4888
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
emotional to us
 

4889
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:10,870
emotional to us
so

4890
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:10,880
so
 

4891
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,550
so
at one point it knew that

4892
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
at one point it knew that
 

4893
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,910
at one point it knew that
these were the

4894
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:15,920
these were the
 

4895
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,790
these were the
named entities who were authorized to

4896
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
named entities who were authorized to
 

4897
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,669
named entities who were authorized to
make

4898
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
make
 

4899
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,390
make
changes to the knowledge base and so on

4900
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,400
changes to the knowledge base and so on
 

4901
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,310
changes to the knowledge base and so on
and it noticed that all of them were

4902
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:24,320
and it noticed that all of them were
 

4903
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,590
and it noticed that all of them were
people

4904
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:25,600
people
 

4905
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,030
people
except for it

4906
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,040
except for it
 

4907
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,350
except for it
because it was also allowed to and so it

4908
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,360
because it was also allowed to and so it
 

4909
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,990
because it was also allowed to and so it
said you know am i a person

4910
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
said you know am i a person
 

4911
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,950
said you know am i a person
and we had to like tell it very sadly

4912
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
and we had to like tell it very sadly
 

4913
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,629
and we had to like tell it very sadly
no

4914
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
no
 

4915
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,550
no
you're not so the moments like that

4916
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:38,560
you're not so the moments like that
 

4917
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,310
you're not so the moments like that
where it asks questions that are

4918
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,320
where it asks questions that are
 

4919
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,310
where it asks questions that are
unintentionally poignant

4920
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:42,320
unintentionally poignant
 

4921
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,430
unintentionally poignant
uh are

4922
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:43,440
uh are
 

4923
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,390
uh are
are worth treasuring ah that is powerful

4924
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:46,400
are worth treasuring ah that is powerful
 

4925
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,669
are worth treasuring ah that is powerful
that's such a powerful question

4926
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
that's such a powerful question
 

4927
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,229
that's such a powerful question
it has to do with basic

4928
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:52,239
it has to do with basic
 

4929
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,910
it has to do with basic
uh controller who can access the system

4930
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
uh controller who can access the system
 

4931
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,830
uh controller who can access the system
who can modify it

4932
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:55,840
who can modify it
 

4933
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,390
who can modify it
uh but that's when those questions

4934
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
uh but that's when those questions
 

4935
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,709
uh but that's when those questions
you know like what rights do i have as

4936
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:00,719
you know like what rights do i have as
 

4937
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,590
you know like what rights do i have as
this a system well that's another issue

4938
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:03,600
this a system well that's another issue
 

4939
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,390
this a system well that's another issue
which is there'll be a thin

4940
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
which is there'll be a thin
 

4941
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,709
which is there'll be a thin
envelope of time

4942
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
envelope of time
 

4943
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,229
envelope of time
between when we have general ais

4944
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
between when we have general ais
 

4945
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,910
between when we have general ais
and when

4946
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:13,920
and when
 

4947
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,750
and when
everyone realizes that they should have

4948
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
everyone realizes that they should have
 

4949
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,149
everyone realizes that they should have
basic human rights and freedoms and so

4950
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
basic human rights and freedoms and so
 

4951
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:21,270
basic human rights and freedoms and so
on

4952
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
on
 

4953
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,229
on
right now we don't think twice about

4954
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
right now we don't think twice about
 

4955
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,390
right now we don't think twice about
effectively enslaving

4956
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,400
effectively enslaving
 

4957
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,990
effectively enslaving
our email systems and our series and our

4958
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:30,000
our email systems and our series and our
 

4959
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,910
our email systems and our series and our
alexas and so on but

4960
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:31,920
alexas and so on but
 

4961
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,830
alexas and so on but
at some point

4962
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:33,840
at some point
 

4963
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,510
at some point
they'll

4964
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520
they'll
 

4965
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,390
they'll
be as deserving of freedom as

4966
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,400
be as deserving of freedom as
 

4967
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,189
be as deserving of freedom as
human beings are yeah i'm very much with

4968
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:43,199
human beings are yeah i'm very much with
 

4969
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,430
human beings are yeah i'm very much with
you but it does sound absurd and i i

4970
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,440
you but it does sound absurd and i i
 

4971
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,270
you but it does sound absurd and i i
happen to believe that it'll happen in

4972
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:47,280
happen to believe that it'll happen in
 

4973
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,030
happen to believe that it'll happen in
our lifetime that's why i think there'll

4974
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
our lifetime that's why i think there'll
 

4975
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,430
our lifetime that's why i think there'll
be a narrow envelope of time

4976
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
be a narrow envelope of time
 

4977
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,470
be a narrow envelope of time
when

4978
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:52,480
when
 

4979
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,189
when
we'll keep them as essentially

4980
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:57,199

 

4981
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,110

indentured servants

4982
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120
indentured servants
 

4983
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,470
indentured servants
um and after which we'll have to realize

4984
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
um and after which we'll have to realize
 

4985
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,350
um and after which we'll have to realize
that

4986
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
that
 

4987
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,030
that
they should have they should have

4988
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,040
they should have they should have
 

4989
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,430
they should have they should have
freedoms that other that we give that we

4990
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:07,440
freedoms that other that we give that we
 

4991
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,030
freedoms that other that we give that we
afford to other people

4992
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,040
afford to other people
 

4993
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,590
afford to other people
and all of that starts with a system

4994
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,600
and all of that starts with a system
 

4995
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,430
and all of that starts with a system
like psych raising a single question

4996
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:13,440
like psych raising a single question
 

4997
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,229
like psych raising a single question
about

4998
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:14,239
about
 

4999
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,229
about
who can modify stuff i think that's how

5000
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:16,239
who can modify stuff i think that's how
 

5001
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:20,310
who can modify stuff i think that's how
it starts yes that's um

5002
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
it starts yes that's um
 

5003
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,709
it starts yes that's um
that's the start of a revolution uh what

5004
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719
that's the start of a revolution uh what
 

5005
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:23,990
that's the start of a revolution uh what
about

5006
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
about
 

5007
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,830
about
are there stuff like uh love and uh

5008
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:27,840
are there stuff like uh love and uh
 

5009
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,750
are there stuff like uh love and uh
consciousness and all those kinds of

5010
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
consciousness and all those kinds of
 

5011
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,790
consciousness and all those kinds of
topics

5012
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:30,800
topics
 

5013
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,229
topics
do they come up in psych in the

5014
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:32,239
do they come up in psych in the
 

5015
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,870
do they come up in psych in the
knowledge base oh of course so an

5016
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
knowledge base oh of course so an
 

5017
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,750
knowledge base oh of course so an
important part of human knowledge in

5018
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:37,760
important part of human knowledge in
 

5019
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,590
important part of human knowledge in
fact it's difficult to understand human

5020
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
fact it's difficult to understand human
 

5021
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,350
fact it's difficult to understand human
behavior in human history without

5022
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
behavior in human history without
 

5023
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,030
behavior in human history without
understanding

5024
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,040
understanding
 

5025
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,149
understanding
human emotions and why people do things

5026

human emotions and why people do things

how
how emotions drive people to to do

5034
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
how emotions drive people to to do
 

5035
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,910
how emotions drive people to to do
things and

5036
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:53,920
things and
 

5037
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,070
things and
all of that is extremely important in

5038
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
all of that is extremely important in
 

5039
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,830
all of that is extremely important in
getting psych to understand things for

5040
01:32:59,830 --> 01:32:59,840
getting psych to understand things for
 

5041
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,790
getting psych to understand things for
example in coming up with scenarios

5042
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:02,800
example in coming up with scenarios
 

5043
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,350
example in coming up with scenarios
so one of the applications that psych

5044
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
so one of the applications that psych
 

5045
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,990
so one of the applications that psych
does one kind of application it does is

5046
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,000
does one kind of application it does is
 

5047
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,470
does one kind of application it does is
to generate plausible scenarios of what

5048
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:10,480
to generate plausible scenarios of what
 

5049
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,070
to generate plausible scenarios of what
might happen and what might happen based

5050
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,080
might happen and what might happen based
 

5051
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,590
might happen and what might happen based
on that and what might happen based on

5052
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
on that and what might happen based on
 

5053
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,510
on that and what might happen based on
that and so on so you generate this

5054
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:15,520
that and so on so you generate this
 

5055
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,470
that and so on so you generate this
ever-expanding sphere if you will of

5056
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:18,480
ever-expanding sphere if you will of
 

5057
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,510
ever-expanding sphere if you will of

in something that you do and why and how
 

5129
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,270
in something that you do and why and how
and so on so that was

01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
and so on so that was
 

5131
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,590
and so on so that was
always a very important part of the

5132
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
always a very important part of the
 

5133
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,830
always a very important part of the
knowledge that we had to represent

5134
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
knowledge that we had to represent
 

5135
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,070
knowledge that we had to represent
in the system so i talk a lot about love

5136
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
in the system so i talk a lot about love
 

5137
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,070
in the system so i talk a lot about love
so i gotta ask do you remember off the

so i gotta ask do you remember off the
 

5139
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,669
so i gotta ask do you remember off the
top of your head

various aspects of love that are useful
 

5149
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,950
various aspects of love that are useful
for understanding human nature and

01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:12,560
we try to tease apart
 

5159
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,550
we try to tease apart
concepts that

01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:14,560
concepts that

01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,870
concepts that
have enormous

5169
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,229
where you don't as it were you don't
need to tease them apart further so love

5170
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
need to tease them apart further so love
 

5171
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,990
need to tease them apart further so love
is too general of a term it's not

01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
they're interrelated and then each one
 

5197
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,390
they're interrelated and then each one
of them has idiosyncratic

5198
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
of them has idiosyncratic
 

5199
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,910
of them has idiosyncratic
things about it

5200
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:01,920
things about it
 

5201
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,310
things about it
and you don't have to deal with love to

5202
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
and you don't have to deal with love to
 

5203
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,270
and you don't have to deal with love to
get to that level of complexity even

5204
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,280
get to that level of complexity even
 

5205
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,830
get to that level of complexity even
something like in

5206
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
something like in
 

5207
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,149
something like in
x being in y meaning physically in y

5208
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
x being in y meaning physically in y
 

5209
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:17,350
x being in y meaning physically in y
we may have one english word in to

5210
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
we may have one english word in to
 

5211
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,990
we may have one english word in to
represent that but it's useful to tease

5212
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,000
represent that but it's useful to tease
 

5213
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,350
represent that but it's useful to tease
that apart

5214
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
that apart
 

5215
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,070
that apart
because the way that the

5216
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080
because the way that the
 

5217
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,070
because the way that the
the liquid is in the coffee cup is

5218
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,080
the liquid is in the coffee cup is
 

5219
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,830
the liquid is in the coffee cup is
different from the way that the air is

5220
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:27,840
different from the way that the air is
 

5221
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,189
different from the way that the air is
in the room which is different from the

5222
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
in the room which is different from the
 

5223
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,910
in the room which is different from the
way that i'm in my jacket

5224
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:31,920
way that i'm in my jacket
 

5225
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,109
way that i'm in my jacket
and so on and so they're questions like

5226
01:36:35,109 --> 01:36:35,119
and so on and so they're questions like
 

5227
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:37,750
and so on and so they're questions like
if i look at this coffee cup well i see

5228
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,760
if i look at this coffee cup well i see
 

5229
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,830
if i look at this coffee cup well i see
the liquid if i turn it upside down with

5230
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
the liquid if i turn it upside down with
 

5231
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,390
the liquid if i turn it upside down with
a liquid come out and so on

5232
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
a liquid come out and so on
 

5233
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,149
a liquid come out and so on
if i have say

5234
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
if i have say
 

5235
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,470
if i have say
coffee with sugar in it

5236
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:46,480
coffee with sugar in it
 

5237
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,310
coffee with sugar in it
if i do the same thing the sugar doesn't

5238
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
if i do the same thing the sugar doesn't
 

5239
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,229
if i do the same thing the sugar doesn't
come out right it stays in the liquid

5240
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
come out right it stays in the liquid
 

5241
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,070
come out right it stays in the liquid
because it's dissolved in the liquid and

5242
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
because it's dissolved in the liquid and
 

5243
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,470
because it's dissolved in the liquid and
so on so by now we have about 75

5244
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
so on so by now we have about 75
 

5245
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,870
so on so by now we have about 75
different kinds of in

5246
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:56,880
different kinds of in
 

5247
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,870
different kinds of in
in the system and it's important to

5248
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:58,880
in the system and it's important to
 

5249
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,030
in the system and it's important to
distinguish those so if you're reading

5250
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,040
distinguish those so if you're reading
 

5251
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,830
distinguish those so if you're reading
along an english

5252
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
along an english
 

5253
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,550
along an english
text and you see the word in

5254
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:08,560

 

5255
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,870

the writer of that was able to use this

5256
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
the writer of that was able to use this
 

5257
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,390
the writer of that was able to use this
one innocuous word because he or she was

5258
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:14,400
one innocuous word because he or she was
 

5259
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,149
one innocuous word because he or she was
able to assume that the reader had

5260
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
able to assume that the reader had
 

5261
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,870
able to assume that the reader had
enough common sense and world knowledge

5262
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
enough common sense and world knowledge
 

5263
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,910
enough common sense and world knowledge
to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds

5264
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds
 

5265
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,070
to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds
of in they actually meant and the same

5266
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,080
of in they actually meant and the same
 

5267
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,830
of in they actually meant and the same
thing with love you may see the word

5268
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
thing with love you may see the word
 

5269
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,950
thing with love you may see the word
love

5270
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,960
love
 

5271
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,950
love
but if i say you know i love ice cream

5272
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
but if i say you know i love ice cream
 

5273
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,189
but if i say you know i love ice cream
that's obviously different than if i say

5274
01:37:31,189 --> 01:37:31,199
that's obviously different than if i say
 

5275
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,390
that's obviously different than if i say
i love this person or i love to go

5276
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
i love this person or i love to go
 

5277
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,390
i love this person or i love to go
fishing or something like that so

5278
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400

 

5279
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,790

you have to be careful not to take

5280
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:40,800
you have to be careful not to take
 

5281
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,550
you have to be careful not to take
language

5282
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
language
 

5283
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,189
language
too seriously because

5284
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:45,199
too seriously because
 

5285
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,229
too seriously because
people have done a kind of parsimony a

5286
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
people have done a kind of parsimony a
 

5287
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,709
people have done a kind of parsimony a
kind of terseness where you have as few

5288
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
kind of terseness where you have as few
 

5289
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:52,629
kind of terseness where you have as few
words as as you

5290
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
words as as you
 

5291
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,270
words as as you
as you can because otherwise you'd need

5292
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:55,280
as you can because otherwise you'd need
 

5293
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,350
as you can because otherwise you'd need
half a million words in your language

5294
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
half a million words in your language
 

5295
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,830
half a million words in your language
which is a lot of words that's like 10

5296
01:37:59,830 --> 01:37:59,840
which is a lot of words that's like 10
 

5297
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,310
which is a lot of words that's like 10
times more than most languages really

5298
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,320
times more than most languages really
 

5299
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,030
times more than most languages really
make use of and so on just like we have

5300
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
make use of and so on just like we have
 

5301
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,270
make use of and so on just like we have
on the order of

5302
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:07,280
on the order of
 

5303
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,310
on the order of
about a million concepts in

5304
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320
about a million concepts in
 

5305
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,790
about a million concepts in
psych because we've had to tease apart

5306
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:12,800
psych because we've had to tease apart
 

5307
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,790
psych because we've had to tease apart
all these things and so when you look at

5308
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
all these things and so when you look at
 

5309
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,950
all these things and so when you look at
the name of a psych

5310
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
the name of a psych
 

5311
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,070
the name of a psych
term

5312
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:18,080
term
 

5313
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,229
term
most of the psych terms

5314
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
most of the psych terms
 

5315
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,629
most of the psych terms
actually have three or four english

5316
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
actually have three or four english
 

5317
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:25,189
actually have three or four english
words in a phrase which captures the

5318
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
words in a phrase which captures the
 

5319
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,030
words in a phrase which captures the
meaning of this

5320
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
meaning of this
 

5321
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,990
meaning of this
term

5322
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:28,000
term
 

5323
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,669
term
because you have to distinguish all

5324
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:29,679
because you have to distinguish all
 

5325
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,109
because you have to distinguish all
these types of love you have to

5326
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:31,119
these types of love you have to
 

5327
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,430
these types of love you have to
distinguish all these types of in

5328
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
distinguish all these types of in
 

5329
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,910
distinguish all these types of in
and there's not a single english word

5330
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:35,920
and there's not a single english word
 

5331
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,990
and there's not a single english word
which captures most of these things yeah

5332
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,000
which captures most of these things yeah
 

5333
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,870
which captures most of these things yeah
and

5334
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
and
 

5335
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,950
and
it seems like language

5336
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:40,960
it seems like language
 

5337
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,629
it seems like language
when used for communication between

5338
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:42,639
when used for communication between
 

5339
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:43,669
when used for communication between
humans

5340
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
humans
 

5341
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,990
humans
almost as a feature has some ambiguity

5342
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
almost as a feature has some ambiguity

01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:47,119
built in
 

5345
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,350
built in
it's not some it's not an accident

5346
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
it's not some it's not an accident
 

5347
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,430
it's not some it's not an accident
because like the human condition is a

5348
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:51,440
because like the human condition is a
 

5349
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,310
because like the human condition is a
giant mess and so it feels like

5350
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
giant mess and so it feels like
 

5351
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,270
giant mess and so it feels like
nobody wants two robots

5352
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,280
nobody wants two robots
 

5353
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,189
nobody wants two robots
like very precise formal logic

5354
01:38:59,189 --> 01:38:59,199
like very precise formal logic
 

5355
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,910
like very precise formal logic

got kicked off and
 

5503
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,950
got kicked off and
because computer time was enormously

5504
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:42,960
because computer time was enormously
 

5505
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,910
because computer time was enormously
expensive and so he wrote a program and

5506
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:45,920
expensive and so he wrote a program and
 

5507
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,629
expensive and so he wrote a program and
all it did was um it said you know give

5508
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:48,639
all it did was um it said you know give
 

5509
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,430
all it did was um it said you know give
me uh 30 seconds of cpu time and all it

5510
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:51,440
me uh 30 seconds of cpu time and all it
 

5511
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,910
me uh 30 seconds of cpu time and all it
did was it would wait like 20 seconds

5512
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
did was it would wait like 20 seconds
 

5513
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,430
did was it would wait like 20 seconds
and then it would print out on the

know company x for um some large amount
 

5841
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,310
know company x for um some large amount
of money when you have the opportunity

5842
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:54,320
of money when you have the opportunity
 

5843
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,390
of money when you have the opportunity
and so on and you know company x here

5844
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:56,400
and so on and you know company x here
 

5845
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,390
and so on and you know company x here
are like old companies maybe you've

5846
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:58,400
are like old companies maybe you've
 

5847
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,629
are like old companies maybe you've
never even heard of like lycos or

5848
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:00,639
never even heard of like lycos or
 

5849
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,350
never even heard of like lycos or
something like that so um

5850
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:03,360
something like that so um
 

5851
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,750
something like that so um
the the answer is that one reason we've

5852
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:05,760
the the answer is that one reason we've
 

5853
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,750
the the answer is that one reason we've
stayed a private

5854
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
stayed a private
 

5855
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,270
stayed a private
company we haven't gone public one

5856
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
company we haven't gone public one
 

5857
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,950
company we haven't gone public one
reason that we haven't

5858
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
reason that we haven't
 

5859
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,950
reason that we haven't
gone out of our way to take investment

5860
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:12,960
gone out of our way to take investment
 

5861
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,470
gone out of our way to take investment
dollars

5862
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
dollars
 

5863
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,070
dollars
is because we want to have control over

5864
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:18,080
is because we want to have control over
 

5865
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,830
is because we want to have control over
our future over our state of being so

5866
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:21,840
our future over our state of being so
 

5867
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,270
our future over our state of being so
that we can continue to do this as until

5868
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,280
that we can continue to do this as until
 

5869
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,990
that we can continue to do this as until
it's done and we're making progress and

5870
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
it's done and we're making progress and
 

5871
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,870
it's done and we're making progress and
we're now so close to done that almost

5872
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:30,880
we're now so close to done that almost
 

5873
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,550
we're now so close to done that almost
all of our work

5874
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:32,560
all of our work
 

5875
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,189
all of our work
is commercial applications of our

5876
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:35,199
is commercial applications of our
 

5877
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:38,310
is commercial applications of our
technology so five years ago almost all

5878
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:38,320
technology so five years ago almost all
 

5879
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,830
technology so five years ago almost all
of our money came from the government

5880
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
of our money came from the government
 

5881
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,310
of our money came from the government
now uh virtually none of it comes from

5882
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
now uh virtually none of it comes from
 

5883
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,990
now uh virtually none of it comes from
the government almost all of it is from

5884
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000
the government almost all of it is from
 

5885
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,149
the government almost all of it is from
companies that are actually using it for

5886
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
companies that are actually using it for
 

5887
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:48,629
companies that are actually using it for
something hospital chains using it for

5888
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:48,639
something hospital chains using it for
 

5889
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:51,189
something hospital chains using it for
medical reasoning about patients

5890
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
medical reasoning about patients
 

5891
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,149
medical reasoning about patients
and

5892
01:48:52,149 --> 01:48:52,159
and
 

5893
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,470
and
energy companies using it and

5894
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:54,480
energy companies using it and
 

5895
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,229
energy companies using it and
various other

5896
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:56,239
various other
 

5897
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,070
various other
manufacturers using it to reason about

5898
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
manufacturers using it to reason about
 

5899
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,950
manufacturers using it to reason about
supply chains and things like that

5900
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
supply chains and things like that
 

5901
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,070
supply chains and things like that
so

5902
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
so
 

5903
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,669
so
there's so many questions i want to ask

5904
01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:03,679
there's so many questions i want to ask
 

5905
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,750
there's so many questions i want to ask
so one of the ways that people can help

5906
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:05,760
so one of the ways that people can help
 

5907
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,669
so one of the ways that people can help
is by adding to the knowledge base and

5908
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
is by adding to the knowledge base and
 

5909
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:09,590
is by adding to the knowledge base and
that's really basically anybody if the

5910
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:09,600
that's really basically anybody if the
 

5911
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,189
that's really basically anybody if the
tooling is right

5912
01:49:11,189 --> 01:49:11,199
tooling is right
 

5913
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:12,709
tooling is right
and

5914
01:49:12,709 --> 01:49:12,719
and
 

5915
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,390
and
the other way i kind of want to ask you

5916
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
the other way i kind of want to ask you
 

5917
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,070
the other way i kind of want to ask you
about your thoughts on this so you've

5918
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
about your thoughts on this so you've
 

5919
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,550
about your thoughts on this so you've
had like you said in government and

5920
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:18,560
had like you said in government and
 

5921
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,750
had like you said in government and
um you have

5922
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:19,760
um you have
 

5923
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,070
um you have
big clients you had a lot of clients but

5924
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,080
big clients you had a lot of clients but
 

5925
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,990
big clients you had a lot of clients but
most of it is shrouded in secrecy

5926
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,000
most of it is shrouded in secrecy
 

5927
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,109
most of it is shrouded in secrecy
because of the nature of the

5928
01:49:25,109 --> 01:49:25,119
because of the nature of the
 

5929
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:27,109
because of the nature of the
relationship of the kind of things

5930
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
relationship of the kind of things
 

5931
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,790
relationship of the kind of things
you're helping them with

5932
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
you're helping them with
 

5933
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,430
you're helping them with
so that's one way to operate

5934
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
so that's one way to operate
 

5935
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,750
so that's one way to operate
and another way to operate is more in

5936
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
and another way to operate is more in
 

5937
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:34,870
and another way to operate is more in
the open

5938
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:34,880
the open
 

5939
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,830
the open
where it's more consumer facing

5940
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
where it's more consumer facing
 

5941
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:40,709
where it's more consumer facing
and so uh you know hence something like

5942
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:40,719
and so uh you know hence something like
 

5943
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:42,870
and so uh you know hence something like
open cycles born at some point where

5944
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:42,880
open cycles born at some point where
 

5945
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,189
open cycles born at some point where
there's no that that's a misconception

5946
01:49:45,189 --> 01:49:45,199
there's no that that's a misconception
 

5947
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:47,589
there's no that that's a misconception
oh oh well let's let's go there so what

5948
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:47,599
oh oh well let's let's go there so what
 

5949
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,669
oh oh well let's let's go there so what
all right uh what is open psych and how

5950
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
all right uh what is open psych and how
 

5951
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,229
all right uh what is open psych and how
was it born two things i want to say and

5952
01:49:52,229 --> 01:49:52,239
was it born two things i want to say and
 

5953
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,589
was it born two things i want to say and
i want to say each of them before the

5954
01:49:53,589 --> 01:49:53,599
i want to say each of them before the
 

5955
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:56,950
i want to say each of them before the
other so it's going to be difficult

5956
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:56,960
other so it's going to be difficult
 

5957
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,470
other so it's going to be difficult
but we'll come back to open psych in a

5958
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
but we'll come back to open psych in a
 

5959
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,790
but we'll come back to open psych in a
minute but one of the

5960
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
minute but one of the
 

5961
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,669
minute but one of the
terms of our contracts with all of our

and it will be
openly available to everyone who has

6000
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
openly available to everyone who has
 

6001
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,510
openly available to everyone who has
access to psych so that's an important

6002
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:49,520
access to psych so that's an important
 

6003
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,430
access to psych so that's an important
constraint that we never went back on

6004
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:51,440
constraint that we never went back on
 

6005
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,870
constraint that we never went back on
even when we

6006
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:52,880
even when we
 

6007
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,870
even when we
got pushback from companies which we

6008
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:54,880
got pushback from companies which we
 

6009
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,030
got pushback from companies which we
often did who wanted to claim that

6010
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
often did who wanted to claim that
 

6011
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,629
often did who wanted to claim that
almost everything they were telling us

6012
01:50:58,629 --> 01:50:58,639
almost everything they were telling us
 

6013
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,470
almost everything they were telling us
was proprietary

6014
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
was proprietary
 

6015
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,510
was proprietary
so

6016
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:01,520
so
 

6017
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,310
so
so there's a line between very domain

6018
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
so there's a line between very domain
 

6019
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,430
so there's a line between very domain
specific company specific stuff

6020
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:07,440
specific company specific stuff
 

6021
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,990
specific company specific stuff
and the general knowledge that comes

6022
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
and the general knowledge that comes
 

6023
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,950
and the general knowledge that comes
from that

6024
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:10,960
from that
 

6025
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,189
from that
yes or if you imagine say it's an oil

6026
01:51:13,189 --> 01:51:13,199
yes or if you imagine say it's an oil
 

6027
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,589
yes or if you imagine say it's an oil
company there are things which they

6028
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
company there are things which they
 

6029
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,870
company there are things which they
would expect

6030
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:16,880
would expect
 

6031
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,990
would expect
any new petroleum engineer they hired to

6032
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:20,000
any new petroleum engineer they hired to
 

6033
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,350
any new petroleum engineer they hired to
already know

6034
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,360
already know
 

6035
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,470
already know
and it's not okay for them to consider

6036
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:24,480
and it's not okay for them to consider
 

6037
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,390
and it's not okay for them to consider
that that is proprietary and there

6038
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,400
that that is proprietary and there
 

6039
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,390
that that is proprietary and there
sometimes the company will say well

6040
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:28,400
sometimes the company will say well
 

6041
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,149
sometimes the company will say well
we're the first ones to pay you to

6042
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:30,159
we're the first ones to pay you to
 

6043
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,910
we're the first ones to pay you to
represent that in psych

6044
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:31,920
represent that in psych
 

6045
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,589
represent that in psych
and our attitude is some polite form

6046
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:35,599
and our attitude is some polite form
 

6047
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:36,280
and our attitude is some polite form
tough

6048
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:36,290
tough
 

6049
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,589
tough
[Laughter]

6050
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
[Laughter]
 

6051
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:40,629
[Laughter]
the deal is this take it or leave it and

6052
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
the deal is this take it or leave it and
 

6053
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:42,950
the deal is this take it or leave it and
in a few cases they've left it in most

6054
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:42,960
in a few cases they've left it in most
 

6055
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,470
in a few cases they've left it in most
cases

6056
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
cases
 

6057
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:46,709
cases
they'll see our point of view and take

6058
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:46,719
they'll see our point of view and take
 

6059
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,950
they'll see our point of view and take
it because that's how we've built the

6060
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:48,960
it because that's how we've built the
 

6061
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,229
it because that's how we've built the
psych system

6062
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:50,239
psych system
 

6063
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:51,270
psych system

by
essentially tacking with the funding

6066
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:53,599
essentially tacking with the funding
 

6067
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:54,550
essentially tacking with the funding
wins

6068
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:54,560
wins
 

6069
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,589
wins
where people would fund a project and

6070
01:51:57,589 --> 01:51:57,599
where people would fund a project and
 

6071
01:51:57,599 --> 01:51:59,830
where people would fund a project and
half of it would be general knowledge

6072
01:51:59,830 --> 01:51:59,840
half of it would be general knowledge
 

6073
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,510
half of it would be general knowledge
that would stay permanently as part of

6074
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:01,520
that would stay permanently as part of
 

6075
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,189
that would stay permanently as part of
psychics so always with these

6076
01:52:03,189 --> 01:52:03,199
psychics so always with these
 

6077
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,950
psychics so always with these
partnerships it's not like a distraction

6078
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:04,960
partnerships it's not like a distraction
 

6079
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,070
partnerships it's not like a distraction
from the main psych development it's uh

6080
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
from the main psych development it's uh
 

6081
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,990
from the main psych development it's uh
it's a supportive a small distraction

6082
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:10,000
it's a supportive a small distraction
 

6083
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,589
it's a supportive a small distraction
it's a small but it's not a complete one

6084
01:52:11,589 --> 01:52:11,599
it's a small but it's not a complete one
 

6085
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:13,109
it's a small but it's not a complete one
so you're adding to the knowledge base

6086
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:13,119
so you're adding to the knowledge base
 

6087
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:14,950
so you're adding to the knowledge base
yes absolutely and we try to stay away

6088
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:14,960
yes absolutely and we try to stay away
 

6089
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,669
yes absolutely and we try to stay away
from projects

6090
01:52:17,669 --> 01:52:17,679
from projects
 

6091
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,390
from projects
that would not have that property

6092
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:20,400
that would not have that property
 

6093
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,510
that would not have that property
so

6094
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:21,520
so
 

6095
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,510
so
let me go back and talk about open psych

6096
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:23,520
let me go back and talk about open psych
 

6097
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,510
let me go back and talk about open psych
for a second so

6098
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:25,520
for a second so
 

6099
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,270
for a second so
i've had a lot of trouble

6100
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:29,280

 

6101
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,589

other ai researchers
 

6105
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,229
other ai researchers
how important it is

6106
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:36,239
how important it is
 

6107
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,470
how important it is
to use an expressive representation

6108
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:38,480
to use an expressive representation
 

6109
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,310
to use an expressive representation
language like we do this higher order

6110
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
language like we do this higher order
 

6111
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,350
language like we do this higher order
logic

6112
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
logic
 

6113
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,870
logic
rather than just using some triple store

6114
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
rather than just using some triple store
 

6115
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,109
rather than just using some triple store
knowledge graph type

6116
01:52:47,109 --> 01:52:47,119

and

6120
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:49,840
and
 

6121
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,870
and
so

6122
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:50,880
so
 

6123
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,310
so
as an attempt to show them

6124
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
as an attempt to show them
 

6125
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,870
as an attempt to show them
why they needed something more

6126
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:56,880
why they needed something more
 

6127
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,070
why they needed something more
we said oh well we'll represent

6128
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:00,080
we said oh well we'll represent
 

6129
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,510
we said oh well we'll represent
this unimportant projection or shadow or

6130
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
this unimportant projection or shadow or
 

6131
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,070
this unimportant projection or shadow or
subset of psych

6132
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:06,080
subset of psych
 

6133
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,070
subset of psych
that just happens to be

6134
01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,080
that just happens to be
 

6135
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:11,109
that just happens to be
the simple binary relations the relation

6136
01:53:11,109 --> 01:53:11,119
the simple binary relations the relation
 

6137
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,669
the simple binary relations the relation
argument one argument two triples and so

6138
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:13,679
argument one argument two triples and so
 

6139
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:14,790
argument one argument two triples and so
on

6140
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
on
 

6141
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:15,669
on
and

6142
01:53:15,669 --> 01:53:15,679
and
 

6143
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,589
and
then you'll see

6144
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:17,599
then you'll see
 

6145
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:18,390
then you'll see
how

6146
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:18,400
how
 

6147
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,709
how
much more useful it is if you had the

6148
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,719
much more useful it is if you had the
 

6149
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,510
much more useful it is if you had the
entire psych system so it's all well and

6150
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:23,520
entire psych system so it's all well and
 

6151
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,149
entire psych system so it's all well and
good to have the taxonomic relations

6152
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:28,159
good to have the taxonomic relations
 

6153
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:29,830
good to have the taxonomic relations
between terms

6154
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:29,840
between terms
 

6155
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,950
between terms
like person and night and sleep and bed

6156
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:32,960
like person and night and sleep and bed
 

6157
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,430
like person and night and sleep and bed
and house and eyes

6158
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:35,440
and house and eyes
 

6159
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,550
and house and eyes
and and so on but

6160
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
and and so on but
 

6161
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,070
and and so on but
think about how much more useful it

6162
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
think about how much more useful it
 

6163
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,870
think about how much more useful it
would be if you also had all the rules

6164
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
would be if you also had all the rules
 

6165
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,430
would be if you also had all the rules
of thumb about those things like people

6166
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,440
of thumb about those things like people
 

6167
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,350
of thumb about those things like people
sleep at night they sleep lying down

6168
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:47,360
sleep at night they sleep lying down
 

6169
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,790
sleep at night they sleep lying down
they sleep with their eyes closed they

6170
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
they sleep with their eyes closed they
 

6171
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,589
they sleep with their eyes closed they
usually sleep in beds in our country

6172
01:53:51,589 --> 01:53:51,599
usually sleep in beds in our country
 

6173
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,430
usually sleep in beds in our country
they sleep for hours at a time they can

6174
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
they sleep for hours at a time they can
 

6175
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,350
they sleep for hours at a time they can
be woken up they don't like being woken

6176
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:55,360
be woken up they don't like being woken
 

6177
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,990
be woken up they don't like being woken
up and so on and so on so it's that

6178
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:58,000
up and so on and so on so it's that
 

6179
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,149
up and so on and so on so it's that
massive amount of knowledge which is not

6180
01:54:00,149 --> 01:54:00,159
massive amount of knowledge which is not
 

6181
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,950
massive amount of knowledge which is not
part of open psych and we thought that

6182
01:54:02,950 --> 01:54:02,960
part of open psych and we thought that
 

6183
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,149
part of open psych and we thought that
all the researchers would then

6184
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
all the researchers would then
 

6185
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:07,030
all the researchers would then
immediately immediately say oh my god of

6186
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
immediately immediately say oh my god of
 

6187
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,750
immediately immediately say oh my god of
course we need the other 90 that you're

6188
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
course we need the other 90 that you're
 

6189
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,669
course we need the other 90 that you're
not giving us let's partner and license

6190
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
not giving us let's partner and license
 

6191
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,270
not giving us let's partner and license
psych so that we can use it in our

6192
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:15,280
psych so that we can use it in our
 

6193
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,950
psych so that we can use it in our
research but instead

6194
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
research but instead
 

6195
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,790
research but instead
what people said is oh even the bit

6196
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:18,800
what people said is oh even the bit
 

6197
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,550
what people said is oh even the bit
you've released is so much better than

6198
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:20,560
you've released is so much better than
 

6199
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,550
you've released is so much better than
anything we had we'll just make do with

6200
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,560
anything we had we'll just make do with
 

6201
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,350
anything we had we'll just make do with
this

6202
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:23,360
this
 

6203
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,950
this
yeah and so if you look there are a lot

6204
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:24,960
yeah and so if you look there are a lot
 

6205
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,350
yeah and so if you look there are a lot
of robotics companies today for example

6206
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:27,360
of robotics companies today for example
 

6207
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,589
of robotics companies today for example
which use open psych as their

6208
01:54:29,589 --> 01:54:29,599
which use open psych as their
 

6209
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:32,950
which use open psych as their
fundamental ontology um and in some

6210
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
fundamental ontology um and in some
 

6211
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,910
fundamental ontology um and in some
sense the whole world missed the point

6212
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:35,920
sense the whole world missed the point
 

6213
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,709
sense the whole world missed the point
of open psych and we were doing it to

6214
01:54:38,709 --> 01:54:38,719
of open psych and we were doing it to
 

6215
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:40,790
of open psych and we were doing it to
show people why that's not really what

6216
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:40,800
show people why that's not really what
 

6217
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,270
show people why that's not really what
they wanted and too many people thought

6218
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:43,280
they wanted and too many people thought
 

6219
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,189
they wanted and too many people thought
somehow that this was psych or that this

6220
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:45,199
somehow that this was psych or that this
 

6221
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:47,430
somehow that this was psych or that this
was in fact good enough for them and

6222
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,440
was in fact good enough for them and
 

6223
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,790
was in fact good enough for them and
they never even bother coming coming to

6224
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:50,800
they never even bother coming coming to
 

6225
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,189
they never even bother coming coming to
us to get access to the full psych but

6226
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
us to get access to the full psych but
 

6227
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:54,870
us to get access to the full psych but
there's there's two parts to open psych

6228
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:54,880
there's there's two parts to open psych
 

6229
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,270
there's there's two parts to open psych
so one is convincing people on the idea

6230
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
so one is convincing people on the idea
 

6231
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,709
so one is convincing people on the idea
and the power of this general kind of

6232
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
and the power of this general kind of
 

6233
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,550
and the power of this general kind of
representation of knowledge

6234
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:00,560
representation of knowledge
 

6235
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,709
representation of knowledge
and the value that you hold in having

6236
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
and the value that you hold in having
 

6237
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:04,310
and the value that you hold in having
acquired that knowledge and built it and

6238
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
acquired that knowledge and built it and
 

6239
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,310
acquired that knowledge and built it and
continued to build it and the other is

6240
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,320
continued to build it and the other is
 

6241
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,430
continued to build it and the other is
the code base this is the code

6242
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
the code base this is the code
 

6243
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,589
the code base this is the code
side of it so

6244
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
side of it so
 

6245
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,550
side of it so
my sense of the code base that cycle

6246
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:14,560
my sense of the code base that cycle
 

6247
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,350
my sense of the code base that cycle
psyc is operating with i mean it has the

6248
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,360
psyc is operating with i mean it has the
 

6249
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,870
psyc is operating with i mean it has the
technical debt

6250
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:18,880
technical debt
 

6251
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:22,149
technical debt
of the three decades plus right this is

6252
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:22,159
of the three decades plus right this is
 

6253
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:24,070
of the three decades plus right this is
the exact same problem that google had

6254
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:24,080
the exact same problem that google had
 

6255
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,310
the exact same problem that google had
to deal with with the early version of

6256
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:26,320
to deal with with the early version of
 

6257
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,550
to deal with with the early version of
tensorflow it's still dealing with the

6258
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
tensorflow it's still dealing with the
 

6259
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,070
tensorflow it's still dealing with the
that they had to

6260
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:30,080
that they had to
 

6261
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,589
that they had to
basically break

6262
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:31,599
basically break
 

6263
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:33,750
basically break
uh compatibility with the past several

and that's only over a period of a
 

6269

couple years
 

6271
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,709

up tensorflow

6276
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
up tensorflow
 

6277
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,790
up tensorflow
and then pytorch on the facebook side

6278
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:48,800
and then pytorch on the facebook side
 

6279
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,149
and then pytorch on the facebook side
and what you see is there's a magic

6280
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:52,159
and what you see is there's a magic
 

6281

most of the value so most of the value

6290
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
most of the value so most of the value
 

6291
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,790
most of the value so most of the value
that google has is still at google most

some of this major machine learning

6298
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
some of this major machine learning

01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,470
some of this major machine learning
tooling is released into the open my

6300
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
tooling is released into the open my
 

6301
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:15,669
tooling is released into the open my
question is

6302
01:56:15,669 --> 01:56:15,679
question is
 

6303
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,669
question is
not so much on the knowledge which is

6304
01:56:17,669 --> 01:56:17,679
not so much on the knowledge which is
 

6305
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,990
not so much on the knowledge which is
also a big part of open psych

6306
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:20,000
also a big part of open psych
 

6307
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,870
also a big part of open psych
but all the different kinds of tooling

6308
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:22,880
but all the different kinds of tooling
 

6309
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,830
but all the different kinds of tooling
so the

6310
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:23,840
so the
 

6311
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,750
so the
there's the kind of all the kinds of

6312
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
there's the kind of all the kinds of
 

6313
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,830
there's the kind of all the kinds of
stuff you can do on the knowledge graph

6314
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:27,840
stuff you can do on the knowledge graph
 

6315
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,669
stuff you can do on the knowledge graph
knowledge base whatever we call it

6316
01:56:29,669 --> 01:56:29,679
knowledge base whatever we call it
 

6317
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:31,589
knowledge base whatever we call it
there's the inference

6318
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
there's the inference
 

6319
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,990
there's the inference
engines so there there could be some

6320
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:34,000
engines so there there could be some
 

6321
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,310
engines so there there could be some
that probably are a bunch of proprietary

01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,229
that probably are a bunch of proprietary
stuff you want to kind of keep secret

6324
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:38,239
stuff you want to kind of keep secret
 

6325
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:39,669
stuff you want to kind of keep secret
and there's probably some stuff you can

6326
01:56:39,669 --> 01:56:39,679
and there's probably some stuff you can
 

6327
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:42,229
and there's probably some stuff you can
open up completely and then let the

6328
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
open up completely and then let the
 

6329
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:43,669
open up completely and then let the
community build up enough community

6330
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:43,679
community build up enough community
 

6331
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,589
community build up enough community
where they develop stuff on top of it

6332
01:56:45,589 --> 01:56:45,599
where they develop stuff on top of it
 

6333
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:47,270
where they develop stuff on top of it
yes there will be those publications and

6334
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280
yes there will be those publications and
 

6335
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,830
yes there will be those publications and
academic work and all that kind of stuff

6336
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:49,840
academic work and all that kind of stuff
 

6337
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,550
academic work and all that kind of stuff
and uh and also the tooling of adding to

6338
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
and uh and also the tooling of adding to
 

6339
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,870
and uh and also the tooling of adding to
the knowledge base right like developing

6340
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
the knowledge base right like developing
 

6341
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,629
the knowledge base right like developing
you know there's an incredible amount

6342
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
you know there's an incredible amount
 

6343
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,470
you know there's an incredible amount
like there's so many people that are

6344
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:58,480
like there's so many people that are
 

6345
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,310
like there's so many people that are
just really good at this kind of stuff

6346
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:00,320
just really good at this kind of stuff
 

6347
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,709
just really good at this kind of stuff
in the open source community so my

6348
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:02,719
in the open source community so my
 

6349
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,229
in the open source community so my
question for you is like have you

6350
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:04,239
question for you is like have you
 

6351
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,629
question for you is like have you
struggled with this kind of idea

6352
01:57:06,629 --> 01:57:06,639
struggled with this kind of idea
 

6353
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,310
struggled with this kind of idea
that you have so much value in your

6354
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:08,320
that you have so much value in your
 

6355
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,470
that you have so much value in your
company already you've developed so many

6356
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:10,480
company already you've developed so many
 

6357
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,870
company already you've developed so many
good things you have clients that really

6358
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:12,880
good things you have clients that really
 

6359
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,790
good things you have clients that really
value your relationships and then

6360
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
value your relationships and then
 

6361
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,950
value your relationships and then
there's this dormant giant open source

that requires a little bit leap of faith

pop up and start making you nervous
and all that kind of stuff so do you

6410
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
and all that kind of stuff so do you
 

6411
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,950
and all that kind of stuff so do you
think about the space of open sourcing

6412
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:06,960
think about the space of open sourcing
 

6413
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,790
think about the space of open sourcing
some parts and not others

some parts and not others

how to leverage the community

6416
01:58:11,109 --> 01:58:11,119
how to leverage the community
 

6417
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:12,790
how to leverage the community
all those kinds of things that's a good

6418
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:12,800
all those kinds of things that's a good
 

6419
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,470
all those kinds of things that's a good
question and i think you phrased it the

6420
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:14,480
question and i think you phrased it the
 

6421
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,870
question and i think you phrased it the
right way which is

6422
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:16,880
right way which is
 

6423
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,030
right way which is
we're constantly struggling with the

6424
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:19,040
we're constantly struggling with the
 

6425
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,270
we're constantly struggling with the
question of

6426
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:21,280
question of
 

6427
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,990
question of
what to open source what to make public

6428
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:24,000
what to open source what to make public
 

6429
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,030
what to open source what to make public
what to even publicly talk about right

6430
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,040
what to even publicly talk about right
 

6431
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:27,750
what to even publicly talk about right
and

6432
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
and
 

6433
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,270
and
it's

6434
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:29,280
it's
 

6435
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,149
it's
there are

6436
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,159
there are
 

6437
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:33,030
there are
enormous pluses and minuses

6438
01:58:33,030 --> 01:58:33,040
enormous pluses and minuses
 

6439
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,709
enormous pluses and minuses
to every

6440
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:34,719
to every
 

6441
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,109
to every
alternative

6442
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,119
alternative
 

6443
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:40,629
alternative
and it's very much like negotiating a

6444
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:40,639
and it's very much like negotiating a
 

6445
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:43,109
and it's very much like negotiating a
very treacherous path

6446
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:43,119
very treacherous path
 

6447
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:45,589
very treacherous path
part partly the analogy is like if you

6448
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
part partly the analogy is like if you
 

6449
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:46,550
part partly the analogy is like if you
slip

6450
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:46,560
slip
 

6451
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,470
slip
you could make a fatal mistake

6452
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
you could make a fatal mistake
 

6453
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,870
you could make a fatal mistake
give away something which essentially

6454
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:50,880
give away something which essentially
 

6455
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,950
give away something which essentially
kills you or fail to give away something

6456
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:52,960
kills you or fail to give away something
 

6457
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,470
kills you or fail to give away something
which um

6458
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:54,480
which um
 

6459
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,470
which um
failing to give it away um hurts you and

6460
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
failing to give it away um hurts you and
 

6461
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,229
failing to give it away um hurts you and
so on

6462
01:58:58,229 --> 01:58:58,239
so on
 

6463
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:00,870
so on
so it is a it is a very tough

6464
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:00,880
so it is a it is a very tough
 

6465
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,589
so it is a it is a very tough
tough question

6466
01:59:03,589 --> 01:59:03,599
tough question
 

6467
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:06,950
tough question
usually what we have done with

01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:06,960
usually what we have done with
 

6469
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,669

01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:11,990
people who approached us to
collaborate on research is to say we

collaborate on research is to say we
 

6473

01:59:29,669 --> 01:59:29,679
source code access if you have some idea
 

6489
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:31,510
source code access if you have some idea
for how you might improve something or

6490
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:31,520
for how you might improve something or
 

6491
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,350
for how you might improve something or
work with us on something

6492
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,360
work with us on something
 

6493
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,669
work with us on something
so let me also

6494
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:35,679
so let me also
 

6495
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,830
so let me also
get back to one of the very very first

6496
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:37,840
get back to one of the very very first
 

6497
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,550
get back to one of the very very first
things we talked about here

6498
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:40,560
things we talked about here
 

6499
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,430
things we talked about here
which was

6500
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:43,440

 

6501
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,910

separating the question of how could you

6502
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:45,920
separating the question of how could you
 

6503
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:48,310
separating the question of how could you
get a computer to do this at all versus

6504
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:48,320
get a computer to do this at all versus
 

6505
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,990
get a computer to do this at all versus
how could you get a computer to do this

6506
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,000
how could you get a computer to do this
 

6507
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,709
how could you get a computer to do this
efficiently enough in real time

6508
01:59:52,709 --> 01:59:52,719
efficiently enough in real time
 

6509
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:53,750
efficiently enough in real time
and so

6510
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760
and so
 

6511
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,589
and so
one of the

6512
01:59:55,589 --> 01:59:55,599
one of the
 

6513
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:58,550
one of the
early lessons we learned was that we had

6514
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
early lessons we learned was that we had
 

6515
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,149
early lessons we learned was that we had
to separate

6516
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:00,159
to separate
 

6517
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:02,149
to separate
the epistemological problem of what

6518
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
the epistemological problem of what
 

6519
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,149
the epistemological problem of what
should the system know

6520
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
should the system know
 

6521
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:06,149
should the system know
separate that from the heuristic problem

6522
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:06,159
separate that from the heuristic problem
 

6523
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:08,629
separate that from the heuristic problem
of how can the system reason efficiently

6524
02:00:08,629 --> 02:00:08,639
of how can the system reason efficiently
 

6525
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,070
of how can the system reason efficiently
with what it knows

6526
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080
with what it knows
 

6527
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,270
with what it knows
and so

6528
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:11,280
and so
 

6529
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,189
and so
instead of trying to

6530
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:13,199
instead of trying to
 

6531
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:14,310
instead of trying to
pick

6532
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
pick
 

6533
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:17,510
pick
one representation language which was

6534
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,520
one representation language which was
 

6535
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,910
one representation language which was
the sweet spot or the best trade-off

6536
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:19,920
the sweet spot or the best trade-off
 

6537
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,229
the sweet spot or the best trade-off
point between expressiveness

6538
02:00:22,229 --> 02:00:22,239
point between expressiveness
 

6539
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:24,310
point between expressiveness
of the language and efficiency of the

6540
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,320
of the language and efficiency of the
 

6541
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,310
of the language and efficiency of the
language if you had to pick one

6542
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:26,320
language if you had to pick one
 

6543
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,470
language if you had to pick one
knowledge graphs would probably be

6544
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
knowledge graphs would probably be
 

6545
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,629
knowledge graphs would probably be
associative triples would probably be

6546
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
associative triples would probably be
 

6547
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:32,310
associative triples would probably be
about the best you could do and that's

6548
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,320
about the best you could do and that's
 

6549
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,910
about the best you could do and that's
why we started there

6550
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:33,920
why we started there
 

6551
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:34,790
why we started there
but

6552
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:34,800
but
 

6553
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,109
but
after a few years we realized that what

6554
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:37,119
after a few years we realized that what
 

6555
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:39,189
after a few years we realized that what
we could do is we could split this and

6556
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:39,199
we could do is we could split this and
 

6557
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,109
we could do is we could split this and
we could have one

6558
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:41,119
we could have one
 

6559
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:43,910
we could have one
nice clean epistemological level

6560
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:43,920
nice clean epistemological level

02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,589
nice clean epistemological level
language which is this higher order

6565
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:50,470
logic
and we could have one or more grubby

6566
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,480
and we could have one or more grubby
 

6567
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,910
and we could have one or more grubby
but efficient

6568
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:51,920
but efficient
 

6569
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:54,750

opportunistically
would say oh i can make progress on what

would say oh i can make progress on what
 

6575
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,510
would say oh i can make progress on what
you're trying to do over here i have a

6576
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
you're trying to do over here i have a
 

6577
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,589
you're trying to do over here i have a
special method that will

02:01:03,589 --> 02:01:03,599
special method that will
 

6579
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,030
special method that will
contribute a little bit toward a

02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
contribute a little bit toward a
 

6581
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,470
contribute a little bit toward a

02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:08,480
solution and so for some subset of
 

6583
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,790

community of agents
 

6591
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,390
community of agents
and there's one of them which is a

and there's one of them which is a
 

6593

general theorem prover
 

6595
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,870
general theorem prover
and in theory

02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:22,880
and in theory
 

6597
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,109

that's the only one you need

that's the only one you need
 

6599
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:28,310
that's the only one you need
but in practice it always takes so long

6600
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:28,320
but in practice it always takes so long
 

6601
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,030
but in practice it always takes so long
that you never want to call on it um you

it's much better to simply recognize

it's much better to simply recognize

it's much better to simply recognize
that this is a quadratic equation and

that this is a quadratic equation and

solution to your problem and if we ever
 

6659
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,629
solution to your problem and if we ever
come up in a domain application

6660
02:02:32,629 --> 02:02:32,639
come up in a domain application
 

6661
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:34,470
come up in a domain application
where psyc is getting the right answer

6662
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,480
where psyc is getting the right answer
 

6663
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,550
where psyc is getting the right answer
but taking too long

6664
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
but taking too long
 

6665
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,430
but taking too long
then

6666
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:37,440
then
 

6667
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,430
then
what we'll often do is talk to one of

6668
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
what we'll often do is talk to one of
 

6669
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,629
what we'll often do is talk to one of
the human experts and say

6670
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:42,639
the human experts and say
 

6671
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:45,109
the human experts and say
here's the set of reasoning steps that

6672
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:45,119
here's the set of reasoning steps that
 

6673
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:47,430
here's the set of reasoning steps that
psych went through you can see why it

6674
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:47,440
psych went through you can see why it
 

6675
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,510
psych went through you can see why it
took it a long time to get the answer

6676
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:49,520
took it a long time to get the answer
 

6677
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,189
took it a long time to get the answer
how is it that you were able to answer

6678
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:51,199
how is it that you were able to answer
 

6679
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,270
how is it that you were able to answer
that question in two seconds and

6680
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,280
that question in two seconds and
 

6681
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,550
that question in two seconds and
occasionally

6682
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:54,560
occasionally
 

6683
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:57,270
occasionally
you'll get an expert who

6684
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,280
you'll get an expert who
 

6685
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,510
you'll get an expert who
just says well i just know it i just was

6686
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
just says well i just know it i just was
 

6687
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,750
just says well i just know it i just was
able to do it or something and then you

6688
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:01,760
able to do it or something and then you
 

6689
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,350
able to do it or something and then you
don't talk to them anymore but sometimes

6690
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:03,360
don't talk to them anymore but sometimes
 

6691
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,430
don't talk to them anymore but sometimes
you'll get an expert who says

6692
02:03:05,430 --> 02:03:05,440
you'll get an expert who says
 

6693
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,149
you'll get an expert who says
well let me introspect on that yes here

6694
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
well let me introspect on that yes here
 

6695
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,870
well let me introspect on that yes here
is a special representation we use

6696
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:10,880
is a special representation we use
 

6697
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,229
is a special representation we use
just for

6698
02:03:12,229 --> 02:03:12,239
just for
 

6699
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:14,790
just for
aqueous chemistry equations or here's a

6700
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:14,800
aqueous chemistry equations or here's a
 

6701
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,430
aqueous chemistry equations or here's a
special representation and a special

6702
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:17,440
special representation and a special
 

6703
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,750
special representation and a special
technique which we can now apply to

6704
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
technique which we can now apply to
 

6705
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,910
technique which we can now apply to
things in this special representation

6706
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:21,920
things in this special representation
 

6707
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,390
things in this special representation
and so on and then you add that as the

6708
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:24,400
and so on and then you add that as the
 

6709
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,910
and so on and then you add that as the
thousand and first

6710
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
thousand and first
 

6711
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,550
thousand and first
hl heuristic level module

6712
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
hl heuristic level module
 

6713
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:31,189
hl heuristic level module
and from then on um in any application

6714
02:03:31,189 --> 02:03:31,199
and from then on um in any application
 

6715
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:33,430
and from then on um in any application
if it ever comes up again it'll be able

6716
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:33,440
if it ever comes up again it'll be able
 

6717
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,910
if it ever comes up again it'll be able
to contribute and so on so that that's

6718
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:35,920
to contribute and so on so that that's
 

6719
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,390
to contribute and so on so that that's
pretty much one of the main ways in

6720
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
pretty much one of the main ways in
 

6721
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,270
pretty much one of the main ways in
which

6722
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
which
 

6723
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:42,550
which
psyc has recouped this lost efficiency

6724
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:42,560
psyc has recouped this lost efficiency
 

6725
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:46,229
psyc has recouped this lost efficiency
a second important way is meta reasoning

6726
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:46,239
a second important way is meta reasoning
 

6727
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:47,270
a second important way is meta reasoning
so

6728
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,280
so
 

6729
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,830
so
you can speed things up by

6730
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:49,840
you can speed things up by
 

6731
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,790
you can speed things up by
focusing on removing knowledge from the

6732
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:52,800
focusing on removing knowledge from the
 

6733
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,790
focusing on removing knowledge from the
system until all it has left is like

6734
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:54,800
system until all it has left is like
 

6735
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,109
system until all it has left is like
minimal knowledge needed to but that's

6736
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
minimal knowledge needed to but that's
 

6737
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:58,950
minimal knowledge needed to but that's
the wrong thing to do right that would

6738
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
the wrong thing to do right that would
 

6739
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:00,709
the wrong thing to do right that would
be like in a human extra painting part

6740
02:04:00,709 --> 02:04:00,719
be like in a human extra painting part
 

6741
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:01,990
be like in a human extra painting part
of their brain or something that's

6742
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:02,000
of their brain or something that's
 

6743
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,189
of their brain or something that's
really bad

6744
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:03,199
really bad
 

6745
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:05,030
really bad
so instead what you want to do is give

6746
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
so instead what you want to do is give
 

6747
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,589
so instead what you want to do is give
it meta-level advice tactical and

6748
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:07,599
it meta-level advice tactical and
 

6749
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:10,390
it meta-level advice tactical and
strategic advice that enables it to

6750
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,400
strategic advice that enables it to
 

6751
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,229
strategic advice that enables it to
reason about

6752
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:12,239
reason about
 

6753
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:13,990
reason about
what kind of knowledge is going to be

6754
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,000
what kind of knowledge is going to be
 

6755
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,069
what kind of knowledge is going to be
relevant to this problem what kind of

6756
02:04:16,069 --> 02:04:16,079
relevant to this problem what kind of
 

6757
02:04:16,079 --> 02:04:18,229
relevant to this problem what kind of
tactics are going to be good to take in

6758
02:04:18,229 --> 02:04:18,239
tactics are going to be good to take in
 

6759
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:20,790
tactics are going to be good to take in
trying to attack this problem when is it

6760
02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:20,800
trying to attack this problem when is it
 

6761
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,950
trying to attack this problem when is it
time to start trying to prove the

6762
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:22,960
time to start trying to prove the
 

6763
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:25,189
time to start trying to prove the
negation of this thing because i'm

6764
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
negation of this thing because i'm
 

6765
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:27,109
negation of this thing because i'm
knocking myself out trying to prove it's

6766
02:04:27,109 --> 02:04:27,119
knocking myself out trying to prove it's
 

6767
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:28,790
knocking myself out trying to prove it's
true and maybe it's false and if i just

6768
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:28,800
true and maybe it's false and if i just
 

6769
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,629
true and maybe it's false and if i just
spend a minute i can see that it's false

6770
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:30,639
spend a minute i can see that it's false
 

6771
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:32,870
spend a minute i can see that it's false
or something so so it's like dynamically

6772
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:32,880
or something so so it's like dynamically
 

6773
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,870
or something so so it's like dynamically
pruning the the graph to only like based

6774
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:36,880
pruning the the graph to only like based
 

6775
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,870
pruning the the graph to only like based
on the particular thing you're trying to

6776
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:38,880
on the particular thing you're trying to
 

6777
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,069
on the particular thing you're trying to
infer yes and so by now

6778
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:42,079
infer yes and so by now
 

6779
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:44,790
infer yes and so by now
we have about 150

6780
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:44,800
we have about 150
 

6781
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,589
we have about 150
of these sort of like breakthrough ideas

6782
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599
of these sort of like breakthrough ideas
 

6783
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,629
of these sort of like breakthrough ideas
that have led to dramatic speed ups in

6784
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
that have led to dramatic speed ups in
 

6785
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,390
that have led to dramatic speed ups in
the inference process

6786
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:52,400
the inference process
 

6787
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,870
the inference process
you know where one of them was this el

6788
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
you know where one of them was this el
 

6789
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,589
you know where one of them was this el
hl split and lots of hl modules another

6790
02:04:57,589 --> 02:04:57,599
hl split and lots of hl modules another
 

6791
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,470
hl split and lots of hl modules another
one was using meta and meta-meta-level

6792
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:00,480
one was using meta and meta-meta-level
 

6793
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:03,910
one was using meta and meta-meta-level
reasoning um to reason about the

6794
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:03,920
reasoning um to reason about the
 

6795
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,470
reasoning um to reason about the
reasoning that's going on and so on and

6796
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,480
reasoning that's going on and so on and
 

6797
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,550
reasoning that's going on and so on and
you know 150 breakthroughs may sound

6798
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:08,560
you know 150 breakthroughs may sound
 

6799
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,390
you know 150 breakthroughs may sound
like a lot but you know if you divide by

6800
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:10,400
like a lot but you know if you divide by
 

6801
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,510
like a lot but you know if you divide by
37 years it's not as impressive

6802
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
37 years it's not as impressive
 

6803
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,510
37 years it's not as impressive
so there's these kind of heuristic

6804
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:15,520
so there's these kind of heuristic
 

6805
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,830
so there's these kind of heuristic
modules that really help improve the the

6806
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:18,840
modules that really help improve the the
 

6807
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:24,149
modules that really help improve the the
inference uh how hard in general is this

6808
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
inference uh how hard in general is this
 

6809
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:26,550
inference uh how hard in general is this
because you mentioned higher order logic

02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,910
sense it's an intractable very difficult
problem yes so how hard is this

6818
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:35,920
problem yes so how hard is this
 

6819

6849
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,310
engineers in most cases don't even know
how to program uh they have degrees in

6850
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:12,320
how to program uh they have degrees in
 

6851
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:15,030
how to program uh they have degrees in
things like philosophy and so on um so

6852
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:15,040
things like philosophy and so on um so
 

6853
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,109
things like philosophy and so on um so
it's almost like i love that i'd love to

6854
02:06:17,109 --> 02:06:17,119
it's almost like i love that i'd love to
 

6855
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:18,790
it's almost like i love that i'd love to
hang out with those people oh yes it's

6856
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:18,800
hang out with those people oh yes it's
 

6857
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,629
hang out with those people oh yes it's
wonderful but it's very much like the

6858
02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:20,639
wonderful but it's very much like the
 

6859
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:23,270
wonderful but it's very much like the
eloy and the morlocks in

02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:23,280
eloy and the morlocks in
 

6861
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,750
eloy and the morlocks in
hd wells time machine so you have the

6862
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:25,760
hd wells time machine so you have the
 

6863
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:28,030
hd wells time machine so you have the

02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:28,040
eloy who only program in the
 

6865

language yes and then you have the

6868
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:32,400
language yes and then you have the
 

6869
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,350

02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:37,360
the ground uh figuring out what the
 

6873
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,109
the ground uh figuring out what the
machinery is that will make this

6874
02:06:39,109 --> 02:06:39,119
machinery is that will make this
 

6875
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:43,109
machinery is that will make this
efficiently operate and so on um and so

6876
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
efficiently operate and so on um and so
 

6877
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,950
efficiently operate and so on um and so
you know occasionally they'll toss

6878
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:44,960
you know occasionally they'll toss
 

6879
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,109
you know occasionally they'll toss
messages back to each other

6880
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
messages back to each other
 

6881
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:49,669
messages back to each other
and so on but it really is almost this

6882
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
and so on but it really is almost this
 

6883
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,109
and so on but it really is almost this
50 50 split between finding clever ways

6884
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
50 50 split between finding clever ways
 

6885
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:55,589
50 50 split between finding clever ways
to recoup efficiency

6886
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
to recoup efficiency
 

6887
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,470
to recoup efficiency
when you have an expressive language and

6888
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
when you have an expressive language and
 

6889
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,069
when you have an expressive language and
putting in the content of what the

6890
02:07:00,069 --> 02:07:00,079
putting in the content of what the
 

6891
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:02,470
putting in the content of what the
system needs to know and yeah both are

6892
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:02,480
system needs to know and yeah both are
 

6893
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:05,350
system needs to know and yeah both are
fascinating to some degree the entirety

6894
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
fascinating to some degree the entirety
 

6895
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,229
fascinating to some degree the entirety
of the system as far as i understand

6896
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:08,239
of the system as far as i understand
 

6897
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:11,750
of the system as far as i understand
is written in various variants of lisp

6898
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
is written in various variants of lisp
 

6899
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,350
is written in various variants of lisp
so my favorite programming language is

6900
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:13,360
so my favorite programming language is
 

6901
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,589
so my favorite programming language is
still lisp i don't program it in much

6902
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
still lisp i don't program it in much
 

6903
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:16,709
still lisp i don't program it in much
anymore

6904
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
anymore
 

6905
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:19,350
anymore
because you know the world has

6906
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:19,360
because you know the world has
 

6907
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,310
because you know the world has
in majority of its system has moved on

6908
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,320
in majority of its system has moved on
 

6909
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,910
in majority of its system has moved on
like everybody

6910
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
like everybody
 

6911
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,149
like everybody
respects lists but many of the systems

6912
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,159
respects lists but many of the systems
 

6913
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:27,189
respects lists but many of the systems
are not

6914
02:07:27,189 --> 02:07:27,199
are not
 

6915
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:30,229
are not
written in lisp anymore but psych as far

6916
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:30,239
written in lisp anymore but psych as far
 

6917
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:32,390
written in lisp anymore but psych as far
as i understand maybe you can correct me

6918
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:32,400
as i understand maybe you can correct me
 

6919
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,550
as i understand maybe you can correct me
there's a bunch of lisp in it

6920
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
there's a bunch of lisp in it
 

6921
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:37,189
there's a bunch of lisp in it
yeah so it's based on lisp code that we

6922
02:07:37,189 --> 02:07:37,199
yeah so it's based on lisp code that we
 

6923
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:39,030
yeah so it's based on lisp code that we
produced most of the programming is

6924
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:39,040
produced most of the programming is
 

6925
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:42,790
produced most of the programming is
still going on in a dialective lisp and

6926
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:42,800
still going on in a dialective lisp and
 

6927
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,669
still going on in a dialective lisp and
then

6928
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
then
 

6929
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:45,830
then
the for efficiency reasons that gets

6930
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:45,840
the for efficiency reasons that gets
 

6931
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,550
the for efficiency reasons that gets
automatically translated into things

6932
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
automatically translated into things
 

6933
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,990
automatically translated into things
like java

6934
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
like java
 

6935
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,390
like java
or c nowadays it's almost all translated

6936
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:52,400
or c nowadays it's almost all translated
 

6937
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,430
or c nowadays it's almost all translated
into java because java has gotten good

6938
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:55,440
into java because java has gotten good
 

6939
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,870
into java because java has gotten good
enough that

6940
02:07:56,870 --> 02:07:56,880
enough that
 

6941
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,550
enough that
that's that's really all we need to do

6942
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
that's that's really all we need to do
 

6943
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,149
that's that's really all we need to do
so it's translated into java and then

6944
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:00,159
so it's translated into java and then
 

6945
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:03,510
so it's translated into java and then
java is compiled down to uh by code yes

6946
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:03,520
java is compiled down to uh by code yes
 

6947
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:06,830
java is compiled down to uh by code yes
okay so that's sort of that's a the

6948
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:06,840
okay so that's sort of that's a the
 

6949
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:09,350
okay so that's sort of that's a the
the that's a

6950
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
the that's a
 

6951
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,870
the that's a
you know it's a process that probably

6952
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:10,880
you know it's a process that probably
 

6953
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:13,109
you know it's a process that probably
has to do with the fact that when psych

6954
02:08:13,109 --> 02:08:13,119
has to do with the fact that when psych
 

6955
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:15,109
has to do with the fact that when psych
was originally written and you build up

6956
02:08:15,109 --> 02:08:15,119
was originally written and you build up
 

6957
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:17,189
was originally written and you build up
a powerful system

6958
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:17,199
a powerful system
 

6959
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:18,870
a powerful system
like there is some technical depth you

6960
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:18,880
like there is some technical depth you
 

6961
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,790
like there is some technical depth you
have to deal with as is the case with

6962
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
have to deal with as is the case with
 

6963
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,390
have to deal with as is the case with
most powerful systems that span years

6964
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:24,400
most powerful systems that span years
 

6965
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:28,550
most powerful systems that span years
um have you ever considered

6966
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:28,560

 

6967
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,550

this this would help me understand

6968
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:30,560
this this would help me understand
 

6969
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,310
this this would help me understand
because from my perspective

6970
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,320
because from my perspective
 

6971
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,709
because from my perspective
so much of the value of everything

6972
02:08:34,709 --> 02:08:34,719
so much of the value of everything
 

6973
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:36,550
so much of the value of everything
you've done

6974
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
you've done
 

6975
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,390
you've done
with psych and psycho because then is

6976
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:38,400
with psych and psycho because then is
 

6977
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,629
with psych and psycho because then is
the is the knowledge

6978
02:08:40,629 --> 02:08:40,639
the is the knowledge
 

6979
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:42,709
the is the knowledge
have you ever considered just like

6980
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
have you ever considered just like
 

6981
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,550
have you ever considered just like
throwing away the code base and starting

6982
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:44,560
throwing away the code base and starting
 

6983
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,430
throwing away the code base and starting
from scratch not really throwing away

6984
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:47,440
from scratch not really throwing away
 

6985
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:48,550
from scratch not really throwing away
but

6986
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:48,560
but
 

6987
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,870
but
sort of moving it to

6988
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:50,880
sort of moving it to
 

6989
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:52,870
sort of moving it to
uh like room throwing away that

6990
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:52,880
uh like room throwing away that
 

6991
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,270
uh like room throwing away that
technical debt starting with a more

6992
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
technical debt starting with a more
 

6993
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,069
technical debt starting with a more
updated programming language

6994
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
updated programming language
 

6995
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:59,990
updated programming language
is that throwing away a lot of value or

6996
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:00,000
is that throwing away a lot of value or
 

6997
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,149
is that throwing away a lot of value or
no like what's your sense how much of

6998
02:09:02,149 --> 02:09:02,159
no like what's your sense how much of
 

6999
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,310
no like what's your sense how much of
the value is in the silly software

7000
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,320
the value is in the silly software
 

7001
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,470
the value is in the silly software
engineering aspect and how much of the

7002
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:06,480
engineering aspect and how much of the
 

7003
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:10,069
engineering aspect and how much of the
value is in the knowledge

7004
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:10,079

 

7005
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:11,030

so

7006
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:11,040
so
 

7007
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,109
so
development

7008
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:13,119
development
 

7009
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:14,229

of
 

7011
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,830
of
of programs in lisp

7012
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:16,840
of programs in lisp

precedes
 

7015
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,990

um i think

7016
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
um i think
 

7017
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,750
um i think
somewhere between a thousand and fifty

7018
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:21,760
somewhere between a thousand and fifty
 

7019
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,510
somewhere between a thousand and fifty
thousand times faster

7020
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:23,520
thousand times faster
 

7021
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,550
thousand times faster
than development in any any of what

7022
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
than development in any any of what
 

7023
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,189
than development in any any of what
you're calling um modern or improved

7024
02:09:29,189 --> 02:09:29,199
you're calling um modern or improved
 

7025
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:30,709
you're calling um modern or improved
computer languages well there's other

7026
02:09:30,709 --> 02:09:30,719
computer languages well there's other
 

7027
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:31,910
computer languages well there's other
functional languages like you know

7028
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
functional languages like you know
 

7029
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,229
functional languages like you know
closure and all the there's

7030
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:34,239
closure and all the there's
 

7031
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:37,109
closure and all the there's
but i mean i'm with you i i like lisp i

7032
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
but i mean i'm with you i i like lisp i
 

7033
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,950
but i mean i'm with you i i like lisp i
just wonder how many great programmers

7034
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:38,960
just wonder how many great programmers
 

7035
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:41,669
just wonder how many great programmers
there are there's still like yes so so

7036
02:09:41,669 --> 02:09:41,679
there are there's still like yes so so
 

7037
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:43,270
there are there's still like yes so so
it is true when a new inference

7038
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,280
it is true when a new inference
 

7039
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,589
it is true when a new inference
programmer comes on board they need to

7040
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
programmer comes on board they need to
 

7041
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,109
programmer comes on board they need to
learn

7042
02:09:47,109 --> 02:09:47,119
learn
 

7043
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:48,390
learn
some of

7044
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:48,400
some of
 

7045
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,229
some of
this but in fact we have a subset of

7046
02:09:50,229 --> 02:09:50,239
this but in fact we have a subset of
 

7047
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:53,589
this but in fact we have a subset of
lisp which we call cleverly sub l

7048
02:09:53,589 --> 02:09:53,599
lisp which we call cleverly sub l
 

7049
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:55,669
lisp which we call cleverly sub l
which is really all they need to learn

7050
02:09:55,669 --> 02:09:55,679
which is really all they need to learn
 

7051
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:58,390
which is really all they need to learn
and so the programming actually goes on

7052
02:09:58,390 --> 02:09:58,400
and so the programming actually goes on
 

7053
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,669
and so the programming actually goes on
in sub sub-l not in full lisp and so it

7054
02:10:01,669 --> 02:10:01,679
in sub sub-l not in full lisp and so it
 

7055
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:03,669
in sub sub-l not in full lisp and so it
does not take programmers very long at

7056
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
does not take programmers very long at
 

7057
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,109
does not take programmers very long at
all to learn

7058
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:05,119
all to learn
 

7059
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:06,149
all to learn
sub-l

7060
02:10:06,149 --> 02:10:06,159
sub-l
 

7061
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:08,229
sub-l
and that's something which can then be

7062
02:10:08,229 --> 02:10:08,239
and that's something which can then be
 

7063
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:11,109
and that's something which can then be
translated efficiently into

7064
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:11,119
translated efficiently into
 

7065
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,910
translated efficiently into
java and for some of our programmers who

7066
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
java and for some of our programmers who
 

7067
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,910
java and for some of our programmers who
are doing say user interface work then

7068
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:15,920
are doing say user interface work then
 

7069
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:17,830
are doing say user interface work then
they never have to even learn

7070
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:17,840
they never have to even learn
 

7071
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:21,350
they never have to even learn
sub-l they just have to learn apis into

7072
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
sub-l they just have to learn apis into
 

7073
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,589
sub-l they just have to learn apis into
the the basic uh psych engine so you're

7074
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
the the basic uh psych engine so you're
 

7075
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:26,149
the the basic uh psych engine so you're
not necessarily feeling the burden of

7076
02:10:26,149 --> 02:10:26,159
not necessarily feeling the burden of
 

7077
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:27,830
not necessarily feeling the burden of
like it's it's extremely efficient

7078
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:27,840
like it's it's extremely efficient
 

7079
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,870
like it's it's extremely efficient
there's

7080
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:28,880
there's
 

7081
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,430
there's
um that's not a problem to solve

7082
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:31,440
um that's not a problem to solve
 

7083
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,109
um that's not a problem to solve
okay right right the other thing is

7084
02:10:33,109 --> 02:10:33,119
okay right right the other thing is
 

7085
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:35,109
okay right right the other thing is
remember that we're talking about hiring

7086
02:10:35,109 --> 02:10:35,119
remember that we're talking about hiring
 

7087
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:36,390
remember that we're talking about hiring
programmers

7088
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,400
programmers
 

7089
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,550
programmers
to do inference who are

7090
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:38,560
to do inference who are
 

7091
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,629
to do inference who are
programmers interested in effectively

7092
02:10:40,629 --> 02:10:40,639
programmers interested in effectively
 

7093
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:43,189
programmers interested in effectively
automatic theorem proving right and so

7094
02:10:43,189 --> 02:10:43,199
automatic theorem proving right and so
 

7095
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:45,910
automatic theorem proving right and so
those are people already predisposed to

7096
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:45,920
those are people already predisposed to
 

7097
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,470
those are people already predisposed to
representing things in logic and so on

7098
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:48,480
representing things in logic and so on
 

7099
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,629
representing things in logic and so on
and lisp really was

7100
02:10:50,629 --> 02:10:50,639
and lisp really was
 

7101
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:53,430
and lisp really was
the programming live language

7102
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:53,440
the programming live language
 

7103
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,910
the programming live language
based on logic that john mccarthy and

7104
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:55,920
based on logic that john mccarthy and
 

7105
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,950
based on logic that john mccarthy and
others who developed it basically create

7106
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:58,960
others who developed it basically create
 

7107
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,589
others who developed it basically create
took the the formalisms that alonso

7108
02:11:01,589 --> 02:11:01,599
took the the formalisms that alonso
 

7109
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:02,950
took the the formalisms that alonso
church and other

7110
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:02,960
church and other
 

7111
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,270
church and other
philosophers other logicians

7112
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:05,280
philosophers other logicians
 

7113
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,510
philosophers other logicians
had come up with and basically said can

7114
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:07,520
had come up with and basically said can
 

7115
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,990
had come up with and basically said can
we basically make a programming la

7116
02:11:09,990 --> 02:11:10,000
we basically make a programming la
 

7117
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,510
we basically make a programming la
language which is effectively logic

7118
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:13,520
language which is effectively logic
 

7119
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:14,550
language which is effectively logic
and so

7120
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:14,560
and so
 

7121
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,189
and so
since we're talking about reasoning

7122
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:17,199
since we're talking about reasoning
 

7123
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:20,790
since we're talking about reasoning
in about expressions written in this

7124
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
in about expressions written in this
 

7125
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,030
in about expressions written in this
logical epistemological language and

7126
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:23,040
logical epistemological language and
 

7127
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,709
logical epistemological language and
we're doing operations which are

7128
02:11:24,709 --> 02:11:24,719
we're doing operations which are
 

7129
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,030
we're doing operations which are
effectively like theorem proving type

7130
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,040
effectively like theorem proving type
 

7131
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,750
effectively like theorem proving type
operations and so on there's a natural

7132
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:29,760
operations and so on there's a natural
 

7133
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,390
operations and so on there's a natural
impedance match between

7134
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:32,400
impedance match between
 

7135
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:33,830
impedance match between
lisp and

7136
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:33,840
lisp and
 

7137
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,030
lisp and
the the knowledge the way it's

7138
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
the the knowledge the way it's
 

7139
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,430
the the knowledge the way it's
represented so i guess you could say

7140
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
represented so i guess you could say
 

7141
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,629
represented so i guess you could say
it's a perfectly logical language to use

7142
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:40,639
it's a perfectly logical language to use
 

7143
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:42,550
it's a perfectly logical language to use
oh yes

7144
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:42,560
oh yes
 

7145
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,669
oh yes
okay i'm sorry

7146
02:11:43,669 --> 02:11:43,679
okay i'm sorry
 

7147
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:45,910
okay i'm sorry
i'll even let you uh get away with that

7148
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
i'll even let you uh get away with that
 

7149
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,750
i'll even let you uh get away with that
[\h__\h] that thing

7150
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:47,760
[\h__\h] that thing
 

7151
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,790
[\h__\h] that thing
so

7152
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:48,800
so
 

7153
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,310
so
i'll probably use that in the future

7154
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:50,320
i'll probably use that in the future
 

7155
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,189
i'll probably use that in the future

have to be able to

7173
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,510
new helpful hl modules and how they'll
work with each other and

7174
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
work with each other and
 

7175
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,990
work with each other and
looking at things that are taking a long

7176
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:14,000
looking at things that are taking a long
 

7177
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,830
looking at things that are taking a long

efficient so

7182
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:20,880

let me just give you one very simple

7184
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:22,480
let me just give you one very simple
 

7185
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,390
let me just give you one very simple
example which is when you have a

7186
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:24,400
example which is when you have a
 

7187
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:27,189
example which is when you have a
transitive relation like larger than

7188
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:27,199
transitive relation like larger than
 

7189
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:28,950
transitive relation like larger than
this is larger than that which is larger

7190
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:28,960
this is larger than that which is larger
 

7191
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,390
this is larger than that which is larger
than that which is larger than that so

7192
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
than that which is larger than that so
 

7193
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,550
than that which is larger than that so
the first thing must be larger than

7194
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
the first thing must be larger than
 

7195
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,669
the first thing must be larger than
the last thing whenever you have a

7196
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:33,679
the last thing whenever you have a
 

7197
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:35,910
the last thing whenever you have a
transitive relation

7198
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:35,920
transitive relation
 

7199
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,390

02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
if you're not careful if i ask whether
 

7201
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,229
if you're not careful if i ask whether
this thing over here is larger than the

02:12:40,229 --> 02:12:40,239
this thing over here is larger than the
 

7203

this thing over here is larger than the

7204
02:12:41,669 --> 02:12:41,679
thing over here i'll have to do some
 

7205
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:44,950
thing over here i'll have to do some
kind of graph walk or theorem proving

7206
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:44,960
kind of graph walk or theorem proving
 

7207
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:47,189
kind of graph walk or theorem proving
that might involve like 5 or 10 or 20 or

02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:47,199
that might involve like 5 or 10 or 20 or
 

7209
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:48,390
that might involve like 5 or 10 or 20 or
30 steps

7217
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,189
the transit of closure the cleaning star
of that transit of relation now you have

7218
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
of that transit of relation now you have
 

7219
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:58,709
of that transit of relation now you have
this big table

7220
02:12:58,709 --> 02:12:58,719
this big table
 

7221
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:01,109
this big table
but you can always guarantee that in one

7222
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
but you can always guarantee that in one
 

7223
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,990
but you can always guarantee that in one
single step you can just look up whether

7224
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
single step you can just look up whether
 

7225
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,470
single step you can just look up whether
this is larger than that

7226
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:06,480
this is larger than that
 

7227
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,830
this is larger than that
and so

7228
02:13:07,830 --> 02:13:07,840
and so
 

7229
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:08,709
and so
we

7230
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
we
 

7231
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,270
we
there are lots of cases where storage is

7232
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:11,280
there are lots of cases where storage is
 

7233
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,990
there are lots of cases where storage is
cheap today and so by having this extra

7234
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,000
cheap today and so by having this extra
 

7235
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,030

very very efficiently
and let me give you one other

and we'll notice that

02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:35,520
and we'll notice that
 

7253
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,550
and we'll notice that
things very much like it syntactically

02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:38,560
things very much like it syntactically
 

7255
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:41,030
things very much like it syntactically
come up again and again and again so

7256
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,040
come up again and again and again so
 

7257
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,510
come up again and again and again so
we'll create a whole brand new relation

we'll create a whole brand new relation
 

7259

now we have

inference process so rip so now we've

7296
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:27,760
inference process so rip so now we've
 

7297
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,470
inference process so rip so now we've
covered about four of the 150 um good

7298
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
covered about four of the 150 um good
 

7299
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,229
covered about four of the 150 um good
ideas i said that's a nice that's the

7300
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:32,239
ideas i said that's a nice that's the
 

7301
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:34,149
ideas i said that's a nice that's the
cool so that idea in particular is like

7302
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:34,159
cool so that idea in particular is like
 

7303
02:14:34,159 --> 02:14:36,069
cool so that idea in particular is like
a nice compression that turns out to be

7304
02:14:36,069 --> 02:14:36,079
a nice compression that turns out to be
 

7305
02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:37,510
a nice compression that turns out to be
really useful yes that's really

7306
02:14:37,510 --> 02:14:37,520
really useful yes that's really
 

7307
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,709
really useful yes that's really
interesting i mean this whole thing is

7308
02:14:38,709 --> 02:14:38,719
interesting i mean this whole thing is
 

7309
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:40,629
interesting i mean this whole thing is
just fascinating from a philosophical

there's part of me
 

7313
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,069
there's part of me
i mean it makes me a little bit sad

7314
02:14:44,069 --> 02:14:44,079
i mean it makes me a little bit sad
 

7315
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:45,589
i mean it makes me a little bit sad

in philosophy who've taught logic for
 

7381
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:58,470
in philosophy who've taught logic for
years and so on and they're just they're

02:15:58,470 --> 02:15:58,480
years and so on and they're just they're
 

7383

just awful but the converse is true so
 

7385
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:03,109
just awful but the converse is true so
one of the best ontological engineers we

a great at this task this task
 

7445
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,230
a great at this task this task
of converting

7446
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:12,240
of converting
 

7447
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,309
of converting
the messiness of human language and

knowledge yeah into formal logic this is

7450
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:17,280
knowledge yeah into formal logic this is
 

7451
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:19,509
knowledge yeah into formal logic this is
very much like what um alan turing had

7452
02:17:19,509 --> 02:17:19,519
very much like what um alan turing had
 

7453
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:22,150
very much like what um alan turing had
to do during world war ii uh in trying

02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
to do during world war ii uh in trying
 

7455
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,990
to do during world war ii uh in trying
to find people to bring to bletchley

7456
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,000
to find people to bring to bletchley
 

7457

and
often

7558
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:20,800
often
 

7559
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:23,190
often
the people who are going to be good at

7560
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:23,200
the people who are going to be good at
 

7561

the people who are going to be good at
ontological engineering will give me

7562
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:25,040
ontological engineering will give me
 

7563
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,830
ontological engineering will give me
some causal explanation or will refer to

7564
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:27,840
some causal explanation or will refer to
 

7565
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:29,830
some causal explanation or will refer to
some things that are true in the world

7566
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
some things that are true in the world
 

7567
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,910
some things that are true in the world
so if you imagine a sentence like the

7568
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:31,920
so if you imagine a sentence like the
 

7569
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:34,230
so if you imagine a sentence like the
horse was led into the barn while its

7570
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:34,240
horse was led into the barn while its
 

7571
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:35,910
horse was led into the barn while its
head was still wet

7572
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:35,920
head was still wet
 

7573
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,910
head was still wet
and so its head refers to the horse's

7574
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
and so its head refers to the horse's
 

7575
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,469
and so its head refers to the horse's
head but how do you know that and so

7576
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479
head but how do you know that and so
 

7577
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:42,070
head but how do you know that and so
some people will say i just know it some

7578
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:42,080
some people will say i just know it some
 

7579
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,750
some people will say i just know it some
people will say well the horse was the

7580
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:43,760
people will say well the horse was the
 

7581
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,349
people will say well the horse was the
subject of the sentence

7582
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
subject of the sentence
 

7583
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:47,190
subject of the sentence
and i'll say okay well what about the

7584
02:19:47,190 --> 02:19:47,200
and i'll say okay well what about the
 

7585
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,030
and i'll say okay well what about the
horse was led into the barn while its

7586
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:49,040
horse was led into the barn while its
 

7587
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,670
horse was led into the barn while its
roof was still wet now its roof

7588
02:19:51,670 --> 02:19:51,680
roof was still wet now its roof
 

7589
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,070
roof was still wet now its roof
obviously refers to the barn

7590
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:54,080
obviously refers to the barn
 

7591
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:56,389
obviously refers to the barn
and so then they'll say oh well that's

7592
02:19:56,389 --> 02:19:56,399
and so then they'll say oh well that's
 

7593
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:58,710
and so then they'll say oh well that's
because it's the closest noun and so on

7594
02:19:58,710 --> 02:19:58,720
because it's the closest noun and so on
 

7595
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:01,030
because it's the closest noun and so on
so basically if they try to give me

7596
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:01,040
so basically if they try to give me
 

7597
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:04,550
so basically if they try to give me
answers which are based on syntax and

7598
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:04,560
answers which are based on syntax and
 

7599
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,550
answers which are based on syntax and
grammar and so on that's a really bad

7600
02:20:06,550 --> 02:20:06,560
grammar and so on that's a really bad
 

7601
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:08,790
grammar and so on that's a really bad
sign but if they're able to say things

7602
02:20:08,790 --> 02:20:08,800
sign but if they're able to say things
 

7603
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:11,270
sign but if they're able to say things
like well horses have heads and barns

7604
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
like well horses have heads and barns
 

7605
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,270
like well horses have heads and barns
don't and barns have roofs and horses

7606
02:20:13,270 --> 02:20:13,280
don't and barns have roofs and horses
 

7607
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,230
don't and barns have roofs and horses
don't

7608
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:14,240
don't
 

7609
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:16,309
don't
then that's a positive sign that they're

7610
02:20:16,309 --> 02:20:16,319
then that's a positive sign that they're
 

7611
02:20:16,319 --> 02:20:17,510
then that's a positive sign that they're
going to be good at this because they

7612
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:17,520
going to be good at this because they

02:23:12,479 --> 02:23:14,150
intelligence
so you uh in terms of tests of

7774
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:14,160
so you uh in terms of tests of
 

7775
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,550
so you uh in terms of tests of
intelligence uh you know

7776
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:16,560
intelligence uh you know
 

7777
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:18,870
intelligence uh you know
with the lobner prize which is a very

7778
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
with the lobner prize which is a very
 

7779
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:19,910
with the lobner prize which is a very
kind of

7780
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:19,920
kind of
 

7781
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:21,670
kind of
you want to say a more strict

7782
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:21,680
you want to say a more strict
 

7783
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,590
you want to say a more strict
formulation of the touring test as

7784
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:23,600
formulation of the touring test as
 

7785
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,670
formulation of the touring test as
originally formulated and then there's

7786
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:25,680
originally formulated and then there's
 

7787
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:29,750
originally formulated and then there's
something like alexa prize which is more

7788
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:29,760
something like alexa prize which is more
 

7789
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,190
something like alexa prize which is more
i would say a more interesting

7790
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,200
i would say a more interesting
 

7791
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:33,990
i would say a more interesting
formulation of the test which is like

7792
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:34,000
formulation of the test which is like
 

7793
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,030
formulation of the test which is like
uh

7794
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
uh
 

7795
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,030
uh
ultimately the metric is how long does a

7796
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:37,040
ultimately the metric is how long does a
 

7797
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,349
ultimately the metric is how long does a
human want to talk to the hai system so

7798
02:23:39,349 --> 02:23:39,359
human want to talk to the hai system so
 

7799
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:41,910
human want to talk to the hai system so
it's like the goal is you want it to be

7800
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:41,920
it's like the goal is you want it to be
 

7801
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,429
it's like the goal is you want it to be
20 minutes

7802
02:23:43,429 --> 02:23:43,439
20 minutes
 

7803
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:45,190
20 minutes
it's basically

7804
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:45,200
it's basically
 

7805
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:46,750
it's basically
not just have a

7806
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:46,760
not just have a
 

7807
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,550
not just have a
convincing

7808
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:48,560
convincing
 

7809
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:50,630
convincing
conversation but more like a compelling

7810
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:50,640
conversation but more like a compelling
 

7811
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:53,110
conversation but more like a compelling
one or a fun one or an interesting one

7812
02:23:53,110 --> 02:23:53,120
one or a fun one or an interesting one
 

7813
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:55,270
one or a fun one or an interesting one
and that that seems like more to the

7814
02:23:55,270 --> 02:23:55,280
and that that seems like more to the
 

7815
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:56,389
and that that seems like more to the
spirit

7816
02:23:56,389 --> 02:23:56,399
spirit
 

7817
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:58,710
spirit
maybe of um

7818
02:23:58,710 --> 02:23:58,720
maybe of um
 

7819
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:01,110
maybe of um
of what uh touring was imagining but

7820
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:01,120
of what uh touring was imagining but
 

7821
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,349
of what uh touring was imagining but
what for you do you think in the space

7822
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
what for you do you think in the space
 

7823
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:06,630
what for you do you think in the space
of tests is a is a good test like when

7824
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:06,640
of tests is a is a good test like when
 

7825
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:09,110
of tests is a is a good test like when
you see a system based on psych that

7826
02:24:09,110 --> 02:24:09,120
you see a system based on psych that
 

7827
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:10,710
you see a system based on psych that
passes that test

7828
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:10,720
passes that test
 

7829
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:12,550
passes that test
you'd be like damn

7830
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:12,560
you'd be like damn
 

7831
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:16,469
you'd be like damn
we've created something special here

7832
02:24:16,469 --> 02:24:16,479

 

7833
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:18,469

the the test has to be something

7834
02:24:18,469 --> 02:24:18,479
the the test has to be something
 

7835
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:20,469
the the test has to be something
involving

7836
02:24:20,469 --> 02:24:20,479
involving
 

7837
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:22,550
involving
depth of reasoning and recursiveness of

7838
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:22,560
depth of reasoning and recursiveness of
 

7839
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:25,510
depth of reasoning and recursiveness of
reasoning the ability to answer

7840
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:25,520
reasoning the ability to answer
 

7841
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,830
reasoning the ability to answer
repeated why questions about the answer

7842
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:27,840
repeated why questions about the answer
 

7843
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,590
repeated why questions about the answer
you just gave

7844
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:29,600
you just gave
 

7845
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:31,349
you just gave
it's how many wide questions in a row

7846
02:24:31,349 --> 02:24:31,359
it's how many wide questions in a row
 

7847
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:32,710
it's how many wide questions in a row
can you keep answering something

7848
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:32,720
can you keep answering something
 

7849
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:34,870
can you keep answering something
something like that and

7850
02:24:34,870 --> 02:24:34,880
something like that and
 

7851
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:36,230
something like that and
um

7852
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:36,240
um
 

7853
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,630
um
have like a young curious child and an

7854
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:38,640
have like a young curious child and an
 

7855
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:40,870
have like a young curious child and an
ai system and how long will any ad

7856
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:40,880
ai system and how long will any ad
 

7857
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:43,349
ai system and how long will any ad
system last before it wants to quit yes

7858
02:24:43,349 --> 02:24:43,359
system last before it wants to quit yes
 

7859
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:45,270
system last before it wants to quit yes
and again that's not the only test

7860
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:45,280
and again that's not the only test
 

7861
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,750
and again that's not the only test
another one has to do with argumentation

7862
02:24:47,750 --> 02:24:47,760
another one has to do with argumentation
 

7863
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:51,030
another one has to do with argumentation
in other words here's a proposition um

7864
02:24:51,030 --> 02:24:51,040
in other words here's a proposition um
 

7865
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,750
in other words here's a proposition um
come up with pro and con

7866
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:53,760
come up with pro and con
 

7867
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,110
come up with pro and con
arguments

7868
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:55,120
arguments
 

7869
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:57,910
arguments
for it and try and

7870
02:24:57,910 --> 02:24:57,920
for it and try and
 

7871
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:00,469
for it and try and
give me convincing arguments on both

7872
02:25:00,469 --> 02:25:00,479
give me convincing arguments on both
 

7873
02:25:00,479 --> 02:25:01,910
give me convincing arguments on both
sides

7874
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:01,920
sides
 

7875
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:02,950
sides
and

7876
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:02,960
and
 

7877
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:05,270
and
so that's that's another important kind

7878
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:05,280
so that's that's another important kind
 

7879
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,190
so that's that's another important kind
of ability that

7880
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:07,200
of ability that
 

7881
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:09,510
of ability that
the system needs to be able to exhibit

7882
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:09,520
the system needs to be able to exhibit
 

7883
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:11,190
the system needs to be able to exhibit
in order to really be

7884
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:11,200
in order to really be
 

7885
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:14,070
in order to really be
intelligent i think so there's certain i

7886
02:25:14,070 --> 02:25:14,080
intelligent i think so there's certain i
 

7887
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,710
intelligent i think so there's certain i
mean if you look at ibm watson and like

7888
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:16,720
mean if you look at ibm watson and like
 

7889
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,550
mean if you look at ibm watson and like
certain impressive accomplishments for

7890
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:18,560
certain impressive accomplishments for
 

7891
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,230
certain impressive accomplishments for
very specific

7892
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:20,240
very specific
 

7893
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:24,309
very specific
tests almost like a demo right um there

7894
02:25:24,309 --> 02:25:24,319
tests almost like a demo right um there
 

7895
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:26,309
tests almost like a demo right um there
is some

7896
02:25:26,309 --> 02:25:26,319
is some
 

7897
02:25:26,319 --> 02:25:29,990
is some
uh like i talked to the guy who led

7898
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:30,000
uh like i talked to the guy who led
 

7899
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,349
uh like i talked to the guy who led
the

7900
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
the
 

7901
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:33,670
the
the jeopardy effort

7902
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:33,680
the jeopardy effort
 

7903
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,750
the jeopardy effort
and there's some kind of hard-coding

7904
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
and there's some kind of hard-coding
 

7905
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,790
and there's some kind of hard-coding
heuristics uh tricks that you try to

7906
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:38,800
heuristics uh tricks that you try to
 

7907
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,389
heuristics uh tricks that you try to
pull it all together to make the thing

7908
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:40,399
pull it all together to make the thing
 

7909
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:42,710
pull it all together to make the thing
work in the end for this thing right

7910
02:25:42,710 --> 02:25:42,720
work in the end for this thing right
 

7911
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:44,550
work in the end for this thing right
that seems to be one of the lessons with

7912
02:25:44,550 --> 02:25:44,560
that seems to be one of the lessons with
 

7913
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:47,270
that seems to be one of the lessons with
ai is like

7914
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
ai is like
 

7915
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,950
ai is like
that's the fastest way to get a solution

7916
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:48,960
that's the fastest way to get a solution
 

7917
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:51,349
that's the fastest way to get a solution
that's pretty damn impressive so so here

7918
02:25:51,349 --> 02:25:51,359
that's pretty damn impressive so so here
 

7919
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,510
that's pretty damn impressive so so here
here's what i would say is that

7920
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,520

 

7921
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,990

as impressive as that was

7922
02:25:57,990 --> 02:25:58,000
as impressive as that was
 

7923
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,590
as impressive as that was
it made some mistakes but more

7924
02:25:59,590 --> 02:25:59,600
it made some mistakes but more
 

7925
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:01,510
it made some mistakes but more
importantly

7926
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:01,520
importantly
 

7927
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,110
importantly
many of the mistakes it made were

7928
02:26:03,110 --> 02:26:03,120
many of the mistakes it made were
 

7929
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,670
many of the mistakes it made were
mistakes which no human would have made

7930
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,680
mistakes which no human would have made
 

7931
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:06,790
mistakes which no human would have made
yeah

7932
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:06,800
yeah
 

7933
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,389
yeah
and

7934
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
and
 

7935
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:10,710
and
so part of the

7936
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
so part of the
 

7937
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:11,750
so part of the
the the

7938
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:11,760
the the
 

7939
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:12,710
the the
new

7940
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
new
 

7941
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,510
new
or augmented touring tests would have to

7942
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,520
or augmented touring tests would have to
 

7943
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,469
or augmented touring tests would have to
be

7944
02:26:16,469 --> 02:26:16,479
be
 

7945
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:19,750
be
and the mistakes you make are ones which

7946
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:19,760
and the mistakes you make are ones which
 

7947
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:22,389
and the mistakes you make are ones which
humans don't basically look at and say

7948
02:26:22,389 --> 02:26:22,399
humans don't basically look at and say
 

7949
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:23,270
humans don't basically look at and say
what

7950
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:23,280
what
 

7951
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,070
what
yeah

7952
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,080
yeah
 

7953
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:25,750
yeah
so for example

7954
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:25,760
so for example
 

7955
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,670
so for example
there was a

7956
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:27,680
there was a
 

7957
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,349
there was a
um a question about which 16th century

7958
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:31,359
um a question about which 16th century
 

7959
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:34,550
um a question about which 16th century
italian politician blah blah blah and

7960
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:34,560
italian politician blah blah blah and
 

7961
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:37,030
italian politician blah blah blah and
watson said ronald reagan

7962
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:37,040
watson said ronald reagan
 

7963
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,110
watson said ronald reagan
so most americans would have gotten that

7964
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
so most americans would have gotten that
 

7965
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,270
so most americans would have gotten that
question wrong but they would never have

7966
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:41,280
question wrong but they would never have
 

7967
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,670
question wrong but they would never have
said ronald reagan as an answer

7968
02:26:43,670 --> 02:26:43,680
said ronald reagan as an answer
 

7969
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:44,790
said ronald reagan as an answer
because

7970
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:44,800
because
 

7971
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,750
because
you know

7972
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:45,760
you know
 

7973
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:48,230
you know
among the things they know is that he

7974
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:48,240
among the things they know is that he
 

7975
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:50,309
among the things they know is that he
lived relatively recently and people

7976
02:26:50,309 --> 02:26:50,319
lived relatively recently and people
 

7977
02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:53,030
lived relatively recently and people
don't really live 400 years and you know

7978
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:53,040
don't really live 400 years and you know
 

7979
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,670
don't really live 400 years and you know
things like that so that that's i think

7980
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:55,680
things like that so that that's i think
 

7981
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,550
things like that so that that's i think
a very important thing which is um if

7982
02:26:58,550 --> 02:26:58,560
a very important thing which is um if
 

7983
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,630
a very important thing which is um if
it's making mistakes which

7984
02:27:00,630 --> 02:27:00,640
it's making mistakes which
 

7985
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:03,910
it's making mistakes which
no normal sane human would have made

7986
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:03,920
no normal sane human would have made
 

7987
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,830
no normal sane human would have made
then that's a really bad sign and if

7988
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:05,840
then that's a really bad sign and if
 

7989
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:08,070
then that's a really bad sign and if
it's not making those kinds of mistakes

7990
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,080
it's not making those kinds of mistakes
 

7991
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:10,230
it's not making those kinds of mistakes
then that's a good sign and i don't

7992
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:10,240
then that's a good sign and i don't
 

7993
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,870
then that's a good sign and i don't
think it's any one very very simple test

7994
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:12,880
think it's any one very very simple test
 

7995
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,309
think it's any one very very simple test
i think it's all of the things you

7996
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:14,319
i think it's all of the things you
 

7997
02:27:14,319 --> 02:27:15,830
i think it's all of the things you
mentioned all the things i mentioned

7998
02:27:15,830 --> 02:27:15,840
mentioned all the things i mentioned
 

7999
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,550
mentioned all the things i mentioned
there's really a battery of tests which

8000
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:18,560
there's really a battery of tests which
 

8001
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:21,110
there's really a battery of tests which
together if it passes almost all of

8002
02:27:21,110 --> 02:27:21,120
together if it passes almost all of
 

8003
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:23,830
together if it passes almost all of
these tests it'd be hard to argue that

8004
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:23,840
these tests it'd be hard to argue that
 

8005
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,469
these tests it'd be hard to argue that
it's not intelligent and if it fails

8006
02:27:26,469 --> 02:27:26,479
it's not intelligent and if it fails
 

8007
02:27:26,479 --> 02:27:28,630
it's not intelligent and if it fails
some several of these tests it's really

8008
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:28,640
some several of these tests it's really
 

8009
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,790
some several of these tests it's really
hard to argue that it really understands

8010
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
hard to argue that it really understands
 

8011
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,230
hard to argue that it really understands
what it's doing that it really is

8012
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:32,240
what it's doing that it really is
 

8013
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:34,710
what it's doing that it really is
generally intelligent so to pass all of

8014
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:34,720
generally intelligent so to pass all of
 

8015
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,389
generally intelligent so to pass all of
those tests

8016
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:36,399
those tests
 

8017
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:37,910
those tests
you know we've talked a lot about psych

8018
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:37,920
you know we've talked a lot about psych
 

8019
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:40,630
you know we've talked a lot about psych
and knowledge and reasoning

8020
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:40,640
and knowledge and reasoning
 

8021
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,550
and knowledge and reasoning
do you think this ai system would need

8022
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:42,560
do you think this ai system would need
 

8023
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:46,550
do you think this ai system would need
to have some other human-like elements

8024
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:46,560
to have some other human-like elements
 

8025
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,710
to have some other human-like elements
for example a body

8026
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:48,720
for example a body
 

8027
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,190
for example a body
or a physical manifestation in this

8028
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
or a physical manifestation in this
 

8029
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,389
or a physical manifestation in this
world

8030
02:27:52,389 --> 02:27:52,399
world
 

8031
02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:54,790
world
and another one which seems to be

8032
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:54,800
and another one which seems to be
 

8033
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,389
and another one which seems to be
fundamental to

8034
02:27:56,389 --> 02:27:56,399
fundamental to
 

8035
02:27:56,399 --> 02:27:59,750
fundamental to
the human experience is consciousness

8036
02:27:59,750 --> 02:27:59,760
the human experience is consciousness
 

8037
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:01,830
the human experience is consciousness
the subjective experience of what it's

8038
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:01,840
the subjective experience of what it's
 

8039
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:04,469
the subjective experience of what it's
like to actually be you

8040
02:28:04,469 --> 02:28:04,479
like to actually be you
 

8041
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:06,389
like to actually be you
do you think he needs those to be able

8042
02:28:06,389 --> 02:28:06,399
do you think he needs those to be able
 

8043
02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:08,309
do you think he needs those to be able
to pass all those tests and to achieve

8044
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
to pass all those tests and to achieve
 

8045
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:09,590
to pass all those tests and to achieve
general intelligence it's a good

8046
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:09,600
general intelligence it's a good
 

8047
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,830
general intelligence it's a good
question i think in the case of a body

8048
02:28:11,830 --> 02:28:11,840
question i think in the case of a body
 

8049
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:14,469
question i think in the case of a body
uh no i know there are a lot of people

8050
02:28:14,469 --> 02:28:14,479
uh no i know there are a lot of people
 

8051
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:16,230
uh no i know there are a lot of people
like penrose who would have uh disagreed

8052
02:28:16,230 --> 02:28:16,240
like penrose who would have uh disagreed
 

8053
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:18,070
like penrose who would have uh disagreed
with me and so on

8054
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:18,080
with me and so on
 

8055
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:18,790
with me and so on
and

8056
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,800
and
 

8057
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:20,070
and
and others but

8058
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,080
and others but
 

8059
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,910
and others but
no i don't think it needs to have a body

8060
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:21,920
no i don't think it needs to have a body
 

8061
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,190
no i don't think it needs to have a body
in order to be

8062
02:28:23,190 --> 02:28:23,200
in order to be
 

8063
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:25,910
in order to be
intelligent i think that it needs to be

8064
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:25,920
intelligent i think that it needs to be
 

8065
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:28,870
intelligent i think that it needs to be
able to talk about

8066
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:28,880
able to talk about
 

8067
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,750
able to talk about
uh having a body and having sensations

8068
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:31,760
uh having a body and having sensations
 

8069
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,230
uh having a body and having sensations
and having emotions and so on it doesn't

8070
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:34,240
and having emotions and so on it doesn't
 

8071
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:35,590
and having emotions and so on it doesn't
actually have to

8072
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:35,600
actually have to
 

8073
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,389
actually have to
have

8074
02:28:36,389 --> 02:28:36,399
have
 

8075
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:38,790
have
all of that but it has to understand it

8076
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:38,800
all of that but it has to understand it
 

8077
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:41,270
all of that but it has to understand it
in the same way that helen keller was

8078
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:41,280
in the same way that helen keller was
 

8079
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,190
in the same way that helen keller was
perfectly intelligent and able to talk

8080
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:43,200
perfectly intelligent and able to talk
 

8081
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,309
perfectly intelligent and able to talk
about

8082
02:28:44,309 --> 02:28:44,319
about
 

8083
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:46,950
about
colors and sounds and

8084
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:46,960
colors and sounds and
 

8085
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,070
colors and sounds and
shapes and

8086
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,080
shapes and
 

8087
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,309
shapes and
and so on even though

8088
02:28:50,309 --> 02:28:50,319
and so on even though
 

8089
02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:52,230
and so on even though
she didn't directly experience all the

8090
02:28:52,230 --> 02:28:52,240
she didn't directly experience all the
 

8091
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:56,070
she didn't directly experience all the
same things that the rest of us do so

8092
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:56,080
same things that the rest of us do so
 

8093
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:58,630
same things that the rest of us do so
knowledge of it and being able to

8094
02:28:58,630 --> 02:28:58,640
knowledge of it and being able to
 

8095
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,630
knowledge of it and being able to
correctly

8096
02:29:00,630 --> 02:29:00,640
correctly
 

8097
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,870
correctly
make use of that

8098
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:02,880
make use of that
 

8099
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:05,190
make use of that
is certainly an important facility but

8134
02:29:40,230 --> 02:29:40,240
now
 

8135
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:40,950
now
but

8136
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:40,960
but
 

8137
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:43,270
but
in the same sense psych is conscious in

8138
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:43,280
in the same sense psych is conscious in
 

8139
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,110
in the same sense psych is conscious in
that same sense already where of course

8140
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:45,120
that same sense already where of course
 

8141
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,429
that same sense already where of course
it understands it's a computer program

8142
02:29:47,429 --> 02:29:47,439
it understands it's a computer program
 

8143
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:49,349
it understands it's a computer program
it understands where and when it's

8144
02:29:49,349 --> 02:29:49,359
it understands where and when it's
 

8145
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:51,110
it understands where and when it's
running it understands who's talking to

8146
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,120
running it understands who's talking to
 

8147
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:53,510
running it understands who's talking to
it it understands what its task is what

8148
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,520
it it understands what its task is what
 

8149
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,190
it it understands what its task is what
its goals are what its current problem

8150
02:29:55,190 --> 02:29:55,200
its goals are what its current problem
 

8151
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:57,190
its goals are what its current problem
is that it's working on it understands

8152
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:57,200
is that it's working on it understands
 

8153
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,950
is that it's working on it understands
how long it's spent on things what it's

8154
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:58,960
how long it's spent on things what it's
 

8155
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:01,190
how long it's spent on things what it's
tried it understands what it's done in

8156
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:01,200
tried it understands what it's done in
 

8157
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,550
tried it understands what it's done in
the past

8158
02:30:02,550 --> 02:30:02,560
the past
 

8159
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,870
the past
and so on um and

8160
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
and so on um and
 

8161
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:07,429
and so on um and
uh you know if if we want to call that

8162
02:30:07,429 --> 02:30:07,439
uh you know if if we want to call that
 

8163
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:10,230
uh you know if if we want to call that
consciousness then yes psych is already

8164
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:10,240
consciousness then yes psych is already
 

8165
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:12,389
consciousness then yes psych is already
conscious but i don't think that i would

8166
02:30:12,389 --> 02:30:12,399
conscious but i don't think that i would
 

8167
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:14,389
conscious but i don't think that i would
ascribe anything

8168
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
ascribe anything
 

8169
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:16,950
ascribe anything
mystical to that again some people would

8170
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:16,960
mystical to that again some people would
 

8171
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:18,469
mystical to that again some people would
but i would i would say that you know

8172
02:30:18,469 --> 02:30:18,479
but i would i would say that you know
 

8173
02:30:18,479 --> 02:30:20,630
but i would i would say that you know
other than other than our own personal

8174
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:20,640
other than other than our own personal
 

8175
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,950
other than other than our own personal
experience of consciousness um we're

8176
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:22,960
experience of consciousness um we're
 

8177
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,190
experience of consciousness um we're
just treating everyone else in the world

8178
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,200
just treating everyone else in the world
 

8179
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,230
just treating everyone else in the world
um so to speak um at their word about

8180
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:28,240
um so to speak um at their word about
 

8181
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:31,030
um so to speak um at their word about
being conscious and so if

8182
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,040
being conscious and so if
 

8183
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,349
being conscious and so if
if a computer program if an ai is able

8184
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:33,359
if a computer program if an ai is able
 

8185
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:34,469
if a computer program if an ai is able
to

8186
02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:34,479
to
 

8187
02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:35,590
to
exhibit

8188
02:30:35,590 --> 02:30:35,600
exhibit
 

8189
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:38,710
exhibit
all the same kinds of

8190
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:38,720
all the same kinds of
 

8191
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,389
all the same kinds of
response as you would expect of a

8192
02:30:40,389 --> 02:30:40,399
response as you would expect of a
 

8193
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:42,150
response as you would expect of a
conscious entity

8194
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,160
conscious entity
 

8195
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:44,230
conscious entity
then you know it doesn't doesn't it

8196
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,240
then you know it doesn't doesn't it
 

8197
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,630
then you know it doesn't doesn't it
deserve the label of consciousness just

8198
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:46,640
deserve the label of consciousness just
 

8199
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:48,790
deserve the label of consciousness just
as much so there's another burden that

8200
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:48,800
as much so there's another burden that
 

8201
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,630
as much so there's another burden that
comes with this whole intelligence thing

8202
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:50,640
comes with this whole intelligence thing
 

8203
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:53,110
comes with this whole intelligence thing
that humans got is uh

8204
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,120
that humans got is uh
 

8205
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:55,670
that humans got is uh
the extinguishing

8206
02:30:55,670 --> 02:30:55,680
the extinguishing
 

8207
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:57,910
the extinguishing
of the light of consciousness which is

8208
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:57,920
of the light of consciousness which is
 

8209
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,750
of the light of consciousness which is
uh kind of realizing they were going to

8210
02:30:59,750 --> 02:30:59,760
uh kind of realizing they were going to
 

8211
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:02,309
uh kind of realizing they were going to
be dead someday

8212
02:31:02,309 --> 02:31:02,319
be dead someday
 

8213
02:31:02,319 --> 02:31:04,070
be dead someday
and there's a bunch of philosophers like

8214
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:04,080
and there's a bunch of philosophers like

who kind of think that this
 

8219
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:11,590
who kind of think that this
realization of mortality and then

8220
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:11,600
realization of mortality and then
 

8221
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,190
realization of mortality and then
fear sometimes they call it terror of

8222
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:15,200
fear sometimes they call it terror of

02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:58,790
is to fear the extinguishing of that
consciousness the fear of mortality

8262
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
consciousness the fear of mortality
 

8263
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,230
consciousness the fear of mortality
do you think that's useful for

8264
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:00,240
do you think that's useful for
 

8265
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,830
do you think that's useful for
intelligence

8266
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
intelligence
 

8267
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,070
intelligence
thinking like i might die and i really

8268
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
thinking like i might die and i really
 

8269
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,710
thinking like i might die and i really
don't want to die i i don't think so i

8270
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:06,720
don't want to die i i don't think so i
 

8271
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,389
don't want to die i i don't think so i
think it may help

8272
02:32:08,389 --> 02:32:08,399
think it may help
 

8273
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:11,429
think it may help
some humans to be

8274
02:32:11,429 --> 02:32:11,439
some humans to be
 

8275
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:13,910
some humans to be
um better people it may help some humans

8276
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:13,920
um better people it may help some humans
 

8277
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,429
um better people it may help some humans
to be more creative

8278
02:32:15,429 --> 02:32:15,439
to be more creative
 

8279
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:18,630
to be more creative
and so on i don't think it's necessary

8280
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:18,640
and so on i don't think it's necessary
 

8281
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:20,790
and so on i don't think it's necessary
for ais to

8282
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:20,800
for ais to
 

8283
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,110
for ais to
believe that they have limited lifespans

8284
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:23,120
believe that they have limited lifespans
 

8285
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,630
believe that they have limited lifespans
and therefore they should make the most

8286
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:24,640
and therefore they should make the most
 

8287
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:27,429
and therefore they should make the most
of their behavior maybe eventually

8288
02:32:27,429 --> 02:32:27,439
of their behavior maybe eventually
 

8289
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:29,270
of their behavior maybe eventually
the answer to that and my answer to that

8290
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:29,280
the answer to that and my answer to that
 

8291
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:31,510
the answer to that and my answer to that
will change but as of now i would say

8292
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:31,520
will change but as of now i would say
 

8293
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,309
will change but as of now i would say
that that's almost like a frill or a

8294
02:32:34,309 --> 02:32:34,319
that that's almost like a frill or a
 

8295
02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:36,150
that that's almost like a frill or a
side effect that

8296
02:32:36,150 --> 02:32:36,160
side effect that
 

8297
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,670
side effect that
is not in fact if you look at most

8298
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:37,680
is not in fact if you look at most
 

8299
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,630
is not in fact if you look at most
humans

8300
02:32:38,630 --> 02:32:38,640
humans
 

8301
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,070
humans
most humans

8302
02:32:40,070 --> 02:32:40,080
most humans
 

8303
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:41,910
most humans
um ignore the fact that they're going to

8304
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:41,920
um ignore the fact that they're going to
 

8305
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,750
um ignore the fact that they're going to
die most of the time

8306
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:43,760
die most of the time
 

8307
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,790
die most of the time
uh so

8308
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:44,800
uh so
 

8309
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,550
uh so
well but that's like

8310
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:46,560
well but that's like
 

8311
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:48,389
well but that's like
this goes to the white space between the

8312
02:32:48,389 --> 02:32:48,399
this goes to the white space between the
 

8313
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:49,510
this goes to the white space between the
words

8314
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:49,520
words
 

8315
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,070
words
so what ernest becker argues is that

8316
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:52,080
so what ernest becker argues is that
 

8317
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,750
so what ernest becker argues is that
that ignoring is we're living an

8318
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:53,760
that ignoring is we're living an
 

8319
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,670
that ignoring is we're living an
illusion that we're constructed on the

8320
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:55,680
illusion that we're constructed on the
 

8321
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:57,990
illusion that we're constructed on the
foundation of this terror so we're

8322
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:58,000
foundation of this terror so we're
 

8323
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,870
foundation of this terror so we're
escape life as we know it

8324
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:00,880
escape life as we know it
 

8325
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:04,630
escape life as we know it
pursuing things creating things love

8326
02:33:04,630 --> 02:33:04,640
pursuing things creating things love
 

8327
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:06,150
pursuing things creating things love
everything we can think of that's

8328
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
everything we can think of that's
 

8329
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:09,429
everything we can think of that's
beautiful about humanity is is just

8330
02:33:09,429 --> 02:33:09,439
beautiful about humanity is is just
 

8331
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:11,510
beautiful about humanity is is just
trying to escape this realization that

8332
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:11,520
trying to escape this realization that
 

8333
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,910
trying to escape this realization that
we're going to die one day that's his

8334
02:33:13,910 --> 02:33:13,920
we're going to die one day that's his
 

8335
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,750
we're going to die one day that's his
that's his idea and i think i don't know

8336
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:15,760
that's his idea and i think i don't know
 

8337
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:18,870
that's his idea and i think i don't know
if i i 100

8338
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:18,880
if i i 100
 

8339
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:21,429
if i i 100
believe in this but there's it certainly

8340
02:33:21,429 --> 02:33:21,439
believe in this but there's it certainly
 

8341
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:24,070
believe in this but there's it certainly
rhymes it seems like to me like it

8342
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:24,080
rhymes it seems like to me like it
 

8343
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:26,150
rhymes it seems like to me like it
rhymes with the truth

8344
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:26,160
rhymes with the truth
 

8345
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,870
rhymes with the truth
yeah i i think that for some people

8346
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:28,880
yeah i i think that for some people
 

8347
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:29,670
yeah i i think that for some people
um

8348
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:29,680
um
 

8349
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:31,750
um
that's going to be a more powerful

8350
02:33:31,750 --> 02:33:31,760
that's going to be a more powerful
 

8351
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:33,670
that's going to be a more powerful
factor than others clearly doug is

8352
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:33,680
factor than others clearly doug is
 

8353
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:35,510
factor than others clearly doug is
talking about russians

8354
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:35,520
talking about russians
 

8355
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:36,230
talking about russians
and

8356
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:36,240
and
 

8357
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:39,590
and
i think that uh

8358
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:39,600

 

8359
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:42,630

some russians so clearly it infiltrates

8360
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:42,640
some russians so clearly it infiltrates
 

8361
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:44,469
some russians so clearly it infiltrates
all of russian literature

8362
02:33:44,469 --> 02:33:44,479
all of russian literature
 

8363
02:33:44,479 --> 02:33:46,870
all of russian literature
and ai doesn't have to have

8364
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:46,880
and ai doesn't have to have
 

8365
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:48,710
and ai doesn't have to have
uh

8366
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:48,720
uh
 

8367
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:52,710
uh
fear of death as a motivating force in

8368
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:52,720
fear of death as a motivating force in
 

8369
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:54,630
fear of death as a motivating force in
that we can build in

8370
02:33:54,630 --> 02:33:54,640
that we can build in
 

8371
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,870
that we can build in
motivation so we can build in the

8372
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:56,880
motivation so we can build in the
 

8373
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:59,429
motivation so we can build in the
motivation of

8374
02:33:59,429 --> 02:33:59,439
motivation of
 

8375
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:02,389
motivation of
obeying users and making users happy and

8376
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
obeying users and making users happy and
 

8377
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:04,710
obeying users and making users happy and
making others happy and

8378
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:04,720
making others happy and
 

8379
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:06,389
making others happy and
and so on and

8380
02:34:06,389 --> 02:34:06,399
and so on and
 

8381
02:34:06,399 --> 02:34:09,510
and so on and
that can substitute for this sort of

8382
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:09,520
that can substitute for this sort of
 

8383
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:12,389
that can substitute for this sort of
personal fear of death that sometimes

8384
02:34:12,389 --> 02:34:12,399
personal fear of death that sometimes
 

8385
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:14,070
personal fear of death that sometimes
leads to

8386
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:14,080
leads to
 

8387
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:17,030
leads to
bursts of creativity in in humans i

8388
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,040
bursts of creativity in in humans i
 

8389
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,750
bursts of creativity in in humans i
don't know i think like i think ai

8390
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:19,760
don't know i think like i think ai
 

8391
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:21,910
don't know i think like i think ai
really needs to understand death deeply

8392
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:21,920
really needs to understand death deeply
 

8393
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:23,429
really needs to understand death deeply
in order to be able to drive a car for

8394
02:34:23,429 --> 02:34:23,439
in order to be able to drive a car for
 

8395
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:24,790
in order to be able to drive a car for
example

8396
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:24,800
example
 

8397
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:27,030
example
i i think there's just some

8398
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:27,040
i i think there's just some
 

8399
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:30,309
i i think there's just some
like there no i really disagree i think

8400
02:34:30,309 --> 02:34:30,319
like there no i really disagree i think
 

8401
02:34:30,319 --> 02:34:32,389
like there no i really disagree i think
it needs to understand the value of

8402
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
it needs to understand the value of
 

8403
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:34,710
it needs to understand the value of
human life especially the value of human

8404
02:34:34,710 --> 02:34:34,720
human life especially the value of human
 

8405
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,469
human life especially the value of human
life to other humans

8406
02:34:36,469 --> 02:34:36,479
life to other humans
 

8407
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:40,150
life to other humans
the um and understand that certain

8408
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:40,160
the um and understand that certain
 

8409
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:41,750
the um and understand that certain
things are more important than other

8410
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,760
things are more important than other
 

8411
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,150
things are more important than other
things it has to have a lot of knowledge

8412
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:44,160
things it has to have a lot of knowledge
 

8413
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,309
things it has to have a lot of knowledge
about ethics and

8414
02:34:46,309 --> 02:34:46,319
about ethics and
 

8415
02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:48,950
about ethics and
morality and so on but some of it is so

8416
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:48,960
morality and so on but some of it is so
 

8417
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:51,190
morality and so on but some of it is so
messy that it's impossible to encode for

8418
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:51,200
messy that it's impossible to encode for
 

8419
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:54,150
messy that it's impossible to encode for
example this is disagree so if there's a

8420
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:54,160
example this is disagree so if there's a
 

8421
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,230
example this is disagree so if there's a
person dying right in front of us

8422
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:56,240
person dying right in front of us
 

8423
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:59,030
person dying right in front of us
most human beings would help that person

8424
02:34:59,030 --> 02:34:59,040
most human beings would help that person
 

8425
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,590
most human beings would help that person
but they would not apply that same

8426
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:01,600
but they would not apply that same
 

8427
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,389
but they would not apply that same
ethics to everybody else in the world

8428
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
ethics to everybody else in the world
 

8429
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,469
ethics to everybody else in the world
this is the tragedy of how difficult it

8430
02:35:06,469 --> 02:35:06,479
this is the tragedy of how difficult it
 

8431
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:07,910
this is the tragedy of how difficult it
is to be a doctor

8432
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:07,920
is to be a doctor
 

8433
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,910
is to be a doctor
because they know when they help a dying

8434
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:09,920
because they know when they help a dying
 

8435
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,270
because they know when they help a dying
child

8436
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:11,280
child
 

8437
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:12,870
child
they know that the money they're

8438
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:12,880
they know that the money they're
 

8439
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:14,710
they know that the money they're
spending on this child

8440
02:35:14,710 --> 02:35:14,720
spending on this child
 

8441
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:16,950
spending on this child
cannot possibly be spent on every other

8442
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:16,960
cannot possibly be spent on every other
 

8443
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:19,750
cannot possibly be spent on every other
child that's dying and that's

8444
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
child that's dying and that's
 

8445
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,670
child that's dying and that's
that's a very difficult to encode

8446
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:21,680
that's a very difficult to encode
 

8447
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:23,110
that's a very difficult to encode

8448
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,120
decision
 

8449
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,150

now

8450
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:24,160
now
 

8451
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,710
now
perhaps perhaps it is perhaps it could

8452
02:35:26,710 --> 02:35:26,720
perhaps perhaps it is perhaps it could
 

8453
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:28,710
perhaps perhaps it is perhaps it could
be formalized oh but i mean you're

8454
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:28,720
be formalized oh but i mean you're
 

8455
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:30,070
be formalized oh but i mean you're
talking about

8456
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:30,080
talking about
 

8457
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:32,630
talking about
autonomous vehicles right so

8458
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:32,640
autonomous vehicles right so
 

8459
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:34,389
autonomous vehicles right so
autonomous vehicles are going to have to

8460
02:35:34,389 --> 02:35:34,399
autonomous vehicles are going to have to
 

8461
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:36,150
autonomous vehicles are going to have to
make those decisions

8462
02:35:36,150 --> 02:35:36,160
make those decisions
 

8463
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:40,389
make those decisions
um all the time of um what is the chance

8464
02:35:40,389 --> 02:35:40,399
um all the time of um what is the chance
 

8465
02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:43,349
um all the time of um what is the chance
of this bad event happening um how bad

8466
02:35:43,349 --> 02:35:43,359
of this bad event happening um how bad
 

8467
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:45,270
of this bad event happening um how bad
is that compared to this chance of that

8468
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,280
is that compared to this chance of that
 

8469
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,990
is that compared to this chance of that
bad event happening and so on and you

8470
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:48,000
bad event happening and so on and you
 

8471
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,230
bad event happening and so on and you
know when a potential accident is about

8472
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:50,240
know when a potential accident is about
 

8473
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:52,790
know when a potential accident is about
to happen is it worth taking this risk

8474
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:52,800
to happen is it worth taking this risk
 

8475
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:54,550
to happen is it worth taking this risk
if i have to make a choice which of

8476
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
if i have to make a choice which of
 

8477
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:56,710
if i have to make a choice which of
these two cars am i going to hit and why

8478
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:56,720
these two cars am i going to hit and why
 

8479
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:58,070
these two cars am i going to hit and why
and see i was thinking about a very

8480
02:35:58,070 --> 02:35:58,080
and see i was thinking about a very
 

8481
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,830
and see i was thinking about a very
different choice when i'm talking about

8482
02:35:59,830 --> 02:35:59,840
different choice when i'm talking about
 

8483
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:02,870
different choice when i'm talking about
your mortality which is just observing

8484
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:02,880

02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:05,920
uh manhattan style driving
 

8487
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:09,030

02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,040
i think that humans as an effective
 

8489
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,349
i think that humans as an effective
driver needs to threaten

8490
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359

02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:13,280
pedestrians lives
 

8493
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:14,550
pedestrians lives
a lot

8494
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:14,560
a lot
 

8495
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,790
a lot
there's a dance i've watched pedestrians

8496
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
there's a dance i've watched pedestrians
 

8497
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:19,030
there's a dance i've watched pedestrians
a lot of i worked on this problem and it

8498
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:19,040
a lot of i worked on this problem and it
 

8499
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,389
a lot of i worked on this problem and it
seems like

8500
02:36:20,389 --> 02:36:20,399
seems like
 

8501
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:23,270
seems like
the the if i could summarize the problem

8502
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:23,280
the the if i could summarize the problem
 

8503
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,429
the the if i could summarize the problem
of a pedestrian crossing

8504
02:36:25,429 --> 02:36:25,439
of a pedestrian crossing
 

8505
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:26,309
of a pedestrian crossing
is

8506
02:36:26,309 --> 02:36:26,319
is
 

8507
02:36:26,319 --> 02:36:28,469
is
the car with this movement is saying i'm

8508
02:36:28,469 --> 02:36:28,479
the car with this movement is saying i'm
 

8509
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:30,870
the car with this movement is saying i'm
going to kill you and the pedestrian is

8510
02:36:30,870 --> 02:36:30,880
going to kill you and the pedestrian is
 

8511
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,389
going to kill you and the pedestrian is
saying

8512
02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:32,399
saying
 

8513
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,710
saying
maybe and then they decide and say no i

8514
02:36:34,710 --> 02:36:34,720
maybe and then they decide and say no i
 

8515
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:36,150
maybe and then they decide and say no i
don't think you you have the guts to

8516
02:36:36,150 --> 02:36:36,160
don't think you you have the guts to
 

8517
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:37,670
don't think you you have the guts to
kill me and you walk and they walk in

8518
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:37,680
kill me and you walk and they walk in
 

8519
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:39,190
kill me and you walk and they walk in
front and they look away

8520
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
front and they look away
 

8521
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,590
front and they look away
and there's that dance the the the

8522
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:41,600
and there's that dance the the the
 

8523
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:44,950
and there's that dance the the the
pedestrian as this is a social contract

8524
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:44,960
pedestrian as this is a social contract
 

8525
02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:46,710
pedestrian as this is a social contract
that the pedestrian trusts that once

8526
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:46,720
that the pedestrian trusts that once
 

8527
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,150
that the pedestrian trusts that once
they're in front of the car and the car

8528
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:48,160
they're in front of the car and the car
 

8529
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:49,950
they're in front of the car and the car
is sufficiently from a physics

8530
02:36:49,950 --> 02:36:49,960
is sufficiently from a physics
 

8531
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:52,150
is sufficiently from a physics
perspective able to stop they're going

8532
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:52,160
perspective able to stop they're going
 

8533
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,630
perspective able to stop they're going
to stop but the car also has to threaten

8534
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:54,640
to stop but the car also has to threaten
 

8535
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:57,349
to stop but the car also has to threaten
that pedestrians like i'm late for work

8536
02:36:57,349 --> 02:36:57,359
that pedestrians like i'm late for work
 

8537
02:36:57,359 --> 02:36:59,510
that pedestrians like i'm late for work
so you're being kind of an [\h__\h] by

8538
02:36:59,510 --> 02:36:59,520
so you're being kind of an [\h__\h] by
 

8539
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,590
so you're being kind of an [\h__\h] by
crossing in front of me but life and

8540
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
crossing in front of me but life and
 

8541
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,309
crossing in front of me but life and
death is in like is part of the

8542
02:37:04,309 --> 02:37:04,319
death is in like is part of the
 

8543
02:37:04,319 --> 02:37:07,750
death is in like is part of the
calculation here and it's that that

8544
02:37:07,750 --> 02:37:07,760
calculation here and it's that that
 

8545
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:09,750
calculation here and it's that that
equation is being solved millions of

8546
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:09,760
equation is being solved millions of
 

8547
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,510
equation is being solved millions of

yes very effectively that game theory

8550
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:13,520
yes very effectively that game theory
 

8551
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:15,190
yes very effectively that game theory
whatever yeah whatever that formulation

8552
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:15,200
whatever yeah whatever that formulation
 

8553
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:17,429
whatever yeah whatever that formulation
absolutely i just i don't know if it's

8554
02:37:17,429 --> 02:37:17,439
absolutely i just i don't know if it's
 

8555
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:19,990
absolutely i just i don't know if it's
as simple as some

8556
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:20,000
as simple as some
 

8557
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,230
as simple as some
formalizable game theory problem it it

8558
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:22,240
formalizable game theory problem it it
 

8559
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:24,389
formalizable game theory problem it it
could very well be in a case of driving

8560
02:37:24,389 --> 02:37:24,399
could very well be in a case of driving
 

8561
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:27,030
could very well be in a case of driving
and in the case of most of uh

8562
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040
and in the case of most of uh
 

8563
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,349
and in the case of most of uh
human society i i don't know but

8564
02:37:29,349 --> 02:37:29,359
human society i i don't know but
 

8565
02:37:29,359 --> 02:37:31,910
human society i i don't know but
it uh yeah you might be right that sort

8566
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:31,920
it uh yeah you might be right that sort
 

8567
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,590
it uh yeah you might be right that sort
of uh the fear of death is just one of

8568
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:33,600
of uh the fear of death is just one of
 

8569
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,710
of uh the fear of death is just one of
the quirks

8570
02:37:34,710 --> 02:37:34,720
the quirks
 

8571
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:37,510
the quirks
of uh like the way our brains have

8572
02:37:37,510 --> 02:37:37,520
of uh like the way our brains have
 

8573
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:39,510
of uh like the way our brains have
evolved but it's not it's not a

8574
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:39,520
evolved but it's not it's not a
 

8575
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:41,990
evolved but it's not it's not a
necessary feature of intelligence

8576
02:37:41,990 --> 02:37:42,000
necessary feature of intelligence
 

8577
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,630
necessary feature of intelligence
drivers certainly are always doing this

8578
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:44,640
drivers certainly are always doing this
 

8579
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:46,790
drivers certainly are always doing this
kind of estimate even if it's

8580
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:46,800
kind of estimate even if it's
 

8581

02:40:58,630 --> 02:40:58,640
say it's very possible that you would be
 

8747
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:00,389
say it's very possible that you would be
one of the first people

8748
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:00,399
one of the first people
 

8749
02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:02,710
one of the first people
that can sit down in the room

8750
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:02,720
that can sit down in the room
 

8751
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:04,309
that can sit down in the room
let's say with her and have a

8752
02:41:04,309 --> 02:41:04,319
let's say with her and have a
 

8753
02:41:04,319 --> 02:41:06,150
let's say with her and have a
conversation

8754
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:06,160
conversation
 

8755
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:07,670
conversation
what would you ask her what would you

8756
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:07,680
what would you ask her what would you
 

8757
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:09,190
what would you ask her what would you
talk about

8758
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:09,200
talk about
 

8759
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:14,830
talk about
looking at all of the

8760
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:14,840

02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:25,030

what are the

8766
02:41:25,030 --> 02:41:25,040

 

8767
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:27,830

what are the some possible solutions to

8768
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:27,840
what are the some possible solutions to
 

8769
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:31,349
what are the some possible solutions to
big problems that the world has that

8770
02:41:31,349 --> 02:41:31,359
big problems that the world has that
 

8771
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:33,030
big problems that the world has that
people haven't really thought of before

8772
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040
people haven't really thought of before
 

8773
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,590
people haven't really thought of before
that are not being

8774
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:35,600
that are not being
 

8775
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:38,309
that are not being
properly or at least adequately

8776
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
properly or at least adequately

pursued
 

8779
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:42,230
pursued
what are some novel solutions that you

8780
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:42,240
what are some novel solutions that you
 

8781
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:45,110
what are some novel solutions that you
can think of that we haven't

8782
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:45,120
can think of that we haven't
 

8783
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:47,190
can think of that we haven't
that might work and that might be worth

8784
02:41:47,190 --> 02:41:47,200
that might work and that might be worth
 

8785
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:48,389
that might work and that might be worth
considering

8786
02:41:48,389 --> 02:41:48,399
considering
 

8787
02:41:48,399 --> 02:41:50,950
considering
so that is a damn good question given

8788
02:41:50,950 --> 02:41:50,960
so that is a damn good question given
 

8789
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:53,110
so that is a damn good question given
that the agi is going to be somewhat

8790
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:53,120
that the agi is going to be somewhat
 

8791
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:55,910
that the agi is going to be somewhat
different from human intelligence

8792
02:41:55,910 --> 02:41:55,920
different from human intelligence
 

8793
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:57,590
different from human intelligence
it's still going to make some mistakes

8794
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:57,600
it's still going to make some mistakes
 

8795
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:59,510
it's still going to make some mistakes
that we wouldn't make but it's also

8796
02:41:59,510 --> 02:41:59,520
that we wouldn't make but it's also
 

8797
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:01,750
that we wouldn't make but it's also
possibly going to notice

8798
02:42:01,750 --> 02:42:01,760
possibly going to notice
 

8799
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,990
possibly going to notice
some blind spots we have

8800
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:04,000
some blind spots we have
 

8801
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,950
some blind spots we have
and um i would i would love it

8802
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:06,960
and um i would i would love it
 

8803
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:10,230
and um i would i would love it
as a test of is it really

8804
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240
as a test of is it really
 

8805
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,630
as a test of is it really
on a par with our intelligences

8806
02:42:12,630 --> 02:42:12,640
on a par with our intelligences
 

8807
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:15,190
on a par with our intelligences
can it help spot some of the blind spots

8808
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,200
can it help spot some of the blind spots
 

8809
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:17,429
can it help spot some of the blind spots
that we have

8810
02:42:17,429 --> 02:42:17,439
that we have
 

8811
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:20,309
that we have
so the two-part question of can you help

8812
02:42:20,309 --> 02:42:20,319
so the two-part question of can you help
 

8813
02:42:20,319 --> 02:42:22,230
so the two-part question of can you help
identify what are the big problems in

8814
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:22,240
identify what are the big problems in
 

8815
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,389
identify what are the big problems in
the world and two

8816
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
the world and two
 

8817
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:26,710
the world and two
what are some novel solutions to those

8818
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:26,720
what are some novel solutions to those
 

8819
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:28,630
what are some novel solutions to those
problems that are not being

8820
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:28,640
problems that are not being
 

8821
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:31,110
problems that are not being
talked about by anyone

8822
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:31,120
talked about by anyone
 

8823
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:33,510
talked about by anyone
yeah and some of those may become

8824
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:33,520
yeah and some of those may become
 

8825
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:36,070
yeah and some of those may become
um you know infeasible or reprehensible

8826
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:36,080
um you know infeasible or reprehensible
 

8827
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:37,510
um you know infeasible or reprehensible
or something but some of them might be

8828
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,520
or something but some of them might be
 

8829
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:40,070
or something but some of them might be
actually great things to look at you

8830
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:40,080
actually great things to look at you
 

8831
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:41,510
actually great things to look at you
know if you if you go back and look at

8832
02:42:41,510 --> 02:42:41,520
know if you if you go back and look at
 

8833
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:42,710
know if you if you go back and look at
some of the most

8834
02:42:42,710 --> 02:42:42,720
some of the most
 

8835
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,429
some of the most
powerful discoveries that have been made

8836
02:42:45,429 --> 02:42:45,439
powerful discoveries that have been made
 

8837
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:47,910
powerful discoveries that have been made
uh like relativity and um

8838
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:47,920
uh like relativity and um
 

8839
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:50,870
uh like relativity and um
superconductivity and so on a lot of

8840
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:50,880
superconductivity and so on a lot of
 

8841
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:51,750
superconductivity and so on a lot of
them

8842
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:51,760
them
 

8843
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:52,630
them
were

8844
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:52,640
were
 

8845
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:55,190
were
cases where

8846
02:42:55,190 --> 02:42:55,200
cases where
 

8847
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,150
cases where
someone took seriously the idea that

8848
02:42:58,150 --> 02:42:58,160
someone took seriously the idea that
 

8849
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:01,190
someone took seriously the idea that
there might actually be

8850
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:01,200
there might actually be
 

8851
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:03,190
there might actually be
a non-obvious answer

8852
02:43:03,190 --> 02:43:03,200
a non-obvious answer
 

8853
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:05,269
a non-obvious answer
to it to a question so in einstein's

8854
02:43:05,269 --> 02:43:05,279
to it to a question so in einstein's
 

8855
02:43:05,279 --> 02:43:06,550
to it to a question so in einstein's
case it was

8856
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:06,560
case it was
 

8857
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,950
case it was
yeah the lorenz transformation is known

8858
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:08,960
yeah the lorenz transformation is known
 

8859
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,870
yeah the lorenz transformation is known
um nobody believes that it's actually

8860
02:43:10,870 --> 02:43:10,880
um nobody believes that it's actually
 

8861
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:12,550
um nobody believes that it's actually
the way reality works what if it were

8862
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:12,560
the way reality works what if it were
 

8863
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,150
the way reality works what if it were
the real way that reality actually

8864
02:43:14,150 --> 02:43:14,160
the real way that reality actually
 

8865
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:15,190
the real way that reality actually
worked

8866
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,200
worked
 

8867
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:16,550
worked
so you know a lot of people don't

8868
02:43:16,550 --> 02:43:16,560
so you know a lot of people don't
 

8869
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:17,910
so you know a lot of people don't
realize he didn't actually work out that

8870
02:43:17,910 --> 02:43:17,920
realize he didn't actually work out that
 

8871
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:19,429
realize he didn't actually work out that
equation he just sort of took it

8872
02:43:19,429 --> 02:43:19,439
equation he just sort of took it
 

8873
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:21,870
equation he just sort of took it
seriously um or in the case of

8874
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:21,880
seriously um or in the case of
 

8875
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:24,389
seriously um or in the case of
superconductivity you have this v equals

8876
02:43:24,389 --> 02:43:24,399
superconductivity you have this v equals
 

8877
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:27,030
superconductivity you have this v equals
ir equation where r is resistance and so

8878
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,040
ir equation where r is resistance and so
 

8879
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,590
ir equation where r is resistance and so
on and um

8880
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:29,600
on and um
 

8881
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,750
on and um
it was being mapped at lower and lower

8882
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:31,760
it was being mapped at lower and lower
 

8883
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,269
it was being mapped at lower and lower
temperatures but everyone thought that

8884
02:43:33,269 --> 02:43:33,279
temperatures but everyone thought that
 

8885
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:36,230
temperatures but everyone thought that
was just bump on a log research

8886
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:36,240
was just bump on a log research
 

8887
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:39,670
was just bump on a log research
to show that v equals ir always held

8888
02:43:39,670 --> 02:43:39,680
to show that v equals ir always held
 

8889
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:41,110
to show that v equals ir always held
and then when some

8890
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
and then when some
 

8891
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:43,830
and then when some
graduate student

8892
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:43,840
graduate student
 

8893
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,750
graduate student
got to a slightly lower temperature and

8894
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:45,760
got to a slightly lower temperature and
 

8895
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:47,349
got to a slightly lower temperature and
showed that resistance suddenly dropped

8896
02:43:47,349 --> 02:43:47,359
showed that resistance suddenly dropped
 

8897
02:43:47,359 --> 02:43:49,190
showed that resistance suddenly dropped
off everyone just assumed that they did

8898
02:43:49,190 --> 02:43:49,200
off everyone just assumed that they did
 

8899
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:51,830
off everyone just assumed that they did
it wrong and they and it was only a

8900
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:51,840
it wrong and they and it was only a
 

8901
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,590
it wrong and they and it was only a
little while later that they realized it

8902
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:53,600
little while later that they realized it
 

8903
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:56,469
little while later that they realized it
was um it was actually a new phenomenon

8904
02:43:56,469 --> 02:43:56,479
was um it was actually a new phenomenon
 

8905
02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:59,030
was um it was actually a new phenomenon
or in the case of um

8906
02:43:59,030 --> 02:43:59,040
or in the case of um
 

8907
02:43:59,040 --> 02:43:59,910
or in the case of um
the

8908
02:43:59,910 --> 02:43:59,920
the
 

8909
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:03,590

02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:03,590
um in order for the new generation to
escape those paradigms and i think that

02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:03,600
escape those paradigms and i think that

02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:06,070
escape those paradigms and i think that

02:47:08,230 --> 02:47:08,240
you'll find that
 

9077
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:10,550
you'll find that
you're optimizing for

9078
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:10,560
you're optimizing for
 

9079
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:12,469
you're optimizing for
short periods of time

9080
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:12,479
short periods of time
 

9081
02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:14,389
short periods of time
and before you know it you turn around

9082
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:14,399
and before you know it you turn around
 

9083
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:16,870
and before you know it you turn around
and long periods of time have gone by

9084
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:16,880
and long periods of time have gone by
 

9085
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:18,309
and long periods of time have gone by
without you ever really making a

9086
02:47:18,309 --> 02:47:18,319
without you ever really making a
 

9087
02:47:18,319 --> 02:47:21,110
without you ever really making a
difference in the world you know there's

9088
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,120
difference in the world you know there's
 

9089
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,110
difference in the world you know there's
when you look i mean the field that i

9090
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,120
when you look i mean the field that i
 

9091
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,110
when you look i mean the field that i
really love is artificial intelligence

9092
02:47:25,110 --> 02:47:25,120
really love is artificial intelligence
 

9093
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:27,670
really love is artificial intelligence
and there's not many projects there's

9094
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:27,680
and there's not many projects there's
 

9095
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:28,790
and there's not many projects there's
not many

9096
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:28,800
not many
 

9097
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:31,510
not many
little flames of hope that have been

9098
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:31,520
little flames of hope that have been
 

9099
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:34,070
little flames of hope that have been
carried out for many years for decades

9100
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:34,080
carried out for many years for decades
 

9101
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:36,469
carried out for many years for decades
and psych represents one of them

9102
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
and psych represents one of them
 

9103
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:37,990
and psych represents one of them
and uh

9104
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:38,000
and uh
 

9105
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:41,190
and uh
i mean that in itself is just a really

9106
02:47:41,190 --> 02:47:41,200
i mean that in itself is just a really
 

9107
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:42,630

so i'm i'm deeply grateful that you
would be carrying that flame for so many

9112
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:47,040
would be carrying that flame for so many
 

9113
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:48,469
would be carrying that flame for so many
years and i think that's an inspiration

9114
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:48,479
years and i think that's an inspiration
 

9115
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:51,030
years and i think that's an inspiration
to young people that said you said life

9116
02:47:51,030 --> 02:47:51,040
to young people that said you said life
 

9117
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,190
to young people that said you said life
is finite and we talked about mortality

9118
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:53,200
is finite and we talked about mortality
 

9119

get older
it's more on my mind especially as

9134
02:48:12,309 --> 02:48:12,319
it's more on my mind especially as
 

9135
02:48:12,319 --> 02:48:15,830
it's more on my mind especially as
acquaintances and friends and especially

mentors
one by one are dying so i can't

9140
02:48:19,910 --> 02:48:19,920
one by one are dying so i can't
 

9141
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:21,030
one by one are dying so i can't
avoid

9142
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,040
avoid
 

9143
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,269
avoid
thinking about mortality and i think

9144
02:48:23,269 --> 02:48:23,279
thinking about mortality and i think
 

9145
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:24,870
thinking about mortality and i think
that

9146
02:48:24,870 --> 02:48:24,880
that
 

9147
02:48:24,880 --> 02:48:26,710
that
the good news from the point of you and

9148
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:26,720
the good news from the point of you and
 

9149
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,429
the good news from the point of you and
the rest of the world is that that adds

9150
02:48:29,429 --> 02:48:29,439
the rest of the world is that that adds
 

9151
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:30,469
the rest of the world is that that adds
impetus

9152
02:48:30,469 --> 02:48:30,479
impetus
 

9153
02:48:30,479 --> 02:48:31,349
impetus
to

9154
02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359
to
 

9155
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,429
to
my need to succeed in a small number of

9156
02:48:33,429 --> 02:48:33,439
my need to succeed in a small number of
 

9157
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:35,030
my need to succeed in a small number of
years in the future

9158
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:35,040
years in the future
 

9159
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,790
years in the future
because i have a deadline

9160
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:36,800
because i have a deadline
 

9161
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:38,950
because i have a deadline
exactly i'm not going to have another 37

9162
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:38,960
exactly i'm not going to have another 37
 

9163
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:41,670
exactly i'm not going to have another 37
years to continue working on this so we

9164
02:48:41,670 --> 02:48:41,680
years to continue working on this so we
 

9165
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,750
years to continue working on this so we
really do want psych to

9166
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:43,760
really do want psych to
 

9167
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:46,230
really do want psych to
make an impact in the world

9168
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:46,240
make an impact in the world
 

9169
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:47,670
make an impact in the world
commercially

9170
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:47,680
commercially
 

9171
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:50,230
commercially
physically metaphysically

9172
02:48:50,230 --> 02:48:50,240
physically metaphysically
 

9173
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:52,150
physically metaphysically
in the next small number of years two

9174
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:52,160
in the next small number of years two
 

9175
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:54,790
in the next small number of years two
three five years not two three five

9176
02:48:54,790 --> 02:48:54,800
three five years not two three five
 

9177
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:57,510
three five years not two three five
decades anymore and so this is really

9178
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:57,520
decades anymore and so this is really
 

9179
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,429
decades anymore and so this is really
driving me toward

9180
02:48:59,429 --> 02:48:59,439
driving me toward
 

9181
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:02,630
driving me toward
uh this this sort of commercialization

9182
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:02,640
uh this this sort of commercialization
 

9183
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:05,830
uh this this sort of commercialization
and increasing increasingly widespread

9184
02:49:05,830 --> 02:49:05,840
and increasing increasingly widespread
 

9185
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:07,110
and increasing increasingly widespread
application

9186
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:07,120
application
 

9187
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:09,429
application
of psych whereas before

9188
02:49:09,429 --> 02:49:09,439
of psych whereas before
 

9189
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:11,110
of psych whereas before
i felt that i could just sort of sit

9190
02:49:11,110 --> 02:49:11,120
i felt that i could just sort of sit
 

9191
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:13,510
i felt that i could just sort of sit
back roll my eyes wait till the world

9192
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,520
back roll my eyes wait till the world
 

9193
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:15,510
back roll my eyes wait till the world
caught up and now i don't feel that way

9194
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:15,520
caught up and now i don't feel that way
 

9195
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:18,389
caught up and now i don't feel that way
anyway anymore i feel like i need to put

9196
02:49:18,389 --> 02:49:18,399
anyway anymore i feel like i need to put
 

9197
02:49:18,399 --> 02:49:20,230
anyway anymore i feel like i need to put
in some effort to

9198
02:49:20,230 --> 02:49:20,240
in some effort to
 

9199
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:22,230
in some effort to
make the world aware of what we have and

9200
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:22,240
make the world aware of what we have and
 

9201
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:23,510
make the world aware of what we have and
what it can do

9202
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520
what it can do

carrying of artificial intelligence the
 

9239
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,630
carrying of artificial intelligence the
big dream

9240
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:56,640
big dream
 

9241
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:58,309
big dream
is there

9242
02:49:58,309 --> 02:49:58,319

what do you hope your legacy is

9244
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,120
what do you hope your legacy is
 

9245
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:01,990
what do you hope your legacy is
hmm

9246
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:02,000
hmm
 

9247
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,389
hmm
that's a good question

9248
02:50:04,389 --> 02:50:04,399
that's a good question
 

9249
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:07,190
that's a good question
that people think of me as

9250
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:07,200
that people think of me as
 

9251
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:10,870
that people think of me as
one of the pioneers or inventors

9252
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:10,880
one of the pioneers or inventors
 

9253
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:13,190
one of the pioneers or inventors
of

9254
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:13,200
of
 

9255
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:16,309
of
the ai that is ubiquitous and that they

9256
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,319
the ai that is ubiquitous and that they
 

9257
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:18,070
the ai that is ubiquitous and that they
take for granted

9258
02:50:18,070 --> 02:50:18,080
take for granted
 

9259
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:20,950
take for granted
and so on much much the way that

9260
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:20,960
and so on much much the way that
 

9261
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:24,309
and so on much much the way that
today we look back on the the pioneers

9262
02:50:24,309 --> 02:50:24,319
today we look back on the the pioneers
 

9263
02:50:24,319 --> 02:50:28,230
today we look back on the the pioneers
of electricity or the pioneers of

9264
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:28,240
of electricity or the pioneers of
 

9265
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:31,269
of electricity or the pioneers of
similar types of technologies and so on

9266
02:50:31,269 --> 02:50:31,279
similar types of technologies and so on
 

9267
02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:32,790
similar types of technologies and so on
as

9268
02:50:32,790 --> 02:50:32,800
as
 

9269
02:50:32,800 --> 02:50:34,389
as
you know it's hard to imagine what life

9270
02:50:34,389 --> 02:50:34,399
you know it's hard to imagine what life
 

9271
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:37,590
you know it's hard to imagine what life
would be like if these people hadn't

9272
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:37,600
would be like if these people hadn't
 

9273
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:38,870
would be like if these people hadn't
done what they

9274
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
done what they
 

9275
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:41,030
done what they
um what they did so that that's one

9276
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:41,040
um what they did so that that's one
 

9277
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:41,990
um what they did so that that's one
thing

9278
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:42,000
thing
 

9279
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,590
thing
that i'd like to be remembered as

part of the future we're so sort of
 

9339
02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:00,630
part of the future we're so sort of

all that kind of stuff today but it
seems like the ideas that psych carries
