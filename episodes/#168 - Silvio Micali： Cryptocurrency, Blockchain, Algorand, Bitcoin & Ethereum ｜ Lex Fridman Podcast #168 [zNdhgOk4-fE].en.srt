fundamental that is decentralized about
 

211
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,430
fundamental that is decentralized about
it so at least in spirit

212
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
it so at least in spirit

how can it be common knowledge if only

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,430
how can it be common knowledge if only
one person or a few people are villager

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,509
one person or a few people are villager
the only way you don't have villager you

224
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
the only way you don't have villager you
 

225
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,110
the only way you don't have villager you
have to ask you know what is on page

226
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
have to ask you know what is on page
 

227
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,670
have to ask you know what is on page
seven

228
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
seven
 

229
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,350
seven
and how do you know that whatever they

230
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
and how do you know that whatever they
 

231
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,350
and how do you know that whatever they
tell you is on page seven

232
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
tell you is on page seven
 

233
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,030
tell you is on page seven
they tell the same thing to everybody

234
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
they tell the same thing to everybody
 

235
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,789
they tell the same thing to everybody
else and so

236
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
else and so
 

237
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,550
else and so
that is this commandant is like

very hard you build a building and now
 

249
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,869
very hard you build a building and now
you want to auction off

you want to auction off
 

251
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,509
you want to auction off
make sense because uh you want to

so you know that the fair price has

272
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
so you know that the fair price has
 

273
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,510
so you know that the fair price has
reached and you know

274

but
 

301
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,950
but
you often talk about blockchain

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
you often talk about blockchain
 

303
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,870

each or whatever this unit then i start

346
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
each or whatever this unit then i start
 

347
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,430
each or whatever this unit then i start
up

348
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
up

writing on the ledger i give a hundred
of these units to my sister

352
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
of these units to my sister

to somebody else and so and and that is
money and that is money because

368
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
money and that is money because
 

369
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,430
money and that is money because
you can see that somebody who

370
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
you can see that somebody who
 

371
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,270
you can see that somebody who
tenders your payment has really the

tenders your payment has really the
 

373
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,110
tenders your payment has really the
money there right you don't have any

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
money there right you don't have any
 

375
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,950
money there right you don't have any
more of a doubt when you want to sell an

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,350
moment of a transaction
you really see because the ledger is

388
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
you really see because the ledger is
 

389
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,950
you really see because the ledger is
always operated what you see

390
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
always operated what you see
 

391
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,990
always operated what you see
is what i see what the merchant sees you

392
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
is what i see what the merchant sees you
 

393
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,070
is what i see what the merchant sees you
know where the money so is

394
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
know where the money so is
 

395
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,990
know where the money so is
the most powerful money system there is

396
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
the most powerful money system there is
 

397
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,390
the most powerful money system there is
because it is totally transparent and so

398
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
because it is totally transparent and so
 

399
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,629
because it is totally transparent and so
you know that you have been paid

400
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
you know that you have been paid
 

401
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,870
you know that you have been paid
and and you know that the money is there

402
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
and and you know that the money is there
 

403
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,390
and and you know that the money is there
you have not to second guess anything

404
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
you have not to second guess anything
 

405
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,710
you have not to second guess anything
else

so the the common knowledge applied

408
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
so the the common knowledge applied
 

409
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,150
so the the common knowledge applied
there is

410
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
there is
 

411
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,990
there is
you're basically mimicking the same kind

412
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
you're basically mimicking the same kind
 

413
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,430
you're basically mimicking the same kind
of thing you would get in the physical

414
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
of thing you would get in the physical
 

415
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,270
of thing you would get in the physical
space which is

416
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
space which is
 

417
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,350
space which is
uh if you give a hundred bucks or a

418
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
uh if you give a hundred bucks or a
 

419
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,510
uh if you give a hundred bucks or a
hundred of that thing whatever

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
hundred of that thing whatever
 

421
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,309
hundred of that thing whatever
of that cryptocurrency to your sister

422
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
of that cryptocurrency to your sister
 

423
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,189
of that cryptocurrency to your sister
the actual

the actual
 

425
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,589
the actual
transfer is as real as you giving like

426
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
transfer is as real as you giving like
 

427
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,110

a a a basket of apples to your sister
 

429
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,070
a a a basket of apples to your sister
because that uh so in the case in the

430
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
because that uh so in the case in the
 

431
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,670
because that uh so in the case in the
physical space

432
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
physical space
 

433
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,589
physical space
the the common knowledge is in the

434
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
the the common knowledge is in the
 

435
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,950
the the common knowledge is in the

436
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
physics
 

437
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,909
physics
right of the atoms and then it's digital

438
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
right of the atoms and then it's digital
 

439
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,909
right of the atoms and then it's digital
space the common knowledge is in this

440
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
space the common knowledge is in this
 

441
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,790
space the common knowledge is in this
ledger

442
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
ledger
 

443
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,070
ledger
and so that transfer holds

444
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
and so that transfer holds
 

445
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,029
and so that transfer holds
um the same kind of power but now it's

446
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
um the same kind of power but now it's
 

447
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,029
um the same kind of power but now it's
operating in the digital space

448
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
operating in the digital space
 

449
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,189
operating in the digital space
correct again i apologize for a set of

450
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
correct again i apologize for a set of
 

451
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,710
correct again i apologize for a set of
ridiculous questions but

452
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
ridiculous questions but
 

453
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,070
ridiculous questions but
uh you mentioned cryptocurrencies of

454
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
uh you mentioned cryptocurrencies of
 

455
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,670
uh you mentioned cryptocurrencies of
money

456
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
money
 

457
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,189
money
what what is money why do we have money

458
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
what what is money why do we have money
 

459
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,430
what what is money why do we have money
do you think about this kind of from

460
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
do you think about this kind of from
 

461
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,430
do you think about this kind of from
this high philosophical level

462
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
this high philosophical level
 

463
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,869
this high philosophical level
at times of this uh

464
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
at times of this uh
 

465
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,749
at times of this uh
tool this idea that we humans have all

466
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
tool this idea that we humans have all
 

467
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,150
tool this idea that we humans have all
kind of

468
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
kind of
 

469
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,230
kind of
came up with and seem to be using

470
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
came up with and seem to be using
 

471
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,990
came up with and seem to be using
effectively to do stuff

472
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000

 

473
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,189

money is a social construct okay in

474
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
money is a social construct okay in
 

475
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,150
money is a social construct okay in
my opinion and this has been somehow

476
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
my opinion and this has been somehow
 

477
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,790
my opinion and this has been somehow
people always felt that somehow money

478
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
people always felt that somehow money
 

479
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,469
people always felt that somehow money
is a way to allow us to transact

480
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
is a way to allow us to transact
 

481
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,629
is a way to allow us to transact
even though we want to different things

482
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
even though we want to different things
 

483
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,190
even though we want to different things
so i have

484
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
so i have
 

485
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,469
so i have
two sheep and then you have

486
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
two sheep and then you have
 

487
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,350
two sheep and then you have
one cow and i want the cow but uh you

488
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
one cow and i want the cow but uh you
 

489
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,269
one cow and i want the cow but uh you
are looking for blankets instead you

490
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
are looking for blankets instead you
 

491
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,670
are looking for blankets instead you
know

492
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
know
 

493
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,070
know
so to have money it's really simplifies

494
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
so to have money it's really simplifies
 

495
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,230
so to have money it's really simplifies
this but at the end of and that's why

496
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
this but at the end of and that's why
 

497
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,630
this but at the end of and that's why
a bit was invented and you started with

498
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
a bit was invented and you started with
 

499
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,389
a bit was invented and you started with
gold you started when the

500
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
gold you started when the
 

501
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,550
gold you started when the
corny edge when you started with czech

502
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
corny edge when you started with czech
 

503
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,310
corny edge when you started with czech
but at the end of the day

504
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
but at the end of the day
 

505
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,190
but at the end of the day
money is essentially a social construct

506
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
money is essentially a social construct
 

507
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,310
money is essentially a social construct
because

508
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
because

is something
you know and i've been reading more and

686
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
you know and i've been reading more and
 

687
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,110
you know and i've been reading more and
more about different cryptocurrencies

688
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120

 

689
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,870

there is a kind of uh belief that

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
you know uh to to proof of work so it's
 

701
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,030
you know uh to to proof of work so it's
tied to physical

702
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
tied to physical
 

703
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,430
tied to physical
reality in terms of how much you can

704
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440

mine effectively

706
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
mine effectively
 

707
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,350
mine effectively
and so on that that's an important

708
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
and so on that that's an important
 

709
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,790
and so on that that's an important
feature of money

710
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
feature of money
 

711
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,710
feature of money
do you think that's an important feature

712
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
do you think that's an important feature
 

713
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,750
do you think that's an important feature
to be a part of whatever the money is

714
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
to be a part of whatever the money is
 

715
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,949
to be a part of whatever the money is
that is certainly a very useful part so

716
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
that is certainly a very useful part so
 

717
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,190
that is certainly a very useful part so
um at some point in time you know assume

718
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
um at some point in time you know assume
 

719
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,310
um at some point in time you know assume
a veteran or

720
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
a veteran or
 

721
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,230
a veteran or
money something that all of a sudden we

722
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
money something that all of a sudden we
 

723
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,870
money something that all of a sudden we
say this is money i have a currency

724
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
say this is money i have a currency
 

725
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,430
say this is money i have a currency
then uh you know i offer you 10 days is

726
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
then uh you know i offer you 10 days is
 

727
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,470
then uh you know i offer you 10 days is
in payment of

provide but but
 

733
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,990
provide but but
at the end of the day if you know that

734
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
at the end of the day if you know that
 

735
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,310
at the end of the day if you know that
uh you can cultivate it and generate

736
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
uh you can cultivate it and generate
 

737
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,269
uh you can cultivate it and generate
them um

738
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
them um
 

739
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,150
them um
at will then perhaps you know you should

740
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
at will then perhaps you know you should
 

741
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,030
at will then perhaps you know you should
not accept

my payment in uh here is a
 

745
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,750
my payment in uh here is a
a bouquet of basis so you need some kind

746
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
a bouquet of basis so you need some kind
 

747
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,110
a bouquet of basis so you need some kind
of a scarcity the inability to create a

748

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,750
of a scarcity the inability to create a
sudden layout or nothing is uh is uh is

750
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
sudden layout or nothing is uh is uh is
 

751
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,550
sudden layout or nothing is uh is uh is
unimportant

752
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
unimportant
 

753
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,150
unimportant
and uh um it's not an

754
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
and uh um it's not an
 

755
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,910
and uh um it's not an
intrinsic necessity but it's much easier

756
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
intrinsic necessity but it's much easier
 

757
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,990
intrinsic necessity but it's much easier
to accept once you know that there is a

758
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
to accept once you know that there is a
 

759
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,230
to accept once you know that there is a
fixed number of units or whatever

fixed number of units or whatever
 

761
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,949
fixed number of units or whatever
currency there is and therefore you can

762
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
currency there is and therefore you can

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
much of this piece of a pie
 

769
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,030
much of this piece of a pie
and therefore i consider myself paid i

you describe the goals of a blockchain

774
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
you describe the goals of a blockchain
 

775
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,350
you describe the goals of a blockchain
you have a nice presentation on this

776
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
you have a nice presentation on this
 

777
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,790
you have a nice presentation on this
as scalability security and

778
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:47,800
as scalability security and
 

779
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,750
as scalability security and
decentralization

780
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
decentralization
 

781
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,069
decentralization
and you challenge the blockchain

782
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
and you challenge the blockchain
 

783
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,870
and you challenge the blockchain
trilemma

784
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
trilemma
 

785
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,710
trilemma
that claims you can only have two of the

786
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
that claims you can only have two of the
 

787
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,990
that claims you can only have two of the
three so

788
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
three so
 

789
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,310
three so
let's talk about each what is

790
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
let's talk about each what is
 

791
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,389
let's talk about each what is
scalability in the context

792
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
scalability in the context
 

793
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,150
scalability in the context
of blockchain and cryptocurrency what

794
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
of blockchain and cryptocurrency what
 

795
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,750
of blockchain and cryptocurrency what
does scalability mean

796
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
does scalability mean
 

797
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,389
does scalability mean
so remember if we said that the

798
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
so remember if we said that the
 

799
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,110
so remember if we said that the
blockchain

800
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
blockchain
 

801
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,030
blockchain
is a ledger and each page receives that

802
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
is a ledger and each page receives that
 

803
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,590
is a ledger and each page receives that
gets transaction and everybody can write

804
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
gets transaction and everybody can write
 

805
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,470

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,550
in this
in these pages of a ledger nobody can be

in these pages of a ledger nobody can be
stopped for writing and everybody can

810
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
stopped for writing and everybody can

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,629
stopped for writing and everybody can
read them

812
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
read them
 

813
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,910

okay scalability means how fast can you

814
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
okay scalability means how fast can you
 

815
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,550
okay scalability means how fast can you
write just

816
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
write just
 

817
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,110
write just
imagine that you can write an entry in

818
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
imagine that you can write an entry in
 

819
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,990
imagine that you can write an entry in
this uh

820
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
this uh
 

821
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,269
this uh
special shared ledger once every hour

822
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
special shared ledger once every hour
 

823
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,030
special shared ledger once every hour
well you know what you're going to do if

824
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
well you know what you're going to do if
 

825
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,430
well you know what you're going to do if
you ever know one transaction per hour

826
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
you ever know one transaction per hour
 

827
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,590
you ever know one transaction per hour
the world that doesn't go around so you

828
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
the world that doesn't go around so you
 

829
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,389
the world that doesn't go around so you
need to have scalability means here that

830
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
need to have scalability means here that
 

831
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,750
need to have scalability means here that
you can somehow write a lot of

832
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
you can somehow write a lot of
 

833
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,790
you can somehow write a lot of
transaction

834

transaction
 

835
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,670
transaction
and then you can read them and everybody

836
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
and then you can read them and everybody
 

837
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,949
and then you can read them and everybody
can validate them

838
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
can validate them
 

839
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,150
can validate them
and that is the speed and and this

840
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
and that is the speed and and this
 

841
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,550
and that is the speed and and this
and the number of transactions are per

842
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
and the number of transactions are per
 

843
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,790
and the number of transactions are per
second and the fact that they are shared

844
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
second and the fact that they are shared
 

845
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,949
second and the fact that they are shared
so you want to have this

846
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
so you want to have this
 

847
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,350
so you want to have this
this uh the speed not only in writing

848
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
this uh the speed not only in writing
 

849
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,150
this uh the speed not only in writing
but in in

850
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
but in in
 

851
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,670
but in in
sharing and uh and uh an inspection for

852
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
sharing and uh and uh an inspection for
 

853
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,389
sharing and uh and uh an inspection for
validity

854
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
validity
 

855
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,430
validity
this is scalability the world is big

856
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
this is scalability the world is big
 

857
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,269
this is scalability the world is big
the world wants to interact with the

858
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
the world wants to interact with the
 

859
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,110
the world wants to interact with the
people want to interact with each other

860
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
people want to interact with each other
 

861
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,949
people want to interact with each other
and you better be prepared to have a

862
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
and you better be prepared to have a
 

863
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,710
and you better be prepared to have a
ledger in which you can write lots and

864
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
ledger in which you can write lots and
 

865
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,590
ledger in which you can write lots and
lots and lots of

866
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
lots and lots of
 

867
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,590
lots and lots of
transactions in this special way very

868
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
transactions in this special way very
 

869
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,790
transactions in this special way very
very very quickly

871
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,710
very very quickly
so maybe from a more mathematical

872
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
so maybe from a more mathematical
 

873
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,230
so maybe from a more mathematical
perspective or

874
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
perspective or
 

875
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,470
perspective or
can we say something about how much

876
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
can we say something about how much
 

877
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,550
can we say something about how much
scalability is needed

878
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
scalability is needed
 

879
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,350
scalability is needed
for a world that is big well it really

880
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
for a world that is big well it really
 

881
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,990
for a world that is big well it really
depends

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
depends
 

883
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,470
depends
how many transactions so you want but

884
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
how many transactions so you want but
 

885
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,350
how many transactions so you want but
remember

886
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
remember
 

887
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,150

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
at least thousands of transactions are
 

893
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,310
at least thousands of transactions are

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
credit cards right you know we are going

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,829
credit cards right you know we are going
to go from

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,509
to go from
an average of 1600 to peaks over 20 000

an average of 1600 to peaks over 20 000
 

901
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:51,990

or
 

903
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,110
or
40 000 something like this but

904
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
40 000 something like this but
 

905
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,230
40 000 something like this but
but remember it's not only a question of

906
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
but remember it's not only a question of
 

907
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,910
but remember it's not only a question of
the transaction per se but

908
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
the transaction per se but
 

909
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,430
the transaction per se but
the value is that the transaction

910
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
the value is that the transaction
 

911
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
the value is that the transaction
is actually been shared and visible to

912
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
is actually been shared and visible to
 

913
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,310
is actually been shared and visible to
everybody and the certainty that that is

914
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
everybody and the certainty that that is
 

915
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,269
everybody and the certainty that that is
the case

916
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
the case
 

917
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,629
the case
i can print them on my own printer

918
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
i can print them on my own printer
 

919
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,710
i can print them on my own printer
way more transactions but nobody has the

920
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
way more transactions but nobody has the
 

921
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,910
way more transactions but nobody has the
time to see or

922
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
time to see or
 

923
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,470
time to see or
to inspect that doesn't count right so

924
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
to inspect that doesn't count right so
 

925
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,749
to inspect that doesn't count right so
you want

926
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
you want
 

927
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,069
you want
scalability at this common knowledge

928
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
scalability at this common knowledge
 

929
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,910
scalability at this common knowledge
level that is the challenge

930
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
level that is the challenge
 

931
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,230
level that is the challenge
i also meant from a perspective of like

932
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
i also meant from a perspective of like
 

933
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,389
i also meant from a perspective of like
uh like a complexity analysis

934
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
uh like a complexity analysis
 

935
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,030
uh like a complexity analysis
so does it you know when you get more

936
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
so does it you know when you get more
 

937
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,870
so does it you know when you get more
and more people involved

938
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
and more people involved
 

939
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,629
and more people involved
doesn't need to scale in some kind of

940
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
doesn't need to scale in some kind of
 

941
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,550
doesn't need to scale in some kind of
way that uh

942
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
way that uh
 

943
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,350
way that uh
like do you do you like to see certain

944
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
like do you do you like to see certain
 

945
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,870
like do you do you like to see certain
kind of properties in order to say

946
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
kind of properties in order to say
 

947
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,550
kind of properties in order to say
something is scalable

948
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
something is scalable
 

949
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,629
something is scalable
oh absolutely i took a little bit

950
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
oh absolutely i took a little bit
 

951
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,670
oh absolutely i took a little bit
implicitly that

952
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
implicitly that
 

953
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,389
implicitly that
the people transacting are actually very

954
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
the people transacting are actually very
 

955
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,110
the people transacting are actually very
different

956
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
different
 

957
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,749
different
so if there is a two people who can do

958
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
so if there is a two people who can do
 

959
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,389
so if there is a two people who can do
uh

960
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
uh
 

961
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,910
uh
fast and satisfaction per second with

962
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
fast and satisfaction per second with
 

963
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,829
fast and satisfaction per second with
each other this is not so interesting

964
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
each other this is not so interesting
 

965
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,749
each other this is not so interesting
what do we really need is to save

966
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
what do we really need is to save
 

967
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,670
what do we really need is to save
billions of people and at any point in

968
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
billions of people and at any point in
 

969
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,350
billions of people and at any point in
time you know thousands and thousands of

970
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
time you know thousands and thousands of
 

971
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,910
time you know thousands and thousands of
them

972
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
them
 

973
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,470
them
want to transact with each other and you

974
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
want to transact with each other and you
 

975
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,350
want to transact with each other and you
want to support

976
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
want to support
 

977
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,630
want to support
that so algorand uh

978
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
that so algorand uh
 

979
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,150
that so algorand uh
it solves so that's the the the company

980
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
it solves so that's the the the company
 

981
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,029
it solves so that's the the the company
the team

982
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
the team
 

983
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,870
the team
of cryptographers mathematicians

984
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
of cryptographers mathematicians
 

985
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,789
of cryptographers mathematicians
engineers so on that challenge the

986
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
engineers so on that challenge the
 

987
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,949
engineers so on that challenge the
blockchain trilemma

988
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
blockchain trilemma
 

989
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,590
blockchain trilemma
so let's break it down in terms of

990
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
so let's break it down in terms of
 

991
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,350
so let's break it down in terms of
achieving scalability

992
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
achieving scalability
 

993
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,829
achieving scalability
how do we achieve scalability in the

994
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
how do we achieve scalability in the
 

995
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,350
how do we achieve scalability in the
space of blockchain in the space of

996
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
space of blockchain in the space of
 

997
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,710
space of blockchain in the space of
cryptocurrency

998
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
cryptocurrency
 

999
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,230
cryptocurrency
okay so uh scalability security remember

1000
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
okay so uh scalability security remember
 

1001
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,230
okay so uh scalability security remember
and the decentralization nice so

1002
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
and the decentralization nice so
 

1003
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,830
and the decentralization nice so
that's what they want what's the best

1004
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
that's what they want what's the best
 

1005
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,430
that's what they want what's the best
way to approach can we break it down

1006
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
way to approach can we break it down
 

1007
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,950
way to approach can we break it down
let's start with scalability

1008
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
let's start with scalability
 

1009
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,950
let's start with scalability
and think about how do we achieve it

1010
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
and think about how do we achieve it
 

1011
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,470
and think about how do we achieve it
well to achieve it

1012
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
well to achieve it
 

1013
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,470
well to achieve it
one at a time is perhaps elise even

1014
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
one at a time is perhaps elise even
 

1015
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,470
one at a time is perhaps elise even
security if nobody transacts

1016
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
security if nobody transacts
 

1017
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,909
security if nobody transacts
nobody loses money so beta is secure but

1018
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
nobody loses money so beta is secure but
 

1019
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,110
nobody loses money so beta is secure but
it's not scalable so let me tell you i'm

1020
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
it's not scalable so let me tell you i'm
 

1021
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,150
it's not scalable so let me tell you i'm
a cryptographer

1022
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
a cryptographer

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,270
a cryptographer
so i try to fight the bad guys

1024
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
so i try to fight the bad guys
 

1025
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,310
so i try to fight the bad guys
and what what you want is that a vessel

1026
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320

okay then

1036
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
okay then

yeah so somehow you want to make sure
 

1177
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,950
yeah so somehow you want to make sure
that you know you need to

1178
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
that you know you need to
 

1179
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,510
that you know you need to
work because you want to prevent you

1180

want to make sure
 

1183
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,950
want to make sure
that you know you get a one solution

1184
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
that you know you get a one solution
 

1185
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,990
that you know you get a one solution
every 10 minutes

so that is very rare but two pages are

1192
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
so that is very rare but two pages are
 

1193
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,590
so that is very rare but two pages are
added at the same time

1194

1195
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,909
added at the same time
because if i solve the puzzle at the

1196
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
because if i solve the puzzle at the
 

1197
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,510
because if i solve the puzzle at the
same time you do

1198

same time you do
 

1199
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,390
same time you do
you could happen that if it happens once

1200
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
you could happen that if it happens once
 

1201
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,750
you could happen that if it happens once
or twice we can survive

1202
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
or twice we can survive
 

1203
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,830
or twice we can survive
it but if it happens you know every

1204
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
it but if it happens you know every
 

1205
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,110
it but if it happens you know every
other page you know

1206
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
other page you know
 

1207
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,750
other page you know
is a double page of when uh which of the

1208
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
is a double page of when uh which of the
 

1209
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,350
is a double page of when uh which of the
two is the real page it becomes a

1210
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
two is the real page it becomes a
 

1211
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,230
two is the real page it becomes a
problem

1212
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
problem
 

1213
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,510
problem
so that's why in bitcoin it is important

1214
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
so that's why in bitcoin it is important
 

1215
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,230
so that's why in bitcoin it is important
that to have

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
that to have
 

1217
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,710
that to have
substantial amount of work so that no

1218
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
substantial amount of work so that no
 

1219
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,070

many how many people try
 

1221
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,430
many how many people try
on earth to solve a puzzle you have

1222
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
on earth to solve a puzzle you have
 

1223
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,750
on earth to solve a puzzle you have
one solution out of how many people are

1224
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
one solution out of how many people are
 

1225

one solution out of how many people are
trying every 10 minutes

1226
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
trying every 10 minutes
 

1227
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,070
trying every 10 minutes
so that you have you distantiate this

1228
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
so that you have you distantiate this
 

1229
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,789
so that you have you distantiate this
pages

1230
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
pages
 

1231
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,710
pages
and you have the time to propagate for

1232
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
and you have the time to propagate for
 

1233
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,390
and you have the time to propagate for
the network resolution

1234
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
the network resolution
 

1235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,630
the network resolution
and the page attached to it and

1236
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
and the page attached to it and
 

1237
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,390
and the page attached to it and
therefore there is one page at a time

1238
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
therefore there is one page at a time
 

1239
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,149
therefore there is one page at a time
that is added

1240
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159

1243
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,830
and they say well why don't we do that
we have a solution

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
we have a solution

facto centralized right
 

1335
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,830
facto centralized right
yeah and uh in a different type of

1336
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
yeah and uh in a different type of
 

1337
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,070
yeah and uh in a different type of
approach

1338
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
approach
 

1339
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,830
approach
is instead for instance a delegated

1340
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
is instead for instance a delegated
 

1341
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,350
is instead for instance a delegated
proof of stake

1342
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
proof of stake
 

1343
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,029
proof of stake
which is also very easy to explain

1344
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
which is also very easy to explain
 

1345
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,390
which is also very easy to explain
essentially boils down to to say well

1346
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
essentially boils down to to say well
 

1347
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,590
essentially boils down to to say well
look at these 21 people say okay

1348
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
look at these 21 people say okay
 

1349
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,830
look at these 21 people say okay
don't they look honest yes they do in

1350
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
don't they look honest yes they do in
 

1351
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,870
don't they look honest yes they do in
fact

1352
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
fact
 

1353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,549
fact
i believe if they're going to remain

1354
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
i believe if they're going to remain
 

1355
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,630
i believe if they're going to remain
honest for the foreseeable future so

1356
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
honest for the foreseeable future so
 

1357
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,470
honest for the foreseeable future so
when do we do ourselves a favor

1358
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
when do we do ourselves a favor
 

1359
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,710
when do we do ourselves a favor
let's entrust them to add the page

1360
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
let's entrust them to add the page
 

1361
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,269
let's entrust them to add the page
on behalf of all of us to the ledger

1362
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
on behalf of all of us to the ledger
 

1363
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,870
on behalf of all of us to the ledger
okay

1364
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:52,880
okay
 

1365
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,590
okay
okay but now we are going to say is this

1366
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
okay but now we are going to say is this
 

1367
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,510
okay but now we are going to say is this
centralized or decentralized well

1368
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
centralized or decentralized well
 

1369
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,230
centralized or decentralized well
21 is better than one what to say is

1370
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
21 is better than one what to say is
 

1371
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,029
21 is better than one what to say is
very little

1372
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
very little
 

1373
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,269
very little
so if you look at uh when people

1374
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
so if you look at uh when people
 

1375
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,190
so if you look at uh when people
rebelled to centralized power i don't

1376
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
rebelled to centralized power i don't
 

1377
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,029
rebelled to centralized power i don't
know the french revolutions okay

1378
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
know the french revolutions okay
 

1379
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,909
know the french revolutions okay
there was a monarch and the nobles yes

1380
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
there was a monarch and the nobles yes
 

1381
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,590
there was a monarch and the nobles yes
were there 21 nobles

1382
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
were there 21 nobles
 

1383
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,669
were there 21 nobles
no there were thousands of them but

1384
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
no there were thousands of them but
 

1385
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,990
no there were thousands of them but
there were millions and millions of

1386
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
there were millions and millions of
 

1387
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,190
there were millions and millions of
disempowered citizens so one is

1388
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
disempowered citizens so one is
 

1389
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,990
disempowered citizens so one is
centralized

1390
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
centralized
 

1391
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,390
centralized
21 is also centralized right so that's

1392
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
21 is also centralized right so that's
 

1393
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,909
21 is also centralized right so that's
delegated proof of stake

1394
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
delegated proof of stake
 

1395
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,510
delegated proof of stake
delegate kind of like a representative

1396
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
delegate kind of like a representative
 

1397
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,029
delegate kind of like a representative
democracy i guess

1398
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
democracy i guess
 

1399
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:39,190
democracy i guess
yes which is good working great right

1400
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200

 

1401
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,830

there's problems there are problems yeah

1402
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
there's problems there are problems yeah
 

1403
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,390
there's problems there are problems yeah
and

1404
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
and
 

1405
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,789
and
and so we were looking for a different

1406
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
and so we were looking for a different
 

1407
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,190
and so we were looking for a different
uh

1408
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
uh
 

1409
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,750
uh
um when thinking about algonquin for a

1410
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
um when thinking about algonquin for a
 

1411
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,310
um when thinking about algonquin for a
different approach

1412
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
different approach
 

1413
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,870
different approach
and so we have a man approaching retinol

1414
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
and so we have a man approaching retinol
 

1415
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,269
and so we have a man approaching retinol
is really really decentralized because

1416
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
is really really decentralized because
 

1417
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,029
is really really decentralized because
essentially um

1418
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
essentially um
 

1419
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,710
essentially um
it works as follows so you have a bunch

1420
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
it works as follows so you have a bunch
 

1421
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,190
it works as follows so you have a bunch
of tokens right these are the tokens

1422
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
of tokens right these are the tokens
 

1423
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,269
of tokens right these are the tokens
and that have equal power and you have

1424
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
and that have equal power and you have
 

1425
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,350
and that have equal power and you have
to say 10 billions of tokens distributed

1426
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
to say 10 billions of tokens distributed
 

1427
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,430
to say 10 billions of tokens distributed
from um

1428
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
from um
 

1429
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,190
from um
to the entire world and the owners

1430
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
to the entire world and the owners
 

1431
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,190
to the entire world and the owners
each token has a chance to add value

1432
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
each token has a chance to add value
 

1433
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,950
each token has a chance to add value
equal probability driver everybody else

1434
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
equal probability driver everybody else
 

1435
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,590
equal probability driver everybody else
in fact actually if you want here is how

1436
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
in fact actually if you want here is how
 

1437
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,789
in fact actually if you want here is how
it works

1438
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
it works
 

1439
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,750
it works
so think about you know by some magic

1440
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
so think about you know by some magic
 

1441
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,350
so think about you know by some magic
cryptographic process

1442
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
cryptographic process
 

1443
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,430
cryptographic process
which is not magic it's mathematics but

1444
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
which is not magic it's mathematics but
 

1445
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,710
which is not magic it's mathematics but
think about the magic

1446
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
think about the magic
 

1447
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,390
think about the magic
assume that you select a thousand tokens

1448
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400

 

1449
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,950

and so sometimes a random okay and you

1450
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
and so sometimes a random okay and you
 

1451
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,230
and so sometimes a random okay and you
have a guarantee that were handled

1452
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
have a guarantee that were handled
 

1453
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,190
have a guarantee that were handled
selected

1454
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
selected
 

1455
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,630
selected
and then this the owners of this 1000

1456
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
and then this the owners of this 1000
 

1457
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,350
and then this the owners of this 1000
tokens

1458
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
tokens
 

1459
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,149
tokens
somehow agree on the next page they all

1460
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
somehow agree on the next page they all
 

1461
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,590
somehow agree on the next page they all
sign it

1462
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
sign it
 

1463
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,710
sign it
and that's the next page okay

1464
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
and that's the next page okay
 

1465
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,269
and that's the next page okay
so it is clear that you know nobody has

1466
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
so it is clear that you know nobody has
 

1467
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,830
so it is clear that you know nobody has
the power but you know

1468
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
the power but you know
 

1469
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,789
the power but you know
once uh up in a while one of your tokens

1470
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
once uh up in a while one of your tokens
 

1471
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,590
once uh up in a while one of your tokens
is selected

1472
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
is selected
 

1473
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,789
is selected
and you are in charge of this committee

1474
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
and you are in charge of this committee
 

1475
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,590
and you are in charge of this committee
to select the next page but this goes

1476
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
to select the next page but this goes
 

1477
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,149
to select the next page but this goes
around

1478
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
around
 

1479
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,269
around
very quickly so and if you look at this

1480
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
very quickly so and if you look at this
 

1481
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,590
very quickly so and if you look at this
the question really is that is not

1482
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
the question really is that is not
 

1483
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,350
the question really is that is not
really centralized

1484
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
really centralized
 

1485
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,070
really centralized
and because of what for for agreeing on

1486
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
and because of what for for agreeing on
 

1487
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,789
and because of what for for agreeing on
the same page it is important that

1488
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
the same page it is important that
 

1489
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,750
the same page it is important that
the 1000 tokens that you're randomly

1490
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
the 1000 tokens that you're randomly
 

1491
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,029
the 1000 tokens that you're randomly
selected

1492
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
selected
 

1493
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,149
selected
are in honest ends the majority of them

1494
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
are in honest ends the majority of them
 

1495
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,870
are in honest ends the majority of them
so which if the majority of the tokens

1496
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
so which if the majority of the tokens
 

1497
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,630
so which if the majority of the tokens
are in honest ends that is

1498
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
are in honest ends that is
 

1499
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,549
are in honest ends that is
essentially true because if the majority

1500
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
essentially true because if the majority
 

1501
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,310
essentially true because if the majority
of the tokens are in honest ends

1502
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
of the tokens are in honest ends
 

1503
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,909
of the tokens are in honest ends
if you select say 90 percent of the

1504
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
if you select say 90 percent of the
 

1505
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,470
if you select say 90 percent of the
people

1506
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
people
 

1507
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,350
people
are 90 percent of the tokens are in

1508
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
are 90 percent of the tokens are in
 

1509
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,310
are 90 percent of the tokens are in
honest hands

1510
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
honest hands
 

1511
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,190
honest hands
so can you randomly select a thousand in

1512
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
so can you randomly select a thousand in
 

1513
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,269
so can you randomly select a thousand in
this thousand you find the 501

1514
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
this thousand you find the 501
 

1515
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,230
this thousand you find the 501
tokens in bad ends very very improbable

1516
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
tokens in bad ends very very improbable
 

1517
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,870
tokens in bad ends very very improbable
so

1518
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
so
 

1519
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,149
so
basically uh when a large fraction of

1520
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
basically uh when a large fraction of
 

1521
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,990
basically uh when a large fraction of
people are honest then you can use

1522
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
people are honest then you can use
 

1523
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,669
people are honest then you can use
randomness as a powerful tool to get

1524
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:06,679
randomness as a powerful tool to get
 

1525
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,789
randomness as a powerful tool to get
decentralization

1526
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
decentralization
 

1527
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,990
decentralization
so what does honesty mean and uh now

1528
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
so what does honesty mean and uh now
 

1529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,310
so what does honesty mean and uh now
we're

1530
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
we're
 

1531
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,269
we're
into the social side of things which is

1532
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
into the social side of things which is
 

1533
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,630
into the social side of things which is
uh

1534
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
uh
 

1535
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,149
uh
how do we know that

1536
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
how do we know that
 

1537
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,190
how do we know that
like the fraction a large fraction of uh

1538
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
like the fraction a large fraction of uh
 

1539
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,029
like the fraction a large fraction of uh
people or participating parties are

1540
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
people or participating parties are
 

1541
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,070
people or participating parties are
honest

1542
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
honest
 

1543
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,310
honest
that is an excellent question so by the

1544
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
that is an excellent question so by the
 

1545
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,750
that is an excellent question so by the
way first of all we should

1546
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
way first of all we should
 

1547
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,950
way first of all we should
realize that the same thing is for every

1548
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
realize that the same thing is for every
 

1549
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,470
realize that the same thing is for every
other system when you look at proof of

1550
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
other system when you look at proof of
 

1551
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,190
other system when you look at proof of
work

1552
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
work
 

1553
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,310
work
you realize that the majority of the

1554
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
you realize that the majority of the
 

1555
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,590
you realize that the majority of the
mining power

1556
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
mining power
 

1557
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,909
mining power
is in honest hands yes when you look at

1558
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
is in honest hands yes when you look at
 

1559
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,070
is in honest hands yes when you look at
a delegated proof of stake

1560
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
a delegated proof of stake
 

1561
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,630
a delegated proof of stake
you realize that the majority of these

1562
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
you realize that the majority of these
 

1563
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,230
you realize that the majority of these
21 people are honest

1564
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
21 people are honest
 

1565
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,630
21 people are honest
what is the difference the difference is

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640
what is the difference the difference is

1569
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,549
veta
in these other systems you soon to say

1570
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:54,559
in these other systems you soon to say
 

1571
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,750
in these other systems you soon to say
the whole economy

the whole economy
 

1573
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,870
the whole economy
is secure if the majority of this

small piece of economy are honest
 

1577
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,990
small piece of economy are honest
and that is a big question but instead

and that is a big question but instead
 

1579

what
 

1581
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,230
what
in our grand in our approach we say

in our grand in our approach we say
the whole economy is secure if the

had to conspire with each other in order
 

1597
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,990
had to conspire with each other in order
to think of a very economy for which

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
to think of a very economy for which
 

1599
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,470
to think of a very economy for which
they own the majority of yes but i think

1600
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
they own the majority of yes but i think
 

1601
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,110
they own the majority of yes but i think
it is a bit

1602
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
it is a bit
 

1603
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,870
it is a bit
harder too like a self-destructive

1604

and you're also making me realize that

1608
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
and you're also making me realize that
 

1609
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,389
and you're also making me realize that
basically every system that we have in

1610
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
basically every system that we have in
 

1611
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,830
basically every system that we have in
the world today

1612
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
the world today
 

1613
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,630
the world today
assumes that the majority of

1614
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
assumes that the majority of
 

1615
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,029
assumes that the majority of
participants is honest

1616
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
participants is honest
 

1617
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,110
participants is honest
yes the only difference is the majority

1618
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
yes the only difference is the majority
 

1619
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,070
yes the only difference is the majority
of whom

1620
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,080
of whom
 

1621
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,070
of whom
and in in some cases the majority of a

1622
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,080
and in in some cases the majority of a
 

1623
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,630
and in in some cases the majority of a
club and in our case is the majority of

1624
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
club and in our case is the majority of
 

1625
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,510
club and in our case is the majority of
the old system

1626
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
the old system
 

1627
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,269
the old system
the whole the whole system okay so

1628
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
the whole the whole system okay so
 

1629
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,990
the whole the whole system okay so
that's that's fast so through that kind

1630
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
that's that's fast so through that kind
 

1631
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,750
that's that's fast so through that kind
of uh random

1632
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
of uh random
 

1633
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,029
of uh random
sampling you can achieve

1634
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
sampling you can achieve
 

1635
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,269
sampling you can achieve
decentralization

1636
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
decentralization
 

1637
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,710
decentralization
you can achieve so the scalability

1638
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
you can achieve so the scalability
 

1639
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,830
you can achieve so the scalability
i understand and then the security that

1640
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
i understand and then the security that
 

1641
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,230
i understand and then the security that
you're

1642
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
you're
 

1643
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,110
you're
referring to basically the security

1644
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
referring to basically the security
 

1645
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,789
referring to basically the security
comes from the fact that

1646
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
comes from the fact that
 

1647
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,350
comes from the fact that
the sample selected would uh likely

1648
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
the sample selected would uh likely
 

1649
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,950
the sample selected would uh likely
include honest people

1650
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
include honest people
 

1651
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,830
include honest people
so it's very difficult to so by the way

1652
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
so it's very difficult to so by the way
 

1653
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,029
so it's very difficult to so by the way
the security as you

1654
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
the security as you
 

1655
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,789
the security as you
as you mentioned that you're referring

1656
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
as you mentioned that you're referring
 

1657
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,190
as you mentioned that you're referring
to is basically

1658
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
to is basically
 

1659
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,470
to is basically
security against dishonesty right or

1660
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,480
security against dishonesty right or
 

1661
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,149
security against dishonesty right or
manipulation or whatever yes

1662
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
manipulation or whatever yes
 

1663
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,389
manipulation or whatever yes
yes so essentially when what you're

1664
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
yes so essentially when what you're
 

1665
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,389
yes so essentially when what you're
going to to do is to be following and

1666
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
going to to do is to be following and
 

1667
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,110
going to to do is to be following and
say say well

1668
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
say say well
 

1669
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,350
say say well
silvio i understood what you're saying

1670
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
silvio i understood what you're saying
 

1671
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,269
silvio i understood what you're saying
but somebody has to randomly selected

1672
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
but somebody has to randomly selected
 

1673
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,110
but somebody has to randomly selected
with tokens when i believe you so then

1674
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
with tokens when i believe you so then
 

1675
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,789
with tokens when i believe you so then
who does this random selection that's a

1676
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
who does this random selection that's a
 

1677
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,269
who does this random selection that's a
good point

1678
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
good point
 

1679
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,310
good point
and uh in uh in algorithm we do

1680
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
and uh in uh in algorithm we do
 

1681
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,190
and uh in uh in algorithm we do
something a little bit

1682
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
something a little bit
 

1683
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,230
something a little bit
unorthodox essentially is

1684
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
unorthodox essentially is
 

1685
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,590
unorthodox essentially is
the token choose themselves

1686
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
the token choose themselves
 

1687
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,990
the token choose themselves
at random and you say if you think about

1688
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
at random and you say if you think about
 

1689
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,389
at random and you say if you think about
it that seems to be a terrible idea

1690
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
it that seems to be a terrible idea
 

1691
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,230
it that seems to be a terrible idea
because if you want to say choose

1692
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
because if you want to say choose
 

1693
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,990
because if you want to say choose
yourself at random and whoever chooses

1694
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
yourself at random and whoever chooses
 

1695
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,389
yourself at random and whoever chooses
himself is a fuss and people committee

1696
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
himself is a fuss and people committee
 

1697
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,190
himself is a fuss and people committee
you choose the page for for the rest of

you choose the page for for the rest of
 

1699

us
 

1701
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,830
us
and because if i'm a bad person i'm

1702
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
and because if i'm a bad person i'm
 

1703
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,190
and because if i'm a bad person i'm
going to select myself

1704
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,200
going to select myself
 

1705
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,029
going to select myself
over and over again because i want to be

1706
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:17,039
over and over again because i want to be
 

1707
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,510
over and over again because i want to be

part of the committee every single time
 

1709
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,630
part of the committee every single time
but not so fast so what do we do

1710
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
but not so fast so what do we do
 

1711
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,630
but not so fast so what do we do
in algon what does it mean that i select

1712
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
in algon what does it mean that i select
 

1713
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,950
in algon what does it mean that i select
myself that each one of us

1714
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
myself that each one of us
 

1715

in the privacy of our own computer
 

1717
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,230
in the privacy of our own computer
actually a laptop

1718
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
actually a laptop
 

1719
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,070
actually a laptop
what you do is that you execute your own

1720
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
what you do is that you execute your own
 

1721
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,350
what you do is that you execute your own
individual lottery and

1722
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
individual lottery and
 

1723
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,389
individual lottery and
uh think about that you pull a lever of

1724
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
uh think about that you pull a lever of
 

1725
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,590
uh think about that you pull a lever of
a slot machine

1726
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
a slot machine
 

1727
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,230
a slot machine
you can only pull the lever once not

1728
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
you can only pull the lever once not
 

1729
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,029
you can only pull the lever once not
until you win

1730
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
until you win
 

1731
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,190
until you win
not enough times until you win and when

1732
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
not enough times until you win and when
 

1733
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,230
not enough times until you win and when
you pull the lever

1734
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
you pull the lever
 

1735
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,710
you pull the lever
case one either you win in such a case

1736
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
case one either you win in such a case
 

1737
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,190
case one either you win in such a case
you have a winning ticket

1738
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
you have a winning ticket
 

1739
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,950
you have a winning ticket
or you lose you don't get any winning

1740
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
or you lose you don't get any winning
 

1741
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,470
or you lose you don't get any winning
ticket so

1742
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
ticket so
 

1743
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,950
ticket so
if you don't have a winning ticket you

1744
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
if you don't have a winning ticket you
 

1745
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,029
if you don't have a winning ticket you
can say anything you want about the next

1746
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
can say anything you want about the next
 

1747
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,909
can say anything you want about the next

but
 

1751
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,750
but
if you ever winning ticket people say oh

1752
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
if you ever winning ticket people say oh
 

1753
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,990
if you ever winning ticket people say oh
wow this is one of the 1000 winning

wow this is one of the 1000 winning
 

1755
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,830
wow this is one of the 1000 winning
tickets we better pay attention to what

1756
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
tickets we better pay attention to what

he or she says

he or she says
 

1759
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,190
he or she says
and that's how it works and the lottery

1760
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
and that's how it works and the lottery
 

1761
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,509
and that's how it works and the lottery
is a cryptographic lottery which means

1762
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:19,519
is a cryptographic lottery which means
 

1763
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,870
is a cryptographic lottery which means
that even if i am

1764
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
that even if i am
 

1765
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,310
that even if i am

probability
 

1773
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,909
probability
of one talking winning the lottery and

1774
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
of one talking winning the lottery and
 

1775
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,230
of one talking winning the lottery and
that's how it happens so everybody pulls

1776
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
that's how it happens so everybody pulls
 

1777
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,750
that's how it happens so everybody pulls
the lever

1778
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
the lever
 

1779
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,190
the lever
the 1000 random winners say oh here is

1780
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200
the 1000 random winners say oh here is
 

1781
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,310
the 1000 random winners say oh here is
my winning

1782
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
my winning
 

1783
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,470
my winning
ticket and here is my opinion up or down

1784
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
ticket and here is my opinion up or down
 

1785
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,870
ticket and here is my opinion up or down
above the block these are the ones that

1786
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
above the block these are the ones that
 

1787
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,470
above the block these are the ones that
count

1788
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
count
 

1789
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,110
count
and if you think about it while this is

1790
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
and if you think about it while this is
 

1791
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,870
and if you think about it while this is
distributed because there is

1792
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
distributed because there is
 

1793
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,710
distributed because there is
in the case of argon there is a 10

1794
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
in the case of argon there is a 10
 

1795
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,870
in the case of argon there is a 10
billion tokens and you select a

1796
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
billion tokens and you select a
 

1797
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,029
billion tokens and you select a
1000 of them more distributed than this

1798
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
1000 of them more distributed than this
 

1799
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,710
1000 of them more distributed than this
you cannot get

1800
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
you cannot get
 

1801
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,909
you cannot get
and then why is this you know scalable

1802
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
and then why is this you know scalable
 

1803
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,149
and then why is this you know scalable
because what you have to do okay yeah to

1804
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
because what you have to do okay yeah to
 

1805
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,110
because what you have to do okay yeah to
do the lottery

1806
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
do the lottery
 

1807
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,909
do the lottery
how long the lottery takes it takes

1808
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
how long the lottery takes it takes
 

1809
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,389
how long the lottery takes it takes
actually one microsecond

1810
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
actually one microsecond
 

1811
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,470
actually one microsecond
whether you have one token or two tokens

1812
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
whether you have one token or two tokens
 

1813
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,389
whether you have one token or two tokens
or a billion tokens is always one

1814
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
or a billion tokens is always one
 

1815
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,070
or a billion tokens is always one
microsecond of computation

1816
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
microsecond of computation
 

1817
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,950
microsecond of computation
which is very fast we don't hit the

1818
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
which is very fast we don't hit the
 

1819
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,990
which is very fast we don't hit the
planet with a microsecond of computation

1820
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
planet with a microsecond of computation
 

1821
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,110
planet with a microsecond of computation
and and finally why is this secure

right
and where is it lacking okay so the

1920
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
and where is it lacking okay so the
 

1921
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,750
and where is it lacking okay so the
first thing that bitcoin got right

1965
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,750
but money is not only a question that
you store it

1966
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
you store it
 

1967
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,670
you store it
and you put under the mattress money

1968
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
and you put under the mattress money
 

1969
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,270

wants to be transacted
 

1971
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,829
wants to be transacted
and the transaction in bitcoins are very

1972
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839
and the transaction in bitcoins are very
 

1973
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,470
and the transaction in bitcoins are very
little

little
 

1975
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,790
little
so if you want to store value everybody

1976
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
so if you want to store value everybody
 

1977
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,790
so if you want to store value everybody
needs a store value might as well

needs a store value might as well
 

1979
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,550
needs a store value might as well

guess what they want to be paid so much
 

2119
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,630
guess what they want to be paid so much
so right that uh

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
so right that uh
 

2121
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,910
so right that uh
six percent of the world uh gdp is

six percent of the world uh gdp is
 

2123
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,870
six percent of the world uh gdp is
uh goes into financial friction which is

uh goes into financial friction which is
 

2125
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,310
uh goes into financial friction which is
essentially third party

so the headed right of the world needed

2128

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,589
you make of just as a small sort of
a side in human history perhaps it's a

2148
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
a side in human history perhaps it's a
 

2149
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,150
a side in human history perhaps it's a
big one

2150
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
big one
 

2151
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,710
big one
is the nft the non-fungible tokens do

2152
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720
is the nft the non-fungible tokens do
 

2153
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,550
is the nft the non-fungible tokens do
you find those interesting technically

2154
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
you find those interesting technically
 

2155
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,550
you find those interesting technically
or is it more interesting on the social

2156
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,560
or is it more interesting on the social
 

2157
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,069
or is it more interesting on the social
side of things

2158
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
side of things
 

2159
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,950
side of things
well both i think you know i think it's

2160
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
well both i think you know i think it's
 

2161
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,510
well both i think you know i think it's
um

2162
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
um
 

2163
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,829
um
nfts are actually great right so you

2164
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
nfts are actually great right so you
 

2165
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,190
nfts are actually great right so you
have always um

2166
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,200
have always um
 

2167
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,150
have always um
you're an artist to create a a song or

2168
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
you're an artist to create a a song or
 

2169
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,109
you're an artist to create a a song or
you could be

2170
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
you could be
 

2171
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,550
you could be
um a piece of art

2172
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:44,560
um a piece of art
 

2173
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,109
um a piece of art
he has many unique representation right

2174
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
he has many unique representation right
 

2175
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:47,670
he has many unique representation right
over

2176
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:47,680
over
 

2177
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,710
over
of unique uh uh a piece whether he's an

2178
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
of unique uh uh a piece whether he's an
 

2179
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,069
of unique uh uh a piece whether he's an
artifact of uh

2180
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:52,079
artifact of uh
 

2181
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,190
artifact of uh
uh something dream napa by you and uh

2182
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
uh something dream napa by you and uh
 

2183
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,870
uh something dream napa by you and uh
and as unique representation but now you

2184
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
and as unique representation but now you
 

2185
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,790
and as unique representation but now you
can trade and allow

2186
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
can trade and allow
 

2187
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,870
can trade and allow
in the important part is that now you

2188
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
in the important part is that now you
 

2189
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,910
in the important part is that now you
have a visa

2190
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:01,920
have a visa
 

2191
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,870
have a visa
not only the nfts themselves but the

2192
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
not only the nfts themselves but the
 

2193
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,670
not only the nfts themselves but the
ability

2194
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
ability
 

2195
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,390
ability
to trade them quickly fast securely

2196
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
to trade them quickly fast securely
 

2197
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,829
to trade them quickly fast securely
knowing that who owns which rights and

2198
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
knowing that who owns which rights and
 

2199
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,190
knowing that who owns which rights and
that gives a totally new opportunity for

2200
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
that gives a totally new opportunity for
 

2201
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,430
that gives a totally new opportunity for
content creators to be remunerated for

2202
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
content creators to be remunerated for
 

2203
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,790
content creators to be remunerated for
what they do

2204
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
what they do
 

2205
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,270
what they do
so but ultimately you still have to have

2206
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
so but ultimately you still have to have
 

2207
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,870
so but ultimately you still have to have
that scalability security

2208
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
that scalability security
 

2209
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,829
that scalability security
and decentralization to to make it you

2210
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:29,839
and decentralization to to make it you
 

2211
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,630
and decentralization to to make it you
know

2212
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
know
 

2213
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,790
know
to make it work for bigger and bigger

2214
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
to make it work for bigger and bigger
 

2215
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,670
to make it work for bigger and bigger
applications

2216
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
applications
 

2217
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,150
applications
correct yeah yeah i still wonder what

2218
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
correct yeah yeah i still wonder what
 

2219
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,790
correct yeah yeah i still wonder what
kind of applications are yet to be

2220
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
kind of applications are yet to be
 

2221
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,510
kind of applications are yet to be
like enabled by it because so much the

2222
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
like enabled by it because so much the
 

2223
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,550
like enabled by it because so much the
interesting thing about

2224
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560
interesting thing about
 

2225
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,829
interesting thing about
nft is you know if you look outside of

2226
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
nft is you know if you look outside of
 

2227
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,190
nft is you know if you look outside of
art

2228
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
art
 

2229
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,470
art
is uh just like money you can start

2230
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
is uh just like money you can start
 

2231
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,950
is uh just like money you can start
playing with different social

2232
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:52,960
playing with different social
 

2233
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,069
playing with different social
constructs is you can start

2234
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:56,079
constructs is you can start
 

2235
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,870
constructs is you can start
playing with ideas you can start playing

2236
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
playing with ideas you can start playing
 

2237
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,870
playing with ideas you can start playing
with um

2238
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
with um
 

2239
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,390
with um
with uh even like investing somebody was

2240
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
with uh even like investing somebody was
 

2241
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,109
with uh even like investing somebody was
talking about almost creating an economy

2242
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
talking about almost creating an economy
 

2243
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,870
talking about almost creating an economy
out of uh

2244
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
out of uh
 

2245
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,710
out of uh
like uh creative people or influencers

2246
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
like uh creative people or influencers
 

2247
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,550
like uh creative people or influencers
like if you start a youtube channel or

2248
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:14,560
like if you start a youtube channel or
 

2249
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,750
like if you start a youtube channel or
something like that

2250
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
something like that
 

2251
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,069
something like that
you can invest in that person and you

2252
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
you can invest in that person and you
 

2253
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,710
you can invest in that person and you
can start trading their creations

2254
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
can start trading their creations
 

2255
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,349
can start trading their creations
and then almost like create a market out

2256
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
and then almost like create a market out
 

2257
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,030
and then almost like create a market out
of people's ideas out of people's

2258
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
of people's ideas out of people's
 

2259
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,230
of people's ideas out of people's
creations out of

2260
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,240
creations out of
 

2261
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,670
creations out of
the people themselves that

2262
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
the people themselves that
 

2263
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,750
the people themselves that
generate those creations and there's a

2264
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:31,760
generate those creations and there's a
 

2265
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,349
generate those creations and there's a
lot of interesting possibilities of what

2266
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
lot of interesting possibilities of what
 

2267
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,710
lot of interesting possibilities of what
you can do with that i mean it seems

2268
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
you can do with that i mean it seems
 

2269
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,390
you can do with that i mean it seems
ridiculous but

2270
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,400
ridiculous but
 

2271
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,190
ridiculous but
you're basically creating a hierarchy of

2272
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
you're basically creating a hierarchy of
 

2273
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,710
you're basically creating a hierarchy of
value

2274
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
value
 

2275
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,150
value
maybe artificial in the digital world

2276
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
maybe artificial in the digital world
 

2277
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,510
maybe artificial in the digital world
and are trading that but in so doing are

2278
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
and are trading that but in so doing are
 

2279
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,190
and are trading that but in so doing are
inspiring people to

2280
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
inspiring people to
 

2281
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,470
inspiring people to
create so maybe uh

2282
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,480
create so maybe uh
 

2283
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,950
create so maybe uh
as a sort of our economy gets better and

2284
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
as a sort of our economy gets better and
 

2285
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,670
as a sort of our economy gets better and
better and better

2286
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
better and better
 

2287
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,109
better and better
where actual work in the physical space

2288
00:40:59,109 --> 00:40:59,119
where actual work in the physical space
 

2289
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,190
where actual work in the physical space
uh becomes less and less in terms of its

2290
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
uh becomes less and less in terms of its
 

2291
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,349
uh becomes less and less in terms of its
importance maybe we'll completely be

2292
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
importance maybe we'll completely be
 

2293
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,349
importance maybe we'll completely be
operating in a digital space where

2294
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
operating in a digital space where
 

2295
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,510
operating in a digital space where
where these kinds of economies have more

2296
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
where these kinds of economies have more
 

2297
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,550
where these kinds of economies have more
and more power

2298
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
and more power
 

2299
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,230
and more power
and then you have to have this kind of

2300
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
and then you have to have this kind of
 

2301
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,589
and then you have to have this kind of
blockchains

2302
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
blockchains
 

2303
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,470
blockchains
to uh the scalability security and

2304
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:16,480
to uh the scalability security and
 

2305
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,510
to uh the scalability security and
decentralization

2306
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
decentralization
 

2307
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,150
decentralization
and decentralization is of course the

2308
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
and decentralization is of course the
 

2309
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,950
and decentralization is of course the
tricky one

2310
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
tricky one
 

2311
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,990
tricky one
because uh people in power start to get

2312
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
because uh people in power start to get
 

2313
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,270
because uh people in power start to get
nervous

2314
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
nervous
 

2315
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,030
nervous
absolutely once in power you always

2316
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,040
absolutely once in power you always
 

2317
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,589
absolutely once in power you always
never

2318
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
never
 

2319
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,829
never
be supplanted by somebody else but this

2320
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:31,839
be supplanted by somebody else but this
 

2321
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:32,950
be supplanted by somebody else but this
is your job

2322
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
is your job
 

2323
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,630
is your job
see you congratulations you don't have a

2324
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
see you congratulations you don't have a
 

2325
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,550
see you congratulations you don't have a
job the top job and now everybody wants

2326
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
job the top job and now everybody wants
 

2327
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,430

it
 

2329
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,470
it
well what is your sense about our our

2330
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
well what is your sense about our our
 

2331
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:40,950
well what is your sense about our our
time

2332
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
time
 

2333
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,309
time
and the future hope about the

2334
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:43,319
and the future hope about the
 

2335
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:45,270
and the future hope about the
decentralization

2336
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
decentralization
 

2337
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,750
decentralization
of power do you think that's something

2338
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:47,760
of power do you think that's something
 

2339
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,630
of power do you think that's something
that we can actually achieve

2340
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
that we can actually achieve
 

2341
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,750
that we can actually achieve
uh given that power corrupts and

2342
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
uh given that power corrupts and
 

2343
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,670
uh given that power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely and

2344
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
absolute power corrupts absolutely and
 

2345
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,589
absolute power corrupts absolutely and
it's so wonderful to be

2346
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
it's so wonderful to be
 

2347
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,950
it's so wonderful to be
absolutely powerful well good question

2348
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
absolutely powerful well good question
 

2349
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,910

00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
so but uh so there are two things first
 

2367
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,470
so but uh so there are two things first
of all

2368
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
of all
 

2369
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,950
of all
power has been um centralized for

2370
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
power has been um centralized for
 

2371
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,069
power has been um centralized for
various reasons

2372
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
various reasons
 

2373
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,990
various reasons
when you want to get it is easier for

2374
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
when you want to get it is easier for
 

2375
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,349
when you want to get it is easier for
somebody

2376
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
somebody
 

2377
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,309
somebody
even a single law person to grab power

2378
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
even a single law person to grab power
 

2379
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,829
even a single law person to grab power
but there is also

2380
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
but there is also
 

2381
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,829
but there is also
some kind of a technology lack thereof

2382
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
some kind of a technology lack thereof
 

2383
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,870
some kind of a technology lack thereof
that justified having power because

2384
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
that justified having power because
 

2385
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,950
that justified having power because
in a way in a society in which even

2386

unilateral communication is hard it is

2394
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
unilateral communication is hard it is
 

2395
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,470
unilateral communication is hard it is
much easier to say

2396
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
much easier to say
 

2397
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,230
much easier to say
you do as i say because the alternative

2398
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
you do as i say because the alternative
 

2399
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,390
you do as i say because the alternative
but as so there is a little bit of a

2400
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
but as so there is a little bit of a
 

2401
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,710
but as so there is a little bit of a
technology barrier but i think of it

2402
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
technology barrier but i think of it
 

2403
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,550
technology barrier but i think of it
and and now to get to this common

2404
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
and and now to get to this common
 

2405
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,069
and and now to get to this common
knowledge of it is a totally different

now we have finally the technology for

2410
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
now we have finally the technology for
 

2411
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,829
now we have finally the technology for
doing this so

2412
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:07,839
doing this so
 

2413
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,910
doing this so
that is one part but i really believe

2414
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:09,920
that is one part but i really believe
 

2415
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,190
that is one part but i really believe
that you know not

2416
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
that you know not
 

2417
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,109
that you know not

by having a distributed system not only

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,750
by having a distributed system not only

you don't have a
you have actually much more stable and

you have actually much more stable and
 

2423
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,829
you have actually much more stable and

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
because not only for corruption but even
 

2427
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,750
because not only for corruption but even
for things that go astray and you give

2428

for things that go astray and you give
 

2429
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,109

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,390
an architecture how about i i make a
pyramid

2476
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400
pyramid
 

2477
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,430

i put west on the top and

2478
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
i put west on the top and
 

2479
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,309
i put west on the top and
the power flows down and um and so again

2480
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
the power flows down and um and so again
 

2481
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:24,870
the power flows down and um and so again
it's a

2482
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880
it's a
 

2483
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,270
it's a
little bit perhaps of a technology

2484
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
little bit perhaps of a technology
 

2485
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,190
little bit perhaps of a technology
problem but now the technology is there

2486
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
problem but now the technology is there
 

2487
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,670
problem but now the technology is there
so that is a big challenge to rethink

2488
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
so that is a big challenge to rethink
 

2489
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,510
so that is a big challenge to rethink

it's not the way you need
 

2639
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,950
it's not the way you need
a teal you need to correct you need to

2640
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
a teal you need to correct you need to
 

2641
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,230
a teal you need to correct you need to
adjust

2642
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,240
adjust
 

2643
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,829
adjust
and um and so on um by the way we design

2644
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
and um and so on um by the way we design
 

2645
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,430
and um and so on um by the way we design
algorithm with the idea

2646
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,440
algorithm with the idea
 

2647
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,030
algorithm with the idea
that the code was evolving

2648
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
that the code was evolving
 

2649
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,829
that the code was evolving
as the needs and of course however is a

00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
as the needs and of course however is a
 

2651
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:30,470
as the needs and of course however is a
system

2652
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
system
 

2653
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,230
system
in which and every time there is an

2654
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
in which and every time there is an
 

2655
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,230
in which and every time there is an
adjustment you must have essentially a

2656
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
adjustment you must have essentially a
 

2657
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,710
adjustment you must have essentially a
vote

2658
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
vote
 

2659
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,150
vote
that right now is orchestrated

2660
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
that right now is orchestrated
 

2661
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,150
that right now is orchestrated
at 90 percent of the stake they say okay

2662
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
at 90 percent of the stake they say okay
 

2663
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,150
at 90 percent of the stake they say okay
we are ready we agree on the next

2664
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
we are ready we agree on the next
 

2665
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,790
we are ready we agree on the next
version

2666
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
version
 

2667
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,270
version
and we pick up this version so we are

2668
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
and we pick up this version so we are
 

2669
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,630
and we pick up this version so we are
able to evolve without

2670
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:46,640
able to evolve without
 

2671
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,549
able to evolve without
losing too many components left and

2672
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:48,559
losing too many components left and
 

2673
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,030
losing too many components left and
right but i think without evolving

2674
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
right but i think without evolving
 

2675
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,510
right but i think without evolving
any system essentially become aesthetic

2676
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
any system essentially become aesthetic
 

2677
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,270
any system essentially become aesthetic
and that is going to shrivel

2678
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
and that is going to shrivel
 

2679
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,309
and that is going to shrivel
and die sooner or later and and so that

2680
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
and die sooner or later and and so that
 

2681
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:58,630
and die sooner or later and and so that
is

2682
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:58,640

um the open source development a lot i
 

2743
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,510
um the open source development a lot i
mean there's no

we propagate the vision like the vision
 

2755
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,309
we propagate the vision like the vision
of the project is more stable

of the project is more stable
 

2757
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,710
of the project is more stable
maybe not the details but the vision and

2758
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
maybe not the details but the vision and
 

2759

maybe not the details but the vision and
so do you think there's value

2760
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
so do you think there's value
 

2761
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,190
so do you think there's value
to because we're there's a tension

2762
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
to because we're there's a tension
 

2763
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,069
to because we're there's a tension

like in visionary yes what do you make

2766
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
like in visionary yes what do you make
 

2767
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,390
like in visionary yes what do you make
of that attention

2768
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
of that attention
 

2769
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,710
of that attention
okay so i really believe that if it's a

2770
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
okay so i really believe that if it's a
 

2771
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,390
okay so i really believe that if it's a
another good question i think of it you

2772
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
another good question i think of it you
 

2773
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,109
another good question i think of it you
know

2774
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
know
 

2775
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,349
know
um i really believe in the power of

2776
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:49,359
um i really believe in the power of
 

2777

um i really believe in the power of
emotions i think the

2778
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
emotions i think the
 

2779
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,270
emotions i think the
emotion i have a creative impulse of

2780
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,280
emotion i have a creative impulse of
 

2781
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,470
emotion i have a creative impulse of
everybody else and very

2782
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
everybody else and very
 

2783
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,430
everybody else and very
very far is very easy for a leader to be

very far is very easy for a leader to be
 

2785

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:04,950
as much as we want to do we must agree
that

2964
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
that
 

2965
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,109
that
the first guarantee of financial growth

2966
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
the first guarantee of financial growth
 

2967
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,150
the first guarantee of financial growth
and prosperity are really the legal

2968
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,160
and prosperity are really the legal
 

2969
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,790
and prosperity are really the legal
system

2970
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
system
 

2971
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,430
system
the courts because we may not think

2972
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
the courts because we may not think
 

2973
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,950
the courts because we may not think
about them and say oh the courts are

2974
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
about them and say oh the courts are
 

2975
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,510
about them and say oh the courts are
kind of a bunch of boring lawyers but

2976
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:19,520
kind of a bunch of boring lawyers but
 

2977
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,390
kind of a bunch of boring lawyers but
without them

2978
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
without them
 

2979
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,309
without them
i'm saying there is no certainty there

2980
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
i'm saying there is no certainty there
 

2981
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,150
i'm saying there is no certainty there
is no um

2982
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160
is no um
 

2983
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,549
is no um
notion of equality there is no notion

2984
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
notion of equality there is no notion
 

2985
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,790
notion of equality there is no notion
that you can resolve your disputes

2986
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
that you can resolve your disputes
 

2987
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,790
that you can resolve your disputes
thing that's what thrives the commerce

2988
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
thing that's what thrives the commerce
 

2989
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,710
thing that's what thrives the commerce
and things and so what i really believe

2990
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:32,720
and things and so what i really believe
 

2991
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,150
and things and so what i really believe
that the blockchain

2992
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
that the blockchain
 

2993
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,549
that the blockchain
actually makes a lot of this trust

2994
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
actually makes a lot of this trust
 

2995
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,390
actually makes a lot of this trust
essentially automatic by making it

2996
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:38,400
essentially automatic by making it
 

2997
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,589
essentially automatic by making it
impossible to cheat in the way you don't

2998
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
impossible to cheat in the way you don't
 

2999
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,589
impossible to cheat in the way you don't
even need to go to court

3000
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
even need to go to court
 

3001
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,870
even need to go to court
if nobody can change a villager right

3002
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
if nobody can change a villager right
 

3003
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,870
if nobody can change a villager right
so essentially is a way of

3004
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
so essentially is a way of
 

3005
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,710
so essentially is a way of
you cannot solve and the legal system

3006
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:52,720
you cannot solve and the legal system
 

3007
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,069
you cannot solve and the legal system
reduces to a blockchain

3008
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
reduces to a blockchain
 

3009
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,390
reduces to a blockchain
but what i'm saying a big chunk of it

3010
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
but what i'm saying a big chunk of it
 

3011
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,309
but what i'm saying a big chunk of it
can actually be

3012
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,319
can actually be
 

3013
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,230
can actually be
guaranteed and there is no reason why

3014
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
guaranteed and there is no reason why
 

3015
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,670
guaranteed and there is no reason why
technology should be antagonistic

3016
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
technology should be antagonistic
 

3017
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,670
technology should be antagonistic
to legal scholarship it could be

3018
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:05,680
to legal scholarship it could be
 

3019
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,870
to legal scholarship it could be
actually coexisting

3020
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
actually coexisting
 

3021
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,109
actually coexisting
and one should start to doing the

3022
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
and one should start to doing the
 

3023
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,870
and one should start to doing the
interesting things that the economy

3024
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
interesting things that the economy
 

3025
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,990
interesting things that the economy
alone cannot do

3026
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
alone cannot do
 

3027
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,790
alone cannot do
and then you go from there but but i

3028
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
and then you go from there but but i
 

3029
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,230
and then you go from there but but i
think that is uh

3030
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
think that is uh
 

3031
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,510
think that is uh
essentially is uh blockchain can affect

3032
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
essentially is uh blockchain can affect
 

3033
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,270
essentially is uh blockchain can affect
all kinds of our yes in some sense the

3034
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
all kinds of our yes in some sense the
 

3035
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,950
all kinds of our yes in some sense the
transparency the required transparency

3036
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
transparency the required transparency
 

3037
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,309
transparency the required transparency
ensures honesty

3038
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:30,319
ensures honesty
 

3039
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,829
ensures honesty
prevents corruption so there's a lot of

3040
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
prevents corruption so there's a lot of
 

3041
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,670
prevents corruption so there's a lot of
system that could use that and the legal

3042
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
system that could use that and the legal
 

3043
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,950
system that could use that and the legal
system is one of them

3044
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
system is one of them
 

3045
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,589
system is one of them
there is a little bit of attention that

3046
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:37,599
there is a little bit of attention that
 

3047
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,670
there is a little bit of attention that
i wonder if you can speak to

3048
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
i wonder if you can speak to
 

3049
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,710
i wonder if you can speak to
where this kind of transparency there's

3050
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
where this kind of transparency there's
 

3051
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,950
where this kind of transparency there's
a tension with privacy

3052
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
a tension with privacy
 

3053
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,549
a tension with privacy
is it possible to achieve privacy

3054
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
is it possible to achieve privacy
 

3055
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,789
is it possible to achieve privacy
if wanted on uh on a blockchain

3056
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
if wanted on uh on a blockchain
 

3057
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,150
if wanted on uh on a blockchain
do you have do you have ideas about

3058
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
do you have do you have ideas about
 

3059
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,670
do you have do you have ideas about
different technologies that can do that

3060
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
different technologies that can do that
 

3061
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,030
different technologies that can do that
people have been playing with different

3062
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,040
people have been playing with different
 

3063
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,069
people have been playing with different
ideas

3064
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
ideas
 

3065
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,270
ideas
so absolutely the answer is that yes

3066
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
so absolutely the answer is that yes
 

3067
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,829
so absolutely the answer is that yes
and um but by the way i'm a

3068
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:03,839
and um but by the way i'm a
 

3069
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,789
and um but by the way i'm a
cryptographer

3070
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:04,799
cryptographer
 

3071
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,349
cryptographer
right okay so i really believe in

3072
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
right okay so i really believe in
 

3073
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,710
right okay so i really believe in
privacy and i believe

3074
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
privacy and i believe
 

3075
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,030
privacy and i believe
in and never devoted an um

3076
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
in and never devoted an um
 

3077
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,670
in and never devoted an um
a big chunk of my life to guarantee

3078
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
a big chunk of my life to guarantee
 

3079
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,349
a big chunk of my life to guarantee
privacy even when it seems almost

3080
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
privacy even when it seems almost
 

3081
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,030
privacy even when it seems almost
impossible to have it

3082
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
impossible to have it
 

3083
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,950
impossible to have it
and and it is possible to everything

3084
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:20,960
and and it is possible to everything
 

3085
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,950
and and it is possible to everything
also in the blockchain too

3086
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
also in the blockchain too
 

3087
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,549
also in the blockchain too
and however i believe in timing

3088
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
and however i believe in timing
 

3089
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,270
and however i believe in timing
as well and i believe that the people

3090
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280
as well and i believe that the people
 

3091
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,589
as well and i believe that the people
have

3092
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
have
 

3093
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,750
have
the right to understand

3094
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
the right to understand
 

3095
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,349
the right to understand
their system we live in and right now

their system we live in and right now
 

3097
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,390
their system we live in and right now
um people can understand the blockchain

3098
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,400
um people can understand the blockchain
 

3099
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,750
um people can understand the blockchain
to be

3100
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
to be

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,349
to be
something that is not con cannot be

3106
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
and is uh transparent and that is good
 

3107
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,309
and is uh transparent and that is good
enough and right now

3108
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
enough and right now
 

3109
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,230
enough and right now
any way to add and there is a pseudo

3110
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
any way to add and there is a pseudo

i split it through other public keys go
 

3123
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,910
i split it through other public keys go
on to figure out which one is silvio

3124
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
on to figure out which one is silvio
 

3125
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,510
on to figure out which one is silvio

privacy no

3130
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
privacy no
 

3131
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,190
privacy no
no not the one i created and i think

3132
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
no not the one i created and i think
 

3133
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,069
no not the one i created and i think
it's good enough

3134
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
it's good enough
 

3135
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,309
it's good enough
because and it's important for now that

3136
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
because and it's important for now that
 

3137
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,230
because and it's important for now that
we absorb the best stage

3138
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
we absorb the best stage
 

3139
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,230
we absorb the best stage
because in the next stage we must

3140
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
because in the next stage we must
 

3141
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,230
because in the next stage we must
understand the privacy tool rather than

3142
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
understand the privacy tool rather than
 

3143
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,430
understand the privacy tool rather than
taking on faith

3144
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
taking on faith
 

3145
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,589
taking on faith
when the public starts saying i believe

3146
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
when the public starts saying i believe
 

3147
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,589
when the public starts saying i believe
in the scientist and whatever they say

3148
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599
in the scientist and whatever they say
 

3149
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,270
in the scientist and whatever they say
i swear by them and therefore if they

3150
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
i swear by them and therefore if they
 

3151
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,789
i swear by them and therefore if they
tell me private is private

3152
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799
tell me private is private
 

3153
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,630
tell me private is private
and nobody understands it very well we

3154
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
and nobody understands it very well we
 

3155
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,710
and nobody understands it very well we
need a much more

3156
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720
need a much more
 

3157
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,910
need a much more
educated about the tools we are using

3158
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:39,920
educated about the tools we are using
 

3159
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,030
educated about the tools we are using
and so i look forward to deploying

3160
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,040
and so i look forward to deploying
 

3161
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,549
and so i look forward to deploying
more and more privacy on the blockchain

3162
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
more and more privacy on the blockchain
 

3163
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,750
more and more privacy on the blockchain
but we are not i i i will not

3164
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
but we are not i i i will not
 

3165
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,710
but we are not i i i will not
rush to it until the people understand

3166
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
rush to it until the people understand
 

3167
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,549
rush to it until the people understand
and are behind whatever we have right

3168
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
and are behind whatever we have right
 

3169
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,870
and are behind whatever we have right
now

3170
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880

 

3171
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,870

so you build privacy on top of the power

3172
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
so you build privacy on top of the power
 

3173
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,230
so you build privacy on top of the power
of the blockchain you have to first

3174
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
of the blockchain you have to first
 

3175
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,950
of the blockchain you have to first
understand

3176
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
understand
 

3177
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,589
understand
the power of the blockchain yes so

3178
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
the power of the blockchain yes so
 

3179
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,470
the power of the blockchain yes so

3181
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,309
algorand
is like one of the most exciting

3182
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:06,319
is like one of the most exciting
 

3183
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,510
is like one of the most exciting
technically at least

3184
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:07,520
technically at least
 

3185
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,710

what's the future of algon look like uh

3190
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040
what's the future of algon look like uh
 

3191
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,710
what's the future of algon look like uh
is it possible for it to dominate the

3192
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
is it possible for it to dominate the
 

3193
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,750
is it possible for it to dominate the
world

3194

let's put the best way i certainly

working very hard with a great team

3198
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
working very hard with a great team
 

3199
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,670
working very hard with a great team
to give the best blockchain that

3200
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
to give the best blockchain that
 

3201
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,030
to give the best blockchain that
one can demand and enjoy

3202
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,040
one can demand and enjoy
 

3203
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,589
one can demand and enjoy
and they said i really believe that

00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
and they said i really believe that
 

3205
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,750

there is going to be

3206
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:35,760
there is going to be

there is going to be
it's not a winner takes them all so it's

3208
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
it's not a winner takes them all so it's
 

3209
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,390
it's not a winner takes them all so it's
going to be a few blockchains

3210
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,400
going to be a few blockchains
 

3211
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,069
going to be a few blockchains
and each one is going to have its own

3212
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
and each one is going to have its own
 

3213
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,870
and each one is going to have its own
brand and it's going to be great at

3214
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
brand and it's going to be great at
 

3215
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,670
brand and it's going to be great at
something

3216
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
something
 

3217
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,069
something

00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,270
it's important to have a dialogue
between these things and

00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
between these things and
 

3229
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,589
between these things and
i'm sure and i'm working very hard to

make sure the underground is one of them
 

3233
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,589
make sure the underground is one of them
but i don't believe of it you know he's

00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:03,599
but i don't believe of it you know he's

00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
different things but the important thing
 

3243
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,309
different things but the important thing
is going to have enough interoperability

3244
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
is going to have enough interoperability
 

3245
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,670
is going to have enough interoperability
of our systems so that you can transfer

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,029
even trust each other just because
they never saw each other so i think

3616
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
they never saw each other so i think
 

3617
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,069
they never saw each other so i think
it's so powerful

3618
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:08,079
it's so powerful
 

3619
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,990
it's so powerful
that uh is going to do this said

3620
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,000
that uh is going to do this said

again a particular cryptocurrency

3622
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
again a particular cryptocurrency
 

3623
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,150
again a particular cryptocurrency
should develop and cryptocurrency they

3624
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
should develop and cryptocurrency they
 

3625
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,109
should develop and cryptocurrency they
will all develop

3626
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
will all develop
 

3627
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,990
will all develop
but the answer is yes we are going

3628
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
but the answer is yes we are going
 

3629
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,349
but the answer is yes we are going
towards a much more

existential crisis that we kind of think
 

3645
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,630
existential crisis that we kind of think
about including artificial intelligence

idea and is a both an old idea

3694
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
idea and is a both an old idea
 

3695
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,109
idea and is a both an old idea
in some sense and a very very modern one

3696
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:49,119
in some sense and a very very modern one
 

3697
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,029
in some sense and a very very modern one
and in my opinion is this idea of a

3698
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:51,039
and in my opinion is this idea of a
 

3699
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,349
and in my opinion is this idea of a
one-way function

3700
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
one-way function
 

3701
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,470
one-way function
so a function that easy

3702
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
so a function that easy
 

3703

01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200
easily but given f of x
 

3709
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,470
easily but given f of x
is very hard to go back to x okay

3710
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,480
is very hard to go back to x okay
 

3711
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,470
is very hard to go back to x okay

and so the fact that the notion of a

3728
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
and so the fact that the notion of a
 

3729
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,510
and so the fact that the notion of a
function which you have a recipe that is

3730
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
function which you have a recipe that is
 

3731
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,750
function which you have a recipe that is
in front of your eyes to transform an x

3732
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
in front of your eyes to transform an x
 

3733
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,470
in front of your eyes to transform an x
into

into
 

3735
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,670
into
f of x and then from f of x even though

3736
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
f of x and then from f of x even though
 

3737
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,510
f of x and then from f of x even though
you see the recipe to transform it

3738
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
you see the recipe to transform it
 

3739
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,549
you see the recipe to transform it
you cannot go back to x that in my

01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
you cannot go back to x that in my
 

3741
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,630
you cannot go back to x that in my
opinion is one of the most

3742
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:46,640
opinion is one of the most
 

3743
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,549
opinion is one of the most
elegant and momentous

01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
notions that there are and is a
 

3747
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,430
notions that there are and is a
computational notion because of the

3748
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
computational notion because of the
 

3749
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,910
computational notion because of the
difficulties in a computational sense

3750
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
difficulties in a computational sense
 

3751
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,510
difficulties in a computational sense
and it's a mathematical notion because

3752
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
and it's a mathematical notion because
 

3753
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,910
and it's a mathematical notion because
we were talking about function

3754
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
we were talking about function
 

3755
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,029
we were talking about function
and is so fruitful because that is

3756
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
and is so fruitful because that is
 

3757
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,470

do you think true randomness is

4066
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
do you think true randomness is
 

4067
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,149
do you think true randomness is
possible and what does that mean

through randomness pretty quickly
but is it is it uh maybe is this a

4078
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
but is it is it uh maybe is this a
 

4079
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,350
but is it is it uh maybe is this a
philosophical question is there such a

4080
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
philosophical question is there such a
 

4081
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,390
philosophical question is there such a
thing as true randomness

4082
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
thing as true randomness
 

4083
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,950
thing as true randomness
well the answer is actually maybe but if

4084
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
well the answer is actually maybe but if
 

4085
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,669
well the answer is actually maybe but if
there

4086
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
there
 

4087
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,110
there
exists most probably is

4088
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
exists most probably is
 

4089
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,390
exists most probably is
expensive to get and uh

4090
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
expensive to get and uh
 

4091
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,110

and uh and in any case if i give you one

4092
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,120
and uh and in any case if i give you one
 

4093
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,310

01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
philosophical sense in the
 

4105
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,390
philosophical sense in the
um colloquial way to say that we cannot

4106
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:36,400
um colloquial way to say that we cannot
 

4107
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:36,950
um colloquial way to say that we cannot
uh

4108
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
uh
 

4109
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,270
uh
somehow pin it down do you ever again

4110
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
somehow pin it down do you ever again
 

4111
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,070
somehow pin it down do you ever again
just

4112
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
just
 

4113
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,310
just
stay on philosophical for a bit for a

4114
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
stay on philosophical for a bit for a
 

4115
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,350
stay on philosophical for a bit for a
brief moment

4116
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
brief moment
 

4117
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,390
brief moment
do you ever think about free will and

4118
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
do you ever think about free will and
 

4119
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,189
do you ever think about free will and
uh whether that exists because

4120
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
uh whether that exists because
 

4121
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,790
uh whether that exists because
ultimately

4122
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
ultimately
 

4123
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,990
ultimately
free will sort of is this experience

4124
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
free will sort of is this experience
 

4125
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,189
free will sort of is this experience
that we have like we're making choices

4126
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
that we have like we're making choices
 

4127
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,229
that we have like we're making choices
even though it appears that

4128
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
even though it appears that
 

4129
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,110
even though it appears that
you know the world is deterministic at

4130
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
you know the world is deterministic at
 

4131
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,149
you know the world is deterministic at
the core i mean

4132
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:04,159
the core i mean
 

4133
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,470
the core i mean
it's against the debate but if it is in

4134
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,480
it's against the debate but if it is in
 

4135
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,550
it's against the debate but if it is in
fact deterministic at the lowest

4136
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
fact deterministic at the lowest
 

4137
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,550
fact deterministic at the lowest
possible level

4138
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
possible level
 

4139
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,070
possible level
uh at the at the physics level

4140
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
uh at the at the physics level
 

4141
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,229
uh at the at the physics level
uh how do you make if if it is

4142
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
uh how do you make if if it is
 

4143
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,310
uh how do you make if if it is
deterministic how do you make uh

4144
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:18,320
deterministic how do you make uh
 

4145
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,669
deterministic how do you make uh
how do you make sense of the difference

4146
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
how do you make sense of the difference
 

4147
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,510
how do you make sense of the difference
between the experience of us

4148
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
between the experience of us
 

4149
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,110
between the experience of us
feeling like we're making a choice and

4150
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
feeling like we're making a choice and
 

4151
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,189
feeling like we're making a choice and
the whole thing being deterministic

4152
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:25,199
the whole thing being deterministic
 

4153
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:26,870
the whole thing being deterministic
so first of all let me give you a gut

4154
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
so first of all let me give you a gut
 

4155
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,870
so first of all let me give you a gut
reaction yeah to my question

4156
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
reaction yeah to my question
 

4157
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,950
reaction yeah to my question
and a gut reaction is that

4158
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:32,960

 

4159
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,070

it is important that we believe that

4160
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
it is important that we believe that
 

4161
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,510
it is important that we believe that
there exists free will and second of all

4162
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:39,520
there exists free will and second of all
 

4163
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,350
there exists free will and second of all
almost uh by weird logic

4164
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
almost uh by weird logic
 

4165
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,430
almost uh by weird logic
if we believe it exists then it does

4166
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
if we believe it exists then it does
 

4167
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,709
if we believe it exists then it does
exist okay

4168
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
exist okay
 

4169
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,950
exist okay
yeah so it's very important for our

4170
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:48,960
yeah so it's very important for our
 

4171
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,910
yeah so it's very important for our
social

4172
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920
social
 

4173
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,590

that it exists and the moment in which
 

4179
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,390

you know we

you know we
 

4181
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,630
you know we
we so want to be almost we conjure it up

4182
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
we so want to be almost we conjure it up
 

4183
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,910
we so want to be almost we conjure it up
in existence

4184
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
in existence
 

4185
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,470
in existence
but again i really feel that if you look

4186
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
but again i really feel that if you look
 

4187
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,669
but again i really feel that if you look
at some point

4188
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
at some point
 

4189
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,470
at some point
and the space of free will seems to

4190
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
and the space of free will seems to
 

4191
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,470
and the space of free will seems to
shrink

4192
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
shrink
 

4193
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,910

01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,189
are why we prefer
certain things than others right and why

we react to noises of music

4204
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
we react to noises of music

01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,149
we react to noises of music
we prefer poetry of everything else we

4206
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
we prefer poetry of everything else we
 

4207
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,390
we prefer poetry of everything else we
may explain even always

4208
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
may explain even always
 

4209
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,430
may explain even always
but uh but at the end of the day whether

4210
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
but uh but at the end of the day whether
 

4211
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,149
but uh but at the end of the day whether
it

01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,390
it
exists in a philosophical sense or not

it's like randomness if you can

4216
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:34,960
it's like randomness if you can
 

4217
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,910
it's like randomness if you can
pseudorandom is as good as random

4218

01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
when does it really matter
 

4225
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,630
when does it really matter
yeah so you know we're talking about

4226
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:46,640
yeah so you know we're talking about
 

4227
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,510
yeah so you know we're talking about
randomness i wonder if i can weave in

4228
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
randomness i wonder if i can weave in
 

4229
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,550
randomness i wonder if i can weave in
quantum mechanics

4230
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:50,560
quantum mechanics
 

4231
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,229
quantum mechanics
for a brief moment there's a

4232
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
for a brief moment there's a
 

4233
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,910
for a brief moment there's a
you know a lot of advancements on the

4234
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
you know a lot of advancements on the
 

4235
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,750
you know a lot of advancements on the
quantum computing side

4236
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
quantum computing side
 

4237
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,510
quantum computing side
so leveraging quantum mechanics to

4238
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
so leveraging quantum mechanics to
 

4239
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,350
so leveraging quantum mechanics to
perform a new kind of computation

4240
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:03,360
perform a new kind of computation
 

4241
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,430
perform a new kind of computation
and there's concern of that being a

4242
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
and there's concern of that being a
 

4243
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,630
and there's concern of that being a
threat

4244
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
threat
 

4245
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,709

what do you think do you think quantum
computing will challenge

01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,830
contend
that quantum mechanics exist but has

4270
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
that quantum mechanics exist but has
 

4271
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,189
that quantum mechanics exist but has
nothing to do with computing is not

4272
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
nothing to do with computing is not
 

4273
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,790
nothing to do with computing is not
going to accelerate it

4274
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
going to accelerate it
 

4275
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,430
going to accelerate it
and at least you know

4276
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440

 

4277
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,550

very basic and um are the computation

4278
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
very basic and um are the computation
 

4279
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,510
very basic and um are the computation
that is a belief that you cannot uh take

4280
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
that is a belief that you cannot uh take
 

4281
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,550
that is a belief that you cannot uh take
it out

4282
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
it out
 

4283
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,750
it out
i'm a little bit uh more agnostic about

4284
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
i'm a little bit uh more agnostic about
 

4285
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,189
i'm a little bit uh more agnostic about
it but i really believe

4286
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
it but i really believe
 

4287
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,350
it but i really believe
going back to whatever i said about the

4288
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
going back to whatever i said about the
 

4289
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,430
going back to whatever i said about the
the one-way function

4290
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,440
the one-way function
 

4291
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,070
the one-way function
so one way function what is it what is a

4292
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
so one way function what is it what is a
 

4293
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,950
so one way function what is it what is a
cryptography

4294
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
cryptography
 

4295
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,669
cryptography
so does quantum computing challenge the

4296
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:03,679
so does quantum computing challenge the
 

4297
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,149
so does quantum computing challenge the
one

4298
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:04,159
one
 

4299
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,229
one
function essentially you can boil it

4300
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
function essentially you can boil it
 

4301
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,229
function essentially you can boil it
down to does one computing find one way

4302
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
down to does one computing find one way
 

4303
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,750
down to does one computing find one way
function what is one way function

4304
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
function what is one way function
 

4305
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,669
function what is one way function
easy in one direction other than the

4306
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
easy in one direction other than the
 

4307
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:12,790
easy in one direction other than the
other

4308
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
other
 

4309
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,669
other
okay but if quantum computing exists

4310
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
okay but if quantum computing exists
 

4311
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,830
okay but if quantum computing exists
when you define what it is easy

4312
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840
when you define what it is easy
 

4313
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,110
when you define what it is easy
it's not by easy by a classical computer

4314
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
it's not by easy by a classical computer
 

4315
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,270
it's not by easy by a classical computer
and art by a classical computer but is

4316
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
and art by a classical computer but is
 

4317
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,350
and art by a classical computer but is
it for for a quantum computer that's a

4318
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,360
it for for a quantum computer that's a
 

4319
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,149
it for for a quantum computer that's a
bad idea

4320
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:26,159
bad idea
 

4321
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,270
bad idea
but once easy means it should be easy

4322
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
but once easy means it should be easy
 

4323
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,790
but once easy means it should be easy
for a quantum

4324
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
for a quantum
 

4325
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,070
for a quantum
and hard for also quantum then you can

4326
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,080
and hard for also quantum then you can
 

4327
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:34,790
and hard for also quantum then you can
see that

4328
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
see that
 

4329
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,189
see that
you are yes is a challenge but you have

4330
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:37,199
you are yes is a challenge but you have
 

4331
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,110
you are yes is a challenge but you have
hope because you can absorb

4332
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
hope because you can absorb
 

4333
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,430
hope because you can absorb
if one computing really realizes and

4334
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:41,440
if one computing really realizes and
 

4335
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,950
if one computing really realizes and
becomes available

4336
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:42,960
becomes available
 

4337
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,229
becomes available
and according to the promises then you

4338
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
and according to the promises then you
 

4339
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:49,110
and according to the promises then you
can use them also for the easy part

4340
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,120
can use them also for the easy part
 

4341
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,510
can use them also for the easy part
and once you use it from the easy part

4342
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:51,520
and once you use it from the easy part
 

4343
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,390
and once you use it from the easy part
the

4344
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
the
 

4345
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,149
the
choices that you have a one-way function

4346
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
choices that you have a one-way function
 

4347
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,910
choices that you have a one-way function
they multiply so okay

4348
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
they multiply so okay
 

4349
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,709
they multiply so okay
so the particular candidates of one-way

4350
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
so the particular candidates of one-way
 

4351
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,310
so the particular candidates of one-way
function

4352
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
function
 

4353
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,990
function
may not be one way anymore

4354
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,000
may not be one way anymore
 

4355
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,070
may not be one way anymore
but quantum one-way function may

4356
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
but quantum one-way function may
 

4357
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,669
but quantum one-way function may
continue to exist

4358
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
continue to exist
 

4359
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:13,830
continue to exist
and so i really believe that

4360
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:13,840

 

4361
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,350

for uh life to be meaningful

4362
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
for uh life to be meaningful
 

4363
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,229
for uh life to be meaningful
with one way function had to exist

4364
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239
with one way function had to exist
 

4365
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,110
with one way function had to exist
because

4366
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,120
because
 

4367
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,550
because
just imagine that anything that is

4368
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:24,560
just imagine that anything that is
 

4369
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,070
just imagine that anything that is
becomes easy to to do i mean what kind

4370
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
becomes easy to to do i mean what kind
 

4371
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,270
becomes easy to to do i mean what kind
of life is it

4372
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
of life is it
 

4373
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,950
of life is it
i mean so you need that and if something

4374
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
i mean so you need that and if something
 

4375
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,030
i mean so you need that and if something
is hard but it's so hard to generate

4376
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
is hard but it's so hard to generate
 

4377
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,950
is hard but it's so hard to generate
you'll never find something which is

4378
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:36,960
you'll never find something which is
 

4379
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,270
you'll never find something which is
hard for you you want but there is

4380
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
hard for you you want but there is
 

4381
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,510
hard for you you want but there is
abundance if it is easy to produce

4382
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
abundance if it is easy to produce
 

4383
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,750
abundance if it is easy to produce
heart problem what's in my opinion is

4384
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
heart problem what's in my opinion is
 

4385
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:44,950
heart problem what's in my opinion is
why life is interesting

4386
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:44,960
why life is interesting
 

4387
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,310
why life is interesting
because art form pop up another really

4388
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
because art form pop up another really
 

4389
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,110
because art form pop up another really
relatable speed so in some sense i

4390
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
relatable speed so in some sense i
 

4391
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,550
relatable speed so in some sense i
almost think that

4392
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
almost think that
 

4393
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,270
almost think that
i do hope they exist if they don't exist

4394
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
i do hope they exist if they don't exist
 

4395
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,550
i do hope they exist if they don't exist
somehow life is

4396
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
somehow life is
 

4397
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,110
somehow life is
way less interesting than uh it actually

4398
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
way less interesting than uh it actually
 

4399
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,950
way less interesting than uh it actually
is yeah it does

4400
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:00,960
is yeah it does
 

4401
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,390
is yeah it does
that's funny it does seem like the

4402
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
that's funny it does seem like the
 

4403
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,350
that's funny it does seem like the
one-way function is fundamental to all

4404
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,360
one-way function is fundamental to all
 

4405
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,470
one-way function is fundamental to all
of life which is the the emergence of

4406
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
of life which is the the emergence of
 

4407
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,310
of life which is the the emergence of
the complexity that we see around us

4408
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:10,320
the complexity that we see around us
 

4409
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,709
the complexity that we see around us
seem to require the one-way function

4410
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:12,719
seem to require the one-way function
 

4411
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,590
seem to require the one-way function
i don't know if you uh play with

4412
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:15,600
i don't know if you uh play with
 

4413
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,790
i don't know if you uh play with
cellular automata

4414
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:16,800
cellular automata
 

4415
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,189
cellular automata
that's just another formulation of i

4416
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
that's just another formulation of i
 

4417
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,950
that's just another formulation of i
know but yeah it's a

4418
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
know but yeah it's a
 

4419
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,750
know but yeah it's a
very simple it's almost a very simple

4420
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
very simple it's almost a very simple
 

4421
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,030
very simple it's almost a very simple
illustration of

4422
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:25,040
illustration of
 

4423
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,149
illustration of
starting out with simple rules and

4424
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:28,159
starting out with simple rules and
 

4425
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,470
starting out with simple rules and
one way being able to generate

4426
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
one way being able to generate
 

4427
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,350
one way being able to generate
incredible

4428
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:31,360
incredible
 

4429
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,510
incredible
amounts of complexity but then you ask

4430
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:33,520
amounts of complexity but then you ask
 

4431
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,390
amounts of complexity but then you ask
the question can i reverse that

4432
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
the question can i reverse that
 

4433
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,229
the question can i reverse that
then it's just it's just a surprising

4434
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:40,239
then it's just it's just a surprising
 

4435
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,350
then it's just it's just a surprising
how difficult it is to reverse that

4436
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,360
how difficult it is to reverse that
 

4437
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,070
how difficult it is to reverse that
it's surprising even in constrained

4438
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
it's surprising even in constrained
 

4439
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,270
it's surprising even in constrained
situations it's

4440
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,280
situations it's
 

4441
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,189
situations it's
very difficult to prove anything uh that

4442
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
very difficult to prove anything uh that
 

4443
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:55,669
very difficult to prove anything uh that
it almost i mean the sad thing about it

4444
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
it almost i mean the sad thing about it
 

4445
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,430
it almost i mean the sad thing about it
well i don't know if it's sad but it

4446
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
well i don't know if it's sad but it
 

4447
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,629
well i don't know if it's sad but it
seems like we don't even have the

4448
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:58,639
seems like we don't even have the
 

4449
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,790
seems like we don't even have the
mathematical tools

4450
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
mathematical tools
 

4451
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,669
mathematical tools
to reverse engineer stuff i don't know

01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
to reverse engineer stuff i don't know
 

4453
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:04,950
to reverse engineer stuff i don't know
if they exist or not

if they exist or not
 

4455
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,629
if they exist or not
but in the space of cellular automata

4456
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:06,639
but in the space of cellular automata
 

4457
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,070
but in the space of cellular automata
where you start with something simple

4458
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
where you start with something simple
 

4459
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,350
where you start with something simple
and you create something incredibly

4460
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
and you create something incredibly
 

4461
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,790
and you create something incredibly
complex

4462
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
complex
 

4463
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,030
complex
can you take something a small picture

4464
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
can you take something a small picture
 

4465
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,990
can you take something a small picture
of that complex

4466
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
of that complex
 

4467
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,470
of that complex
and reverse engineer that's kind of what

4468
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
and reverse engineer that's kind of what
 

4469
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,910
and reverse engineer that's kind of what
we're doing as scientists

here you're seeing the result of the
 

4473
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,270
here you're seeing the result of the

4474
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
complexity and you're trying to come up
 

4475
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,149
complexity and you're trying to come up
with some

4476
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
with some
 

4477
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,950
with some
universal law that generate all of this

4478
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
universal law that generate all of this
 

4479
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,750
universal law that generate all of this
what is the

4480
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,760
what is the
 

4481
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,430
what is the
you know the theory of everything what

4482
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:27,440
you know the theory of everything what
 

4483
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,030
you know the theory of everything what
are the basic physics laws that

4484
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
are the basic physics laws that
 

4485
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,629
are the basic physics laws that
generated this whole thing

4486
01:21:30,629 --> 01:21:30,639
generated this whole thing
 

4487
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,390
generated this whole thing
and there's a hope that you should be

4488
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
and there's a hope that you should be
 

4489
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,990
and there's a hope that you should be
able to do that but

4490
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
able to do that but
 

4491
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,470
able to do that but
it gets it's difficult yeah but there is

4492
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
it gets it's difficult yeah but there is
 

4493
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,149
it gets it's difficult yeah but there is
also some portrait of the fact that it's

4494
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
also some portrait of the fact that it's
 

4495
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:38,790
also some portrait of the fact that it's
difficult

4496
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
difficult
 

4497
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,910
difficult
right because he it gives us a mystery

4498
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,920
right because he it gives us a mystery
 

4499
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,629
right because he it gives us a mystery
to life

4500
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
to life
 

4501
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,950
to life
which yeah without the wheelchair i mean

4502
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:44,960
which yeah without the wheelchair i mean
 

4503
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,390
which yeah without the wheelchair i mean
uh it's not so fun uh

4504
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:46,400
uh it's not so fun uh
 

4505
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,110
uh it's not so fun uh
all right life will be less fun can we

4506
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120
all right life will be less fun can we
 

4507
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,790
all right life will be less fun can we
talk about interactive proofs a little

4508
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
talk about interactive proofs a little
 

4509
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,350
talk about interactive proofs a little
bit and

4510
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
bit and
 

4511
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,830
bit and
zero knowledge proofs what are those

4512
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
zero knowledge proofs what are those
 

4513
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,189
zero knowledge proofs what are those
okay how do they work

4514
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:55,199
okay how do they work
 

4515
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,229
okay how do they work
so interactive proof actually

4516
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
so interactive proof actually
 

4517
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:01,669
so interactive proof actually
is um is

4518
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:01,679
is um is
 

4519
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,189
is um is
is a modern realization and uh

4520
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:04,199
is a modern realization and uh
 

4521
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:06,550
is a modern realization and uh
conceptualization of something

4522
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
conceptualization of something
 

4523
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,590
conceptualization of something
that we knew was true but you know that

4524
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:09,600
that we knew was true but you know that
 

4525
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,189
that we knew was true but you know that
is easy to go to lecture

4526
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
is easy to go to lecture
 

4527
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,430
is easy to go to lecture
in fact that's my motivation we invented

4528
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
in fact that's my motivation we invented
 

4529
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,030
in fact that's my motivation we invented
the schools to go to lecture right we

4530
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
the schools to go to lecture right we
 

4531
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,390
the schools to go to lecture right we
don't say oh i have a minister of

we spend a lot of our treasury in

4542
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
we spend a lot of our treasury in
 

4543
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,590
we spend a lot of our treasury in
educating our kids

4544
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
educating our kids
 

4545
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,950
educating our kids
and in person educating go to class

4546
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:30,960
and in person educating go to class
 

4547
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,310
and in person educating go to class
interact with a teacher on the

4548
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:32,320
interact with a teacher on the
 

4549
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,629
interact with a teacher on the
blackboard and chalk on my time

4550
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
blackboard and chalk on my time
 

4551
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,189
blackboard and chalk on my time
now we can have you know whiteboard and

4552
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
now we can have you know whiteboard and
 

4553
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,870
now we can have you know whiteboard and
presumably you're going to have actually

4554
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
presumably you're going to have actually
 

4555
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,189
presumably you're going to have actually
this

4556
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:39,199
this
 

4557
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,310
this
uh magic pens and the display instead

4558
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
uh magic pens and the display instead
 

4559
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,430
uh magic pens and the display instead
but the the the idea is that

4560
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
but the the the idea is that
 

4561
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,629
but the the the idea is that
interactively you can convey truth much

4562
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:48,639
interactively you can convey truth much
 

4563
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,430
interactively you can convey truth much
more efficiently and we knew this

4564
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
more efficiently and we knew this
 

4565
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,709
more efficiently and we knew this
psychologically

4566
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
psychologically
 

4567
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,390
psychologically
it's better to hear the explanation than

4568
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
it's better to hear the explanation than
 

4569
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,590
it's better to hear the explanation than
just to be labor or some paper right

4570
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
just to be labor or some paper right
 

4571
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,310
just to be labor or some paper right
same thing so interactive proofs is a

i have a winning strategy that i can win
 

4595
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,189
i have a winning strategy that i can win
half of it

4596
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
half of it
 

4597
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,310
half of it
all the time no matter what you do

4598
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
all the time no matter what you do
 

4599
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,149
all the time no matter what you do
okay so then you say well is the theorem

4600
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:28,159
okay so then you say well is the theorem
 

4601
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,750
okay so then you say well is the theorem
true you believe me why should i believe

4602
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
true you believe me why should i believe
 

4603
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,270
true you believe me why should i believe
you so okay let's play

4604
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,280
you so okay let's play
 

4605
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,629
you so okay let's play
so and if i prove that i have a strategy

4606
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
so and if i prove that i have a strategy
 

4607
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,270
so and if i prove that i have a strategy
that

4608
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
that
 

4609
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,110
that
and i win the first time and i win the

4610
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:37,120
and i win the first time and i win the
 

4611
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,270
and i win the first time and i win the
second time then i lose a third time but

4612
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
second time then i lose a third time but
 

4613
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,110
second time then i lose a third time but
i win

4614
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,120
i win
 

4615
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,830
i win
every say more than half of a time or i

4616
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:43,840
every say more than half of a time or i
 

4617
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,149
every say more than half of a time or i
win

4618
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
win
 

4619
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,470
win
say all the time if the serum is true

4620
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
say all the time if the serum is true
 

4621
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,189
say all the time if the serum is true
and at least

4622
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:47,199
and at least
 

4623
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:48,629
and at least
at the most half of a time if the

4624
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
at the most half of a time if the
 

4625
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,590
at the most half of a time if the
theorem is false you statistically

4626
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
theorem is false you statistically
 

4627
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,590
theorem is false you statistically
get convinced you can verify this

4628
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
get convinced you can verify this
 

4629
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,790
get convinced you can verify this
quickly

4630
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
quickly
 

4631
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,070
quickly
and and therefore is a much when the

4632
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,080
and and therefore is a much when the
 

4633
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,390
and and therefore is a much when the
game

4634
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,400
game
 

4635
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,750
game
in the game typically is extremely fast

4636
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:01,760
in the game typically is extremely fast
 

4637
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,709
in the game typically is extremely fast
so you generate a miniature game in

4638
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:04,719
so you generate a miniature game in
 

4639
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:05,990
so you generate a miniature game in
which the theorem is true

4640
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:06,000
which the theorem is true
 

4641
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,910
which the theorem is true
i win all the time in the theorem is

4642
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:07,920
i win all the time in the theorem is
 

4643
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,910
i win all the time in the theorem is
false i can win at most

4644
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
false i can win at most
 

4645
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,870
false i can win at most
half of a time and if i win win win win

4646
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:12,880
half of a time and if i win win win win
 

4647
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,470
half of a time and if i win win win win
win win win you can deduce either the

4648
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
win win win you can deduce either the
 

4649
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,350
win win win you can deduce either the
firm is true

4650
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
firm is true
 

4651
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,270
firm is true
which most probably is the case of this

4652
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
which most probably is the case of this
 

4653
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,030
which most probably is the case of this
week

4654
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,040
week
 

4655
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,790
week
or i've been very very unlucky because

4656
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:22,800
or i've been very very unlucky because
 

4657
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,510
or i've been very very unlucky because
it's like if i had a hundred coin tosses

4658
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:25,520
it's like if i had a hundred coin tosses
 

4659
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,110
it's like if i had a hundred coin tosses
and i got a hundred heads

4660
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
and i got a hundred heads
 

4661
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,990
and i got a hundred heads
very improbable right so that is a way

4662
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
very improbable right so that is a way
 

4663
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,990
very improbable right so that is a way
and so this transformation

4664
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
and so this transformation
 

4665
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,110
and so this transformation

what what the truth is and what proofs
 

4689
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,189
what what the truth is and what proofs
are so these are generally proofs

are so these are generally proofs
 

4691
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:07,189
are so these are generally proofs
so what kind of

so what kind of
 

4693
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,390
so what kind of

and prove he said truth
uh so uh what does it allow us

so it enlarges the real mobot is

4704
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
so it enlarges the real mobot is
 

4705
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,870
so it enlarges the real mobot is
provable because

01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,629
in some sense the classical way of

4710
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
proving things
 

4711
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,229
proving things
was extremely inefficient

4712
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
was extremely inefficient
 

4713
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,709
was extremely inefficient
from the very fire point of view yes

4714
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:34,719
from the very fire point of view yes
 

4715
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:35,910
from the very fire point of view yes
right so

4716
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:35,920
right so
 

4717
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,149
right so
and and so therefore there is so much

4718
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:38,159
and and so therefore there is so much
 

4719
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,390
and and so therefore there is so much
proof that you can take and

4720
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:40,400
proof that you can take and
 

4721
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,030
proof that you can take and
but in this way you can actually very

4722
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
but in this way you can actually very
 

4723
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,870
but in this way you can actually very
quickly minutes

4724
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880

the passages of a very very very long
 

4735
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,110
the passages of a very very very long
proof and you better check

4736
01:25:59,110 --> 01:25:59,120
proof and you better check
 

4737
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,669
proof and you better check
all of them because if you don't check

4738
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:01,679
all of them because if you don't check
 

4739
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:02,550

one line
 

4741
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,189
one line
an error can be in that line and so you

4742
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
an error can be in that line and so you
 

4743
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,110
an error can be in that line and so you
have to go linearly through all the

01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,550
a proof system is something that
allows me to convince you of a true

4758
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
allows me to convince you of a true
 

4759
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,310
allows me to convince you of a true
statement

4760
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
statement
 

4761
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,550
statement
but does not allow me to convince you of

01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
but does not allow me to convince you of
 

4763
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,790
but does not allow me to convince you of
a false statement

4764
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
a false statement
 

4765
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,270
a false statement
and better at the ancestor proof proof

4766
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:33,280
and better at the ancestor proof proof
 

4767
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,030

should be elegant but advances is true
 

4771
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,510
should be elegant but advances is true
or false so she wants to be able to

4772
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
or false so she wants to be able to
 

4773
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,390
or false so she wants to be able to

differentiate
 

4775

it is possible to prove the truth and it

4776
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
it is possible to prove the truth and it
 

4777
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,870
it is possible to prove the truth and it
should be impossible or statistically

4778
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
should be impossible or statistically
 

4779
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,229
should be impossible or statistically
extremely hard

4780
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:46,239
extremely hard
 

4781
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,629
extremely hard
to prove something false and if you do

4782
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:48,639
to prove something false and if you do
 

4783
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:49,990
to prove something false and if you do
this you can prove way way

4784
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,000
this you can prove way way
 

4785
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,790
this you can prove way way
more once you understand this and on top

4786
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:52,800
more once you understand this and on top
 

4787
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,390
more once you understand this and on top
of it

01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
of it
 

4789
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,709
of it
we got some insight i can visit zero

4790
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:56,719
we got some insight i can visit zero
 

4791

we got some insight i can visit zero
knowledge proofs

4792
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
knowledge proofs
 

4793
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,030
knowledge proofs
that is in something which you took for

4794
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
that is in something which you took for
 

4795
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,070
that is in something which you took for
granted were

4796
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
granted were
 

4797
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,310
granted were
the same knowledge and verification

4798
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:06,320
the same knowledge and verification
 

4799
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,950
the same knowledge and verification
are actually separate concepts so you

4800
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
are actually separate concepts so you
 

4801
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,070
are actually separate concepts so you
can verify

4802
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
can verify
 

4803
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,110
can verify
that an assertion is correct without

4804
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:13,120
that an assertion is correct without
 

4805
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,590
that an assertion is correct without
having

4806
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
having
 

4807
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,790
having
any idea why this is so and so

4808
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:16,800
any idea why this is so and so
 

4809
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,030
any idea why this is so and so
people fail to say if you want to verify

4810
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,040
people fail to say if you want to verify
 

4811
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,070
people fail to say if you want to verify
something you have to

4812
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
something you have to
 

4813
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,830
something you have to
to have a proof once you have a proof

4814
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
to have a proof once you have a proof
 

4815
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,669
to have a proof once you have a proof
you know why it's true you have

4816
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
you know why it's true you have
 

4817
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,709
you know why it's true you have
the proof itself and so somehow you can

4818
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
the proof itself and so somehow you can
 

4819
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,590
the proof itself and so somehow you can
totally differentiate knowledge

4820
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:31,600
totally differentiate knowledge
 

4821
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,709
totally differentiate knowledge
and and uh and verification validity so

4822
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
and and uh and verification validity so
 

4823
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:35,590
and and uh and verification validity so
totally you can

4824
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
totally you can
 

4825
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,430
totally you can
decide if something is true and still

4826
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
decide if something is true and still
 

4827
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,950
decide if something is true and still
have no idea is there a good example

4828
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
have no idea is there a good example
 

4829
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,310
have no idea is there a good example
in your mind oh actually

4830
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320
in your mind oh actually
 

4831
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,030
in your mind oh actually
you know at the beginning we labor to

4832
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,040
you know at the beginning we labor to
 

4833
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,350
you know at the beginning we labor to
find

4834
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,360
find
 

4835
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,590
find
the first knowledge zero knowledge proof

4836
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
the first knowledge zero knowledge proof
 

4837
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,350
the first knowledge zero knowledge proof
then we find a second then we've had the

4838
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:49,360
then we find a second then we've had the
 

4839
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,229
then we find a second then we've had the
third

4840
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,239
third
 

4841
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,950
third
and then a few years later actually we

4842
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
and then a few years later actually we
 

4843
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,310
and then a few years later actually we
proved a theorem

4844
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
proved a theorem
 

4845
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,430
proved a theorem
which essentially says every theorem no

4846
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,440
which essentially says every theorem no
 

4847
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,870
which essentially says every theorem no
matter what about

4848
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
matter what about
 

4849
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,750
matter what about
can be explained in a zero-knowledge way

4850
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,760
can be explained in a zero-knowledge way
 

4851
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,030
can be explained in a zero-knowledge way
okay so it's not a class of fear but

4852
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,040
okay so it's not a class of fear but
 

4853
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,910
okay so it's not a class of fear but
all theorems and is a very powerful

4854
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
all theorems and is a very powerful
 

4855
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,750
all theorems and is a very powerful
thing so if we were really

4856
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
thing so if we were really
 

4857
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,870
thing so if we were really
for thousands of years

4858
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:14,880
for thousands of years
 

4859
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,189
for thousands of years
bought this identity between knowledge

4860
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
bought this identity between knowledge
 

4861
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,070
bought this identity between knowledge
and verification

4862
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:18,080
and verification
 

4863
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,790
and verification
to be hand-in-hand together and uh for

4864
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:20,800
to be hand-in-hand together and uh for
 

4865
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,070
to be hand-in-hand together and uh for
no reason at all

4866
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
no reason at all
 

4867
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,910
no reason at all
i mean we had to develop a weaver

4868
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
i mean we had to develop a weaver
 

4869
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,750
i mean we had to develop a weaver
technology as you know i'm very big on

4870
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
technology as you know i'm very big on
 

4871
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,189
technology as you know i'm very big on
technology because

4872
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
technology because
 

4873
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,470
technology because
it makes us more human and and make us

4874
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
it makes us more human and and make us
 

4875
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,510
it makes us more human and and make us
understand

4876
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:31,520
understand
 

4877
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,590
understand
more things than before and uh and i

4878
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
more things than before and uh and i
 

4879
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,709
more things than before and uh and i
think of it is a

4880
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:34,719
think of it is a
 

4881
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,750
think of it is a
that is a that's a good thing

4882
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:37,760
that is a that's a good thing
 

4883
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,750
that is a that's a good thing
so this interactive proof process

4884
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:41,760
so this interactive proof process
 

4885
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,070
so this interactive proof process
there's power in games yeah and you've

4886
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,080
there's power in games yeah and you've
 

4887
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,790
there's power in games yeah and you've
recently

4888
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
recently
 

4889
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,270
recently
gotten into uh recently i'm not sure you

4890
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
gotten into uh recently i'm not sure you
 

4891
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:47,990
gotten into uh recently i'm not sure you
can correct me

4892
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,000
can correct me
 

4893
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,350
can correct me
uh mechanism design yeah uh

4894
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
uh mechanism design yeah uh
 

4895
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,030
uh mechanism design yeah uh
so it's i mean first of all maybe you

4896
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
so it's i mean first of all maybe you
 

4897
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,870
so it's i mean first of all maybe you
can explain what mechanism design is

4898
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
can explain what mechanism design is
 

4899
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,669
can explain what mechanism design is
and the the fascinating space of playing

4900
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
and the the fascinating space of playing
 

4901
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,270
and the the fascinating space of playing
with games

4902
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,280
with games
 

4903
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,629
with games
and designing games mechanism design is

4904
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:04,639
and designing games mechanism design is
 

4905
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:05,030
and designing games mechanism design is
that

4906
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
that
 

4907
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,310
that
you want to you want a certain behavior

4908
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,320
you want to you want a certain behavior
 

4909
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,550
you want to you want a certain behavior
to arise right if you want to organize

4910
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560
to arise right if you want to organize
 

4911
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,750
to arise right if you want to organize
you know

4912
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
you know
 

4913
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,669
you know
a societal structure or something you

4914
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:13,679
a societal structure or something you
 

4915
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,350
a societal structure or something you
want to have some orderly

4916
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:15,360
want to have some orderly
 

4917
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,070
want to have some orderly
uh behavior to our eyes right because uh

4918
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,080
uh behavior to our eyes right because uh
 

4919
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,430
uh behavior to our eyes right because uh
it is important for

4920
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
it is important for
 

4921
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,709
it is important for
your goals but

01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,870
your goals but
but you know that people they don't care

makers about uh maximizing their utility
so put the grassley making money the

4930
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
so put the grassley making money the
 

4931
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:32,950
so put the grassley making money the
more money

4932

more money
 

4933
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,430
more money
the better so to speak right i'm

4934
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
the better so to speak right i'm
 

4935
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,350
the better so to speak right i'm
exaggerating my self-interest

01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
them so what you want to do
 

4941
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:46,470

is ideally what you want to do is to
 

4943
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:50,830
is ideally what you want to do is to
design a game so that while people

4944
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:50,840
design a game so that while people
 

4945
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,189
design a game so that while people
played so to maximize their

they achieve the social goal and
 

4951
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,030
they achieve the social goal and
behavior that i want

01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,480
that is really the best type of thing
 

4955
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,310
that is really the best type of thing
and it is a very

and it is a very
 

4957
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,910
and it is a very
hard science and art to design

4958
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
hard science and art to design
 

4959
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,350
hard science and art to design
with games and it challenges us

4960
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:13,360
with games and it challenges us
 

4961
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,270
with games and it challenges us
to

4963
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,590

actually come up with solution concepts

actually come up with solution concepts
 

4965
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,070
actually come up with solution concepts

for way to analyzing the games
 

4967

there's a very specific kind of games
 

5007
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,149
there's a very specific kind of games
and the

5008
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:08,159
and the
 

5009
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,669

yes so if you want to reason if there is

5014
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
yes so if you want to reason if there is
 

5015
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,229
yes so if you want to reason if there is
always say

5016
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:16,239
always say
 

5017
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:19,430
always say
that you can analyze a restricted class

5018
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
that you can analyze a restricted class
 

5019
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,870
that you can analyze a restricted class
of games this way

5020
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
of games this way
 

5021
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,750
of games this way
but most games you know don't fall into

5022
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:23,760
but most games you know don't fall into
 

5023
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,870
but most games you know don't fall into
the rest of the class

5024
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:24,880
the rest of the class
 

5025
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,990
the rest of the class
then what do i do when you need to

5026
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
then what do i do when you need to
 

5027
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,750
then what do i do when you need to
enlarge a way what a rational player can

5028
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:31,760
enlarge a way what a rational player can
 

5029
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:32,550
enlarge a way what a rational player can
do

5030
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:32,560
do
 

5031
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,510
do
so for instance uh in my opinion at

5032
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520
so for instance uh in my opinion at
 

5033
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,990
so for instance uh in my opinion at
least in some of my

5034
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:38,000
least in some of my
 

5035
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,270
least in some of my
i played with this for a few years and i

5036
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,280
i played with this for a few years and i
 

5037
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,870
i played with this for a few years and i
i was doing some exotic things i'm sure

5038
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,880
i was doing some exotic things i'm sure
 

5039
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,990
i was doing some exotic things i'm sure
in in the space that was not exactly

5040
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,000
in in the space that was not exactly
 

5041
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,870
in in the space that was not exactly
mainstream

5042
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:48,880
mainstream
 

5043
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,350
mainstream
and then i changed my interest and our

5044
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:51,360
and then i changed my interest and our
 

5045
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,149
and then i changed my interest and our
blockchain

5046
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:52,159
blockchain
 

5047
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,310
blockchain
but what i'm saying for a while i was

5048
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:54,320
but what i'm saying for a while i was
 

5049
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,189
but what i'm saying for a while i was
doing

5050
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
doing
 

5051
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,990
doing
so for instance to me is a way in which

5052
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:58,000
so for instance to me is a way in which
 

5053
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,990
so for instance to me is a way in which
i design the game

5054
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
i design the game
 

5055
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,950
i design the game
and you don't have the best move for you

5056
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:02,960
and you don't have the best move for you
 

5057
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,950
and you don't have the best move for you
the best move is the move that is best

5058
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
the best move is the move that is best
 

5059
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,550
the best move is the move that is best
for you no matter what the other players

5060
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,560
for you no matter what the other players
 

5061
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,189
for you no matter what the other players
are doing

5062
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
are doing
 

5063
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,950
are doing
sometimes a game doesn't have that okay

5064
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
sometimes a game doesn't have that okay
 

5065
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,550
sometimes a game doesn't have that okay
it's too much to ask

5066
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
it's too much to ask
 

5067
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,830
it's too much to ask
but i can design the game such of it

5068
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:13,840
but i can design the game such of it
 

5069
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,750
but i can design the game such of it
given the option in front of you say oh

5070
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:15,760
given the option in front of you say oh
 

5071
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,350
given the option in front of you say oh
these are really stupid for me

5072
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:17,360
these are really stupid for me
 

5073
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,070
these are really stupid for me
take them aside but these these are not

5074
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
take them aside but these these are not
 

5075
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,189
take them aside but these these are not
stupid

5076
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:21,199
stupid
 

5077
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,910
stupid
so if you design them the game solve it

5078
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
so if you design them the game solve it
 

5079
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,430
so if you design them the game solve it
in any combination

5080
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
in any combination
 

5081
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,910
in any combination
or non stupid things that the player can

5082
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:27,920

i i don't give a damn i want to say well

5092
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
i i don't give a damn i want to say well
 

5093

i i don't give a damn i want to say well
as long as you don't do stupid things

5094
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
as long as you don't do stupid things
 

5095
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,709
as long as you don't do stupid things
and nobody else does stupid things

5096
01:32:42,709 --> 01:32:42,719
and nobody else does stupid things

good social things outcome guys i should

5098
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
good social things outcome guys i should
 

5099
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,189
good social things outcome guys i should
be equally happy

5100
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
be equally happy
 

5101
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,310
be equally happy
and so i really believe that um

5102
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
and so i really believe that um
 

5103
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,750
and so i really believe that um
this type of analysis you know is uh as

5104
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:53,760
this type of analysis you know is uh as
 

5105
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,709
this type of analysis you know is uh as
possible and

5106
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:54,719
possible and
 

5107
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,830
possible and
uh as a bigger

5108
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:57,840
uh as a bigger
 

5109
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,189
uh as a bigger
radius so it reaches some more games

5110
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
radius so it reaches some more games
 

5111
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:02,870
radius so it reaches some more games
more classes of games

5112
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
more classes of games
 

5113
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,950
more classes of games
and uh and after that we have to enlarge

5114
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
and uh and after that we have to enlarge
 

5115
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,550
and uh and after that we have to enlarge
it again and uh

5116
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,560
it again and uh
 

5117
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,390
it again and uh
and it's going to be we're going to have

5118
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,400
and it's going to be we're going to have
 

5119
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,669
and it's going to be we're going to have
fun because uh

5120
01:33:09,669 --> 01:33:09,679
fun because uh
 

5121
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,310
fun because uh
human behavior can be conceptualized

5122
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
human behavior can be conceptualized
 

5123
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,470
human behavior can be conceptualized
again in many ways and uh

5124
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:14,480
again in many ways and uh
 

5125
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,629
again in many ways and uh
it's it's a long game jim it's a long

5126
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
it's it's a long game jim it's a long
 

5127
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,390
it's it's a long game jim it's a long
game do you have uh favorite games that

5128
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:18,400
game do you have uh favorite games that
 

5129
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,550
game do you have uh favorite games that
you're looking at now i mean i suppose

5130
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
you're looking at now i mean i suppose
 

5131
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,390
you're looking at now i mean i suppose
your work with blockchain and algorithm

5132
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
your work with blockchain and algorithm
 

5133
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,629
your work with blockchain and algorithm
is the kind of game that you're

5134
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:24,639
is the kind of game that you're
 

5135
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,270
is the kind of game that you're
you you basically just mechanism design

5136
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:27,280
you you basically just mechanism design
 

5137
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,590
you you basically just mechanism design
design the game such that it's

5138
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:29,600
design the game such that it's
 

5139
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,430
design the game such that it's
scalable secure and decentralized right

5140
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
scalable secure and decentralized right
 

5141
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,590
scalable secure and decentralized right
yes yes and very often you have to say

5142
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:35,600
yes yes and very often you have to say
 

5143
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,550
yes yes and very often you have to say
and verify and

5144
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
and verify and
 

5145
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,229
and verify and
you must also design so that the

5146
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
you must also design so that the
 

5147
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:42,550
you must also design so that the
incentives are uh

5148
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560

 

5149
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,070

in terms of whatever little i learned

5150
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,080
in terms of whatever little i learned
 

5151
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,510
in terms of whatever little i learned
from my venture in uh mechanism design

5152
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:49,520
from my venture in uh mechanism design
 

5153
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,669
from my venture in uh mechanism design
is that incentives are very hard to

5154
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
is that incentives are very hard to
 

5155
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,270
is that incentives are very hard to
design

5156
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
design
 

5157
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,270
design
because people are very complex

5158
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
because people are very complex
 

5159
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,950
because people are very complex
creatures and so

5160
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:56,960
creatures and so
 

5161
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,030
creatures and so
and so somehow the way we design

5162
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
and so somehow the way we design
 

5163
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,070
and so somehow the way we design
algorithm is a

5164
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
algorithm is a
 

5165
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,470
algorithm is a
totally different way essentially with

5166
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,480
totally different way essentially with
 

5167
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,990
totally different way essentially with
no incentives essentially

5168
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,000

 

5169
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,470

and and but but technically speaking

5170
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
and and but but technically speaking
 

5171
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,590
and and but but technically speaking
there is a notion

5172
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:09,600
there is a notion
 

5173
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,189
there is a notion
that uh uh is actually believable right

5174
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
that uh uh is actually believable right
 

5175
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,629
that uh uh is actually believable right
so that to say um people want to

5176
01:34:16,629 --> 01:34:16,639
so that to say um people want to
 

5177
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:17,990
so that to say um people want to
maximize their utility

5178
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000
maximize their utility
 

5179
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,709
maximize their utility
yes up to a point let me let me tell you

5180
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:20,719
yes up to a point let me let me tell you
 

5181
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:21,270
yes up to a point let me let me tell you
assume

5182
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
assume
 

5183
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,030
assume
that if you are honest

5184
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,040
that if you are honest
 

5185
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,390
that if you are honest
you make 100 bucks but if you are

5186
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
you make 100 bucks but if you are
 

5187
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,550
you make 100 bucks but if you are
dishonest no matter how dishonest you

5188
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:30,560
dishonest no matter how dishonest you
 

5189
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,310
dishonest no matter how dishonest you
are you can only make 100 bucks

5190
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,320
are you can only make 100 bucks
 

5191
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,270
are you can only make 100 bucks
and one cent what are you going to be

5192
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,280
and one cent what are you going to be
 

5193
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,750
and one cent what are you going to be
i'm saying you know what

5194
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:37,760
i'm saying you know what
 

5195
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,390
i'm saying you know what
technically speaking even that one's

5196
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
technically speaking even that one's
 

5197
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,070
technically speaking even that one's
nobody bothers and say

5198
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,080
nobody bothers and say
 

5199
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,669
nobody bothers and say
how much am i going to make by honest

5200
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:43,679
how much am i going to make by honest
 

5201
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,629
how much am i going to make by honest
100 if i'm devious and if i'm a criminal

5202
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:46,639
100 if i'm devious and if i'm a criminal
 

5203
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,470
100 if i'm devious and if i'm a criminal
100 bucks in one cent you know i might

5204
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:48,480
100 bucks in one cent you know i might
 

5205
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,910
100 bucks in one cent you know i might
as well be honest okay

5206
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:49,920
as well be honest okay
 

5207
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,030
as well be honest okay
so that essentially is called you know

5208
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,040
so that essentially is called you know
 

5209
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,910
so that essentially is called you know
epsilon utility equilibrium but uh i

5210
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
epsilon utility equilibrium but uh i
 

5211
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,189
epsilon utility equilibrium but uh i
think it's it's good

5212
01:34:57,189 --> 01:34:57,199
think it's it's good
 

5213
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:00,149
think it's it's good
and and and uh and that's what we design

5214
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:00,159
and and and uh and that's what we design
 

5215
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,629
and and and uh and that's what we design
essentially means of it you know

5216
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
essentially means of it you know
 

5217
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,910
essentially means of it you know
the reason uh having no incentives

5218
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
the reason uh having no incentives
 

5219
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,590
the reason uh having no incentives
is actually a good thing because to

5220
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
is actually a good thing because to
 

5221
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,910
is actually a good thing because to
prevent people from reasoning how else i

5222
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:09,920
prevent people from reasoning how else i
 

5223
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,830
prevent people from reasoning how else i
encounter game the system

5224

encounter game the system
 

5225
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,229
encounter game the system
but why can we achieve an argon to have

5226
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:14,239
but why can we achieve an argon to have
 

5227
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:15,510
but why can we achieve an argon to have
known incentives

5228
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
known incentives
 

5229
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,830

if you have to do a lot of work
 

5237
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,350
if you have to do a lot of work
then you demand to be paid accordingly

5238
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
then you demand to be paid accordingly
 

5239
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,229
then you demand to be paid accordingly
because you right

5240

because you right
 

5241
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,790

01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,390
but if i'm going to say here to add two
and two equal to four how much you want

5244
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
and two equal to four how much you want
 

5245
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,149
and two equal to four how much you want
to me pay for vessel if you don't give

5246
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:34,159
to me pay for vessel if you don't give
 

5247
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:34,870
to me pay for vessel if you don't give
me advice

5248
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:34,880
me advice
 

5249
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,629
me advice
i don't add the two and two i would say

5250
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:36,639
i don't add the two and two i would say
 

5251
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:37,910
i don't add the two and two i would say
you can add 22

5252
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:37,920
you can add 22
 

5253
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,830
you can add 22
in your sleep you don't need to be paid

5254
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:39,840
in your sleep you don't need to be paid
 

5255
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,270
in your sleep you don't need to be paid
to other 2. so

5256
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:41,280
to other 2. so
 

5257
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,270
to other 2. so
the idea is that if we make the system

5258
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:43,280
the idea is that if we make the system
 

5259
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,310
the idea is that if we make the system
so efficient

5260
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
so efficient
 

5261
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,590
so efficient
so that generating the next block is

5262
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
so that generating the next block is
 

5263
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,070
so that generating the next block is
so damn simple it doesn't hit the

5264
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,080
so damn simple it doesn't hit the
 

5265
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,990
so damn simple it doesn't hit the
universe let alone my computer

5266
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
universe let alone my computer
 

5267
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,590
universe let alone my computer
let alone take some microsecond or

5268
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:53,600
let alone take some microsecond or
 

5269
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,070
let alone take some microsecond or
computation i might as well

5270
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
computation i might as well
 

5271
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,709

express such a sophisticated things and
so this

5548
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:04,880
so this
 

5549
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,070
so this
and then the point is that these words

5550
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,080
and then the point is that these words
 

5551
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,470
and then the point is that these words
that uh nobody actually knew because

5552
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:10,480
that uh nobody actually knew because
 

5553
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,149

5557
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:16,950
and plus a bunch of very intricate
rhymes in which they had to rhyme with

things
 

5561
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:21,830
things
and turns out that by getting meaning

5562
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
and turns out that by getting meaning
 

5563
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,430
and turns out that by getting meaning
from the things with the rhyme

5564
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:23,440
from the things with the rhyme
 

5565
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,910
from the things with the rhyme
you essentially guess what the world

5566

you essentially guess what the world
 

5567
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:26,950
you essentially guess what the world
means

5568
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960

very often limitations
 

5593
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,830
very often limitations
are our strength because if you limit

5597
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,790
yourself at a very poor language
somehow you get out of it and you

01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800
somehow you get out of it and you
 

5599
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,390
somehow you get out of it and you
achieve even better form of

5607
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,270
language with lots of resonance from the
prior books so that you can actually

so i really felt that limitations are
our strength

our strength
 

5619
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,310
our strength
and i think that rather than complaining

5620
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:22,320
and i think that rather than complaining
 

5621
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,510
and i think that rather than complaining
about eliminations

5622
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:23,520
about eliminations
 

5623
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,830
about eliminations
we should embrace them because

we should embrace them because
 

5625
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,229
we should embrace them because
if you embrace our limitation limited as

5626
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
if you embrace our limitation limited as
 

5627
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,350
if you embrace our limitation limited as
we are we find

we are we find
 

5629
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,629
we are we find
very creative solutions that people with

01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:34,639
very creative solutions that people with
 

5631
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,430
very creative solutions that people with
less limitation we have we would not

5632
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:37,440
less limitation we have we would not
 

5633
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,030
less limitation we have we would not
even think about it oh this

01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,040
even think about it oh this
 

5635
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,870
even think about it oh this
limitation is a kind of superpower if

5636
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
limitation is a kind of superpower if
 

5637
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,550
limitation is a kind of superpower if
you choose to see it that way
