75
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,069

and that's why we don't have

76
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
and that's why we don't have
 

77
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,789

problems with reinforcement learning you
have to have

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
have to have
 

93
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,069
have to have
some way to maybe simulate that problem

some way to maybe simulate that problem
 

95
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,670

117
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,110
properly
um and so obviously we're missing

118
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
um and so obviously we're missing
 

119
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,710
um and so obviously we're missing
something right and it's quite obvious

120
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
something right and it's quite obvious
 

121
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,390
something right and it's quite obvious
for a lot of people that

122
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
for a lot of people that
 

123
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,910
for a lot of people that
you know the immediate response you get

124
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
you know the immediate response you get
 

125
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,790
you know the immediate response you get
from

126
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
from
 

127
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,869
from
many people is well you know humans use

128
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
many people is well you know humans use
 

129
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,710
many people is well you know humans use
their background knowledge

130
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
their background knowledge
 

131
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,750
their background knowledge
to learn faster and they're right

132
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
to learn faster and they're right
 

133
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,430
to learn faster and they're right
now how was that background knowledge

134
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
now how was that background knowledge
 

135
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,990
now how was that background knowledge
acquired and that's the big question

136
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
acquired and that's the big question
 

137
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,990
acquired and that's the big question
so now you have to ask

138
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
so now you have to ask
 

139
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,430
so now you have to ask
you know how do

140
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
you know how do
 

141
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,110
you know how do

supervision learning
is

178
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
is

okay so

186
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
okay so
 

187
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,390
okay so
you're looking at just observation so

188
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
you're looking at just observation so
 

189
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,550
you're looking at just observation so

all of that that's the that's what you
mean by background knowledge perhaps not

all that basic information
 

213
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,270
all that basic information
and you're saying in in order to learn

214
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
and you're saying in in order to learn
 

215
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,949
and you're saying in in order to learn
to drive

to drive
 

217
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,710

so self-supervised learning still has to

284
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
so self-supervised learning still has to
 

285
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,830
so self-supervised learning still has to
have

286
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
have
 

287
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,909
have
some source of truth

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,550
some source of truth
being told to it by somebody and is so

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
being told to it by somebody and is so
 

291
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,870
being told to it by somebody and is so
you have to figure out a way without

292
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
you have to figure out a way without
 

293
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,830
you have to figure out a way without
human

297
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
assistance or without significant amount
of human assistance to get that truth

298
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
of human assistance to get that truth
 

299
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,030
of human assistance to get that truth
from the world

300
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
from the world
 

301
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,990
from the world
so the mystery there is um

302
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
so the mystery there is um
 

303
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,550
so the mystery there is um
how much signal is there how much truth

304
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
how much signal is there how much truth
 

305
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,070
how much signal is there how much truth
is there that the world gives you

306
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
is there that the world gives you
 

307
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,990
is there that the world gives you
whether it's the human world

308
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
whether it's the human world
 

309
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,510
whether it's the human world
like you watch youtube or something like

310
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
like you watch youtube or something like
 

311
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,790
like you watch youtube or something like
that or it's the more natural world

312
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
that or it's the more natural world
 

313
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,790
that or it's the more natural world
so how much signal is there

314
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
so how much signal is there
 

315
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,189
so how much signal is there
so here's the trick there is way more

316
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
so here's the trick there is way more
 

317
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,469
so here's the trick there is way more
signal

318
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
signal
 

319
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,469
signal
in sort of a self-supervised setting

320
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
in sort of a self-supervised setting
 

321
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,629
in sort of a self-supervised setting
than there is in either a supervised or

322
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
than there is in either a supervised or
 

323
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,390
than there is in either a supervised or

reinforcement setting
 

325
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,110

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
and this is going to my you know analogy
 

327
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,430
and this is going to my you know analogy
of the cake

328
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
of the cake
 

329
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,430
of the cake
the you know low cake as someone has

330
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
the you know low cake as someone has
 

331
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,189
the you know low cake as someone has
called it where

332
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
called it where

there's a

the moment um so whether this will take
 

483
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,790

i think this idea of uh

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
i think this idea of uh
 

499
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,110
i think this idea of uh

539
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,190
what's possible and what's impossible uh
according to into the physics so you

540
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
according to into the physics so you
 

541
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,710
according to into the physics so you
have a model of what's possible what's

have a model of what's possible what's
 

543
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,910
have a model of what's possible what's
impossible and then you'd be very

impossible and then you'd be very
 

545
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,670
impossible and then you'd be very
surprised if it happens and then you'll

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
surprised if it happens and then you'll
 

547
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,750
surprised if it happens and then you'll
have to reconstruct your model

548
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
have to reconstruct your model
 

549
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,190

595
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,230

right but the question is whether we can
 

605
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,350
right but the question is whether we can
come up with sort of a generic

uh this type of approach has been
 

619
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,069
uh this type of approach has been
unbelievably successful in the context

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
getting a machine to learn to represent
 

665
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,350
getting a machine to learn to represent
the visual world for example

666
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
the visual world for example
 

667
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,430
the visual world for example
by just watching video nobody has really

668
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
by just watching video nobody has really
 

669
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,590
by just watching video nobody has really
succeeded in doing this okay well let's

670
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
succeeded in doing this okay well let's
 

671
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,430
succeeded in doing this okay well let's
kind of give a high level overview

672
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
kind of give a high level overview
 

673
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,069
kind of give a high level overview
what's the difference in

674
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
what's the difference in
 

675
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,190
what's the difference in
kind

676
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
kind
 

677
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,030
kind
and in difficulty between vision and

678
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
and in difficulty between vision and
 

679
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,030
and in difficulty between vision and
language so you said

680
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
language so you said
 

681
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,590
language so you said
people haven't been able to

682
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
people haven't been able to
 

683
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,509
people haven't been able to
really kind of crack the problem of

684
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
really kind of crack the problem of
 

685
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,430
really kind of crack the problem of
vision open in terms of self-supervised

686
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
vision open in terms of self-supervised
 

687
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,670
vision open in terms of self-supervised
learning but that may not be necessarily

688
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
learning but that may not be necessarily
 

689
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,870
learning but that may not be necessarily
because it's fundamentally more

690
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
because it's fundamentally more
 

691
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,269
because it's fundamentally more
difficult maybe like when we're talking

692
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
difficult maybe like when we're talking
 

693
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,150
difficult maybe like when we're talking
about achieving like passing

694
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
about achieving like passing
 

695
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,230
about achieving like passing
the turing test and the full spirit of

696
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,240
the turing test and the full spirit of
 

697
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,990
the turing test and the full spirit of
the turing test in language might be

698
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
the turing test in language might be
 

699
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,750
the turing test in language might be
harder than vision that's that's not

700
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
harder than vision that's that's not
 

701
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,230
harder than vision that's that's not
obvious so what in your view which is

702
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
obvious so what in your view which is
 

703
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,269
obvious so what in your view which is
harder

704
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
harder
 

705
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,949
harder
or perhaps are they just the same

706
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
or perhaps are they just the same
 

707
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,030
or perhaps are they just the same
problem when uh

708
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
problem when uh
 

709
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,790
problem when uh
the farther we get to solving each the

710
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
the farther we get to solving each the
 

711
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,470
the farther we get to solving each the
more we realize it's all the same thing

712
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
more we realize it's all the same thing
 

713
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,790
more we realize it's all the same thing
it's all the same cake i think

714
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
it's all the same cake i think
 

715
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,310
it's all the same cake i think
what i'm looking for are methods that

716
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
what i'm looking for are methods that
 

717
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,870
what i'm looking for are methods that
make make them look essentially like the

718
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
make make them look essentially like the
 

719
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,790
make make them look essentially like the
same cake but currently they're not and

720
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
same cake but currently they're not and
 

721
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
same cake but currently they're not and
the main issue

722
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
the main issue
 

723
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,030
the main issue
with

724
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
with
 

725
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,630
with
learning water models or learning

726
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
learning water models or learning
 

727
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,069
learning water models or learning
predictive models

728
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
predictive models
 

729
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,990
predictive models
is that

730
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
is that
 

731
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,870
is that
the prediction is never a single

732
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
the prediction is never a single
 

733
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,670
the prediction is never a single
thing

734
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
thing
 

735
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,750
thing
because the world is not entirely

736
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
because the world is not entirely
 

737
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,110
because the world is not entirely
predictable

738
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
predictable
 

739
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,629
predictable
it may be deterministic or stochastic we

740
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
it may be deterministic or stochastic we
 

741
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,750
it may be deterministic or stochastic we
can get into the philosophical

742
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
can get into the philosophical
 

743
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,470
can get into the philosophical
discussion about it but uh but even if

744
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
discussion about it but uh but even if
 

745
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,750
discussion about it but uh but even if
it's deterministic it's not entirely

746
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
it's deterministic it's not entirely
 

747
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,269
it's deterministic it's not entirely
predictable

748
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
predictable
 

749
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,710
predictable
and so

750
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
and so
 

751
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,629
and so
if i play

752
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
if i play
 

753
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,550
if i play
a short video clip and then i ask you to

754
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
a short video clip and then i ask you to
 

755
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,990
a short video clip and then i ask you to
predict what's going to happen next

756
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
predict what's going to happen next
 

757
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,350
predict what's going to happen next
there's many many plausible

758
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
there's many many plausible
 

759
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,590
there's many many plausible
continuations for that

760
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
continuations for that
 

761
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,870
continuations for that
video clip and the number of

762
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
video clip and the number of
 

763
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,910
video clip and the number of
continuation grows with the

764
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
continuation grows with the
 

765
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,430
continuation grows with the
interval of time that you're asking the

766
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
interval of time that you're asking the
 

767
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,310
interval of time that you're asking the
system to make a prediction uh for

768
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
system to make a prediction uh for
 

769
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,430
system to make a prediction uh for
and so

770
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
and so
 

771
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,069
and so
one big question with supervision is how

772
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
one big question with supervision is how
 

773
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,790
one big question with supervision is how
you

774
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
you
 

775
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,470
you
represent this uncertainty how you

776
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
represent this uncertainty how you
 

777
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,590
represent this uncertainty how you
represent

778
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
represent
 

779
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,350
represent
multiple discrete outcomes how you

780
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
multiple discrete outcomes how you
 

781
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,190
multiple discrete outcomes how you
represent a sort of continuum of

782
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
represent a sort of continuum of
 

783
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,269
represent a sort of continuum of
possible outcomes

784
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
possible outcomes
 

785
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,550
possible outcomes
etc and you know if you are a

786
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
etc and you know if you are a
 

787
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,710
etc and you know if you are a
sort of a classical machine learning

788
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
sort of a classical machine learning
 

789
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,389
sort of a classical machine learning
person you say oh you just represent a

790
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
person you say oh you just represent a
 

791
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,030
person you say oh you just represent a
distribution right

792
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
distribution right
 

793
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,110
distribution right
and that we know how to do

794
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
and that we know how to do
 

795
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,710
and that we know how to do
when we're predicting words missing

796
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
when we're predicting words missing
 

797
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,550
when we're predicting words missing
words in the text because

798
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
words in the text because
 

799
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,389
words in the text because
uh you can have a neural net give a

800
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
uh you can have a neural net give a
 

801
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,470
uh you can have a neural net give a
score for every word in a dictionary

802
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
score for every word in a dictionary
 

803
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,990
score for every word in a dictionary
it's a big you know it's a big list of

804
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
it's a big you know it's a big list of
 

805
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,110
it's a big you know it's a big list of
numbers you know maybe a hundred

806
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
numbers you know maybe a hundred
 

807
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,949
numbers you know maybe a hundred
thousand or so and you can turn them

808
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
thousand or so and you can turn them
 

809
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,870
thousand or so and you can turn them
into a probability distribution that

810
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
into a probability distribution that
 

811
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,710
into a probability distribution that
gives that tells you when i say a

812
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
gives that tells you when i say a
 

813
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,430
gives that tells you when i say a
sentence you know the

814
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
sentence you know the
 

815
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,590

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
you know the cat is chasing the blank in
 

817
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,790
you know the cat is chasing the blank in

the kitchen
 

819
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,990
the kitchen
you know there are only a few words that

820
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
you know there are only a few words that
 

821
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,550
you know there are only a few words that
make sense there you know it could be a

822
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
make sense there you know it could be a
 

823
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,629
make sense there you know it could be a
mouse or it could be a laser spot or you

824
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
mouse or it could be a laser spot or you
 

825
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,389
mouse or it could be a laser spot or you
know something like that right

826
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
know something like that right
 

827
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,430
know something like that right

uh
 

829
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,150
uh
and and if i if i say the the blank is

and and if i if i say the the blank is
 

831
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,829
and and if i if i say the the blank is
changing the blank in the savannah you

832
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
changing the blank in the savannah you
 

833
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,670
changing the blank in the savannah you
also have a bunch of plausible options

834
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
also have a bunch of plausible options
 

835
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,509
also have a bunch of plausible options
for those two words right

836
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
for those two words right
 

837
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,910
for those two words right
um that that because you you have kind

838
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
um that that because you you have kind
 

839
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,590
um that that because you you have kind
of a you know underlying reality that

840
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
of a you know underlying reality that
 

841
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,949
of a you know underlying reality that
you can refer to to sort of fill in

842
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
you can refer to to sort of fill in
 

843
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,949
you can refer to to sort of fill in
those those blanks

844
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
those those blanks
 

845
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,990
those those blanks
um

846
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
um
 

847
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,509
um
so

848
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
so
 

849
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,910
so
you cannot say for sure in the savannah

850
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
you cannot say for sure in the savannah
 

851
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,910
you cannot say for sure in the savannah
if it's a you know a lion or cheetah or

852
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
if it's a you know a lion or cheetah or

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,310

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,670

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
like that i mean it's kind of ridiculous

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,030

that

that
 

903
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,910
that
we're

904
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
we're
 

905
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,590
we're
doing a distribution over every single

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
doing a distribution over every single

it feels like that's a really dumb way

910
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
it feels like that's a really dumb way
 

911
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,750
it feels like that's a really dumb way
to do it

912
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
to do it
 

913
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,790
to do it
um like there seems to there seems to be

914
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
um like there seems to there seems to be
 

915
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,350
um like there seems to there seems to be
like there should be some more

916
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
like there should be some more
 

917
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,030

compressed representation of the

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
compressed representation of the
 

919
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,189
compressed representation of the

920
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
distribution of the words you're right
 

921
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,350

about that and so i agree do you have

922
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
about that and so i agree do you have
 

923
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,509
about that and so i agree do you have
any interesting ideas about how to

924
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
any interesting ideas about how to
 

925
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,030
any interesting ideas about how to

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
represent all the reality in a
 

927
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,710
represent all the reality in a
compressed way such you can form a

928
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
compressed way such you can form a

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,150
compressed way such you can form a

930
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160

931
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,590

big questions you know how do you do

932
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
big questions you know how do you do
 

933
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,590
big questions you know how do you do
that right i mean what's what's kind of

934
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
that right i mean what's what's kind of
 

935
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,110
that right i mean what's what's kind of
you know another thing that that really

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,470
you know another thing that that really

938
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
is
 

939
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,870

00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
uh and it's not the case that those
 

985

996
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
not actually true the reason for this is
 

997
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,670
not actually true the reason for this is
that we don't know how to represent uh

998
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
that we don't know how to represent uh
 

999
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,030
that we don't know how to represent uh
properly distributions over

1000
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
properly distributions over
 

1001
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,069
properly distributions over
combinatorial uh sequences of symbols

1002
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
combinatorial uh sequences of symbols
 

1003
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,990
combinatorial uh sequences of symbols
essentially whenever because the number

1004
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
essentially whenever because the number
 

1005
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,509
essentially whenever because the number
goes exponentially with the length of

1006
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
goes exponentially with the length of
 

1007
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,110
goes exponentially with the length of
the of the symbols

1008
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
the of the symbols
 

1009
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,629
the of the symbols
and so we have to use tricks for this

1010
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
and so we have to use tricks for this
 

1011
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,870
and so we have to use tricks for this
but um those techniques can

1012
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
but um those techniques can
 

1013
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,949
but um those techniques can
you know get around like don't even deal

1014
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
you know get around like don't even deal
 

1015
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,790
you know get around like don't even deal
with it so

1016
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
with it so
 

1017
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,870
with it so
so the big question is like would there

1018
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
so the big question is like would there
 

1019
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,189
so the big question is like would there
be some sort of abstract

1020
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
be some sort of abstract
 

1021
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,430
be some sort of abstract
latent representation of text

1022
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
latent representation of text
 

1023
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,870
latent representation of text
that would say that

1024
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
that would say that
 

1025
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,030
that would say that
you know when i when i switch

1026
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
you know when i when i switch
 

1027
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,550
you know when i when i switch
lion for gazelle

1028
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
lion for gazelle
 

1029
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,430
lion for gazelle
lion for cheetah i also have to switch

1030
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
lion for cheetah i also have to switch
 

1031
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,350
lion for cheetah i also have to switch
zebra for gazelle

1032
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
zebra for gazelle
 

1033
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,629
zebra for gazelle
yeah so

1034
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
yeah so
 

1035
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,870
yeah so
this independence assumption let me

1036
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
this independence assumption let me
 

1037
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,710
this independence assumption let me
throw some criticism at you that i often

1038
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
throw some criticism at you that i often
 

1039
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,790
throw some criticism at you that i often
hear and see how you respond

1040
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
hear and see how you respond
 

1041
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,949
hear and see how you respond
so this kind of filling in the blanks is

1042
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
so this kind of filling in the blanks is
 

1043
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,949
so this kind of filling in the blanks is
just statistics you're not learning

1044
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
just statistics you're not learning
 

1045
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,790
just statistics you're not learning
anything

1046
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
anything
 

1047
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,670
anything
like the deep underlying concepts you're

1048
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
like the deep underlying concepts you're
 

1049
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,949
like the deep underlying concepts you're
just mimicking stuff from

1050
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
just mimicking stuff from
 

1051
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,189
just mimicking stuff from
the past you're not learning anything

1052
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
the past you're not learning anything
 

1053
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,549
the past you're not learning anything
new such that you can use it to

1054
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
new such that you can use it to
 

1055
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,829
new such that you can use it to
generalize about the world

1056
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
generalize about the world
 

1057
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,590
generalize about the world
or okay let me just say the crude

1058
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
or okay let me just say the crude
 

1059
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,069
or okay let me just say the crude
version which is it's just statistics

1060
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
version which is it's just statistics
 

1061
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,549
version which is it's just statistics
it's not intelligence uh what do you

1062
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
it's not intelligence uh what do you
 

1063
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,230
it's not intelligence uh what do you
have to say to that what do you usually

1064
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
have to say to that what do you usually
 

1065
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,590
have to say to that what do you usually
say to that if you kind of hear this

1066
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
say to that if you kind of hear this
 

1067
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,270
say to that if you kind of hear this
kind of thing i don't get into those

1068
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
kind of thing i don't get into those
 

1069
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,949
kind of thing i don't get into those
discussions because they are they're

1070
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
discussions because they are they're
 

1071
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,829
discussions because they are they're
kind of pointless um so first of all

1072
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
kind of pointless um so first of all
 

1073
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,430
kind of pointless um so first of all
it's quite possible that intelligence is

1074
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
it's quite possible that intelligence is
 

1075
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,270
it's quite possible that intelligence is
just statistics it's just statistics of

1076
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
just statistics it's just statistics of
 

1077
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,990
just statistics it's just statistics of
a particular kind yes uh where this is

1078
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
a particular kind yes uh where this is
 

1079
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,830
a particular kind yes uh where this is
the philosophical question it's kind of

1080
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
the philosophical question it's kind of
 

1081
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,630
the philosophical question it's kind of
is

1082
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
is
 

1083
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,390
is
is intel is it possible that

1084
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
is intel is it possible that
 

1085
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,430
is intel is it possible that
intelligence is just statistics yeah

1086
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
intelligence is just statistics yeah
 

1087
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,310
intelligence is just statistics yeah
but what kind of statistics so

1088
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
but what kind of statistics so
 

1089
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,029
but what kind of statistics so
uh if you are asking the question

1090
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
uh if you are asking the question
 

1091
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,950
uh if you are asking the question
are the model of the world the models of

1092
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
are the model of the world the models of
 

1093
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,870
are the model of the world the models of
the world that we learn um do they have

1094
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
the world that we learn um do they have
 

1095
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,270
the world that we learn um do they have
some notion of causality yes

1096
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
some notion of causality yes
 

1097
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,270
some notion of causality yes
so if the criticism comes from people

1098
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
so if the criticism comes from people
 

1099
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,310
so if the criticism comes from people
who say

1100
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
who say
 

1101
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,150
who say
you know current machine learning system

1102
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
you know current machine learning system
 

1103
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,750
you know current machine learning system
don't care about causality which by the

1104
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
don't care about causality which by the
 

1105
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,789
don't care about causality which by the
way is wrong

1106
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
way is wrong
 

1107
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,909
way is wrong
uh

1108
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
uh
 

1109
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,590
uh
you know i agree with them yeah you

1110
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
you know i agree with them yeah you
 

1111
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,270
you know i agree with them yeah you
should you know your model of the world

1112
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
should you know your model of the world
 

1113
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,669
should you know your model of the world
should have your actions as one of your

1114
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
should have your actions as one of your
 

1115
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,950
should have your actions as one of your
of the inputs

1116
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
of the inputs
 

1117
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,549
of the inputs
and that will drive you to learn causal

1118
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
and that will drive you to learn causal
 

1119
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,549
and that will drive you to learn causal
models of the world where you know what

1120
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
models of the world where you know what
 

1121
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,710
models of the world where you know what
you know what uh intervention in the

1122
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
you know what uh intervention in the
 

1123
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,870
you know what uh intervention in the
world will cause what results or you can

1124
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
world will cause what results or you can
 

1125
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,950
world will cause what results or you can
do this by observation of other agents

1126
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
do this by observation of other agents
 

1127
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,110
do this by observation of other agents
uh acting in the world and and observing

1128
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
uh acting in the world and and observing
 

1129
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,310
uh acting in the world and and observing
the effect

1130
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
the effect
 

1131
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,070
the effect
uh other humans for example so i think

1132
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
uh other humans for example so i think
 

1133
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,230
uh other humans for example so i think
you know at some level of description uh

1134
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
you know at some level of description uh
 

1135
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,710
you know at some level of description uh
intelligence is just statistics

1136
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
intelligence is just statistics
 

1137
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,110
intelligence is just statistics
uh but that doesn't mean you don't you

1138
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
uh but that doesn't mean you don't you
 

1139
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,029
uh but that doesn't mean you don't you
don't you know you won't have models

1140
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
don't you know you won't have models
 

1141
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,669
don't you know you won't have models
that have you know deep mechanistic

1142
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
that have you know deep mechanistic
 

1143
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,590
that have you know deep mechanistic
explanation for what goes on

1144
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
explanation for what goes on
 

1145
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,590
explanation for what goes on
uh the question is how do you learn them

1146
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
uh the question is how do you learn them
 

1147
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,630
uh the question is how do you learn them
that's that's the question i'm

1148
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
that's that's the question i'm
 

1149
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,830
that's that's the question i'm
interested in

1150
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
interested in
 

1151
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,350
interested in
uh because

1152
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
uh because
 

1153
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,190
uh because
you know a lot of people who actually

1154
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
you know a lot of people who actually
 

1155
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,350
you know a lot of people who actually
voice their criticism

1156
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
say that those mechanistic model has to
 

1159
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,630
say that those mechanistic model has to
have to come from someplace else they

1160
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
have to come from someplace else they
 

1161
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,990
have to come from someplace else they
have to come from human designers they

1162
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
have to come from human designers they
 

1163
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,310
have to come from human designers they
have to come from i don't know what and

1164
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
have to come from i don't know what and
 

1165
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,110

obviously we learn them

1166
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
obviously we learn them
 

1167
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,630
obviously we learn them
or if we don't learn them as an

1168
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
or if we don't learn them as an
 

1169
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,029
or if we don't learn them as an
individual nature

1170
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
individual nature
 

1171
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,510

learn them for us using evolution so

1172
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
learn them for us using evolution so
 

1173
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,190
learn them for us using evolution so
regardless of what you think those

1174
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
regardless of what you think those
 

1175
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,150
regardless of what you think those
processes have been learned somehow

1176
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
processes have been learned somehow
 

1177
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,789
processes have been learned somehow
so if you look at the the human brain

1178
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
so if you look at the the human brain
 

1179
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,549
so if you look at the the human brain
just like when we humans introspect

1180
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
just like when we humans introspect
 

1181
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,230
just like when we humans introspect
about how the brain works

1182
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
about how the brain works
 

1183
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,789
about how the brain works
it seems like when we think about what

1184
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
it seems like when we think about what
 

1185
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,270
it seems like when we think about what
is intelligence we think about

1186
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
is intelligence we think about
 

1187
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,950
is intelligence we think about
the high level stuff like the models

1188
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
the high level stuff like the models
 

1189
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,549
the high level stuff like the models
we've constructed concepts like

1190
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
we've constructed concepts like
 

1191
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,230
we've constructed concepts like
cognitive science like concepts of

cognitive science like concepts of
 

1193
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,350

kind of fill in the gap kind of learning

1232
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
kind of fill in the gap kind of learning
 

1233
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,710
kind of fill in the gap kind of learning
and just kind of updating the model

1234
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
and just kind of updating the model
 

1235
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,549
and just kind of updating the model
constantly in order to be able to

1236
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
constantly in order to be able to
 

1237
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,270
constantly in order to be able to
support the raw sensory information to

1238
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
support the raw sensory information to
 

1239
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,789
support the raw sensory information to
predict it and then adjust to the

1240
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
predict it and then adjust to the
 

1241
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,430
predict it and then adjust to the
prediction when it's wrong but like kyla

1242
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
prediction when it's wrong but like kyla
 

1243
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,110
prediction when it's wrong but like kyla
when we look at our brain at the high

1244
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
when we look at our brain at the high
 

1245
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,350
when we look at our brain at the high
level it feels like we're doing like

1246
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
level it feels like we're doing like
 

1247
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,029
level it feels like we're doing like
we're playing chess like

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
we're playing chess like
 

1249
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,270
we're playing chess like
we're we're like playing with high level

1250
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
we're we're like playing with high level
 

1251
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,029
we're we're like playing with high level
concepts and we're stitching them

1252
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
concepts and we're stitching them
 

1253
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,630
concepts and we're stitching them
together and we're putting them into

1254
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
together and we're putting them into
 

1255
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,110
together and we're putting them into
long-term memory but really what's going

1256
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
long-term memory but really what's going
 

1257
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,230
long-term memory but really what's going
underneath

1258
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
underneath
 

1259
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,510
underneath
is something we're not able to

1260
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
is something we're not able to
 

1261
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,909
is something we're not able to
introspect which is this kind of

1262
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
introspect which is this kind of
 

1263
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,470
introspect which is this kind of
uh simple large neural network that's

1264
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
uh simple large neural network that's
 

1265
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,029
uh simple large neural network that's
just filling in the gaps right well okay

1266
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
just filling in the gaps right well okay
 

1267
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,549
just filling in the gaps right well okay
so there's a lot of questions there are

1268
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
so there's a lot of questions there are
 

1269
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,390
so there's a lot of questions there are
answers there okay so first of all

1270
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
answers there okay so first of all
 

1271
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,669
answers there okay so first of all
there's a whole school of thought in

00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
there's a whole school of thought in

that likes the idea of predictive coding
 

1279
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,990
that likes the idea of predictive coding
which is really related to the idea i

was talking about in self-supervised
learning so everything is about

1284
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
learning so everything is about
 

1285
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,549
learning so everything is about
prediction the essence of intelligence

1286

prediction the essence of intelligence
 

1287
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,230
prediction the essence of intelligence
is the ability to predict

1288
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
is the ability to predict
 

1289
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,750
is the ability to predict
and everything the brain does is trying

1290
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
and everything the brain does is trying
 

1291
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,029

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
uh predict everything from everything
 

1295
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,350
uh predict everything from everything
else okay and that's really sort of the

1296
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
else okay and that's really sort of the
 

1297
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,070
else okay and that's really sort of the
underlying principle if you want that

1298
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
underlying principle if you want that
 

1299
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,230

uh cell supervisor learning is trying to

1300
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
uh cell supervisor learning is trying to
 

1301
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,070
uh cell supervisor learning is trying to
kind of reproduce this idea of

1302
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
kind of reproduce this idea of
 

1303
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,750
kind of reproduce this idea of

the next step is
 

1313
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,430
the next step is
what kind of intelligence are you

1314
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
what kind of intelligence are you
 

1315
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,149
what kind of intelligence are you
interested in reproducing and of course

you know we all think about you know
trying to reproduce sort of you know

1320
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
trying to reproduce sort of you know
 

1321
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,230
trying to reproduce sort of you know
high-level cognitive processes in humans

1322
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
high-level cognitive processes in humans
 

1323
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,909
high-level cognitive processes in humans
but like with machines we're not even at

1324
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
but like with machines we're not even at
 

1325
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,430
but like with machines we're not even at
the level of

1326
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
the level of
 

1327
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,190
the level of
even reproducing the

1328
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
even reproducing the
 

1329
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,149
even reproducing the
learning processes in a in a cat brain

1330
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
learning processes in a in a cat brain
 

1331
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,990
learning processes in a in a cat brain
um you know the most intelligent or

1332
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
um you know the most intelligent or
 

1333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,750
um you know the most intelligent or
intelligent systems don't don't have as

1334
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
intelligent systems don't don't have as
 

1335
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,190
intelligent systems don't don't have as
much common sense as as a house cat

1336
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
much common sense as as a house cat
 

1337
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,430
much common sense as as a house cat
so um how is it that cats learn and you

1338
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,440
so um how is it that cats learn and you
 

1339
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,350
so um how is it that cats learn and you
know cats don't do a whole lot of uh

1340
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
know cats don't do a whole lot of uh
 

1341
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,789
know cats don't do a whole lot of uh
reasoning they certainly have causal

1342
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
reasoning they certainly have causal
 

1343
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,029
reasoning they certainly have causal
models they certainly have

1344
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
models they certainly have
 

1345
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,190
models they certainly have
uh because you know many cats can figure

1346
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
uh because you know many cats can figure
 

1347
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,549
uh because you know many cats can figure
out like how they can act on the world

1348
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
out like how they can act on the world
 

1349
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,029
out like how they can act on the world
to get what they want um they certainly

1350
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
to get what they want um they certainly
 

1351
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,470
to get what they want um they certainly
have uh a fantastic model of intuitive

1352
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
have uh a fantastic model of intuitive
 

1353
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,190
have uh a fantastic model of intuitive
physics uh certainly of the the the

1354
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
physics uh certainly of the the the
 

1355
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
physics uh certainly of the the the
dynamics of their own bodies but but

1356
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
dynamics of their own bodies but but
 

1357
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,549
dynamics of their own bodies but but
also of praise and things like that

1358
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
also of praise and things like that
 

1359
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,750
also of praise and things like that
right so

1360
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
right so
 

1361
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,990
right so
um they they're they're pretty smart

1362
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
um they they're they're pretty smart
 

1363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,669
um they they're they're pretty smart
they only do this with about 800 million

1364
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
they only do this with about 800 million
 

1365
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,510
they only do this with about 800 million
neurons

1366
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
neurons
 

1367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,630
neurons
we are not anywhere close to reproducing

1368
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
we are not anywhere close to reproducing
 

1369
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,590
we are not anywhere close to reproducing
this kind of

1370
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
this kind of
 

1371
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,230
this kind of
thing so to some extent i could i could

1372
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
thing so to some extent i could i could
 

1373
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,190
thing so to some extent i could i could
say

1374
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
say
 

1375
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,510
say
let's not even worry about like the high

1376
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
let's not even worry about like the high
 

1377
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,149
let's not even worry about like the high
level cognition

1378
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
level cognition
 

1379
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,350
level cognition
and kind of you know long-term planning

1380
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
and kind of you know long-term planning
 

1381
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,870
and kind of you know long-term planning
and reasoning that humans can do until

1382
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
and reasoning that humans can do until
 

1383
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,390
and reasoning that humans can do until
we figure out like you know can we even

1384
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
we figure out like you know can we even
 

1385
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,390
we figure out like you know can we even
reproduce what cats are doing

1386
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
reproduce what cats are doing
 

1387
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,590
reproduce what cats are doing
now that said this ability to

1388
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
now that said this ability to
 

1389
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,029
now that said this ability to
learn world models i think is the key to

1390
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
learn world models i think is the key to
 

1391
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,789
learn world models i think is the key to
the possibility of

1392
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
the possibility of
 

1393
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,950
the possibility of
learning machines that can also reason

1394
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
learning machines that can also reason
 

1395
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,390
learning machines that can also reason
so whenever i give a talk i'd say there

1396
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
so whenever i give a talk i'd say there
 

1397
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,830
so whenever i give a talk i'd say there
are there are three challenges in the

1398
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
are there are three challenges in the
 

1399
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,950
are there are three challenges in the
three main challenges in machine

1400
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
three main challenges in machine
 

1401
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,470
three main challenges in machine
learning the first one is

1402
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
learning the first one is
 

1403
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,909
learning the first one is
uh you know getting machines to learn to

1404
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
uh you know getting machines to learn to
 

1405
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,669
uh you know getting machines to learn to
represent the world

1406
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
represent the world
 

1407
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,630
represent the world
and proposing salt supervised running

1408
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
and proposing salt supervised running
 

1409
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,390
and proposing salt supervised running
the second is

1410
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
the second is
 

1411
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,390
the second is
getting machines to reason in ways that

1412
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
getting machines to reason in ways that
 

1413
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,230
getting machines to reason in ways that
are compatible with

1414
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
are compatible with
 

1415
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,510
are compatible with
essentially gradient-based learning

1416
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
essentially gradient-based learning
 

1417
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,710
essentially gradient-based learning
because this is what deep learning is

1418
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
because this is what deep learning is
 

1419
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,110
because this is what deep learning is
all about really

1420
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
all about really
 

1421
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,630
all about really
and the third one is something we have

1422
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
and the third one is something we have
 

1423
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,149
and the third one is something we have
no idea how to solve at least i have no

is uh

1428
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
is uh
 

1429
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,630
is uh
can we get machines to learn

1430
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
can we get machines to learn
 

1431
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,110
can we get machines to learn
hierarchical representations of action

1432
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
hierarchical representations of action
 

1433
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,870
hierarchical representations of action
plans

1434
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
plans
 

1435
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,310
plans
you know like you know we know how to

1436
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
you know like you know we know how to
 

1437
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,510
you know like you know we know how to
train them to learn hierarchical

1438
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
train them to learn hierarchical
 

1439
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,830
train them to learn hierarchical
representations of

1440
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
representations of
 

1441
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,630
representations of
perception you know with computational

1442
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
perception you know with computational
 

1443
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,750
perception you know with computational
nets and things like that and

1444
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
nets and things like that and
 

1445
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,990
nets and things like that and
transformers but what about action plans

1446
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
transformers but what about action plans
 

1447
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,990
transformers but what about action plans
can we uh get them to spontaneously

1448
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
can we uh get them to spontaneously
 

1449
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,750
can we uh get them to spontaneously
learn good hierarchical representations

1450
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
learn good hierarchical representations
 

1451
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,310
learn good hierarchical representations
of actions also gradient based

1452
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
of actions also gradient based
 

1453
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,630
of actions also gradient based
yeah all of that you know needs to be

1454
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
yeah all of that you know needs to be
 

1455
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,310
yeah all of that you know needs to be
somewhat differentiable so that you can

1456
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
somewhat differentiable so that you can
 

1457
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,549
somewhat differentiable so that you can
apply sort of gradient-based learning uh

1458
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
apply sort of gradient-based learning uh
 

1459
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,830
apply sort of gradient-based learning uh
which is really what deep learning is

1460
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
which is really what deep learning is
 

1461
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,990
which is really what deep learning is
about

00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
so it's background
 

1465
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,269
so it's background
knowledge ability to reason in a way

1466
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279

 

1467
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,750

this differentiable that

1468
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
this differentiable that
 

1469
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,669
this differentiable that
is somehow connected deeply integrated

1470
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
is somehow connected deeply integrated
 

1471
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,830
is somehow connected deeply integrated
with that background knowledge or builds

1472
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
with that background knowledge or builds
 

1473
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,510
with that background knowledge or builds
on top of that background knowledge and

1474
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
on top of that background knowledge and
 

1475
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,110
on top of that background knowledge and
then given that background knowledge be

1476
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
then given that background knowledge be
 

1477
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,510
then given that background knowledge be
able to make hierarchical plans right in

1478
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
able to make hierarchical plans right in
 

1479
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,470
able to make hierarchical plans right in
the world so if if you take classical

1480
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
the world so if if you take classical
 

1481
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,830
the world so if if you take classical
optimal control there's something in

1482
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
optimal control there's something in
 

1483
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,750
optimal control there's something in
classical optimal control called

1484
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
classical optimal control called
 

1485
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,630
classical optimal control called
uh

1486
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
uh
 

1487
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,390
uh
model predictive control

1488
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
model predictive control
 

1489
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,149
model predictive control
and it's you know it's been around since

1490
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
and it's you know it's been around since
 

1491
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,669
and it's you know it's been around since
the early 60s

1492
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
the early 60s
 

1493
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,669
the early 60s
nasa uses that to compute trajectories

1494
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
nasa uses that to compute trajectories
 

1495
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,750
nasa uses that to compute trajectories
of rockets and the basic idea is that

1496
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
of rockets and the basic idea is that
 

1497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,470
of rockets and the basic idea is that
you have a pretty predictive model

1498
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
you have a pretty predictive model
 

1499
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,310
you have a pretty predictive model
of the rocket let's say or whatever

1500
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
of the rocket let's say or whatever
 

1501
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,350
of the rocket let's say or whatever
system you are you intend to control

1502
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
system you are you intend to control
 

1503
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,230
system you are you intend to control
which

1504
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
which
 

1505
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,230
which
given the state of the system at time t

1506
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
given the state of the system at time t
 

1507
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,909
given the state of the system at time t
and given an action

1508
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
and given an action
 

1509
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,230
and given an action
that you're taking the system so for

1510
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
that you're taking the system so for
 

1511
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,470
that you're taking the system so for
rocket to be thrust and you know all the

1512
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
rocket to be thrust and you know all the
 

1513
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,070
rocket to be thrust and you know all the
controls you can have

1514
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
controls you can have
 

1515
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,750
controls you can have
uh it gives you the state of the system

1516
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
uh it gives you the state of the system
 

1517
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,590
uh it gives you the state of the system
at time t plus delta t right so

1518
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
at time t plus delta t right so
 

1519
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,870
at time t plus delta t right so
basically a differential equation

1520
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
basically a differential equation
 

1521
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,630
basically a differential equation
something like that

1522
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
something like that
 

1523
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,149
something like that
um

1524
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
um
 

1525
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,149
um
and if you have this model and you have

1526
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
and if you have this model and you have
 

1527
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,190
and if you have this model and you have
this model

1528
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
this model
 

1529
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,269
this model
in the form of some sort of neural net

1530
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
in the form of some sort of neural net
 

1531
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,590
in the form of some sort of neural net
or some sort of uh set of formula that

1532
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600
or some sort of uh set of formula that
 

1533
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,430
or some sort of uh set of formula that
you can back propagate gradient through

1534
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
you can back propagate gradient through
 

1535
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,390
you can back propagate gradient through
you can do what's called model

1536
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
you can do what's called model
 

1537
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,950
you can do what's called model
predictive control or gradient based

1538
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
predictive control or gradient based
 

1539
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,669
predictive control or gradient based
uh model predictive control so you have

1540
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
uh model predictive control so you have
 

1541
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,029
uh model predictive control so you have
uh you can unroll that

1542
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
uh you can unroll that
 

1543
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,830
uh you can unroll that
that model in time you you

1544
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
that model in time you you
 

1545
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,070
that model in time you you
you you feel it a

1546
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
you you feel it a
 

1547
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,950
you you feel it a
hypothesized sequence of actions

1548
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
hypothesized sequence of actions
 

1549
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,110
hypothesized sequence of actions
and then you have some objective

1550
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
and then you have some objective
 

1551
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,110
and then you have some objective
function that measures how well at the

1552
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
function that measures how well at the
 

1553
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,789
function that measures how well at the
end of the trajectory the system has

1554
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
end of the trajectory the system has
 

1555
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,390
end of the trajectory the system has
succeeded or matched what you wanted to

1556
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
succeeded or matched what you wanted to
 

1557
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,190
succeeded or matched what you wanted to
do

1558
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
do
 

1559
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,350
do
um you know is it a robot harm have you

1560
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
um you know is it a robot harm have you
 

1561
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,430
um you know is it a robot harm have you
grasped the object you want to grasp if

1562
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
grasped the object you want to grasp if
 

1563
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,750
grasped the object you want to grasp if
it's a rocket you know are you at the

1564
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
it's a rocket you know are you at the
 

1565
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,430
it's a rocket you know are you at the
right place near the space station

1566
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
right place near the space station
 

1567
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,950
right place near the space station
things like that

1568
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
things like that
 

1569
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,870
things like that
and by back propagation through time and

1570
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
and by back propagation through time and
 

1571
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,950
and by back propagation through time and
again this was invented in the 1960s by

1572
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
again this was invented in the 1960s by
 

1573
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,029
again this was invented in the 1960s by
optimal control theorists

1574
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
optimal control theorists
 

1575
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,510
optimal control theorists
you can figure out uh what is the

1576
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
you can figure out uh what is the
 

1577
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,549
you can figure out uh what is the
optimal sequence of actions that will

1578
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
optimal sequence of actions that will
 

1579
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,110
optimal sequence of actions that will
you know get my system to the the best

1580
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
you know get my system to the the best
 

1581
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,029
you know get my system to the the best
final state

1582
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
final state
 

1583
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,230
final state
so

1584
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
so
 

1585
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,590
so
that's a form of reasoning it's

1586
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
that's a form of reasoning it's
 

1587
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,750
that's a form of reasoning it's
basically planning and a lot of planning

1588
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
basically planning and a lot of planning
 

1589
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,269
basically planning and a lot of planning
uh systems in robotics are actually

1590
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
uh systems in robotics are actually
 

1591
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,789
uh systems in robotics are actually
based on this

1592
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
based on this
 

1593
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,470
based on this
and uh

1594
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
and uh
 

1595
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,669
and uh
and you can think of this as a form of

1596
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
and you can think of this as a form of
 

1597
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,870
and you can think of this as a form of
reasoning so

1598
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
reasoning so
 

1599
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,870
reasoning so
you know to take the example of the

1600
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
you know to take the example of the
 

1601
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,269
you know to take the example of the
teenager driving a car again you have a

1602
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:01,279
teenager driving a car again you have a
 

1603
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,789
teenager driving a car again you have a
pretty good dynamical model of the car

1604
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799
pretty good dynamical model of the car
 

1605
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,230
pretty good dynamical model of the car
it doesn't need to be very accurate but

1606
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
it doesn't need to be very accurate but
 

1607
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,149
it doesn't need to be very accurate but
you know again that if you

1608
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:06,159
you know again that if you
 

1609
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,590
you know again that if you
turn the wheel to the right and there is

1610
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
turn the wheel to the right and there is
 

1611
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,029
turn the wheel to the right and there is
a cliff you're gonna run off the cliff

1612
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
a cliff you're gonna run off the cliff
 

1613
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,149
a cliff you're gonna run off the cliff
right you don't need to have a very

1614
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
right you don't need to have a very
 

1615
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,909
right you don't need to have a very
accurate model to predict that

1616
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
accurate model to predict that
 

1617
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,669
accurate model to predict that
and you can run this in your mind and

1618
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
and you can run this in your mind and
 

1619
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,909
and you can run this in your mind and
decide not to do it for that reason

1620
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
decide not to do it for that reason
 

1621
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,430
decide not to do it for that reason
because you can predict in advance that

1622
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
because you can predict in advance that
 

1623
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,870
because you can predict in advance that
the result is going to be bad so you can

1624
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
the result is going to be bad so you can
 

1625
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,950
the result is going to be bad so you can
sort of imagine different scenarios

1626
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
sort of imagine different scenarios
 

1627
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,110
sort of imagine different scenarios
and and then you know employ

1628
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
and and then you know employ
 

1629
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,710
and and then you know employ
uh or take the first step in the

1630
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
uh or take the first step in the
 

1631
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,470
uh or take the first step in the
scenario that is most favorable and then

1632
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
scenario that is most favorable and then
 

1633
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,830
scenario that is most favorable and then
repeat the process of planning that's

1634
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
repeat the process of planning that's
 

1635
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,830
repeat the process of planning that's
called receding horizon model predictive

1636
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
called receding horizon model predictive
 

1637
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,190
called receding horizon model predictive
control so even you know all those

1638
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
control so even you know all those
 

1639
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,590
control so even you know all those
things have names you know uh going back

1640
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
things have names you know uh going back
 

1641
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,669
things have names you know uh going back
you know decades um

1642
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
you know decades um
 

1643
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,870
you know decades um
and so

1644
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
and so
 

1645
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,190
and so
if you're not not uh you know classical

1646
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
if you're not not uh you know classical
 

1647
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,630
if you're not not uh you know classical
optimal control the model of the world

1648
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640

is not generally learned

1650
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
is not generally learned
 

1651
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,230
is not generally learned
uh there's you know sometimes a few

1652
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
uh there's you know sometimes a few
 

1653
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,590
uh there's you know sometimes a few
parameters you have to identify that's

1654
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
parameters you have to identify that's
 

1655
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,750
parameters you have to identify that's
called systems identification but

1656
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
called systems identification but
 

1657
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,350
called systems identification but
uh but generally

1658
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
uh but generally
 

1659
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,870
uh but generally
the model is

1660
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
the model is
 

1661
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,870
the model is
mostly deterministic and mostly built by

1662
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
mostly deterministic and mostly built by
 

1663
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,750

hand so the big question of ai

1664
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
hand so the big question of ai
 

1665
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,350
hand so the big question of ai
i think the big challenge of ai for the

1666
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
i think the big challenge of ai for the
 

1667
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,909
i think the big challenge of ai for the
next decade is how do we get machines to

1668
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
next decade is how do we get machines to
 

1669
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,750
next decade is how do we get machines to
learn predictive models of the world

1670
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
learn predictive models of the world
 

1671
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,070

that deal with uncertainty and deal with

1672
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
that deal with uncertainty and deal with
 

1673
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,830
that deal with uncertainty and deal with
the real world in all this complexity so

1674
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
the real world in all this complexity so
 

1675
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,990
the real world in all this complexity so
it's not just the trajectory of a rocket

1676
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
it's not just the trajectory of a rocket
 

1677
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,070
it's not just the trajectory of a rocket
which you can reduce to first principles

1678
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
which you can reduce to first principles
 

1679
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,750
which you can reduce to first principles
it's not it's not even just a trajectory

1680
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
it's not it's not even just a trajectory
 

1681
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,830
it's not it's not even just a trajectory
of a robot arm which again you can model

1682
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:13,840
of a robot arm which again you can model
 

1683
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,470
of a robot arm which again you can model
by you know careful mathematics but it's

1684
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480

door this big philosophical question but
 

1777
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,549
door this big philosophical question but
to me it was interesting because like

1778

to me it was interesting because like
 

1779
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,710
to me it was interesting because like
it's obvious that the person opening the

it's obvious that the person opening the
 

1781
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,310
it's obvious that the person opening the

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,590
i it feels like um
it's not just i mean i guess you can

1804
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
it's not just i mean i guess you can
 

1805
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,430
it's not just i mean i guess you can
integrate all of them into one giant

1806
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
integrate all of them into one giant
 

1807
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,630
integrate all of them into one giant
model like the entirety of the the

1808
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
model like the entirety of the the
 

1809
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,389
model like the entirety of the the
these little interactions because it's

1810
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
these little interactions because it's
 

1811
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,830
these little interactions because it's
not as complicated as chess it's just

1812
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
not as complicated as chess it's just
 

1813
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,669
not as complicated as chess it's just
like a little dance we do like a little

1814
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
like a little dance we do like a little
 

1815
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,830
like a little dance we do like a little
dance together and then we figure it out

1816
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
dance together and then we figure it out
 

1817
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,110
dance together and then we figure it out
well in some ways it's way more

1818
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
well in some ways it's way more
 

1819
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,669
well in some ways it's way more
complicated than chess because uh

1820
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
complicated than chess because uh
 

1821
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,830
complicated than chess because uh
because it's continuous it's uncertain

1822
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:35,840
because it's continuous it's uncertain
 

1823
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,590
because it's continuous it's uncertain
in a continuous manner

1824
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
in a continuous manner
 

1825
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,830
in a continuous manner
uh it doesn't feel more complicated but

1826
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
uh it doesn't feel more complicated but
 

1827
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,190
uh it doesn't feel more complicated but
it doesn't feel more complicated because

1828
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
it doesn't feel more complicated because
 

1829
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,110
it doesn't feel more complicated because
that's what we are we've evolved to

1830
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
that's what we are we've evolved to
 

1831
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,549
that's what we are we've evolved to
solve this is the kind of problem we've

1832
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
solve this is the kind of problem we've
 

1833
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,310
solve this is the kind of problem we've
evolved to solve and so we're good at it

1834
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
evolved to solve and so we're good at it
 

1835
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,590
evolved to solve and so we're good at it
because you know

1836
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
because you know
 

1837
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,389
because you know
nature has made us good at it

1838
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
nature has made us good at it
 

1839
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,389
nature has made us good at it
nature has not made us good at chess we

1840
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
nature has not made us good at chess we
 

1841
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,510
nature has not made us good at chess we
completely suck at chess yeah um

1842
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
completely suck at chess yeah um
 

1843
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,590
completely suck at chess yeah um
in fact that's why we designed it as a

1844
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
in fact that's why we designed it as a
 

1845
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,230
in fact that's why we designed it as a
game is to be challenging

1846
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
game is to be challenging
 

1847
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,669
game is to be challenging
and if there is something that you know

1848
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
and if there is something that you know
 

1849
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,070
and if there is something that you know
recent progress in chess and go

1850
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
recent progress in chess and go
 

1851
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,470
recent progress in chess and go
has made us realize is that humans are

1852
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
has made us realize is that humans are
 

1853
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,990
has made us realize is that humans are
really terrible at those things like

1854
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
really terrible at those things like
 

1855
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,230
really terrible at those things like
really bad you know there was a story

1856
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
really bad you know there was a story
 

1857
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,950
really bad you know there was a story
right before alphago that uh

1858
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
right before alphago that uh
 

1859
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,029
right before alphago that uh
uh you know the best go players thought

1860
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
uh you know the best go players thought
 

1861
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,549
uh you know the best go players thought
there were maybe two or three stones

1862
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
there were maybe two or three stones
 

1863
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,470
there were maybe two or three stones
behind you know an ideal player that

1864
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
behind you know an ideal player that
 

1865
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,070
behind you know an ideal player that
they would call god

1866
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
they would call god
 

1867
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,710
they would call god
uh in fact no they are like nine or ten

1868
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
uh in fact no they are like nine or ten
 

1869
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,190
uh in fact no they are like nine or ten
stones behind i mean we're just bad

1870
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
stones behind i mean we're just bad
 

1871
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,909
stones behind i mean we're just bad
so we're not good at and it's because we

1872
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
so we're not good at and it's because we
 

1873
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,310
so we're not good at and it's because we
have limited uh working memory we we're

1874
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
have limited uh working memory we we're
 

1875
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,149
have limited uh working memory we we're
not very good at like doing this uh tree

1876
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
not very good at like doing this uh tree
 

1877
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,750
not very good at like doing this uh tree
exploration that you know computers are

1878
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
exploration that you know computers are
 

1879
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,510
exploration that you know computers are
much better

1880
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
much better
 

1881
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,350
much better
at doing than we are but we are much

1882
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
at doing than we are but we are much
 

1883
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,269
at doing than we are but we are much
better at learning differentiable models

1884
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
better at learning differentiable models
 

1885
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,389
better at learning differentiable models
of the world

1886
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
of the world
 

1887
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,230
of the world
i mean i said differentiable in the kind

1888
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
i mean i said differentiable in the kind
 

1889
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,430
i mean i said differentiable in the kind
of

1890
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
of
 

1891
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,789
of
you know i should say

1892
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
you know i should say
 

1893
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,149
you know i should say
not differentiable in the sense that you

1894
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159
not differentiable in the sense that you
 

1895
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,750
not differentiable in the sense that you
know we went back for up to it but in

1896
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
know we went back for up to it but in
 

1897
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,350
know we went back for up to it but in
the sense that

1898
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
the sense that
 

1899
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,470
the sense that
our brain has some mechanism for

1900
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
our brain has some mechanism for
 

1901
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,350
our brain has some mechanism for
estimating gradients uh of some kind

1902
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
estimating gradients uh of some kind
 

1903
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,269
estimating gradients uh of some kind
yeah and that's what you know makes us

1904
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
yeah and that's what you know makes us
 

1905
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,950
yeah and that's what you know makes us
uh efficient so if you have an agent

1906
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
uh efficient so if you have an agent
 

1907
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,190
uh efficient so if you have an agent
that consists of

1908
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
that consists of
 

1909
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,590
that consists of
a a model of the world which you know in

1910
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
a a model of the world which you know in
 

1911
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,110
a a model of the world which you know in
the human brain is basically the entire

1912
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
the human brain is basically the entire
 

1913
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,310
the human brain is basically the entire
front half of your brain

1914
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320

 

1915
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,070

an objective function

1916
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
an objective function
 

1917
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,269
an objective function
which

1918
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
which
 

1919
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,350
which
uh in human in in humans is a

1920
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,360
uh in human in in humans is a
 

1921
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,430
uh in human in in humans is a
combination of two things there is your

1922
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
combination of two things there is your
 

1923
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,509
combination of two things there is your
sort of intrinsic motivation module

1924
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
sort of intrinsic motivation module
 

1925
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,870
sort of intrinsic motivation module
which is in the basal ganglia you know

1926
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
which is in the basal ganglia you know
 

1927
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,230
which is in the basal ganglia you know
at the base of your brain that's the

1928
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
at the base of your brain that's the
 

1929
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,470
at the base of your brain that's the
thing that measures pain and hunger and

1930
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
thing that measures pain and hunger and
 

1931
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,590
thing that measures pain and hunger and
things like that like immediate

1932
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
things like that like immediate
 

1933
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,830
things like that like immediate
feelings and emotions

1934
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
feelings and emotions
 

1935
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,830
feelings and emotions
and then there is

1936
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
and then there is
 

1937
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,029
and then there is
you know the equivalent of what people

1938
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:31,039
you know the equivalent of what people
 

1939
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,710
you know the equivalent of what people
in reform spectrum called a critic which

1940
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
in reform spectrum called a critic which
 

1941
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,909
in reform spectrum called a critic which
is a sort of module that predicts ahead

1942
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
is a sort of module that predicts ahead
 

1943
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,909
is a sort of module that predicts ahead
what the outcome

1944
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
what the outcome
 

1945
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,509
what the outcome
of a uh

1946
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
of a uh
 

1947
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,750
of a uh
of a situation will be

1948
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
of a situation will be
 

1949
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,830
of a situation will be
and so it's it's not a cost function but

1950
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
and so it's it's not a cost function but
 

1951
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,269
and so it's it's not a cost function but
it's sort of not an objective function

1952
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
it's sort of not an objective function
 

1953
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,430
it's sort of not an objective function
but it's sort of a

1954
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
but it's sort of a
 

1955
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,190
but it's sort of a
you know trained predictor of the

1956
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
you know trained predictor of the
 

1957
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,110
you know trained predictor of the
ultimate objective function and that

1958
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
ultimate objective function and that
 

1959
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,590
ultimate objective function and that
also is differentiable and so if all of

1960
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
also is differentiable and so if all of
 

1961
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,950
also is differentiable and so if all of
this is differentiable your cost

1962
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
this is differentiable your cost
 

1963
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,509
this is differentiable your cost
function your your critic your

00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
function your your critic your
 

1965
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,310
function your your critic your

1966
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
uh
 

1967
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,549
uh
you know your your role model then you

1968
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
you know your your role model then you
 

1969
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,669
you know your your role model then you
can use

1970
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
can use
 

1971
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,269
can use
gradient-based type methods to do

1972
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
gradient-based type methods to do
 

1973
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,909
gradient-based type methods to do
planning to the reasoning to do learning

1974
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
planning to the reasoning to do learning
 

1975
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,590
planning to the reasoning to do learning
uh you know to do all the things that

1976
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
uh you know to do all the things that
 

1977
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,870
uh you know to do all the things that
would like an intelligent agent uh

1978
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
would like an intelligent agent uh
 

1979
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,750
would like an intelligent agent uh
to do

1980
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
to do
 

1981
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,149
to do
and the gradient-based learning like

1982
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
and the gradient-based learning like
 

1983
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,230
and the gradient-based learning like
what's your intuition that's probably at

1984
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
what's your intuition that's probably at
 

1985
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,310
what's your intuition that's probably at
the core of what can solve intelligence

1986
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,320
the core of what can solve intelligence
 

1987
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,990
the core of what can solve intelligence
so you don't need

1988
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
so you don't need
 

1989
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,669
so you don't need
like a

1990
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
like a
 

1991
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,509
like a
logic based reasoning uh in your view i

1992
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
logic based reasoning uh in your view i
 

1993
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,789
logic based reasoning uh in your view i
don't know how to make logic based

1994
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
don't know how to make logic based
 

1995
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,710
don't know how to make logic based
reasoning compatible with

1996
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
reasoning compatible with
 

1997
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,870
reasoning compatible with
efficient learning yeah and

1998
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
efficient learning yeah and
 

1999
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,149
efficient learning yeah and
okay i mean there is a big question

2000
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
okay i mean there is a big question
 

2001
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,909
okay i mean there is a big question
perhaps a philosophical question i mean

2002
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
perhaps a philosophical question i mean
 

2003
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,549
perhaps a philosophical question i mean
it's not that philosophical but uh that

2004
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
it's not that philosophical but uh that
 

2005
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,310
it's not that philosophical but uh that
we can ask is is that you know all the

2006
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
we can ask is is that you know all the
 

2007
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,269
we can ask is is that you know all the
learning

2008
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
learning
 

2009
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,750
learning
algorithms we know from engineering and

2010
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
algorithms we know from engineering and
 

2011
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,110
algorithms we know from engineering and
computer science

2012
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
computer science
 

2013
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,029
computer science
proceed by optimizing some objective

2014
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
proceed by optimizing some objective
 

2015
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,389
proceed by optimizing some objective
function

2016
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
function
 

2017
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,149
function
yeah right

2018
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
yeah right
 

2019
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,789
yeah right
so one question we may ask is

2020
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
so one question we may ask is
 

2021
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,669
so one question we may ask is
is

2022
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:51,679
is
 

2023
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,110
is
does learning in the brain minimize an

2024
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
does learning in the brain minimize an
 

2025
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,710
does learning in the brain minimize an
objective function

2026
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
objective function
 

2027
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,269
objective function
it could be a you know a composite of

2028
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
it could be a you know a composite of
 

2029
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,549
it could be a you know a composite of
multiple objective functions but it's

2030
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
multiple objective functions but it's
 

2031
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,870
multiple objective functions but it's
still an objective function

2032
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
still an objective function
 

2033
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,430
still an objective function
uh second if it does optimize an

2034
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
uh second if it does optimize an
 

2035
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,710
uh second if it does optimize an
objective function

2036
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
objective function
 

2037
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,269
objective function
does it do does it do it by

2038
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
does it do does it do it by
 

2039
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,509
does it do does it do it by
some sort of gradient estimation

2040
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
some sort of gradient estimation
 

2041
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,710
some sort of gradient estimation
you know it doesn't need to be back prop

2042
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
you know it doesn't need to be back prop
 

2043
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,389
you know it doesn't need to be back prop
but you know some way of estimating the

2044
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
but you know some way of estimating the
 

2045
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,630
but you know some way of estimating the
gradient in efficient manner

2046
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
gradient in efficient manner
 

2047
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,389
gradient in efficient manner
whose complexity is on the same order of

2048
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
whose complexity is on the same order of
 

2049
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,110
whose complexity is on the same order of
magnitude as you know actually running

2050
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
magnitude as you know actually running
 

2051
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,070
magnitude as you know actually running
the

2052
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
the
 

2053
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,549
the
inference

2054
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559

 

2055
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,990

because you can't afford to do things

2056
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
because you can't afford to do things
 

2057
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,990
because you can't afford to do things
like you know perturbing a weight in

2058
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
like you know perturbing a weight in
 

2059
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,350
like you know perturbing a weight in
your brain to figure out what the effect

2060
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
your brain to figure out what the effect
 

2061
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,990
your brain to figure out what the effect
is and then sort of uh you know you can

2062
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
is and then sort of uh you know you can
 

2063
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,509
is and then sort of uh you know you can
do sort of estimating gradient by

2064
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
do sort of estimating gradient by
 

2065
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,389
do sort of estimating gradient by
perturbation it's it to me it seems very

2066
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
perturbation it's it to me it seems very
 

2067
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,870
perturbation it's it to me it seems very
imp implausible that the brain uses some

2068
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
imp implausible that the brain uses some
 

2069
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,789
imp implausible that the brain uses some
sort of

2070
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
sort of
 

2071
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,269
sort of
you know zeroth order black box gradient

2072
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
you know zeroth order black box gradient
 

2073
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,870
you know zeroth order black box gradient
free optimization

2074
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
free optimization
 

2075
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,269
free optimization
because it's so much less efficient than

2076
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
because it's so much less efficient than
 

2077
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,789
because it's so much less efficient than
gradient optimization so it has to have

2078
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
gradient optimization so it has to have
 

2079
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,110
gradient optimization so it has to have
a way of estimating gradients

2080
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
a way of estimating gradients
 

2081
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,509
a way of estimating gradients
is it possible that some kind of logic

2082
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
is it possible that some kind of logic
 

2083
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,710
is it possible that some kind of logic
based reasoning emerges in pockets as a

2084
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
based reasoning emerges in pockets as a
 

2085
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,190
based reasoning emerges in pockets as a
useful like you said if the brain is an

2086
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
useful like you said if the brain is an
 

2087
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,470
useful like you said if the brain is an
objective function maybe it's a

2088
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
objective function maybe it's a
 

2089
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,070
objective function maybe it's a
mechanism for creating objective

2090
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
mechanism for creating objective
 

2091
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,110
mechanism for creating objective
functions

2092
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
functions
 

2093
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,830
functions
it's it's a mechanism for

2094
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
it's it's a mechanism for
 

2095
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,389
it's it's a mechanism for
creating knowledge bases for example

2096
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
creating knowledge bases for example
 

2097
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,790
creating knowledge bases for example
that can then be queried like maybe it's

2098
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:08,800
that can then be queried like maybe it's
 

2099
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,310
that can then be queried like maybe it's
like an efficient representation of

2100
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
like an efficient representation of
 

2101
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,510
like an efficient representation of
knowledge that's learned in a

2102
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
knowledge that's learned in a
 

2103
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,109
knowledge that's learned in a
gradient-based way or something like

2104
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
gradient-based way or something like
 

2105
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,109
gradient-based way or something like
that well so i think there is a lot of

2106
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
that well so i think there is a lot of
 

2107
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,710
that well so i think there is a lot of
different types of

2108
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
different types of
 

2109
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,389
different types of
intelligence so first of all i think the

2110
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
intelligence so first of all i think the
 

2111
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,990
intelligence so first of all i think the
type of logical reasoning that we think

2112
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
type of logical reasoning that we think
 

2113
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,109
type of logical reasoning that we think
about

2114
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
about
 

2115
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,710
about
that we are

2116
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
that we are
 

2117
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,629
that we are
you know maybe stemming from

2118
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
you know maybe stemming from
 

2119
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,149
you know maybe stemming from
you know sort of classical ai of the

2120
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
you know sort of classical ai of the
 

2121
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,869
you know sort of classical ai of the
1970s and 80s

2122
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
1970s and 80s
 

2123
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,349
1970s and 80s
i think humans use that relatively

2124
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359
i think humans use that relatively
 

2125
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,790
i think humans use that relatively
rarely

2126
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:32,800
rarely
 

2127
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,629
rarely
and are not particularly good at it but

2128
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
and are not particularly good at it but
 

2129
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,430
and are not particularly good at it but
we judge each other based on our ability

2130
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
we judge each other based on our ability
 

2131
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,470
we judge each other based on our ability
to uh

2132
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
to uh
 

2133
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,790
to uh
solve those rare problems it's called an

2134
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
solve those rare problems it's called an
 

2135
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,669
solve those rare problems it's called an
iq test i think so like i'm i'm not very

2136
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
iq test i think so like i'm i'm not very
 

2137
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,109
iq test i think so like i'm i'm not very
good at chess

2138
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
good at chess
 

2139
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,349
good at chess
yes i'm judging you this whole time

2140
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359
yes i'm judging you this whole time
 

2141
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,389
yes i'm judging you this whole time
because

2142
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
because
 

2143
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,710
because
well we we actually with your with your

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
well we we actually with your with your
 

2145
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,069
well we we actually with your with your
uh you know heritage i'm sure you're

2146
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
uh you know heritage i'm sure you're
 

2147
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,349
uh you know heritage i'm sure you're
good at chess

well i'm terrible at chess so um

2154
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
well i'm terrible at chess so um
 

2155
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,750
well i'm terrible at chess so um
you know but i think perhaps uh another

2156
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
you know but i think perhaps uh another
 

2157
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,589
you know but i think perhaps uh another
type of intelligence that i have is this

2158
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
type of intelligence that i have is this
 

2159
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,550
type of intelligence that i have is this

uh
 

2161
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,470
uh
uh you know ability of sort of building

2162
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
uh you know ability of sort of building
 

2163
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,550
uh you know ability of sort of building
models of the world from

2164
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
models of the world from
 

2165
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,470
models of the world from
uh you know

2166
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
uh you know
 

2167
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,230
uh you know
reasoning obvious obviously but also

2168
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
reasoning obvious obviously but also
 

2169
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,750
reasoning obvious obviously but also
also data

2170
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
also data
 

2171
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,109
also data
and those those models generally are

2172
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
and those those models generally are
 

2173
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,109
and those those models generally are
more kind of analogical right so it's

2174
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
more kind of analogical right so it's
 

2175
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,990
more kind of analogical right so it's
it's

2176
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
it's
 

2177
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,150
it's
it's reasoning by simulation

2178
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
it's reasoning by simulation
 

2179
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,829
it's reasoning by simulation
and by analogy

2180
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
and by analogy
 

2181
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,510
and by analogy
where you use one model to apply to a

2182
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
where you use one model to apply to a
 

2183
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,349
where you use one model to apply to a
new situation even though you've never

2184
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
new situation even though you've never
 

2185
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,150
new situation even though you've never
seen that situation you can sort of

2186
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
seen that situation you can sort of
 

2187
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,589
seen that situation you can sort of
connect it to a situation you've

2188
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
connect it to a situation you've
 

2189
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,950
connect it to a situation you've
encountered before

2190
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
encountered before
 

2191
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,829
encountered before
uh and and your reasoning is more

2192
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
uh and and your reasoning is more
 

2193
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,589
uh and and your reasoning is more
you know akin to some sort of internal

2194
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:37,599
you know akin to some sort of internal
 

2195
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,829
you know akin to some sort of internal
simulation so you you're kind of

2196
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
simulation so you you're kind of
 

2197
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,270
simulation so you you're kind of
stimulating what's happening when you're

2198
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,280
stimulating what's happening when you're
 

2199
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,950
stimulating what's happening when you're
building i don't know a box out of wood

00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
building i don't know a box out of wood
 

2201
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,109
building i don't know a box out of wood
or something right you can imagine

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,119
or something right you can imagine
 

2203
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,270
or something right you can imagine
in advance like what would be the result

2204
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
in advance like what would be the result
 

2205
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,470
in advance like what would be the result
of you know cutting the wood in this

2206
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
of you know cutting the wood in this
 

2207
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,150
of you know cutting the wood in this
particular way are you going to use you

2208
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
particular way are you going to use you
 

2209
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,710
particular way are you going to use you
know screws on nails or whatever

2210
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
know screws on nails or whatever
 

2211
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,990

when you are interacting with someone

2212
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
when you are interacting with someone
 

2213
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,069
when you are interacting with someone
you also have a model of that person and

2214
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
you also have a model of that person and
 

2215
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,109
you also have a model of that person and
and sort of interact with that person

2216
00:35:59,109 --> 00:35:59,119
and sort of interact with that person
 

2217
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,270

you know having this model in mind uh to
 

2219
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,310
you know having this model in mind uh to
kind of

kind of
 

2221
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,310
kind of
uh tell the person what you think is

2222
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
uh tell the person what you think is
 

2223
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,910
uh tell the person what you think is
useful to them so

2224
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
useful to them so
 

2225
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,190
useful to them so
i think this

2226
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
i think this
 

2227
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,589
i think this
this ability to construct most of the

2228
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
this ability to construct most of the
 

2229
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,950
this ability to construct most of the
world is

2230
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
world is
 

2231
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,550
world is
basically the essence the essence of

2232
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
basically the essence the essence of
 

2233
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,670
basically the essence the essence of
intelligence

2234
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
intelligence
 

2235
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,230
intelligence
and the ability to use it then to

2236
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
and the ability to use it then to
 

2237
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,270
and the ability to use it then to
plan uh actions that will

2238
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
plan uh actions that will
 

2239
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,950
plan uh actions that will
uh fulfill a particular criterion

2240
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
uh fulfill a particular criterion
 

2241
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,430
uh fulfill a particular criterion
of course is is necessary as well so i'm

2242
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
of course is is necessary as well so i'm
 

2243
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,190
of course is is necessary as well so i'm
going to ask you a series of impossible

2244
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
going to ask you a series of impossible
 

2245
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,349
going to ask you a series of impossible
questions as we keep asking is that been

2246
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
questions as we keep asking is that been
 

2247
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,870
questions as we keep asking is that been
doing so

2248
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880
doing so
 

2249
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,710
doing so
so if that's the fundamental sort of

2250
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
so if that's the fundamental sort of
 

2251
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,710
so if that's the fundamental sort of
dark matter of intelligence this ability

2252
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
dark matter of intelligence this ability
 

2253
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,950
dark matter of intelligence this ability
to form a background model what's your

2254
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
to form a background model what's your
 

2255
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,710
to form a background model what's your
intuition about

2256
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:38,720
intuition about
 

2257
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,270
intuition about
how much knowledge is required

2258
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
how much knowledge is required
 

2259
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,030
how much knowledge is required
you know you know i think dark matter

2260
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
you know you know i think dark matter
 

2261
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,430
you know you know i think dark matter
you put a percentage

2262
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,440
you put a percentage
 

2263
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,589
you put a percentage
on it

2264
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
on it
 

2265
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,829
on it
of uh the composition of the universe

2266
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
of uh the composition of the universe
 

2267
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,430
of uh the composition of the universe
and how much of it is dark matter how

2268
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:51,440
and how much of it is dark matter how
 

2269
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,430
and how much of it is dark matter how
much of his dark energy how much

2270
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
much of his dark energy how much
 

2271
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,069
much of his dark energy how much
information do you think is required to

2272
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
information do you think is required to
 

2273
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,750
information do you think is required to
to be a house cat

2274
00:36:59,750 --> 00:36:59,760
to be a house cat
 

2275
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,349
to be a house cat
so you have to be able to uh when you

2276
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
so you have to be able to uh when you
 

2277
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,990
so you have to be able to uh when you
see a box going it when you see a human

2278
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
see a box going it when you see a human
 

2279
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,069
see a box going it when you see a human
compute the most evil action

2280
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
compute the most evil action
 

2281
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,829
compute the most evil action
if there's a thing that's near an edge

2282
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
if there's a thing that's near an edge
 

2283
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,510
if there's a thing that's near an edge
you knock it off

2284
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
you knock it off
 

2285
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,870
you knock it off
all of that

2286
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
all of that
 

2287
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,790
all of that
plus the extra stuff you mentioned which

2288
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
plus the extra stuff you mentioned which
 

2289
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,750
plus the extra stuff you mentioned which
is a

2290
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
is a
 

2291
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,750
is a
great self-awareness of the physics of

2292
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:15,760
great self-awareness of the physics of
 

2293
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,550
great self-awareness of the physics of
your of your own body and in the world

2294
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
your of your own body and in the world
 

2295
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,990
your of your own body and in the world
how much knowledge is required do you

2296
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
how much knowledge is required do you
 

2297
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,790
how much knowledge is required do you
think to solve it um i don't even know

2298
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
think to solve it um i don't even know
 

2299
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,310
think to solve it um i don't even know
how to measure

2300
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320
how to measure
 

2301
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,829
how to measure
an answer to that question i'm not sure

2302
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
an answer to that question i'm not sure
 

2303
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,589
an answer to that question i'm not sure
how to measure it but whatever it is it

2304
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
how to measure it but whatever it is it
 

2305
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,150
how to measure it but whatever it is it
fits in about about 800 000 neurons uh

2306
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
fits in about about 800 000 neurons uh
 

2307
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,910
fits in about about 800 000 neurons uh
800 million neurons or the

2308
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
800 million neurons or the
 

2309
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,230
800 million neurons or the
representation does

2310
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240

2311
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,829
representation does
everything all knowledge everything

2312
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
everything all knowledge everything
 

2313
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,870
everything all knowledge everything
right

2314
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
right
 

2315
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,829
right
um

2316
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
um
 

2317
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,829
um
it was less than a billion a dog is two

2318
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:41,839
it was less than a billion a dog is two
 

2319
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,750
it was less than a billion a dog is two
billion but a cat is less than one

2320
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
billion but a cat is less than one
 

2321
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,349
billion but a cat is less than one
billion

2322
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
billion
 

2323
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,630
billion
and uh

2324
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
and uh
 

2325
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,150
and uh
so multiply that by a thousand and you

2326
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
so multiply that by a thousand and you
 

2327
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,790
so multiply that by a thousand and you
get the number of synapses and i think

2328
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
get the number of synapses and i think
 

2329
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,270
get the number of synapses and i think
almost all of it is is learned through

2330
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
almost all of it is is learned through
 

2331
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,510
almost all of it is is learned through
this you know a sort of supervised

2332
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
this you know a sort of supervised
 

2333
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,829
this you know a sort of supervised
running although you know i think a tiny

2334
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
running although you know i think a tiny
 

2335
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,430
running although you know i think a tiny
flavor is learned through reinforcement

2336
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440
flavor is learned through reinforcement
 

2337
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,710
flavor is learned through reinforcement
running and certainly very little

2338
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
running and certainly very little
 

2339
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,750
running and certainly very little
through

2340
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
through
 

2341
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,109
through
you know classical supervised running

2342
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
you know classical supervised running
 

2343
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,310
you know classical supervised running
although it's not even clear how

2344
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
although it's not even clear how
 

2345
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,550
although it's not even clear how
supervised learning actually works in uh

2346
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,560
supervised learning actually works in uh
 

2347
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,630
supervised learning actually works in uh
in a biological world

2348
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
in a biological world
 

2349
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,670
in a biological world
um so i think almost all of it is uh is

2350
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
um so i think almost all of it is uh is
 

2351
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,230
um so i think almost all of it is uh is
self supervision but it's driven

2352
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,240
self supervision but it's driven
 

2353
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,030
self supervision but it's driven
by uh the the sort of ingrained

2354
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
by uh the the sort of ingrained
 

2355
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,910
by uh the the sort of ingrained
objective functions that a cat or human

2356
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
objective functions that a cat or human
 

2357
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,510
objective functions that a cat or human
have at the base of their brain which

2358
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
have at the base of their brain which
 

2359
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,270
have at the base of their brain which
kind of drives their

2360
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
kind of drives their
 

2361
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,390
kind of drives their
um their behavior so you know nature

2362
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
um their behavior so you know nature
 

2363
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,270
um their behavior so you know nature
tells us uh you're hungry

2364
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,280
tells us uh you're hungry
 

2365
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,750
tells us uh you're hungry
it doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves

2366
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
it doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves
 

2367
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,030
it doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves
that's that's something that the rest of

2368
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
that's that's something that the rest of
 

2369
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,510
that's that's something that the rest of
our brain has to figure out right

2370
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
our brain has to figure out right
 

2371
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,550
our brain has to figure out right
well it's interesting because there

2372
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
well it's interesting because there
 

2373
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,030
well it's interesting because there
might be more like deeper objective

2374
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
might be more like deeper objective
 

2375
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,190
might be more like deeper objective
functions underlying the whole thing

2376
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
functions underlying the whole thing
 

2377
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,990
functions underlying the whole thing
so

2378
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,000
so
 

2379
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,390
so
hunger may be some kind of

2380
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
hunger may be some kind of
 

2381
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,150
hunger may be some kind of
now you go to like neurobiology it might

2382
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
now you go to like neurobiology it might
 

2383
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,230
now you go to like neurobiology it might
be just the brain

2384
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
be just the brain
 

2385
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,990
be just the brain
uh

2386
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,000
uh
 

2387
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,310
uh
trying to maintain homeostasis

2388
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
trying to maintain homeostasis
 

2389
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,710
trying to maintain homeostasis
so hunger is just one of the

2390
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
so hunger is just one of the
 

2391
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,030
so hunger is just one of the
human perceivable

2392
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
human perceivable
 

2393
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,349
human perceivable
symptoms of the brain being unhappy with

2394
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
symptoms of the brain being unhappy with
 

2395
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,430
symptoms of the brain being unhappy with
the way things are currently right it

2396
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,440
the way things are currently right it
 

2397
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,109
the way things are currently right it
could be just like one really dumb

2398
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
could be just like one really dumb
 

2399
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,870
could be just like one really dumb
objective function at the core but

2400
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
objective function at the core but
 

2401
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,190
objective function at the core but
that's how that's how behavior is is

2402
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
that's how that's how behavior is is
 

2403
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,069
that's how that's how behavior is is
driven uh the the fact that you know the

2404
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
driven uh the the fact that you know the
 

2405
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,910
driven uh the the fact that you know the
orbital ganglia

2406
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
orbital ganglia
 

2407
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,750
orbital ganglia
uh drive us to do things that are that

2408
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:13,760
uh drive us to do things that are that
 

2409
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,390
uh drive us to do things that are that
are different from saying a wong tong or

2410
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
are different from saying a wong tong or
 

2411
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,069
are different from saying a wong tong or
certainly a cat

2412
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
certainly a cat
 

2413
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,910
certainly a cat
is what makes you know human nature

2414
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:19,920
is what makes you know human nature
 

2415
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,829
is what makes you know human nature
versus orangutan nature versus scat

2416
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
versus orangutan nature versus scat
 

2417
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,109
versus orangutan nature versus scat
nature

2418
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
nature
 

2419
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,790
nature
so for example

2420
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
so for example
 

2421
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,510
so for example
uh you know our basal ganglia drives us

2422
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,520
uh you know our basal ganglia drives us
 

2423
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,470
uh you know our basal ganglia drives us
to

2424
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
to
 

2425
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,630
to
seek the company of

2426
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
seek the company of
 

2427
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,069
seek the company of
other humans

2428
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
other humans
 

2429
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,230
other humans
and that's because nature has figured

2430
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
and that's because nature has figured
 

2431
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,069
and that's because nature has figured
out that we need to be social animals

2432
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:36,079
out that we need to be social animals
 

2433
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,829
out that we need to be social animals
for our species to survive and it's true

2434
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
for our species to survive and it's true
 

2435
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,510
for our species to survive and it's true
of many

2436
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
of many
 

2437
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,109
of many
primates

2438
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
primates
 

2439
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,030
primates
it's not true orangutons orangutans are

2440
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
it's not true orangutons orangutans are
 

2441
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,750
it's not true orangutons orangutans are
solitary animals um they don't seek the

2442
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
solitary animals um they don't seek the
 

2443
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,589
solitary animals um they don't seek the
company of others in fact they avoid

2444
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
company of others in fact they avoid
 

2445
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,109
company of others in fact they avoid
them

2446
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
them
 

2447
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,310
them
in fact they scream at them when they

2448
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
in fact they scream at them when they
 

2449
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,349
in fact they scream at them when they
come too close because they're

2450
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
come too close because they're
 

2451
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,550
come too close because they're
territorial

2452
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
territorial
 

2453
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,270
territorial
because for for their survival you know

2454
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
because for for their survival you know
 

2455
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,950
because for for their survival you know
uh evolution has figured out that's the

2456
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
uh evolution has figured out that's the
 

2457
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,069
uh evolution has figured out that's the
best thing

2458
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
best thing
 

2459
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,670
best thing
i mean they're occasionally social of

2460
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
i mean they're occasionally social of
 

2461
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,069
i mean they're occasionally social of
course for you know

2462
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:02,079
course for you know
 

2463
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,470
course for you know
reproduction and stuff like that but um

2464
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,480
reproduction and stuff like that but um
 

2465
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,710
reproduction and stuff like that but um
but but they're mostly solitary so

2466
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
but but they're mostly solitary so
 

2467
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,710
but but they're mostly solitary so
so all of those behaviors are not part

2468
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,720
so all of those behaviors are not part
 

2469
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,230
so all of those behaviors are not part
of intelligence you know people say oh

2470
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
of intelligence you know people say oh
 

2471
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,349
of intelligence you know people say oh
you're never going to have intelligent

2472
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
you're never going to have intelligent
 

2473
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,390
you're never going to have intelligent
machines because you know human

2474
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
machines because you know human
 

2475
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,309
machines because you know human
intelligence is social but then you look

2476
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
intelligence is social but then you look
 

2477
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,630
intelligence is social but then you look
at orangutans you look at octopus

2478
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
at orangutans you look at octopus
 

2479
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,550
at orangutans you look at octopus
octopus never know their parents

2480
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
octopus never know their parents
 

2481
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,870
octopus never know their parents
they barely interact with any other and

2482
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
they barely interact with any other and
 

2483
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,710
they barely interact with any other and
and they get to be really smart in less

2484
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
and they get to be really smart in less
 

2485
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,390
and they get to be really smart in less

you know in a year they're adults in two

2490
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
you know in a year they're adults in two
 

2491
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,630
you know in a year they're adults in two
years they're dead so

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
years they're dead so
 

2493

there are things that we think

2494
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
there are things that we think
 

2495
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,710
there are things that we think
as humans are intimately linked with

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
as humans are intimately linked with
 

2497
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,470
as humans are intimately linked with
intelligence like

2498
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
intelligence like
 

2499
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,670
intelligence like
social interaction like language

2500
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:39,680
social interaction like language
 

2501
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,230
social interaction like language
we think i think we give way too much

2502
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
we think i think we give way too much
 

2503
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,790
we think i think we give way too much
importance to language as a substrate of

importance to language as a substrate of

intelligence as humans
 

2507
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,390
intelligence as humans
because we think our reasoning is so

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
because we think our reasoning is so
 

2509
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,349
because we think our reasoning is so
linked with language so for to solve the

house cat intelligence problem you think

2512
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:53,760
house cat intelligence problem you think
 

2513
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,510
house cat intelligence problem you think
you could do it on a desert island you

2514
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
you could do it on a desert island you
 

2515
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,950
you could do it on a desert island you
could have pretty much you could just

2516
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
could have pretty much you could just
 

2517
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,950
could have pretty much you could just
have a cat sitting there

2518
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
have a cat sitting there
 

2519
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,710
have a cat sitting there
um

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,670
weighs and figure a lot of it out it
needs to have sort of you know the right

2526
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
needs to have sort of you know the right

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,510
needs to have sort of you know the right

set of drives
 

2529
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,109
set of drives
uh to kind of

2530
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
uh to kind of
 

2531
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,550
uh to kind of
you know get it to do the thing and

2532
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
you know get it to do the thing and
 

2533
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,550
you know get it to do the thing and
learn the appropriate things right but

2534
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
learn the appropriate things right but
 

2535
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,990
learn the appropriate things right but
uh

2536
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
uh
 

2537
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,829
uh
like for example you know

2538
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
like for example you know
 

2539
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,550
like for example you know
baby humans are driven to

2540
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
baby humans are driven to
 

2541
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,309
baby humans are driven to
learn to stand up and walk

2542
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
learn to stand up and walk
 

2543
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,630
learn to stand up and walk
okay you know it's not that's kind of

2544
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
okay you know it's not that's kind of
 

2545
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,309
okay you know it's not that's kind of
this desire is hard-wired how to do it

2546
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
this desire is hard-wired how to do it
 

2547
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,309
this desire is hard-wired how to do it
precisely is not that's learned

2548
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
precisely is not that's learned
 

2549
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,870
precisely is not that's learned
but the desire to to walk move around

2550
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:30,880
but the desire to to walk move around
 

2551
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,710
but the desire to to walk move around
and stand up

2552
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
and stand up
 

2553
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,790
and stand up
that's sort of

2554
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
that's sort of
 

2555
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,390
that's sort of
probably hardwired it's very simple to

2556
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,400
probably hardwired it's very simple to
 

2557
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,790
probably hardwired it's very simple to
hardwire this kind of stuff

2558
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
hardwire this kind of stuff
 

2559
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,750
hardwire this kind of stuff
oh like the desire to well

2560
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
oh like the desire to well
 

2561
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,349
oh like the desire to well
that's interesting you're hardwired to

2562
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
that's interesting you're hardwired to
 

2563
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,430
that's interesting you're hardwired to
want to walk

2564
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
want to walk
 

2565
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,190
want to walk
that's not a

2566
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
that's not a
 

2567
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,190
that's not a
there's got to be a deeper need for

2568
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
there's got to be a deeper need for
 

2569
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,230
there's got to be a deeper need for
walking

2570
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
walking
 

2571
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,309
walking
i think it was probably socially imposed

2572
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:52,319
i think it was probably socially imposed
 

2573
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,309
i think it was probably socially imposed
by society that you need to walk all the

2574
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
by society that you need to walk all the
 

2575
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,990
by society that you need to walk all the
other bipedal

2576
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
other bipedal
 

2577
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,829
other bipedal
like a lot of simple animals that you

2578
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
like a lot of simple animals that you
 

2579
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,470
like a lot of simple animals that you
know would probably work without ever

2580
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
know would probably work without ever
 

2581
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,790
know would probably work without ever
watching any other members of the

2582
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:02,800
watching any other members of the
 

2583
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,510
watching any other members of the
species it seems like a scary thing to

2584
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
species it seems like a scary thing to
 

2585
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,910
species it seems like a scary thing to
have to do because you suck it by peter

2586
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
have to do because you suck it by peter
 

2587
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,390
have to do because you suck it by peter
walking at first it seems crawling is

2588
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
walking at first it seems crawling is
 

2589
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,829
walking at first it seems crawling is
much safer

2590
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
much safer
 

2591
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,270
much safer
much more

2592
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
much more
 

2593
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,510
much more
like why are you in a hurry

2594
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
like why are you in a hurry
 

2595
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,430
like why are you in a hurry
well because because you have this thing

2596
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
well because because you have this thing
 

2597
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,150
well because because you have this thing
that drives you to do it you know um

2598
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
that drives you to do it you know um
 

2599
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,150
that drives you to do it you know um
which is sort of part of uh the sort of

2600
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
which is sort of part of uh the sort of
 

2601
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,750
which is sort of part of uh the sort of
human development is that understood

2602
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
human development is that understood
 

2603
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,150
human development is that understood
actually what not entirely no what is

2604
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
actually what not entirely no what is
 

2605
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,670
actually what not entirely no what is
what's the reason to get on two feet

2606
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
what's the reason to get on two feet
 

2607
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,510
what's the reason to get on two feet
it's really hard like most animals don't

2608
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
it's really hard like most animals don't
 

2609
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,430
it's really hard like most animals don't
get on two feet well they get on four

2610
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
get on two feet well they get on four

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,349
get on two feet well they get on four
feet you know many mammals get on four

2612
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
feet you know many mammals get on four
 

2613
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,109
feet you know many mammals get on four
feet yeah they very quickly some of them

2614
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:37,119
feet yeah they very quickly some of them
 

2615
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,390
feet yeah they very quickly some of them
extremely quickly

2616
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
extremely quickly
 

2617
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,030
extremely quickly
but i don't you know like from the last

2618
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
but i don't you know like from the last
 

2619
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,470
but i don't you know like from the last
time i've interacted with the table

2620
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
time i've interacted with the table
 

2621
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,910
time i've interacted with the table
that's much more stable than the thing

2622
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
that's much more stable than the thing
 

2623
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,910

then two legs it's just a really hard

2624
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
then two legs it's just a really hard
 

2625
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,430

problem yeah how many birds have figured

2626
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440

well technically we can go into ontology

2630
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:51,839
well technically we can go into ontology
 

2631
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,030

00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
you can
 

2719
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,309
you can
train a

00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
then you can do this with billions of
 

2727
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,630
then you can do this with billions of
images because there's billions per day

that are showing up
 

2731
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,349
that are showing up
so the

2732
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
so the
 

2733
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,630
so the
amount of training data there is

2734
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
amount of training data there is
 

2735
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,150
amount of training data there is
essentially unlimited

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,430
essentially unlimited
and then you take the output

2738
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
and then you take the output
 

2739
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,870

of what the system learned
 

2747
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,910
of what the system learned
and feed this as input to a classifier

2748
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
and feed this as input to a classifier
 

2749
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,349
and feed this as input to a classifier
for any object in the world that you

00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
for any object in the world that you
 

2751
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,270
for any object in the world that you
want and it works pretty well so that's

2752
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
want and it works pretty well so that's
 

2753
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,430
want and it works pretty well so that's
transfer learning okay

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,550
a few years ago uh dealt with this is
that they only selected something like

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,069
um
so you know

2818
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
so you know
 

2819
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,069
so you know
you wouldn't have like tbt or anything

2820
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:56,079
you wouldn't have like tbt or anything

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,990
can you uh tell me about data
augmentation what the heck is data

2836

for uh
 

2843
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,710
for uh
for video what are some cool ideas here

2844
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
for video what are some cool ideas here
 

2845
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,470
for video what are some cool ideas here
right so data augmentation i mean first

2846
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
right so data augmentation i mean first
 

2847
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,309
right so data augmentation i mean first
data augmentation you know is the idea

2848
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
data augmentation you know is the idea
 

2849
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,069
data augmentation you know is the idea
of artificially increasing the size of

2850
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
of artificially increasing the size of
 

2851
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,870
of artificially increasing the size of
your training set by distorting the

2852
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
your training set by distorting the
 

2853
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,630
your training set by distorting the
images that you have in ways that don't

2854
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,640
images that you have in ways that don't
 

2855
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,390
images that you have in ways that don't
change the nature of the image right so

2856
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
change the nature of the image right so
 

2857
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,990
change the nature of the image right so
you take you you're doing this you can

2858
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
you take you you're doing this you can
 

2859
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,430
you take you you're doing this you can
do data augmentation on any list and

2860
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
do data augmentation on any list and
 

2861
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,030
do data augmentation on any list and
people have done this since the 1990s

2862
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
people have done this since the 1990s
 

2863
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,910
people have done this since the 1990s
right you take a in this digit and you

2864
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
right you take a in this digit and you
 

2865
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,750
right you take a in this digit and you
shift it a little bit or you

2866
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
shift it a little bit or you
 

2867
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,430
shift it a little bit or you
change the size or

2868
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
change the size or
 

2869
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,670
change the size or
rotate it skew it

2870
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
rotate it skew it
 

2871
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,150
rotate it skew it
you know etc add noise

2872
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
you know etc add noise
 

2873
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,790
you know etc add noise
add noise etc and it it works better if

2874
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
add noise etc and it it works better if
 

2875
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,630
add noise etc and it it works better if
you train a supervised classifier with

2876
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
you train a supervised classifier with
 

2877
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,829
you train a supervised classifier with
augmented data you're going to get

2878
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:53,839
augmented data you're going to get
 

2879
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,510
augmented data you're going to get
better results

2880
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
better results
 

2881
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,790
better results
now it's become really interesting over

2882
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
now it's become really interesting over
 

2883
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,150
now it's become really interesting over
the last couple years because

2884
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,160
the last couple years because
 

2885
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,069
the last couple years because
a lot of supervised learning techniques

2886
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
a lot of supervised learning techniques
 

2887
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,470
a lot of supervised learning techniques
to pre-train vision systems are based on

2888
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:06,480
to pre-train vision systems are based on
 

2889
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,910
to pre-train vision systems are based on
data augmentation

2890
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
data augmentation
 

2891
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,510
data augmentation
and the

2892
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:09,520
and the
 

2893
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,510
and the
the basic techniques is originally

2894
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
the basic techniques is originally
 

2895
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,190
the basic techniques is originally
inspired by uh

2896
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
inspired by uh
 

2897
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,390
inspired by uh
techniques that

2898
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
techniques that
 

2899
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,069
techniques that
i worked on in the early 90s and jeff

2900
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
i worked on in the early 90s and jeff
 

2901
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,589
i worked on in the early 90s and jeff
intern worked on also in the early 90s

2902
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
intern worked on also in the early 90s
 

2903
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,349
intern worked on also in the early 90s
there was sort of parallel

2904
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
there was sort of parallel
 

2905
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,510
there was sort of parallel
work i used to call this siamese network

2906
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
work i used to call this siamese network
 

2907
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,829
work i used to call this siamese network
so basically you take

2908
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
so basically you take
 

2909
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,510
so basically you take
two identical copies of the same network

2910
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
two identical copies of the same network
 

2911
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,589
two identical copies of the same network
they share the same weights

2912
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
they share the same weights
 

2913
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,150
they share the same weights
and you show two

2914
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,160
and you show two
 

2915
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,670
and you show two
different views of the same object

2916
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
different views of the same object
 

2917
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,109
different views of the same object
either those two different views may

2918
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
either those two different views may
 

2919
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,190
either those two different views may
have been obtained by data augmentation

2920
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
have been obtained by data augmentation
 

2921
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,549
have been obtained by data augmentation
or maybe it's two different views of the

2922
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559
or maybe it's two different views of the
 

2923
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,190
or maybe it's two different views of the
same scene from a camera that you moved

2924
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
same scene from a camera that you moved
 

2925
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,710
same scene from a camera that you moved
or at different times or something like

2926
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
or at different times or something like
 

2927
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,390
or at different times or something like
that right or two pictures of the same

2928
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,400
that right or two pictures of the same
 

2929
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,390
that right or two pictures of the same
person things like that

2930
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
person things like that
 

2931
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,630
person things like that
and then you train this neural net those

2932
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:46,640
and then you train this neural net those
 

2933
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,309
and then you train this neural net those
two identical copies of this neural net

2934
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
two identical copies of this neural net
 

2935
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,790
two identical copies of this neural net
to produce an output representation a

2936
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800
to produce an output representation a
 

2937
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,309
to produce an output representation a
vector

2938
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319
vector
 

2939
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,829
vector
in such a way that the representation

2940
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
in such a way that the representation
 

2941
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,349
in such a way that the representation
for those two

2942
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
for those two
 

2943
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,549
for those two
images

2944
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
images
 

2945
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,710
images
are as close to each other as possible

2946
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
are as close to each other as possible
 

2947
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,549
are as close to each other as possible
as identical to each other as possible

2948
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
as identical to each other as possible
 

2949
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,950
as identical to each other as possible
right because you want the system to

2950
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
right because you want the system to
 

2951
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,030
right because you want the system to
basically learn a function that will

2952
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
basically learn a function that will
 

2953
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,710
basically learn a function that will
that will be invariant that will not

2954
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
that will be invariant that will not
 

2955
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,230
that will be invariant that will not
change whose output will not change when

2956
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
change whose output will not change when
 

2957
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,670
change whose output will not change when
you transform those

2958
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
you transform those
 

2959
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,750
you transform those
inputs uh in in those in those

2960
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
inputs uh in in those in those
 

2961
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,910
inputs uh in in those in those
particular ways right

2962
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
particular ways right
 

2963
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,510
particular ways right
so that's easy to do

2964
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:15,520
so that's easy to do
 

2965
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,270
so that's easy to do
what's complicated is how do you make

2966
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
what's complicated is how do you make
 

2967
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,870
what's complicated is how do you make
sure that when you show two images that

2968
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
sure that when you show two images that
 

2969
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,150
sure that when you show two images that
are different the system will produce

2970
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,160
are different the system will produce
 

2971
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,829
are different the system will produce
different things

2972
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:21,839
different things
 

2973
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,670
different things
because if you don't

2974
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
because if you don't
 

2975
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,990
because if you don't
have a specific provision for this

2976
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
have a specific provision for this
 

2977
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,309
have a specific provision for this
the system will just ignore the input

2978
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
the system will just ignore the input
 

2979
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,589
the system will just ignore the input
when you train it it will end up

2980
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
when you train it it will end up
 

2981
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,870
when you train it it will end up
ignoring the input and just produce a

2982
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
ignoring the input and just produce a
 

2983
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,470
ignoring the input and just produce a
constant vector that is the same for

2984
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
constant vector that is the same for
 

2985
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,910
constant vector that is the same for
every input right yes that's called a

2986
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:33,920
every input right yes that's called a
 

2987
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,030
every input right yes that's called a
collapse

2988
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,040
collapse
 

2989
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,870
collapse
now how do you avoid collapse so there's

2990
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
now how do you avoid collapse so there's
 

2991
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,710
now how do you avoid collapse so there's
two ideas

2992
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
two ideas
 

2993
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,549
two ideas
one idea that i proposed in the early

2994
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
one idea that i proposed in the early
 

2995
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,190
one idea that i proposed in the early
90s with my colleagues at bell labs jane

2996
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
90s with my colleagues at bell labs jane
 

2997
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,230
90s with my colleagues at bell labs jane
bromley and a couple other people

2998
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
bromley and a couple other people
 

2999
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,150
bromley and a couple other people
which we now call contrastive learning

3000
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
which we now call contrastive learning
 

3001
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,910
which we now call contrastive learning
which is to have negative examples right

3002
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
which is to have negative examples right
 

3003
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,349
which is to have negative examples right
so you have pairs

3004
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
so you have pairs
 

3005
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,230
so you have pairs
of images that you know are different

3006
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
of images that you know are different
 

3007
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,390
of images that you know are different
and you show them to the network and

3008
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
and you show them to the network and
 

3009
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,230
and you show them to the network and
uh those two copies and then you you

3010
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:58,240
uh those two copies and then you you
 

3011
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,910
uh those two copies and then you you
push the two output vectors away from

3012
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
push the two output vectors away from
 

3013
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,870
push the two output vectors away from
each other

3014
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
each other
 

3015
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,950
each other
and they will eventually guarantee that

3016
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
and they will eventually guarantee that
 

3017
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,710
and they will eventually guarantee that
things that are semantically similar

3018
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,720
things that are semantically similar
 

3019
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,470
things that are semantically similar
produce similar representations and

3020
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
produce similar representations and
 

3021
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,510
produce similar representations and
things that are different produce

3022
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,520
things that are different produce
 

3023
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,150
things that are different produce
different representations

3024
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
different representations
 

3025
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,069
different representations
we actually came up with this idea for a

3026
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:12,079
we actually came up with this idea for a
 

3027
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,390
we actually came up with this idea for a
project of doing signature verification

3028
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
project of doing signature verification
 

3029
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,190
project of doing signature verification
so we would collect signature

3030
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
so we would collect signature
 

3031
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,190
so we would collect signature
signatures from like multiple signatures

3032
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
signatures from like multiple signatures
 

3033
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,950
signatures from like multiple signatures
on the same person and then train a

3034
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
on the same person and then train a
 

3035
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,910
on the same person and then train a
neural net to produce the same

3036
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
neural net to produce the same
 

3037
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,190
neural net to produce the same
representation

3038
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
representation
 

3039
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,549
representation
and then uh

3040
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
and then uh
 

3041
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,670
and then uh
you know

3042
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
you know
 

3043
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,750
you know
force the system to produce different

3044
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
force the system to produce different
 

3045
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,790
force the system to produce different
representations for different signatures

3046
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
representations for different signatures
 

3047
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,470
representations for different signatures
this was actually the the problem was

3048
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
this was actually the the problem was
 

3049
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,950
this was actually the the problem was
proposed by people from uh what was a

3050
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
proposed by people from uh what was a
 

3051
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,870
proposed by people from uh what was a
subsidiary of atnt at the time called

3052
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
subsidiary of atnt at the time called
 

3053
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,069
subsidiary of atnt at the time called
ncr

3054
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
ncr
 

3055
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,230
ncr
and they were interested in storing a

3056
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,240
and they were interested in storing a
 

3057
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,230
and they were interested in storing a
representation of the signature on the

3058
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
representation of the signature on the
 

3059
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,470
representation of the signature on the
80 bytes of the

3060
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
80 bytes of the
 

3061
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,710
80 bytes of the
magnetic strip of a credit card so we

3062
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
magnetic strip of a credit card so we
 

3063
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,230
magnetic strip of a credit card so we
came up with this idea of having a

3064
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
came up with this idea of having a
 

3065
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,150
came up with this idea of having a
neural net with 80 outputs

3066
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
neural net with 80 outputs
 

3067
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,910
neural net with 80 outputs
you know that we would quantize on bytes

3068
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:51,920
you know that we would quantize on bytes
 

3069
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,750
you know that we would quantize on bytes
so so that we could encode the

3070
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
so so that we could encode the
 

3071
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,950
so so that we could encode the
and that encoding was then used to

3072
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
and that encoding was then used to
 

3073
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,630
and that encoding was then used to
compare whether the signature matches or

3074
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
compare whether the signature matches or
 

3075
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,309
compare whether the signature matches or
not that's right so then you would you

3076
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
not that's right so then you would you
 

3077
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:58,950
not that's right so then you would you
know

3078
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:58,960
know
 

3079
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,309
know
sign you would run through the neural

3080
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
sign you would run through the neural
 

3081
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,589
sign you would run through the neural
net and then you would compare the

3082
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
net and then you would compare the
 

3083
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,109
net and then you would compare the
output vector to whatever is stored on

3084
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
output vector to whatever is stored on
 

3085
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,549
output vector to whatever is stored on
your card it actually worked

3086
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559
your card it actually worked
 

3087
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,790
your card it actually worked
it worked but they ended up not using it

3088
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:08,800

 

3089
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,349

because nobody cares actually i mean the

3090
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:11,359
because nobody cares actually i mean the
 

3091
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,349
because nobody cares actually i mean the
american you know financial payment

3092
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
american you know financial payment
 

3093
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,630
american you know financial payment
system is

3094
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:14,640
system is
 

3095
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,950
system is
incredibly lags in that respect compared

3096
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
incredibly lags in that respect compared
 

3097
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,030
incredibly lags in that respect compared
to europe oh with the signatures what's

3098
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
to europe oh with the signatures what's
 

3099
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,790
to europe oh with the signatures what's
the purpose of signatures anyway this is

3100
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:20,800
the purpose of signatures anyway this is
 

3101
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,549
the purpose of signatures anyway this is
very nobody looks at them nobody cares

3102
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
very nobody looks at them nobody cares
 

3103
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,309
very nobody looks at them nobody cares
yeah it's uh yeah yeah no so so that

3104
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
yeah it's uh yeah yeah no so so that
 

3105
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,910
yeah it's uh yeah yeah no so so that
that's contrastive learning right so you

3106
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
that's contrastive learning right so you
 

3107
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,510
that's contrastive learning right so you
need positive and negative pairs and the

3108
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
need positive and negative pairs and the
 

3109
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,430
need positive and negative pairs and the
problem with that is that

3110
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
problem with that is that
 

3111
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,349
problem with that is that
you know even though i at the original

3112
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
you know even though i at the original
 

3113
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,549
you know even though i at the original
paper on this

3114
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
paper on this
 

3115
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,710
paper on this
i'm actually not very positive about it

3116
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
i'm actually not very positive about it
 

3117
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,069
i'm actually not very positive about it
because it doesn't work in high

3118
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
because it doesn't work in high
 

3119
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,829
because it doesn't work in high
dimension if your presentation is high

3120
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
dimension if your presentation is high
 

3121
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,150
dimension if your presentation is high
dimensional there's just too many ways

3122
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,160
dimensional there's just too many ways
 

3123
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,150
dimensional there's just too many ways
for two things to be different

3124
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
for two things to be different
 

3125
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,829
for two things to be different
and and so you would need lots and lots

3126
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
and and so you would need lots and lots
 

3127
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,069
and and so you would need lots and lots
and lots of negative pairs

3128
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
and lots of negative pairs
 

3129
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,390
and lots of negative pairs
so there is a particular implementation

3130
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
so there is a particular implementation
 

3131
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,470
so there is a particular implementation
of this which is relatively recent from

3132
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
of this which is relatively recent from
 

3133
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,109
of this which is relatively recent from
actually the google toronto group

3134
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
actually the google toronto group
 

3135
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,510
actually the google toronto group
uh where you know jeff intern is the

3136
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,520
uh where you know jeff intern is the
 

3137
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,270
uh where you know jeff intern is the
senior member there it's called sim

3138
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
senior member there it's called sim
 

3139
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,069

clear sim clr

3140
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:02,079
clear sim clr
 

3141
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,670
clear sim clr
and you know basically a particular way

3142
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
and you know basically a particular way
 

3143
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,910
and you know basically a particular way
of implementing this idea of contracting

3144
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:05,920
of implementing this idea of contracting
 

3145
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,589
of implementing this idea of contracting
running the particular objective

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,430
now
what i'm much more

3152
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
what i'm much more
 

3153
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,349
what i'm much more
enthusiastic about these days is

00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,510
enthusiastic about these days is
non-contrasting methods so other ways to

3156
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
non-contrasting methods so other ways to
 

3157
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,030
non-contrasting methods so other ways to
guarantee that

3158
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
guarantee that
 

3159
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,549
guarantee that
uh

3160
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:18,559
uh
 

3161
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,270
uh
the

3162
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
the
 

3163
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,710
the
representations would be different for

3164
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
representations would be different for
 

3165
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,230
representations would be different for
different

3166
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
different
 

3167
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,230
different
different inputs

3168
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
different inputs
 

3169
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,670
different inputs
and it's actually based on an idea that

3170
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
and it's actually based on an idea that
 

3171
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,430
and it's actually based on an idea that
jeff intern proposed in the early 90s

3172
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
jeff intern proposed in the early 90s
 

3173
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,750
jeff intern proposed in the early 90s
with a student at the time sue becker

3174
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
with a student at the time sue becker
 

3175
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,270
with a student at the time sue becker
and it's based on the idea of maximizing

3176
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
and it's based on the idea of maximizing
 

3177
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,470
and it's based on the idea of maximizing
the mutual information between the

3178
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
the mutual information between the
 

3179
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,549
the mutual information between the
outputs of the two systems you only show

3180
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
outputs of the two systems you only show
 

3181
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,309
outputs of the two systems you only show
positive pairs you only show pairs of

3182
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
positive pairs you only show pairs of
 

3183
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,069
positive pairs you only show pairs of
images that you know are somewhat

3184
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:40,079
images that you know are somewhat
 

3185
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,430
images that you know are somewhat
similar

3186
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
similar
 

3187
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,190
similar
and you train the two networks to be

3188
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
and you train the two networks to be
 

3189
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,870
and you train the two networks to be
informative

3190
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
informative
 

3191
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,309
informative
but also to be

3192
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:46,319
but also to be
 

3193
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,390
but also to be
as informative

3194
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
as informative
 

3195
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,069
as informative
of each other as possible so basically

3196
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
of each other as possible so basically
 

3197
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,069
of each other as possible so basically
one representation has to be predictable

3198
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
one representation has to be predictable
 

3199
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,710
one representation has to be predictable
from the other essentially

3200
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
from the other essentially
 

3201
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,030
from the other essentially
uh and you know he proposed that idea

3202
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
uh and you know he proposed that idea
 

3203
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,549
uh and you know he proposed that idea
had you know

3204
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
had you know
 

3205
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,150
had you know
a couple papers in the early 90s and

3206
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,160
a couple papers in the early 90s and
 

3207
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,069
a couple papers in the early 90s and
then nothing was done about it for

3208
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
then nothing was done about it for
 

3209
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,630
then nothing was done about it for
decades and i kind of revived this idea

3210
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:04,640
decades and i kind of revived this idea
 

3211
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,430
decades and i kind of revived this idea
together with my postdocs at fair

3212
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
together with my postdocs at fair
 

3213
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,950
together with my postdocs at fair
uh particularly a postdoc called

3214
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:08,960
uh particularly a postdoc called
 

3215
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,510
uh particularly a postdoc called

00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,040
in in finland at university of alto
 

3219
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,349
in in finland at university of alto
we came up with something called that we

3220
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
we came up with something called that we
 

3221
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,109
we came up with something called that we
call barlow twins

3222
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:19,119
call barlow twins
 

3223
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,430

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,950
the information content of
a vector you know using some

this what uh kind of data augmentation

3248
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
this what uh kind of data augmentation
 

3249
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,549
this what uh kind of data augmentation
is useful for that non-contrasting

00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
are we talking about does that not
 

3255
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,069
are we talking about does that not
matter that much or it seems like a very

3256
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:54,079
matter that much or it seems like a very
 

3257
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,470
matter that much or it seems like a very
important part of the step yeah how you

3258
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
important part of the step yeah how you
 

3259
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,150
important part of the step yeah how you
generate the images that are similar but

3260
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
generate the images that are similar but
 

3261
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,069
generate the images that are similar but
sufficiently different yeah that's right

3262
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
sufficiently different yeah that's right
 

3263
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,589
sufficiently different yeah that's right
it's an important step and it's also an

3264
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
it's an important step and it's also an
 

3265
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,109
it's an important step and it's also an
annoying step because you need to have

3266
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:03,119
annoying step because you need to have
 

3267
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,150
annoying step because you need to have
that knowledge of what the augmentation

3268
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,160
that knowledge of what the augmentation
 

3269
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,230
that knowledge of what the augmentation
you can do that do not change the nature

3270
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
you can do that do not change the nature
 

3271
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,309
you can do that do not change the nature
of the of the object

3272
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:10,319
of the of the object
 

3273
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,829
of the of the object
and so

3274
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
and so
 

3275
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,510
and so
the standard scenario which you know a

3276
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:13,520
the standard scenario which you know a
 

3277
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,870
the standard scenario which you know a
lot of people working in this area are

3278
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
lot of people working in this area are
 

3279
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,309
lot of people working in this area are
using is you use uh the the type of

3280
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
using is you use uh the the type of
 

3281
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,510
using is you use uh the the type of
distortion

3282
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:19,520
distortion
 

3283
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,430
distortion
so so basically you do geometric

3284
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
so so basically you do geometric
 

3285
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,270
so so basically you do geometric
distortion so one basically just shifts

3286
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280
distortion so one basically just shifts
 

3287
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,390
distortion so one basically just shifts
the image a little bit it's called

3288
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
the image a little bit it's called
 

3289
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,470
the image a little bit it's called
crabbing another one kind of changes the

3290
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
crabbing another one kind of changes the
 

3291
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,390
crabbing another one kind of changes the
scale a little bit another one kind of

3292
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
scale a little bit another one kind of
 

3293
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,069
scale a little bit another one kind of
rotates it another one changes the

3294
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
rotates it another one changes the
 

3295
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,150
rotates it another one changes the
colors you know you can do a shift in

3296
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160
colors you know you can do a shift in
 

3297
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,150
colors you know you can do a shift in
color balance or something like that

3298
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
color balance or something like that
 

3299
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,710
color balance or something like that
uh saturation another one sort of blurs

3300
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:36,720
uh saturation another one sort of blurs
 

3301
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,710
uh saturation another one sort of blurs
it another one adds noise so you have

3302
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
it another one adds noise so you have
 

3303
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,710
it another one adds noise so you have
like a catalog of kind of standard

3304
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
like a catalog of kind of standard
 

3305
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,230
like a catalog of kind of standard
things and people try to use the same

3306
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:42,240
things and people try to use the same
 

3307
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,069
things and people try to use the same
ones for different algorithms so that

3308
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:44,079
ones for different algorithms so that
 

3309
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,670
ones for different algorithms so that
they can compare

3310
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
they can compare
 

3311
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,270
they can compare
but some algorithms uh some cell

3312
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:47,280
but some algorithms uh some cell
 

3313
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,950
but some algorithms uh some cell
supervisor algorithm actually can deal

3314
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
supervisor algorithm actually can deal
 

3315
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,390
supervisor algorithm actually can deal
with much bigger

3316
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
with much bigger
 

3317
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,390
with much bigger
like more aggressive data augmentation

3318
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
like more aggressive data augmentation
 

3319
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,230
like more aggressive data augmentation
and some don't so

3320
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
and some don't so
 

3321
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,829
and some don't so
that kind of makes the whole thing

3322
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
that kind of makes the whole thing
 

3323
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,430
that kind of makes the whole thing
difficult but but that's the kind of

3324
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
difficult but but that's the kind of
 

3325
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,670
difficult but but that's the kind of
distortions we're talking about and

3326
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
distortions we're talking about and
 

3327
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,230
distortions we're talking about and
and so you you you you train with those

3328
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,240
and so you you you you train with those
 

3329
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,430
and so you you you you train with those
distortions

3330
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
distortions
 

3331
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,510
distortions
and then uh you

3332
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
and then uh you
 

3333
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,510
and then uh you
you chop off the last layer a couple

3334
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
you chop off the last layer a couple
 

3335
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,950
you chop off the last layer a couple
layers of the of the network

3336
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:10,960
layers of the of the network
 

3337
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,630
layers of the of the network
and you use the representation as input

3338
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
and you use the representation as input
 

3339
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,270
and you use the representation as input
to a classifier you train the classifier

3340
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
to a classifier you train the classifier
 

3341
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,230
to a classifier you train the classifier
um

3342
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
um
 

3343
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,630
um
on imagenet let's say or whatever and

3344
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
on imagenet let's say or whatever and
 

3345
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,470
on imagenet let's say or whatever and
measure the performance

3346
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
measure the performance
 

3347
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,510
measure the performance
and

3348
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
and
 

3349
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,750
and
interestingly enough the methods that

3350
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:23,760
interestingly enough the methods that
 

3351
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,109
interestingly enough the methods that
are really good at eliminating the

3352
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
are really good at eliminating the
 

3353
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,030
are really good at eliminating the
information that is irrelevant which is

3354
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
information that is irrelevant which is
 

3355
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,829
information that is irrelevant which is
the distortions between those images

3356
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
the distortions between those images
 

3357
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,309
the distortions between those images
do a good job at eliminating it

3358
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
do a good job at eliminating it
 

3359
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,870
do a good job at eliminating it
and uh as a consequence you cannot use

3360
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
and uh as a consequence you cannot use
 

3361
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,630
and uh as a consequence you cannot use
those the representations in those

3362
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
those the representations in those
 

3363
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,950
those the representations in those
systems for things like object detection

3364
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
systems for things like object detection
 

3365
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,390
systems for things like object detection
and localization because that

3366
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:40,400
and localization because that
 

3367
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,549
and localization because that
information is gone

3368
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
information is gone
 

3369
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,150
information is gone
so the type of data augmentation you

3370
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
so the type of data augmentation you
 

3371
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,910
so the type of data augmentation you
need to do depends on the task you want

3372
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
need to do depends on the task you want
 

3373
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,030
need to do depends on the task you want
eventually

3374
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
eventually
 

3375
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,670
eventually
the system to to solve and the type of

3376
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,680
the system to to solve and the type of
 

3377
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,870
the system to to solve and the type of
data augmentation standard data

3378
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
data augmentation standard data
 

3379
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,789
data augmentation standard data
determination that we use today are only

3380
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
determination that we use today are only
 

3381
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,710
determination that we use today are only
appropriate for object recognition or

3382
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:54,720
appropriate for object recognition or
 

3383
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,150
appropriate for object recognition or
image classification they're not

3384
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
image classification they're not
 

3385
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,990
image classification they're not
appropriate for things like can you help

3386
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
appropriate for things like can you help
 

3387
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,829
appropriate for things like can you help
me out understand what uh why the

3388
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
me out understand what uh why the
 

3389
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,270
me out understand what uh why the
localization is so you're saying it's

3390
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
localization is so you're saying it's
 

3391
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,109
localization is so you're saying it's
just not good at the negative

3392
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
just not good at the negative
 

3393
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,470
just not good at the negative
uh like

3394
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
uh like
 

3395
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,910
uh like
classifying the negative so that's why

3396
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
classifying the negative so that's why
 

3397
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,990
classifying the negative so that's why
it can't be used for the localization no

3398
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
it can't be used for the localization no
 

3399
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,470
it can't be used for the localization no
it's just that you train the system

3400
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
it's just that you train the system
 

3401
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,230
it's just that you train the system
you know you you you give it an image

3402
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
you know you you you give it an image
 

3403
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,510
you know you you you give it an image
and then you give it the same image

3404
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:13,520
and then you give it the same image
 

3405
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,349
and then you give it the same image
shifted and scaled and you tell it

3406
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
shifted and scaled and you tell it
 

3407
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,190
shifted and scaled and you tell it
that's the same image

3408
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
that's the same image
 

3409
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,030
that's the same image
so the system basically is trained to

3410
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
so the system basically is trained to
 

3411
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,789
so the system basically is trained to
eliminate the information about position

3412
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
eliminate the information about position
 

3413
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:21,910
eliminate the information about position
and size

3414
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
and size
 

3415
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,109
and size
so now

3416
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:23,119
so now
 

3417
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,270
so now
and now you want to use that oh yeah

3418
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
and now you want to use that oh yeah
 

3419
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,950
and now you want to use that oh yeah
like figure out where an object is and

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,870
just because you know a distorted cat is
the same as a non-distorted cat does

the same as a non-distorted cat does
 

3505
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,470
the same as a non-distorted cat does
that mean you understand

3506
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:54,480
that mean you understand
 

3507
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,549
that mean you understand
what it means to be a cat

3508
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:56,559
what it means to be a cat
 

3509
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,470
what it means to be a cat
to some extent i mean it's a superficial

3510
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
to some extent i mean it's a superficial
 

3511
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,549
to some extent i mean it's a superficial
understanding obviously but like what is

3512
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
understanding obviously but like what is
 

3513
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,230
understanding obviously but like what is
the ceiling of this method do you think

3514
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,240
the ceiling of this method do you think
 

3515
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,829
the ceiling of this method do you think
is this just one

3516
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
is this just one
 

3517
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,829
is this just one
trick on the path to

doing cell supervised learning can we go

3520
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
doing cell supervised learning can we go
 

3521
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,910
doing cell supervised learning can we go
yeah really really far

3522
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:09,920
yeah really really far
 

3523
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,910
yeah really really far
i think we can go really far so if we

3524
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:11,920
i think we can go really far so if we
 

3525
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,390
i think we can go really far so if we
figure out how to

3526
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
figure out how to
 

3527
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,549
figure out how to
uh use techniques of that type perhaps

3528
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
uh use techniques of that type perhaps
 

3529
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,990
uh use techniques of that type perhaps
very different but you know the

3530
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
very different but you know the
 

3531
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,349
very different but you know the

i think we'll have a path um you know

3540
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
i think we'll have a path um you know
 

3541
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,069
i think we'll have a path um you know
towards uh

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,510
towards uh
you know i wouldn't say unlimited but

3544
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
you know i wouldn't say unlimited but
 

3545
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,230
you know i wouldn't say unlimited but
but a path towards some level of

3546
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,240
but a path towards some level of

you know physical common sense in

00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119
you know physical common sense in
 

3551
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,589
you know physical common sense in
machines and i also think that um

3552
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
machines and i also think that um
 

3553
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,710
machines and i also think that um
that

3554
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
that

from a sort of high throughput channel
 

3559
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,750
from a sort of high throughput channel
like like vision

3560
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
like like vision
 

3561
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,069
like like vision
is a necessary step towards uh sort of

3562
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
is a necessary step towards uh sort of
 

3563
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,829
is a necessary step towards uh sort of
real artificial intelligence in other

don't think we can train a machine to be

3568
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
don't think we can train a machine to be
 

3569
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,990
don't think we can train a machine to be
intelligent purely from text

3570
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
intelligent purely from text
 

3571
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,750
intelligent purely from text
because i think the amount of

3572
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
because i think the amount of
 

3573
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,950
because i think the amount of
information about the world that's

3574
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
information about the world that's
 

3575
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,870
information about the world that's
contained in text is tiny compared to

3576
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:08,880
contained in text is tiny compared to
 

3577
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,430
contained in text is tiny compared to
what we need to know

3578
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,440
what we need to know
 

3579
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,750
what we need to know
so for example let's uh and you know

3580
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:13,760
so for example let's uh and you know
 

3581
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,589
so for example let's uh and you know
people have attempted to do this for for

people have attempted to do this for for
 

3583
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,430
people have attempted to do this for for
30 years right the psych project and

00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
30 years right the psych project and
 

3585
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,349
30 years right the psych project and
things like that right of basically kind

3586
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
things like that right of basically kind
 

3587
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,829
things like that right of basically kind
of writing down all the facts that are

3588
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:20,839
of writing down all the facts that are
 

3589
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,150
of writing down all the facts that are
known and

3590
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
known and
 

3591
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,750
known and
hoping that some some sort of common

3592
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
hoping that some some sort of common
 

3593
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,750
hoping that some some sort of common
sense will emerge um i think it's

3594
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:25,760
sense will emerge um i think it's
 

3595
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,829
sense will emerge um i think it's
basically hopeless but let me take an

3596
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
basically hopeless but let me take an
 

3597
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,510
basically hopeless but let me take an
example you take an object

3598
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
example you take an object
 

3599
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,430
example you take an object
i i describe the situation to you i take

3600
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,440
i i describe the situation to you i take
 

3601
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,589
i i describe the situation to you i take
an object i put it on the table and i

3602
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
an object i put it on the table and i
 

3603
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,069
an object i put it on the table and i
push the table it's completely obvious

3604
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
push the table it's completely obvious
 

3605
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,589
push the table it's completely obvious
to you that the object will be pushed

3606
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
to you that the object will be pushed
 

3607
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,510
to you that the object will be pushed
with the table right because it's

3608
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,520
with the table right because it's
 

3609
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,670
with the table right because it's
sitting on it

3610
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
sitting on it
 

3611
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,270
sitting on it
there's no text in the world i believe

3612
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
there's no text in the world i believe
 

3613
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,950
there's no text in the world i believe
that explains this

3614
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
that explains this
 

3615
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,829
that explains this
and so

3616
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839
and so
 

3617
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,589
and so
if you train a machine as powerful as it

3618
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
if you train a machine as powerful as it
 

3619
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,630
if you train a machine as powerful as it
could be you know your gpt 5000

3620
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:52,640
could be you know your gpt 5000
 

3621
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,470
could be you know your gpt 5000
or whatever it is it's never going to

3622
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
or whatever it is it's never going to
 

3623
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,230
or whatever it is it's never going to
learn about this

3624
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:56,240
learn about this
 

3625
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,190
learn about this
um that information is just not is not

3626
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
um that information is just not is not
 

3627
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,870
um that information is just not is not
present in any text

3628
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
present in any text
 

3629
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,710
present in any text
well the question like with the psyc

3630
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:02,720
well the question like with the psyc
 

3631
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,390
well the question like with the psyc
project the dream i think is to have

3632
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
project the dream i think is to have
 

3633
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,390
project the dream i think is to have
like

3634
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
like
 

3635
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,990
like
like 10 million

3636
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,000
like 10 million
 

3637
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,470
like 10 million
say facts like that

3638
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,480
say facts like that
 

3639
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,109
say facts like that
that give you a head start

3640
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,119
that give you a head start
 

3641
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,349
that give you a head start
like a parent guiding you

3642
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:15,359
like a parent guiding you
 

3643
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,109
like a parent guiding you
now we humans don't need a parent to

3644
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:17,119
now we humans don't need a parent to
 

3645
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,109
now we humans don't need a parent to
tell us that the table will move uh

3646
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:19,119
tell us that the table will move uh
 

3647
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,630
tell us that the table will move uh
sorry the smartphone will move with the

3648
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
sorry the smartphone will move with the
 

3649
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,670
sorry the smartphone will move with the
table

3650
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
table
 

3651
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,950
table
but

3652
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
but
 

3653
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,750
but
we get a lot of guidance in other ways

3654
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:25,760
we get a lot of guidance in other ways
 

3655
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,349
we get a lot of guidance in other ways
so it's possible that we can give it a

3656
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
so it's possible that we can give it a
 

3657
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,510
so it's possible that we can give it a
quick shortcut what about cat the guy

3658
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,520
quick shortcut what about cat the guy
 

3659
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,870
quick shortcut what about cat the guy
knows that

3660
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
knows that
 

3661
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,270
knows that
no but they evolved so

3662
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:33,280
no but they evolved so
 

3663
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,589
no but they evolved so
no they learn like us

3664
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:35,599
no they learn like us
 

3665
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,789
no they learn like us
the the sorry the physics of stuff

3666
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:38,799
the the sorry the physics of stuff
 

3667
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:39,670
the the sorry the physics of stuff
well

3668
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,680
well
 

3669
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,510
well
yeah so you're saying it's

3670
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:41,520
yeah so you're saying it's
 

3671
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,390
yeah so you're saying it's
uh

3672
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
uh
 

3673
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,950
uh
see you're putting a lot of intelligence

3674
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:44,960
see you're putting a lot of intelligence
 

3675
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,430
see you're putting a lot of intelligence
onto the nurture side not the nature yes

3676
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
onto the nurture side not the nature yes
 

3677
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,109
onto the nurture side not the nature yes
we seem to have um

3678
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
we seem to have um
 

3679
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,829
we seem to have um
you know there's a very inefficient

3680
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
you know there's a very inefficient
 

3681
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,910
you know there's a very inefficient
arguably process of evolution that got

3682
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
arguably process of evolution that got
 

3683
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,750
arguably process of evolution that got
us from bacteria to who we are today

3684
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
us from bacteria to who we are today
 

3685
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,309
us from bacteria to who we are today
started at the bottom now we're here so

3686
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319
started at the bottom now we're here so
 

3687
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,990
started at the bottom now we're here so
true uh

3688
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
true uh
 

3689
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,470
true uh
the question is how okay so the question

3690
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
the question is how okay so the question
 

3691
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,230
the question is how okay so the question
is how fundamental is that the the

3692
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240
is how fundamental is that the the
 

3693
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,549
is how fundamental is that the the
nature of the whole hardware

3694
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
nature of the whole hardware
 

3695
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,390
nature of the whole hardware
and then

3696
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
and then
 

3697
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,750
and then
is there any way to shortcut it if it's

3698
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
is there any way to shortcut it if it's
 

3699
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,510
is there any way to shortcut it if it's
fundamental if it's not if it's most of

3700
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
fundamental if it's not if it's most of
 

3701
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,870
fundamental if it's not if it's most of
intelligence most of the cool stuff

3702
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:14,880
intelligence most of the cool stuff
 

3703
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,030
intelligence most of the cool stuff
we've been talking about is mostly

3704
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
we've been talking about is mostly
 

3705
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,190
we've been talking about is mostly
nurture mostly trained we figure it out

3706
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
nurture mostly trained we figure it out
 

3707
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,990
nurture mostly trained we figure it out
by observing the world we can form that

3708
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
by observing the world we can form that
 

3709
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,630
by observing the world we can form that
uh big beautiful sexy background model

3710
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:24,640
uh big beautiful sexy background model
 

3711
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,309
uh big beautiful sexy background model
that you're talking about just by

3712
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:26,319
that you're talking about just by
 

3713
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,870
that you're talking about just by

sitting there
 

3715
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,750
sitting there
then okay then you need to then like

3716
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
then okay then you need to then like
 

3717
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,910
then okay then you need to then like
maybe

3718
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:33,920
maybe
 

3719
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,710
maybe
uh

3720
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
uh
 

3721
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,549
uh
it is all supervised learning all the

3722
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
it is all supervised learning all the
 

3723
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:37,670
it is all supervised learning all the
way down

3724
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
way down
 

3725
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,589
way down
so surprise learning site whatever it is

3726
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:39,599
so surprise learning site whatever it is
 

3727
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,510
so surprise learning site whatever it is
that makes uh you know human

3728
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
that makes uh you know human
 

3729
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,430
that makes uh you know human

and this kind of stuff
 

3737
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,230
and this kind of stuff
it cannot be that complicated because it

3738
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
it cannot be that complicated because it
 

3739
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,710
it cannot be that complicated because it

you know it it and it only involves you

3746
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
you know it it and it only involves you
 

3747
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:57,829
you know it it and it only involves you
know

3748
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
know
 

3749
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,109
know
less than one percent of our genome

3750
01:00:59,109 --> 01:00:59,119
less than one percent of our genome
 

3751
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,470
less than one percent of our genome
might be which is the difference between

3752
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
might be which is the difference between
 

3753
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,270
might be which is the difference between
human genome and gyms or whatever

3754
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280
human genome and gyms or whatever
 

3755
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,349
human genome and gyms or whatever
so uh

3756
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
so uh
 

3757
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:06,789
so uh
it can be that complicated you know it

3758
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
it can be that complicated you know it
 

3759
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,710
it can be that complicated you know it
can be that fundamental i mean the most

3760
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
can be that fundamental i mean the most
 

3761
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,510
can be that fundamental i mean the most
of the

3762
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
of the
 

3763
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,510
of the
so complicated stuff already exist in

3764
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,520
so complicated stuff already exist in
 

3765
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,190
so complicated stuff already exist in
cats and dogs and

3766
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,200
cats and dogs and
 

3767
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,109
cats and dogs and
you know certainly primates non-human

3768
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
you know certainly primates non-human
 

3769
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,030
you know certainly primates non-human
primates

3770
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040
primates
 

3771
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,710
primates
yeah that little thing with humans might

3772
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
yeah that little thing with humans might
 

3773
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,589
yeah that little thing with humans might
be just uh something about social

3774
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
be just uh something about social
 

3775
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,349
be just uh something about social
interaction and ability to maintain

3776
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
interaction and ability to maintain
 

3777
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,950
interaction and ability to maintain
ideas across

3778
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
ideas across
 

3779
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,230
ideas across
like a collective of people

3780
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
like a collective of people
 

3781
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,150
like a collective of people
it's it sounds very dramatic and very

3782
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
it's it sounds very dramatic and very
 

3783
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,069
it's it sounds very dramatic and very
impressive but it probably isn't

3784
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
impressive but it probably isn't
 

3785
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,829
impressive but it probably isn't
mechanistically speaking it is but we're

3786
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
mechanistically speaking it is but we're
 

3787
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,390
mechanistically speaking it is but we're
not there yet like you know we we have i

3788
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
not there yet like you know we we have i
 

3789
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,990
not there yet like you know we we have i
mean this is number 634 you know in the

3790
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
mean this is number 634 you know in the
 

3791
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,270
mean this is number 634 you know in the
list of problems to solve

3792
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,280
list of problems to solve
 

3793
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,990
list of problems to solve
so basic physics of the world is is

3794
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
so basic physics of the world is is
 

3795
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,150
so basic physics of the world is is
number one what do you um

3796
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,160
number one what do you um
 

3797
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,589
number one what do you um
just a quick

3798
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
just a quick
 

3799
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,309
just a quick
tangent on data augmentation so a lot of

3800
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
tangent on data augmentation so a lot of
 

3801
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,309
tangent on data augmentation so a lot of
it is

3802
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:54,319
it is

do you have any intuition that maybe

3806
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:00,720
do you have any intuition that maybe
 

3807
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,150
do you have any intuition that maybe
there could be some weird data

3808
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
there could be some weird data
 

3809
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,510
there could be some weird data
augmentation

3810
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
augmentation
 

3811
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,430
augmentation
like generative type of data

3812
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
like generative type of data
 

3813
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,029
like generative type of data
augmentation like doing something weird

3814
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:07,039
augmentation like doing something weird
 

3815
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,270
augmentation like doing something weird
to images which then

3816
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
to images which then
 

3817
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,029
to images which then
improves the

3818
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:11,039
improves the
 

3819
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,349
improves the
the similarity learning process so not

3820
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
the similarity learning process so not
 

3821
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,950
the similarity learning process so not
just kind of dumb

3822
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
just kind of dumb
 

3823
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,029
just kind of dumb
simple distortions but

3824
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:17,039
simple distortions but
 

3825
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,470
simple distortions but
by you shaking your head just saying

3826
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
by you shaking your head just saying
 

3827
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,789
by you shaking your head just saying
that even simple distortions are enough

3828
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:20,799
that even simple distortions are enough
 

3829
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,870
that even simple distortions are enough
i think no i think that augmentation is

3830
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:22,880
i think no i think that augmentation is
 

3831
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,390
i think no i think that augmentation is
a temporary necessary evil

3832
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
a temporary necessary evil
 

3833
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,309
a temporary necessary evil
so what people are working on now is is

3834
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
so what people are working on now is is
 

3835
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,990
so what people are working on now is is
two things one is

3836
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
two things one is
 

3837
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,029
two things one is
uh the type of self-supervisioning

3838
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:33,039
uh the type of self-supervisioning
 

3839
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,630
uh the type of self-supervisioning
like trying to to translate the type of

3840
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,640
like trying to to translate the type of
 

3841
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,870
like trying to to translate the type of
cell suppressant people using language

3842
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
cell suppressant people using language
 

3843
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,870
cell suppressant people using language
translating these two images which is

3844
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:38,880
translating these two images which is
 

3845
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,430
translating these two images which is
basically denoting autoencoder method

3846
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:41,440
basically denoting autoencoder method
 

3847
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,150
basically denoting autoencoder method
right so you you take an image you you

3848
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
right so you you take an image you you
 

3849
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,430
right so you you take an image you you
block you mask some parts of it

3850
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
block you mask some parts of it
 

3851
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,270
block you mask some parts of it
and then you you train some giant neural

3852
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
and then you you train some giant neural
 

3853
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,270
and then you you train some giant neural
net to reconstruct the parts that you've

3854
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
net to reconstruct the parts that you've
 

3855
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,750
net to reconstruct the parts that you've
that are that are missing and

3856
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
that are that are missing and
 

3857
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,990
that are that are missing and
until very recently

3858
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
until very recently
 

3859
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,510
until very recently
there was no there was no working

3860
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
there was no there was no working
 

3861
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,910
there was no there was no working
methods for that uh all the autoencoder

3862
01:02:59,910 --> 01:02:59,920
methods for that uh all the autoencoder
 

3863
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,670
methods for that uh all the autoencoder
type methods for images weren't

3864
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
type methods for images weren't
 

3865
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,589
type methods for images weren't
producing very good representation but

3866
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
producing very good representation but
 

3867
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,829
producing very good representation but
there's a paper now coming out of

3868
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:05,839
there's a paper now coming out of
 

3869
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,430
there's a paper now coming out of
the fair group in menlo park that

3870
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440
the fair group in menlo park that
 

3871
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,549
the fair group in menlo park that
actually works very well so

3872
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,559
actually works very well so
 

3873
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,910
actually works very well so
that doesn't require the documentation

3874
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
that doesn't require the documentation
 

3875
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,309
that doesn't require the documentation
that requires only masking

3876
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
that requires only masking
 

3877
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,190
that requires only masking
okay only masking for images

3878
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
okay only masking for images
 

3879
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,069
okay only masking for images
uh

3880
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
uh
 

3881
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,150
uh
okay right so you mask part of the image

3882
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
okay right so you mask part of the image
 

3883
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,950
okay right so you mask part of the image
and you train a system which you know

3884
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
and you train a system which you know
 

3885
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,029
and you train a system which you know
in this case is a transformer because

3886
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
in this case is a transformer because
 

3887
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,549
in this case is a transformer because
you can you can

3888
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
you can you can
 

3889
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,190
you can you can
the transformer represents the image as

3890
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
the transformer represents the image as
 

3891
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,270
the transformer represents the image as
uh non-overlapping patches so it's easy

3892
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
uh non-overlapping patches so it's easy
 

3893
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,190
uh non-overlapping patches so it's easy
to mask patches and things like that

3894
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
to mask patches and things like that
 

3895
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,190
to mask patches and things like that
okay then my question transfers to that

3896
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
okay then my question transfers to that
 

3897
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,190
okay then my question transfers to that
problem the masking like why should the

3898
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
problem the masking like why should the
 

3899
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,230
problem the masking like why should the
mask be a square or rectangle so it

3900
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
mask be a square or rectangle so it
 

3901
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,670
mask be a square or rectangle so it
doesn't matter like you know i think

3902
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,680
doesn't matter like you know i think
 

3903
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,750
doesn't matter like you know i think
we're gonna come up probably in the

3904
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
we're gonna come up probably in the
 

3905
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,990
we're gonna come up probably in the
future with sort of uh

3906
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
future with sort of uh
 

3907
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,910
future with sort of uh
you know ways to mask that are is you

3908
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
you know ways to mask that are is you
 

3909
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,670
you know ways to mask that are is you
know kind of

3910
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
know kind of
 

3911
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,349
know kind of
random essentially well i mean they are

3912
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:51,359
random essentially well i mean they are
 

3913
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,750
random essentially well i mean they are
random already but no no but like

3914
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
random already but no no but like
 

3915
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,630
random already but no no but like
something that's challenging

3916
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
something that's challenging
 

3917
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,829
something that's challenging
like

3918
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:57,839
like
 

3919
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,390
like
optimally challenging so like i mean

3920
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
optimally challenging so like i mean
 

3921
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,309
optimally challenging so like i mean
maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply

3922
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply
 

3923
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,349
maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply
but you're it seems like there's an data

3924
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
but you're it seems like there's an data
 

3925
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,670
but you're it seems like there's an data
augmentation or masking

3926
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
augmentation or masking
 

3927
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,750
augmentation or masking
there's an interactive element with it

3928
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:09,760
there's an interactive element with it
 

3929
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,430
there's an interactive element with it
like you're almost like playing with an

3930
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
like you're almost like playing with an
 

3931
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,390
like you're almost like playing with an
image

3932
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400
image
 

3933
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,150
image
and like it's like the way we play with

3934
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
and like it's like the way we play with
 

3935
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,990
and like it's like the way we play with
an image in our minds no but it's like

3936
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
an image in our minds no but it's like
 

3937
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,589
an image in our minds no but it's like
dropout it's like boston machine

3938
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:17,599
dropout it's like boston machine
 

3939
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,589
dropout it's like boston machine
training you um

3940
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:19,599
training you um
 

3941
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,910
training you um
you know every every every time you see

3942
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
you know every every every time you see
 

3943
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,029
you know every every every time you see
a percept

3944
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
a percept
 

3945
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,230
a percept
you also

3946
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,240
you also
 

3947
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,990
you also
you you can you can perturb it in some

3948
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000
you you can you can perturb it in some
 

3949
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,990
you you can you can perturb it in some
way and then uh the the principle of the

3950
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
way and then uh the the principle of the
 

3951
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,349
way and then uh the the principle of the
training procedure

3952
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
training procedure
 

3953
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,029
training procedure
is to minimize the difference of the

3954
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
is to minimize the difference of the
 

3955
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,950
is to minimize the difference of the
output of the representation

3956
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
output of the representation
 

3957
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,510
output of the representation
between the the clean version and the

3958
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
between the the clean version and the
 

3959
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,230
between the the clean version and the
corrupted version essentially right and

3960
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
corrupted version essentially right and
 

3961
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,910
corrupted version essentially right and
you you can do this in real time right

3962
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
you you can do this in real time right
 

3963
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,670
you you can do this in real time right
so you know what's the machine work like

3964
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:43,680
so you know what's the machine work like
 

3965
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,309
so you know what's the machine work like
this right you you you show a percept

3966
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
this right you you you show a percept
 

3967
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:47,910
this right you you you show a percept
and you tell the machine that's a good

3968
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
and you tell the machine that's a good
 

3969
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,150
and you tell the machine that's a good
combination of activities or your input

3970
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:50,160
combination of activities or your input
 

3971
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,430
combination of activities or your input
neurons

3972
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
neurons
 

3973
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,349
neurons
uh and then you either uh

3974
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
uh and then you either uh
 

3975
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,390
uh and then you either uh
let them

3976
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
let them
 

3977
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,470
let them
go their merry way without

3978
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
go their merry way without
 

3979
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,470
go their merry way without
clamping them to values or you only do

3980
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
clamping them to values or you only do
 

3981
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,630
clamping them to values or you only do
this with a subset yeah and what you're

3982
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
this with a subset yeah and what you're
 

3983
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,710
this with a subset yeah and what you're
doing is you're training the system so

3984
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
doing is you're training the system so
 

3985
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,910
doing is you're training the system so
that the

3986
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
that the
 

3987
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,910
that the
the stable state of the entire network

3988
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
the stable state of the entire network
 

3989
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,510
the stable state of the entire network
is the same regardless of whether it

3990
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,520
is the same regardless of whether it
 

3991
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,430
is the same regardless of whether it
sees the entire input or whether it is

3992
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
sees the entire input or whether it is
 

3993
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,029
sees the entire input or whether it is
only part of it

3994
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:13,039
only part of it
 

3995
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,950
only part of it
um you know the nozzling autoencoder

3996
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
um you know the nozzling autoencoder
 

3997
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,630
um you know the nozzling autoencoder
method is basically the same thing right

3998
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
method is basically the same thing right
 

3999
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,309
method is basically the same thing right
you you're you're training a system to

4000
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
you you're you're training a system to
 

4001
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,309
you you're you're training a system to
reproduce the input the complete inputs

4002
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
reproduce the input the complete inputs
 

4003
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,230
reproduce the input the complete inputs
and filling the blanks regardless of

4004
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
and filling the blanks regardless of
 

4005
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,230
and filling the blanks regardless of
which which parts are missing and that's

4006
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
which which parts are missing and that's
 

4007
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,309
which which parts are missing and that's
really the underlying principle and you

4008
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
really the underlying principle and you
 

4009
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,910
really the underlying principle and you
could imagine sort of a even in the

4010
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:27,920
could imagine sort of a even in the
 

4011
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,349
could imagine sort of a even in the
brain some sort of neural principle

4012
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
brain some sort of neural principle
 

4013
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,910
brain some sort of neural principle
where you know neurons gonna

4014
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:31,920
where you know neurons gonna
 

4015
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,990
where you know neurons gonna
oscillate right so they they take their

4016
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
oscillate right so they they take their
 

4017
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,510
oscillate right so they they take their
activity and then temporarily they kind

4018
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
activity and then temporarily they kind
 

4019
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,710
activity and then temporarily they kind
of shut off

4020
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
of shut off
 

4021
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,589
of shut off
to

4022
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
to
 

4023
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,349
to
you know force the rest of the system to

4024
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
you know force the rest of the system to
 

4025
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:40,630
you know force the rest of the system to
basically

4026
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
basically
 

4027
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,990
basically
reconstruct

4028
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:42,000
reconstruct
 

4029
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,630
reconstruct
the input without their help you know

4030
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
the input without their help you know
 

4031
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,789
the input without their help you know
and and and

4032
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
and and and
 

4033
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,549
and and and
i mean you could imagine you know you

4034
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
i mean you could imagine you know you
 

4035
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,470
i mean you could imagine you know you
know more or less biologically possible

4036
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
know more or less biologically possible
 

4037
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,670
know more or less biologically possible
processes

4038
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
processes
 

4039
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,990
processes
and i guess with this uh denoising

4040
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
and i guess with this uh denoising
 

4041
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,190
and i guess with this uh denoising
auto encoder and masking and data

4042
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,200
auto encoder and masking and data
 

4043
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,190
auto encoder and masking and data
augmentation you don't have to worry

4044
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,200
augmentation you don't have to worry
 

4045
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,029
augmentation you don't have to worry
about being super efficient

4046
01:06:01,029 --> 01:06:01,039
about being super efficient
 

4047
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,150
about being super efficient
you can just

4048
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
you can just
 

4049
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,309
you can just
do as much as you want yeah and get

4050
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
do as much as you want yeah and get
 

4051
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,910
do as much as you want yeah and get
better over time

4052
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
better over time
 

4053
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,430
better over time
because i was thinking like you might

4054
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
because i was thinking like you might
 

4055
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,430
because i was thinking like you might
want to be clever about the way you do

4056
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
want to be clever about the way you do
 

4057
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,349
want to be clever about the way you do
all these procedures

4058
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
all these procedures
 

4059
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:12,710
all these procedures
you know but

4060
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
you know but
 

4061
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,349
you know but
that's only if it's somehow costly to do

4062
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
that's only if it's somehow costly to do
 

4063
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,910
that's only if it's somehow costly to do
every iteration but it's not really not

4064
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
every iteration but it's not really not
 

4065
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,109
every iteration but it's not really not
really

4066
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:19,119
really
 

4067
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,069
really
maybe

4068
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
maybe
 

4069
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,510
maybe
and then there is you know data

4070
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:21,520
and then there is you know data
 

4071
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,950
and then there is you know data
augmentation without explicit data

4072
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
augmentation without explicit data
 

4073
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,029
augmentation without explicit data
augmentation is data augmentation by

4074
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:25,039
augmentation is data augmentation by
 

4075
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,870
augmentation is data augmentation by
waiting which is you know the the sort

4076
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:26,880
waiting which is you know the the sort
 

4077
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,190
waiting which is you know the the sort
of video prediction

4078
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
of video prediction
 

4079
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,309
of video prediction
you're

4080
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
you're
 

4081
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,029
you're
observing a video clip observing the

4082
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
observing a video clip observing the
 

4083
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,109
observing a video clip observing the
you know the continuation of that video

4084
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
you know the continuation of that video
 

4085
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,029
you know the continuation of that video
clip and try you try to learn a

4086
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
clip and try you try to learn a
 

4087
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,630
clip and try you try to learn a
representation using those joint

4088
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640

embedding architectures in such a way

4090
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,640
embedding architectures in such a way
 

4091
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,630
embedding architectures in such a way
that the representation of the future

4092
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:42,640
that the representation of the future
 

4093
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,870
that the representation of the future
clip is easily predictable from the

clip is easily predictable from the
 

4095
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,870
clip is easily predictable from the
representation of the of the observed

do you think youtube has enough

4100
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
do you think youtube has enough
 

4101
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,630
do you think youtube has enough

how to be a cat

4106
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
how to be a cat
 

4107
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,670
how to be a cat
i think so

4108
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:57,680
i think so
 

4109
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,630
i think so
so the

4110
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
so the
 

4111
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,109
so the
the amount of data is not the constraint

4112
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:01,119
the amount of data is not the constraint
 

4113
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,190
the amount of data is not the constraint
no it would require some selection i

4114
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200
no it would require some selection i
 

4115
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,069
no it would require some selection i
think

4116
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
think
 

4117
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,270
think
some

4118
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280
some
 

4119
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,510
some
some selection of you know maybe the

4120
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
some selection of you know maybe the
 

4121
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,109
some selection of you know maybe the
right type of data you know down the

4122
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:09,119
right type of data you know down the
 

4123
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,029
right type of data you know down the
rabbit hole of just cat videos that

4124
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
rabbit hole of just cat videos that
 

4125
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,789
rabbit hole of just cat videos that
might you might need to watch some

4126
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:12,799
might you might need to watch some
 

4127
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,549
might you might need to watch some
lectures or something

4128
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:14,559
lectures or something
 

4129
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,349
lectures or something
no you wouldn't how meta would that be

4130
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:17,359
no you wouldn't how meta would that be
 

4131
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,109
no you wouldn't how meta would that be
if it like watches

4132
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119
if it like watches
 

4133
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,589
if it like watches
lectures about intelligence and then

4134
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:21,599
lectures about intelligence and then
 

4135
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,390
lectures about intelligence and then
learns watches your lectures and nyu and

4136
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,400
learns watches your lectures and nyu and
 

4137
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,510
learns watches your lectures and nyu and
learns from that how to be intelligent

4138
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520

 

4139
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,670

uh what's your uh do you find

4140
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
uh what's your uh do you find
 

4141
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,190
uh what's your uh do you find
multi-modal learning interesting we've

4142
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
multi-modal learning interesting we've
 

4143
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,270
multi-modal learning interesting we've
been talking about visual language like

4144
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
been talking about visual language like
 

4145
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,270
been talking about visual language like
combining those together maybe audio all

4146
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
combining those together maybe audio all
 

4147
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,390
combining those together maybe audio all
those kinds of things there's a lot of

4148
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
those kinds of things there's a lot of
 

4149
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,390
those kinds of things there's a lot of
things that i find interesting in the

4150
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
things that i find interesting in the
 

4151
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,470
things that i find interesting in the
short term but are not

4152
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
short term but are not
 

4153
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,230
short term but are not
addressing the important problem that i

4154
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:44,240
addressing the important problem that i
 

4155
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,670
addressing the important problem that i
think are really kind of the big

4156
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:45,680
think are really kind of the big
 

4157
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,670
think are really kind of the big
challenges so i think you know things

4158
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
challenges so i think you know things
 

4159
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,349
challenges so i think you know things
like multitask learning continual

4160
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:49,359
like multitask learning continual
 

4161
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,470
like multitask learning continual
learning

4162
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:50,480
learning
 

4163
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,190
learning
uh you know

4164
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:53,200
uh you know
 

4165
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,109
uh you know
adversarial issues i mean those have you

4166
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:55,119
adversarial issues i mean those have you
 

4167
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,589
adversarial issues i mean those have you
know great practical interests in the

4168
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
know great practical interests in the
 

4169
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,270
know great practical interests in the
relatively short term

4170
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
relatively short term
 

4171
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,710
relatively short term
uh possibly but i don't think they're

4172
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
uh possibly but i don't think they're
 

4173
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,470
uh possibly but i don't think they're
fundamental you know active learning

4174
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
fundamental you know active learning
 

4175
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,670
fundamental you know active learning
even to some extent reinforcement

4176
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,680
even to some extent reinforcement
 

4177
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,190
even to some extent reinforcement
learning i think

4178
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:05,200
learning i think
 

4179
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,630
learning i think
those things will

4180
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
those things will
 

4181
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,710
those things will
become either obsolete or

4182
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
become either obsolete or
 

4183
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,670
become either obsolete or
or useless or easy

4184
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,680
or useless or easy
 

4185
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,069
or useless or easy
once we figure out how to do

4186
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
once we figure out how to do
 

4187
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,829
once we figure out how to do
self-improvised representation learning

4188
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:15,839
self-improvised representation learning
 

4189
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,189
self-improvised representation learning
or or learning predictable models

4190
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:19,199
or or learning predictable models
 

4191
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,669
or or learning predictable models
and so i think that's what you know

4192
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
and so i think that's what you know
 

4193
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,349
and so i think that's what you know
the entire community should be focusing

4194
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
the entire community should be focusing
 

4195
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,349
the entire community should be focusing
on uh at least people are interested in

4196
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
on uh at least people are interested in
 

4197
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,870
on uh at least people are interested in
sort of fundamental questions or you

4198
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
sort of fundamental questions or you
 

4199
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,390
sort of fundamental questions or you
know really kind of pushing the envelope

4200
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,400
know really kind of pushing the envelope
 

4201
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,269
know really kind of pushing the envelope
of ai towards the next the next stage

4202
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
of ai towards the next the next stage
 

4203
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,709
of ai towards the next the next stage
but of course there's like a huge amount

4204
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
but of course there's like a huge amount
 

4205
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,309
but of course there's like a huge amount
of you know very interesting work to do

4206
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
of you know very interesting work to do
 

4207
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,470
of you know very interesting work to do
in sort of practical questions that have

4208
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480
in sort of practical questions that have
 

4209
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,349
in sort of practical questions that have
you know short-term impact well you know

4210
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
you know short-term impact well you know
 

4211
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,349
you know short-term impact well you know
it's it's difficult to talk about the

4212
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:41,359
it's it's difficult to talk about the
 

4213
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,950
it's it's difficult to talk about the
temporal scale because

4214
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
temporal scale because
 

4215
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,229
temporal scale because
all of human civilization will

4216
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:44,239
all of human civilization will
 

4217
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,430
all of human civilization will
eventually be destroyed because the the

4218
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:47,440
eventually be destroyed because the the
 

4219
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,189
eventually be destroyed because the the
the sun will die out and even if elon

4220
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
the sun will die out and even if elon
 

4221
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,070
the sun will die out and even if elon
musk is successful multi-planetary

4222
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
musk is successful multi-planetary
 

4223
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,390
musk is successful multi-planetary
colonization across the galaxy uh

4224
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:54,400
colonization across the galaxy uh
 

4225
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,510
colonization across the galaxy uh
eventually

4226
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,520
eventually
 

4227
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,590
eventually
the entirety of it would just become

4228
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
the entirety of it would just become
 

4229
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,149
the entirety of it would just become
giant black holes and um

4230
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:00,159
giant black holes and um
 

4231
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,070
giant black holes and um
that's going to take a while though

4232
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,080
that's going to take a while though
 

4233
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,309
that's going to take a while though
so but but what i'm saying is then that

4234
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:04,319
so but but what i'm saying is then that

01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,750
in the world um and and you have to kind
of ironclad it before before you do this

4396
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:39,760
of ironclad it before before you do this
 

4397
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,110
of ironclad it before before you do this
you know

4398
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:43,120

 

4399
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,350

so much for you know grand grand ideas

um
 

4405
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,310
um
but you know i'm placing myself sort of

4406
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,320
but you know i'm placing myself sort of
 

4407
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,950
but you know i'm placing myself sort of
you know some

4408

you know some
 

4409
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,550
you know some
you know upstream of this queen or quite

4410
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
you know upstream of this queen or quite
 

4411
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,470
you know upstream of this queen or quite
a bit of stream of this your plato think

4412
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
a bit of stream of this your plato think
 

4413
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,270
a bit of stream of this your plato think
about platonic forms you're you're

4414

about platonic forms you're you're
 

4415
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,430
about platonic forms you're you're
platonic because eventually

4416
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
platonic because eventually
 

4417
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,070
platonic because eventually
i want that stuff to get used but uh

4418
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
i want that stuff to get used but uh
 

4419
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,709
i want that stuff to get used but uh
it's okay if it takes five or ten years

4420
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
it's okay if it takes five or ten years
 

4421

01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
before it's been the case before that
 

4427
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,870
before it's been the case before that
you know i've made that case i mean if

4428
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
you know i've made that case i mean if
 

4429
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,950
you know i've made that case i mean if
you look back in the mid-2000s for

01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:16,960
you look back in the mid-2000s for
 

4431
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,550
you look back in the mid-2000s for
example and you ask yourself the

4432
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
example and you ask yourself the
 

4433
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,390

kind of computer vision techniques you

4442
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:29,600
kind of computer vision techniques you
 

4443
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,430
kind of computer vision techniques you
know using uh interest point detectors

4444

sticking an svm on top at that time the

4448
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
sticking an svm on top at that time the
 

4449
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,709
sticking an svm on top at that time the
data sets were so small that

4450
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
data sets were so small that
 

4451
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,669
data sets were so small that
those

4452
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:39,679
those
 

4453
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,830

worked better than companies there was

4456
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:43,679
worked better than companies there was
 

4457
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,430
worked better than companies there was
just not enough data for comnets and

4458
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:45,440
just not enough data for comnets and
 

4459
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,270
just not enough data for comnets and
contests were were a little a little

4460
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
contests were were a little a little
 

4461
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,950
contests were were a little a little
slow with the kind of hardware that was

4462
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:48,960
slow with the kind of hardware that was
 

4463
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,630
slow with the kind of hardware that was
available at the time

available at the time
 

4465
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,270
available at the time
and there was a c change when uh

4466
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
and there was a c change when uh
 

4467
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,350
and there was a c change when uh
basically when you know

4468
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
basically when you know
 

4469
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,750
basically when you know
data sets become bigger and and gpus

4470
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:57,760
data sets become bigger and and gpus
 

4471
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,750

became available that that's what

4472
01:12:59,750 --> 01:12:59,760
became available that that's what
 

4473
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,430
became available that that's what
you know those

4474
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440
you know those
 

4475
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,669
you know those
two of the main factors that basically

4476
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
two of the main factors that basically
 

4477
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,350
two of the main factors that basically
made people change their change their

4478
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
made people change their change their
 

4479
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,669
made people change their change their

right uh you do need entity recognition

4558
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
right uh you do need entity recognition
 

4559
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,990
right uh you do need entity recognition
and you parse and you you you do tagging

4560
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
and you parse and you you you do tagging
 

4561
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,870
and you parse and you you you do tagging
of

4562
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,880
of
 

4563
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,669
of
of of the parts of speech and you know

4564
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:33,679
of of the parts of speech and you know
 

4565
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,430
of of the parts of speech and you know
you do this sort of tree representation

4566
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
you do this sort of tree representation
 

4567
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,430
you do this sort of tree representation
of clauses and all that stuff right

4568
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
of clauses and all that stuff right
 

4569
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,750
of clauses and all that stuff right
before you can do anything

4570
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760

 

4571
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,870

so

4572
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
so
 

4573
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,510
so
that's how it starts right just engineer

4574
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:45,520
that's how it starts right just engineer
 

4575
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,430
that's how it starts right just engineer
the hell out of it and then you start

4576
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:47,440
the hell out of it and then you start
 

4577
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,950
the hell out of it and then you start
having data

4578
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
having data
 

4579
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,630
having data
and maybe you have more powerful

4580
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:50,640
and maybe you have more powerful
 

4581
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,149
and maybe you have more powerful
computers maybe you know something about

4582
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
computers maybe you know something about
 

4583
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,990
computers maybe you know something about
statistical learning so you start using

4584
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,000
statistical learning so you start using
 

4585
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,189
statistical learning so you start using
machine learning and it's usually a

4586
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
machine learning and it's usually a
 

4587
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,870
machine learning and it's usually a
small sliver on top of your kind of

4588
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:56,880
small sliver on top of your kind of
 

4589
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,390
small sliver on top of your kind of
handcrafted system where you know you

4590
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:58,400
handcrafted system where you know you
 

4591
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,669
handcrafted system where you know you
extract features by hand okay and now

4592
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
extract features by hand okay and now
 

4593
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,270
extract features by hand okay and now
you know nowadays the standard way of

4594
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
you know nowadays the standard way of
 

4595
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,709
you know nowadays the standard way of
doing this is that you train the entire

4596
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
doing this is that you train the entire
 

4597
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:05,910
doing this is that you train the entire
thing end to end with the deep learning

4598
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:05,920
thing end to end with the deep learning
 

4599
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,669
thing end to end with the deep learning
system and it learns its own features

4600
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:07,679
system and it learns its own features
 

4601
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,470
system and it learns its own features
and

4602
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
and
 

4603
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,470
and
and you know speech recognition systems

4604
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
and you know speech recognition systems
 

4605
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,350
and you know speech recognition systems
nowadays uh ocr systems are completely

4606
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360
nowadays uh ocr systems are completely
 

4607
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,189
nowadays uh ocr systems are completely
end-to-end it's uh you know it's some

4608
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:15,199
end-to-end it's uh you know it's some
 

4609
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,510
end-to-end it's uh you know it's some
giant neural net that takes raw

4610
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
giant neural net that takes raw
 

4611
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,790
giant neural net that takes raw
waveforms

4612
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
waveforms
 

4613
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,310
waveforms
and produces a sequence of characters

4614
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
and produces a sequence of characters
 

4615
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,390
and produces a sequence of characters
coming out and it's just a huge neural

4616
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:22,400
coming out and it's just a huge neural
 

4617
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,630
coming out and it's just a huge neural
net right there's no you know minecraft

4618
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,640

4619
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,709
net right there's no you know minecraft
model there's no language model that is

4620
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:26,719
model there's no language model that is
 

4621
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,790
model there's no language model that is
explicit other than you know something

4622
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
explicit other than you know something
 

4623
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,390
explicit other than you know something
that's ingrained in the in the sort of

01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
that's ingrained in the in the sort of
 

4625
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,990
that's ingrained in the in the sort of
neural language model if you want same

4626
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
neural language model if you want same
 

4627
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,070
neural language model if you want same
for translation same for all kinds of

4628
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,080
for translation same for all kinds of
 

4629
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,510
for translation same for all kinds of
stuff so you see this

4630
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
stuff so you see this
 

4631
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,350
stuff so you see this
continuous evolution

4632
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
continuous evolution
 

4633
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,189
continuous evolution
from

4634
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
from
 

4635
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,430
from
you know less and less hand crafting and

4636
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
you know less and less hand crafting and
 

4637
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,270
you know less and less hand crafting and
more and more learning

4638
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
more and more learning
 

4639
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,229
more and more learning
um

4640
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
um
 

4641
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,430
um
and uh

4642
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
and uh
 

4643
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,070
and uh
i i think

4644
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
i i think
 

4645
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,550
i i think
it's true in biology as well

4646
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:50,560
it's true in biology as well
 

4647
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,790
it's true in biology as well
so i mean we might disagree about this

4648
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
so i mean we might disagree about this
 

4649
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,149
so i mean we might disagree about this
maybe not uh in this one little piece at

4650
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:56,159
maybe not uh in this one little piece at
 

4651
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,430
maybe not uh in this one little piece at
the end you mentioned active learning

4652
01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,440
the end you mentioned active learning
 

4653
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,590
the end you mentioned active learning
it feels like active learning which is

4654
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,600
it feels like active learning which is
 

4655
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,350
it feels like active learning which is
the selection of data and also the

4656
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
the selection of data and also the
 

4657
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,669
the selection of data and also the
interactivity needs to be part of this

4658
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
interactivity needs to be part of this
 

4659
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,590
interactivity needs to be part of this
giant neural network you cannot just be

4660
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
giant neural network you cannot just be
 

4661
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,270
giant neural network you cannot just be
an observer to do self-supervised

4665
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,750

i don't self supervise learning is just

4666
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
i don't self supervise learning is just
 

4667
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,070
i don't self supervise learning is just
a word but i would whatever this giant

i agree in the sense that i think uh

4696
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:50,080
i agree in the sense that i think uh
 

4697
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,229
i agree in the sense that i think uh
i agree i agree in two ways the first

4698
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
i agree i agree in two ways the first
 

4699
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,669
i agree i agree in two ways the first
the first way i agree is that if you

4700
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:53,679
the first way i agree is that if you
 

4701
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:54,950
the first way i agree is that if you
want uh

4702
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
want uh
 

4703
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,950
want uh
and you certainly need a causal model of

4704
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
and you certainly need a causal model of
 

4705
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,390
and you certainly need a causal model of
the world that allows you to predict the

to train that model you need to take

4710
01:17:01,669 --> 01:17:01,679
to train that model you need to take
 

4711
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,070
to train that model you need to take
actions right you need to be able to act

4712
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
actions right you need to be able to act
 

4713
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,990
actions right you need to be able to act
in a world and see the effect

4714
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
in a world and see the effect
 

4715
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,910
in a world and see the effect
for you to be to learn causal models of

4716
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
for you to be to learn causal models of
 

4717
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,270
for you to be to learn causal models of
the world well so that's not that's not

4718
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:09,280
the world well so that's not that's not
 

4719
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,350
the world well so that's not that's not
obvious because you can observe others

4720
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
obvious because you can observe others
 

4721
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,870
obvious because you can observe others
you can observe others and you can infer

4722
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:12,880
you can observe others and you can infer
 

4723
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,950
you can observe others and you can infer
that they're similar to you and then you

4724
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
that they're similar to you and then you
 

4725
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,390
that they're similar to you and then you
can learn from that yeah but then you

4726
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:16,400
can learn from that yeah but then you
 

4727
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,790
can learn from that yeah but then you
have to kind of hardwire that part right

4728
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
have to kind of hardwire that part right
 

4729
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,070
have to kind of hardwire that part right
you know mirror neurons and all that

4730
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
you know mirror neurons and all that
 

4731
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,070
you know mirror neurons and all that
stuff right so um

4732
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,080
stuff right so um
 

4733
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,430
stuff right so um
and it's not clear to me how you would

4734
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
and it's not clear to me how you would
 

4735
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,030
and it's not clear to me how you would
do this in a machine so

4736
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
do this in a machine so
 

4737
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,310
do this in a machine so
um

4738
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
um
 

4739
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,270
um
so i think the the action part would be

4740
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
so i think the the action part would be
 

4741
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,910
so i think the the action part would be
necessary for having causal models of of

4742
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
necessary for having causal models of of
 

4743
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,350
necessary for having causal models of of
the world

4744
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,360
the world
 

4745
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,910
the world
the second reason it may be

4746
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
the second reason it may be
 

4747
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,910
the second reason it may be
necessary or at least more efficient is

4748
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:37,920
necessary or at least more efficient is
 

4749
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,790
necessary or at least more efficient is
that

4750
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
that
 

4751
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,669
that
uh

4752
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
uh
 

4753
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,830
uh
active learning basically you know goes

4754
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
active learning basically you know goes
 

4755
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,510
active learning basically you know goes
for the jiggler of what you're what you

4756
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,520
for the jiggler of what you're what you
 

4757
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,790
for the jiggler of what you're what you
don't know right

4758
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
don't know right
 

4759
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,550
don't know right
is this you know obvious

4760
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:46,560
is this you know obvious
 

4761
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,390
is this you know obvious
areas of uncertainty

4762
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
areas of uncertainty
 

4763
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,790
areas of uncertainty
uh about your your world and about the

4764
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
uh about your your world and about the
 

4765
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,870
uh about your your world and about the
how the world behaves

4766
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
how the world behaves
 

4767
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,990
how the world behaves
and

4768
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
and
 

4769
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,030
and
you can resolve this uncertainty by

4770
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
you can resolve this uncertainty by
 

4771
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,950
you can resolve this uncertainty by
systematic exploration of that part that

4772
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
systematic exploration of that part that
 

4773
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,950
systematic exploration of that part that
you don't you don't know and if you know

4774
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
you don't you don't know and if you know
 

4775
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,229
you don't you don't know and if you know
that you don't know then you know it

4776
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:02,239
that you don't know then you know it
 

4777
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,990
that you don't know then you know it
makes you curious you kind of look into

4778
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
makes you curious you kind of look into
 

4779
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,430
makes you curious you kind of look into
situations that

4780
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
situations that
 

4781
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,310
situations that
and uh you know across the animal uh

4782
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
and uh you know across the animal uh
 

4783
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,189
and uh you know across the animal uh
world

4784
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:09,199
world
 

4785
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,110
world
different species are different levels

4786
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
different species are different levels
 

4787
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,510
different species are different levels
of curiosity right

4788
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:13,520
of curiosity right
 

4789
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,790
of curiosity right
yeah depending on how they're built

4790
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:14,800
yeah depending on how they're built
 

4791
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,830
yeah depending on how they're built
right so

4792
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
right so
 

4793
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,830
right so
you know cats and rats are incredibly

4794
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840
you know cats and rats are incredibly
 

4795
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,470
you know cats and rats are incredibly
curious uh dogs not so much i mean less

4796
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
curious uh dogs not so much i mean less
 

4797
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,390
curious uh dogs not so much i mean less
yeah so it could be useful to have that

4798
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:22,400
yeah so it could be useful to have that
 

4799
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,870
yeah so it could be useful to have that
kind of curiosity so it'd be useful but

4800
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
kind of curiosity so it'd be useful but
 

4801
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,870
kind of curiosity so it'd be useful but
curiosity just makes the process faster

4802
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
curiosity just makes the process faster
 

4803
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,350
curiosity just makes the process faster
it doesn't make the process exist

4804
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
it doesn't make the process exist
 

4805
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,229
it doesn't make the process exist
the

4806
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239
the
 

4807
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,910
the
so what process what learning process

4808
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
so what process what learning process
 

4809
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,510
so what process what learning process
is it that

4810
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:35,520
is it that
 

4811
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,550
is it that
active learning makes more efficient

4812
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
active learning makes more efficient
 

4813
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,390
active learning makes more efficient
and i'm asking that first question uh

4814
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
and i'm asking that first question uh
 

4815
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,030
and i'm asking that first question uh
you know

4816
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040

 

4817
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,070

you know we haven't answered that

4818
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,080
you know we haven't answered that
 

4819
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,990
you know we haven't answered that
question yet so you know i worry about

4820
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
question yet so you know i worry about
 

4821
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,149
question yet so you know i worry about
active learning once this question is so

4822
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:48,159
active learning once this question is so
 

4823
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,830
active learning once this question is so
it's the more fundamental question to

4824
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:49,840
it's the more fundamental question to
 

4825
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,790
it's the more fundamental question to
ask

4826
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800
ask
 

4827
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,270
ask
and if active learning or

4828
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:53,280
and if active learning or
 

4829
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,709
and if active learning or
interaction

4830
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
interaction
 

4831
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,870
interaction
increases the efficiency of the learning

4832
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
increases the efficiency of the learning
 

4833
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,390
increases the efficiency of the learning
see sometimes

4834
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
see sometimes
 

4835
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,550
see sometimes
it becomes very different if the

4836
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:00,560
it becomes very different if the
 

4837
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,510
it becomes very different if the
increase is several orders of magnitude

4838
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
increase is several orders of magnitude
 

4839
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,669
increase is several orders of magnitude
right like that's true

4840
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
right like that's true
 

4841
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,990
right like that's true
but fundamentally still the same thing

4842
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
but fundamentally still the same thing
 

4843
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,910
but fundamentally still the same thing
and building up the intuition about how

4844
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:09,920
and building up the intuition about how
 

4845
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,950
and building up the intuition about how
to

4846
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
to

is um is the core problem

4854
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
is um is the core problem
 

4855
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,709
is um is the core problem
what do you think about yoshi banjos

4856
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
what do you think about yoshi banjos
 

4857
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,709
what do you think about yoshi banjos
talking about consciousness

4858
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
talking about consciousness
 

4859
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,950
talking about consciousness
and all of these kinds of concepts okay

4860
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
and all of these kinds of concepts okay
 

4861
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,149
and all of these kinds of concepts okay
um

4862
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
um
 

4863
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,390
um
i don't know what consciousness is

4864
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
i don't know what consciousness is
 

4865
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,070
i don't know what consciousness is
but uh

4866
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080
but uh
 

4867
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,830
but uh
it's a good opener

4868
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:31,840
it's a good opener
 

4869
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,430
it's a good opener
and to some extent a lot of the things

4870
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,440
and to some extent a lot of the things
 

4871
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,590
and to some extent a lot of the things
that are said about consciousness remind

4872
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
that are said about consciousness remind
 

4873
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,950
that are said about consciousness remind
me of

4874
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:36,960
me of
 

4875
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,149
me of
the questions people were asking

4876
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
the questions people were asking
 

4877
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,790
the questions people were asking
themselves in the 18th century or 17th

4878
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
themselves in the 18th century or 17th
 

4879
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,110
themselves in the 18th century or 17th
century when they discovered that

4880
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
century when they discovered that
 

4881
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,270
century when they discovered that
uh you know how the eye works and the

4882
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:45,280
uh you know how the eye works and the
 

4883
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,709
uh you know how the eye works and the
fact that the image at the back of the

4884
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
fact that the image at the back of the
 

4885
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,229
fact that the image at the back of the
eye was

4886
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
eye was
 

4887
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,510
eye was
upside down

4888
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:49,520
upside down
 

4889
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,510
upside down
right because you have a lens and and so

4890
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
right because you have a lens and and so
 

4891
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,830
right because you have a lens and and so
on your retina the image that forms is

4892
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
on your retina the image that forms is
 

4893
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,189
on your retina the image that forms is
an image of the world but it's upside

4894
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
an image of the world but it's upside
 

4895
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,110
an image of the world but it's upside
down how is it that you see right side

4896
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
down how is it that you see right side
 

4897
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,990
down how is it that you see right side
up

4898
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:58,000
up
 

4899
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,830
up
and you know with what we know today in

4900
01:19:59,830 --> 01:19:59,840
and you know with what we know today in
 

4901
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,350
and you know with what we know today in
science you know we realize this

4902
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
science you know we realize this
 

4903
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,669
science you know we realize this
question doesn't make any sense

4904
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
question doesn't make any sense
 

4905
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,830
question doesn't make any sense
or or is kind of ridiculous in some way

4906
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:05,840
or or is kind of ridiculous in some way
 

4907
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,270
or or is kind of ridiculous in some way
right so i think a lot of what is said

4908
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
right so i think a lot of what is said
 

4909
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,870
right so i think a lot of what is said
about consciousness is of that nature

4910
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
about consciousness is of that nature
 

4911
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,229
about consciousness is of that nature
now that said there's a lot of really

4912
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
now that said there's a lot of really
 

4913
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,030
now that said there's a lot of really
smart people that uh for whom i have a

4914
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
smart people that uh for whom i have a
 

4915
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,310
smart people that uh for whom i have a
lot of respect who are talking about

4916
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
lot of respect who are talking about
 

4917
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,390
lot of respect who are talking about

who is the colleague of mine at nyu

4920
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600

4921
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,669
who is the colleague of mine at nyu
i have kind of a

4922
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
i have kind of a

01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,750
i have kind of a
unorthodox folk

4924
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,760

 

4925
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,350

speculative

4926
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
speculative
 

4927
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,350
speculative
hypothesis about consciousness so we're

4928
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
hypothesis about consciousness so we're
 

4929
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,470
hypothesis about consciousness so we're
talking about this audio world model and

4930
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:32,480
talking about this audio world model and
 

4931
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,470
talking about this audio world model and
uh i think you know our entire

4932
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
uh i think you know our entire
 

4933
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,870
uh i think you know our entire
prefrontal cortex basically is

4934
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:36,880
prefrontal cortex basically is
 

4935
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,629
prefrontal cortex basically is
uh the engine for our world model

4936
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
uh the engine for our world model
 

4937
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:41,990
uh the engine for our world model
but when we are

4938
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
but when we are
 

4939
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,470
but when we are
attending at a particular situation

4940
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,480
attending at a particular situation
 

4941
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,149
attending at a particular situation
we're focused on that situation we

4942
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
we're focused on that situation we
 

4943
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,470
we're focused on that situation we
basically cannot attend to anything else

4944
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
basically cannot attend to anything else
 

4945
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,669
basically cannot attend to anything else
and that

4946
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
and that
 

4947
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,070
and that
seems to suggest

4948
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,080
seems to suggest
 

4949
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,669
seems to suggest
that we basically have only one

4950
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
that we basically have only one
 

4951
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,669
that we basically have only one
world model engine in our pre-photo

4952
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:57,679
world model engine in our pre-photo
 

4953
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,590
world model engine in our pre-photo
cortex

4954
01:20:59,590 --> 01:20:59,600
cortex
 

4955
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,270
cortex
that engine is configurable to the

4956
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
that engine is configurable to the
 

4957
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,510
that engine is configurable to the
situation at hand so we are building a

4958
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520
situation at hand so we are building a
 

4959
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,990
situation at hand so we are building a
box out of wood or we are you know

4960
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
box out of wood or we are you know
 

4961
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,590
box out of wood or we are you know
driving uh

4962
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
driving uh
 

4963
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,990
driving uh
down the highway playing chess we we

4964
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
down the highway playing chess we we
 

4965
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,470
down the highway playing chess we we
basically have uh a single model of the

4966
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
basically have uh a single model of the
 

4967
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,590
basically have uh a single model of the
world that we configure into the

4968
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
world that we configure into the
 

4969
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,189
world that we configure into the
situation at hand

4970
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
situation at hand
 

4971
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,790
situation at hand
which is why we can only attend to one

4972
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
which is why we can only attend to one
 

4973
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,030
which is why we can only attend to one
task at a time

4974
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:19,040
task at a time
 

4975
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,550
task at a time
now if there is a task that we do

4976
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
now if there is a task that we do
 

4977
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,790
now if there is a task that we do
repeatedly

4978
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:22,800
repeatedly
 

4979
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,350
repeatedly
it it goes from the sort of deliberate

4980
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
it it goes from the sort of deliberate
 

4981
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,790
it it goes from the sort of deliberate
reasoning using model of the world and

4982
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
reasoning using model of the world and
 

4983
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,070
reasoning using model of the world and
prediction and perhaps something like

4984
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
prediction and perhaps something like
 

4985
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,510
prediction and perhaps something like
model predictive control which i was

4986
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
model predictive control which i was
 

4987
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,189
model predictive control which i was
talking about earlier

4988
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
talking about earlier
 

4989
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,189
talking about earlier
to something that is more subconscious

4990
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
to something that is more subconscious
 

4991
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,110
to something that is more subconscious
that becomes automatic so i don't know

4992
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,120
that becomes automatic so i don't know
 

4993
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,950
that becomes automatic so i don't know
if you've ever played against a chess

4994
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
if you've ever played against a chess
 

4995
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,229
if you've ever played against a chess
grandmaster

4996
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:38,239
grandmaster
 

4997
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,790
grandmaster
uh you know i get wiped out in you know

4998
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:40,800
uh you know i get wiped out in you know
 

4999
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,669
uh you know i get wiped out in you know
10 flies right

5000
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
10 flies right
 

5001
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,590
10 flies right
and you know i have to think about my

5002
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
and you know i have to think about my
 

5003
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,030
and you know i have to think about my
move for

5004
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
move for
 

5005
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,189
move for
you know like 15 minutes

5006
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
you know like 15 minutes
 

5007
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,430
you know like 15 minutes
uh and the person in front of me the

5008
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:51,440
uh and the person in front of me the
 

5009
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,669
uh and the person in front of me the
grandmaster you know would just like

5010
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:53,679
grandmaster you know would just like
 

5011
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:56,149
grandmaster you know would just like
react within seconds right

5012
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
react within seconds right
 

5013
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,750
react within seconds right
you know he doesn't need to

5014
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
you know he doesn't need to
 

5015
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,270
you know he doesn't need to
think about it that's become part of the

5016
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
think about it that's become part of the
 

5017
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,550
think about it that's become part of the
subconscious because you know it's

5018
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
subconscious because you know it's
 

5019
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,669
subconscious because you know it's
basically just

5020
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:01,679
basically just
 

5021
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,830
basically just
pattern recognition at this point

5022
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:03,840
pattern recognition at this point
 

5023
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,629
pattern recognition at this point
um

5024
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:04,639
um
 

5025
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,790
um
same you know you the first few hours

5026
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
same you know you the first few hours
 

5027
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,550
same you know you the first few hours
you drive a car you're really attentive

5028
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
you drive a car you're really attentive
 

5029
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,750
you drive a car you're really attentive
you can't do anything else and then

5030
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,760
you can't do anything else and then
 

5031
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,030
you can't do anything else and then
after 20-30 hours of practice 50 hours

5032
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:13,040
after 20-30 hours of practice 50 hours
 

5033
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,470
after 20-30 hours of practice 50 hours
you know a subconscious you can talk to

5034
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
you know a subconscious you can talk to
 

5035
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,750
you know a subconscious you can talk to
the person next to you you know things

5036
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
the person next to you you know things
 

5037
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,870
the person next to you you know things
like that right

5038
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
like that right
 

5039
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,310
like that right
unless the situation becomes

5040
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
unless the situation becomes
 

5041
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,669
unless the situation becomes
unpredictable and then you have to stop

5042
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
unpredictable and then you have to stop
 

5043
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:20,950
unpredictable and then you have to stop
talking

5044
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:20,960
talking
 

5045
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,870
talking
so that suggests you only have one model

5046
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
so that suggests you only have one model
 

5047
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,629
so that suggests you only have one model
in your head

5048
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:24,639
in your head
 

5049
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,910
in your head
and

5050
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
and
 

5051
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,189
and
it might suggest the idea that

5052
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:27,199
it might suggest the idea that
 

5053
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,790
it might suggest the idea that
consciousness basically is the module

5054
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
consciousness basically is the module
 

5055
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,790
consciousness basically is the module
that configures this world model of

5056
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
that configures this world model of
 

5057
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,629
that configures this world model of
yours you know you need to have some

5058
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
yours you know you need to have some
 

5059
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,229
yours you know you need to have some
sort of

5060
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
sort of
 

5061
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:37,189
sort of
executive kind of overseer that

5062
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
executive kind of overseer that
 

5063
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,550
executive kind of overseer that
configures your word model for the

5064
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
configures your word model for the
 

5065
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,470
configures your word model for the
situation at hand

5066
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:40,480
situation at hand
 

5067
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,470
situation at hand
and that that leads to kind of the

5068
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
and that that leads to kind of the
 

5069
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,470
and that that leads to kind of the
really curious concept that

5070
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
really curious concept that
 

5071
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,990
really curious concept that
consciousness is not a consequence of

5072
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
consciousness is not a consequence of
 

5073
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,990
consciousness is not a consequence of
the power of our minds but of the

5074
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
the power of our minds but of the
 

5075
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,750
the power of our minds but of the
limitation of our brains

5076
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
limitation of our brains
 

5077
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,910
limitation of our brains
but because we have only one world model

5078
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:51,920
but because we have only one world model
 

5079
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,229
but because we have only one world model
we have to be conscious if we had as

5080
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
we have to be conscious if we had as
 

5081
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,310
we have to be conscious if we had as
many role models as

5082
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,320
many role models as
 

5083
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,470
many role models as
there are situations we encounter then

5084
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
there are situations we encounter then
 

5085
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,629
there are situations we encounter then
we could do all of them simultaneously

5086
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:00,639
we could do all of them simultaneously
 

5087
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:01,910
we could do all of them simultaneously
and we wouldn't need this sort of

5088
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
and we wouldn't need this sort of
 

5089
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,189
and we wouldn't need this sort of
executive control that we call

5090
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
executive control that we call
 

5091
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:04,390
executive control that we call
consciousness

5092
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:04,400
consciousness
 

5093
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,790
consciousness
yeah interesting and somehow maybe that

5094
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,800
yeah interesting and somehow maybe that
 

5095
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,790
yeah interesting and somehow maybe that
executive controller

5096
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
executive controller
 

5097
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,070
executive controller
i mean the the hard problem of

5098
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
i mean the the hard problem of
 

5099
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,510
i mean the the hard problem of
consciousness there's some kind of

5100
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
consciousness there's some kind of
 

5101
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,669
consciousness there's some kind of
chemicals in biology that's creating a

5102
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
chemicals in biology that's creating a
 

5103
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:14,870
chemicals in biology that's creating a
feeling

5104
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
feeling
 

5105
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,950
feeling
like it feels to experience some of

5106
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:16,960
like it feels to experience some of
 

5107
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,790
like it feels to experience some of
these things

5108
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:18,800
these things
 

5109
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,229
these things
that's kind of like the hard question is

5110
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:22,239
that's kind of like the hard question is
 

5111
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,990
that's kind of like the hard question is
what the heck is that and why is that

5112
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:24,000
what the heck is that and why is that
 

5113
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,990
what the heck is that and why is that
useful maybe the more pragmatic question

5114
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:26,000
useful maybe the more pragmatic question
 

5115
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,229
useful maybe the more pragmatic question
why is it useful to feel like

5116
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,239
why is it useful to feel like
 

5117
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,910
why is it useful to feel like
this is really you

5118
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
this is really you
 

5119
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,990
this is really you
experiencing this versus just like

5120
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
experiencing this versus just like
 

5121
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,189
experiencing this versus just like
information

5122
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:33,199
information
 

5123
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,189
information
being processed

5124
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
being processed
 

5125
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,149
being processed
um it could be just a very nice side

5126
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
um it could be just a very nice side
 

5127
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,229
um it could be just a very nice side
effect of um

5128
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
effect of um
 

5129
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,950
effect of um
of the way we evolved that's just very

5130
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
of the way we evolved that's just very
 

5131
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,870
of the way we evolved that's just very
useful to

5132
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
useful to
 

5133
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,830
useful to
to uh

5134
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:45,840
to uh
 

5135
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,790
to uh
feel a sense of uh ownership to the

5136
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:48,800
feel a sense of uh ownership to the
 

5137
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,629
feel a sense of uh ownership to the
decisions you make to the perceptions

5138
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:50,639
decisions you make to the perceptions
 

5139
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,149
decisions you make to the perceptions
you make to the model you're trying to

5140
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
you make to the model you're trying to
 

5141
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,629
you make to the model you're trying to
maintain like you own this thing

5142
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:54,639
maintain like you own this thing
 

5143
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:56,470
maintain like you own this thing
and it's the only one you got and if you

5144
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:56,480
and it's the only one you got and if you
 

5145
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,709
and it's the only one you got and if you
lose it it's gonna really suck and so

5146
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
lose it it's gonna really suck and so
 

5147
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,110
lose it it's gonna really suck and so
you should really send the brain some

5148
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
you should really send the brain some
 

5149
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,070
you should really send the brain some
signals about it

5150
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:04,080

01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,709

what ideas do you believe might be true

01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
what ideas do you believe might be true
 

5153
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,790
what ideas do you believe might be true
that most or at least many people

5154
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:08,800
that most or at least many people
 

5155
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,110
that most or at least many people
disagree with you with

01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
disagree with you with

disagree with you with
let's say in the space of machine

learning

5160
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:13,600
learning
 

5161
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,510
learning
well it depends who you talk about but

5162
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
well it depends who you talk about but
 

5163
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,790
well it depends who you talk about but

i think
 

5165
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,350
i think
so certainly there is uh

01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
so certainly there is uh
 

5167
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,790
so certainly there is uh
a bunch of people who are nativists

a bunch of people who are nativists
 

5169
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,310
a bunch of people who are nativists
right who think that a lot of the basic

01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:22,320
right who think that a lot of the basic
 

5171
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,430
right who think that a lot of the basic
things about the world are kind of

5172
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
things about the world are kind of
 

5173
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,310
things about the world are kind of
hardwired in our you know minds

5174
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
hardwired in our you know minds
 

5175
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,430
hardwired in our you know minds
things like you know the world is

01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
things like you know the world is
 

5177
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,030
things like you know the world is
three-dimensional for example is that

5178
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
three-dimensional for example is that
 

5179
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,070

5184
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
you know before the age of three months
 

5185
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,430
you know before the age of three months
or so or are we born with it and there

5186
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
or so or are we born with it and there
 

5187
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,350
or so or are we born with it and there
are you know very disa you know

5188
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
are you know very disa you know
 

5189
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,350
are you know very disa you know

cognitive scientists

5192
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
cognitive scientists
 

5193
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,390
cognitive scientists
for this

5194
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
for this
 

5195
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,590
for this
i think those things are actually very

5196
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,600
i think those things are actually very
 

5197
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,189
i think those things are actually very
simple to learn

5198
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
simple to learn
 

5199
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:49,990
simple to learn
um

5200
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
um
 

5201
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,149
um
you know is it the case that the

5202
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
you know is it the case that the
 

5203
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,229
you know is it the case that the
oriented edge detectors in v1 are

5204
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
oriented edge detectors in v1 are
 

5205
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,310
oriented edge detectors in v1 are
learned or are they hardwired i think

5206
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
learned or are they hardwired i think
 

5207
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,669
learned or are they hardwired i think
they are learned they might be learned

5208
01:24:57,669 --> 01:24:57,679
they are learned they might be learned
 

5209
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,510
they are learned they might be learned
before both because it's really easy to

5210
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,520
before both because it's really easy to
 

5211
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,510
before both because it's really easy to
generate signals from the retina that

5212
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
generate signals from the retina that
 

5213
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,990
generate signals from the retina that
actually will train edge detectors so

5214
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
actually will train edge detectors so
 

5215
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,830
actually will train edge detectors so
um and again those are

5216
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,840
um and again those are
 

5217
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,870
um and again those are
things that can be learned within

5218
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:06,880
things that can be learned within
 

5219
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,590
things that can be learned within
minutes of uh opening your eyes right i

5220
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:09,600
minutes of uh opening your eyes right i
 

5221
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,030
minutes of uh opening your eyes right i
mean

5222
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
mean
 

5223
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,350
mean
you know since the 1990s we have

5224
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
you know since the 1990s we have
 

5225
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,870
you know since the 1990s we have
algorithms that can learn oriented

5226
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:14,880
algorithms that can learn oriented
 

5227
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,030
algorithms that can learn oriented
detectors completely unsupervised with

5228
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
detectors completely unsupervised with
 

5229
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,709
detectors completely unsupervised with
the equivalent of a few minutes of real

5230
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:18,719
the equivalent of a few minutes of real
 

5231
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:19,750
the equivalent of a few minutes of real
time so

5232
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:19,760
time so
 

5233
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,830
time so
uh so those things have to be learned

5234
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
uh so those things have to be learned
 

5235
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,910
uh so those things have to be learned
um and there's also those you know mit

5236
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
um and there's also those you know mit
 

5237
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,669
um and there's also those you know mit
experiments where you kind of

5238
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
experiments where you kind of
 

5239
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:26,950
experiments where you kind of
plug the

5240
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
plug the
 

5241
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,950
plug the
optical nerve on the auditory cortex of

5242
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
optical nerve on the auditory cortex of
 

5243
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,790
optical nerve on the auditory cortex of
a baby ferret right and that auditory

5244
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
a baby ferret right and that auditory
 

5245
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,070
a baby ferret right and that auditory
cortex becomes a visual cortex

5246
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:32,080
cortex becomes a visual cortex
 

5247
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,270
cortex becomes a visual cortex
essentially

5248
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
essentially
 

5249
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,189
essentially
so you know clearly

5250
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:35,199
so you know clearly
 

5251
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,830
so you know clearly
there's running taking place there

5252
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
there's running taking place there
 

5253
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,310
there's running taking place there
so you know i think a lot of what people

5254
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:40,320
so you know i think a lot of what people
 

5255
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,830
so you know i think a lot of what people
think are so basic that they need to be

5256
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
think are so basic that they need to be
 

5257
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,030
think are so basic that they need to be
hardwired

5258
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
hardwired
 

5259
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,070
hardwired
i think a lot of those things are

5260
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:44,080
i think a lot of those things are
 

5261
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,669
i think a lot of those things are
learned because they are easy to learn

5262
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:45,679
learned because they are easy to learn
 

5263
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,750
learned because they are easy to learn
jesus so you put a lot of

5264
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
jesus so you put a lot of
 

5265
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,229
jesus so you put a lot of
value in the power of learning what kind

5266
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:50,239
value in the power of learning what kind
 

5267
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,149
value in the power of learning what kind
of things do you suspect might not be

5268
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
of things do you suspect might not be
 

5269
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,270
of things do you suspect might not be
learned

5270
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280
learned
 

5271
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,950
learned
is there something that could not be

5272
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:54,960
is there something that could not be
 

5273
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:55,910
is there something that could not be
learned

5274
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
learned
 

5275
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,030
learned
so your intrinsic drives are not learned

5276
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,040
so your intrinsic drives are not learned
 

5277
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,030
so your intrinsic drives are not learned
they they there are the things that you

5278
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
they they there are the things that you
 

5279
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,790
they they there are the things that you
know make humans uh

5280
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:02,800
know make humans uh
 

5281
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,189
know make humans uh
human or make you know

5282
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
human or make you know
 

5283
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,149
human or make you know
cats different from dogs right it's the

5284
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
cats different from dogs right it's the
 

5285
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,430
cats different from dogs right it's the
the basic drives that are kind of

5286
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,440
the basic drives that are kind of
 

5287
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,790
the basic drives that are kind of
hard-wired in our basal ganglia

5288
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:12,800
hard-wired in our basal ganglia
 

5289
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,910
hard-wired in our basal ganglia
i mean there are people who are working

5290
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
i mean there are people who are working
 

5291
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,189
i mean there are people who are working
on on this kind of stuff that's called

5292
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
on on this kind of stuff that's called
 

5293
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,709
on on this kind of stuff that's called
intrinsic motivation in the context of

5294
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:16,719
intrinsic motivation in the context of
 

5295
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,030
intrinsic motivation in the context of
reinforcement learning um so these are

5296
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
reinforcement learning um so these are
 

5297
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,550
reinforcement learning um so these are
objective functions where the reward

5298
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560
objective functions where the reward
 

5299
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,950
objective functions where the reward
doesn't come from the external world

5300
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
doesn't come from the external world
 

5301
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,709
doesn't come from the external world
it's computed by your own brain your own

5302
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:24,719
it's computed by your own brain your own
 

5303
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,470
it's computed by your own brain your own
brain computes

5304
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,480
brain computes
 

5305
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,070
brain computes
whether you're happy or not right it

5306
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:28,080
whether you're happy or not right it
 

5307
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,790
whether you're happy or not right it
measures your degree of uh

5308
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
measures your degree of uh
 

5309
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,350
measures your degree of uh
comfort or in comfort

5310
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:33,360

5311
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,070
comfort or in comfort
and

5312
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
and
 

5313
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,669
and
and because it's your brain computing

5314
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
and because it's your brain computing
 

5315
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,270
and because it's your brain computing
this presumably knows also how to

5316
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
this presumably knows also how to
 

5317
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,510
this presumably knows also how to
estimate gradients of this right so

5318
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
estimate gradients of this right so
 

5319
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,870
estimate gradients of this right so
um

5320
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
um
 

5321
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,430
um
so it's easier to to learn when your

5322
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,440
so it's easier to to learn when your
 

5323
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,950
so it's easier to to learn when your
objective is is intrinsic

5324
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
objective is is intrinsic
 

5325
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,910
objective is is intrinsic
so that has to be hardwired

5326
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:49,920
so that has to be hardwired
 

5327
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,270
so that has to be hardwired
the critic that makes long-term

5328
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
the critic that makes long-term

result of this that's learned
 

5335
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,669
result of this that's learned
and perception is learned and your model

5336
01:26:59,669 --> 01:26:59,679
and perception is learned and your model
 

5337
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,590
and perception is learned and your model
of the world is learned but let me take

5338
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:01,600
of the world is learned but let me take
 

5339
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,110
of the world is learned but let me take
take an example of you know why the

5340
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
take an example of you know why the
 

5341
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,350
take an example of you know why the
critic i mean example of how the critic

5342
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
critic i mean example of how the critic
 

5343
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,070
critic i mean example of how the critic
might be learned right if i uh if i come

5344
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
might be learned right if i uh if i come
 

5345
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,590
might be learned right if i uh if i come
to you um

5346
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
to you um
 

5347
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,590
to you um
you know i reach across the table and i

5348
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:11,600
you know i reach across the table and i
 

5349
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,910
you know i reach across the table and i
pinch your arm right complete surprise

5350
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
pinch your arm right complete surprise
 

5351
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,790
pinch your arm right complete surprise
for you

5352
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
for you
 

5353
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,229
for you
you would not have expected this i was

5354
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
you would not have expected this i was
 

5355
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:17,669
you would not have expected this i was
expecting that the whole time but yes

5356
01:27:17,669 --> 01:27:17,679
expecting that the whole time but yes
 

5357
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,350
expecting that the whole time but yes
right let's say for the sake of the

5358
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:19,360
right let's say for the sake of the
 

5359
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,030
right let's say for the sake of the
story yes

5360
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,040
story yes
 

5361
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,470
story yes
um okay your visual ganglia is going to

5362
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
um okay your visual ganglia is going to
 

5363
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,229
um okay your visual ganglia is going to
light up because it's going to hurt

5364
01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:26,239
light up because it's going to hurt
 

5365
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,310
light up because it's going to hurt
right

5366
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
right
 

5367
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,990
right
and now your model of the world includes

5368
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
and now your model of the world includes
 

5369
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,229
and now your model of the world includes

those kinds of things to think that it's

5558
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:36,800
those kinds of things to think that it's
 

5559
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,790
those kinds of things to think that it's
going to go on forever and you kind of

5560
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800
going to go on forever and you kind of
 

5561
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,870
going to go on forever and you kind of

know you're going to die yeah and it's
going to be sad but you don't really

5564
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:43,120
going to be sad but you don't really
 

5565
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,110
going to be sad but you don't really
understand that you're going to die and

01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:45,120
understand that you're going to die and
 

5567
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,790
understand that you're going to die and
so that's that's their idea and if i

5568
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:46,800
so that's that's their idea and if i
 

5569
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,470
so that's that's their idea and if i
find that compelling

5570
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
find that compelling
 

5571
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,430
find that compelling
because it does seem to be a core unique

5572
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:51,440
because it does seem to be a core unique
 

5573
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,830
because it does seem to be a core unique
aspect of human nature that we were able

5574
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
aspect of human nature that we were able
 

5575
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,830
aspect of human nature that we were able
to think that we're going we're able to

5576
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:55,840
to think that we're going we're able to
 

5577
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,270
to think that we're going we're able to
really understand

5578
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
really understand
 

5579
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,430
really understand
that this life is finite

5580
01:30:59,430 --> 01:30:59,440
that this life is finite
 

5581
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,950
that this life is finite
that seems important

5582
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
that seems important
 

5583
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,910
that seems important
there's a bunch of different things

5584
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
there's a bunch of different things
 

5585
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,189
there's a bunch of different things
there so first of all i don't think

5586
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:03,199
there so first of all i don't think
 

5587
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,550
there so first of all i don't think
there is a qualitative difference

5588
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:04,560
there is a qualitative difference
 

5589
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,350
there is a qualitative difference
between between us and cats in the term

5590
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,360
between between us and cats in the term
 

5591
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,950
between between us and cats in the term
i think the difference is that we just

5592
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:08,960
i think the difference is that we just
 

5593
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,510
i think the difference is that we just
have a better long-term

5594
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
have a better long-term
 

5595
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,950
have a better long-term
ability to

5596
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
ability to
 

5597
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,430
ability to
predict you know in the long term and so

5598
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:15,440
predict you know in the long term and so
 

5599
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,709
predict you know in the long term and so
we have a better understanding of how

5600
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:16,719
we have a better understanding of how
 

5601
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:17,830
we have a better understanding of how
the world works so we have better

5602
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:17,840
the world works so we have better
 

5603
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,750
the world works so we have better
understanding of you know finance of

5604
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
understanding of you know finance of
 

5605
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,430
understanding of you know finance of
life and things like that so we have a

5606
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
life and things like that so we have a
 

5607
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,310
life and things like that so we have a
better planning engine than cats yeah

5608
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:24,320
better planning engine than cats yeah
 

5609
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,750
better planning engine than cats yeah
okay um but what's the motivation for

5610
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
okay um but what's the motivation for
 

5611
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,430
okay um but what's the motivation for
for planning well i think it's just a

5612
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
for planning well i think it's just a
 

5613
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,790
for planning well i think it's just a
side effect of the fact that we have

5614
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:30,800
side effect of the fact that we have
 

5615
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,550
side effect of the fact that we have
just a better planning engine because it

5616
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:32,560
just a better planning engine because it
 

5617
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,189
just a better planning engine because it
makes us uh as i said you know the

5618
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
makes us uh as i said you know the
 

5619
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,790
makes us uh as i said you know the
essence of intelligence is the ability

5620
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
essence of intelligence is the ability
 

5621
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,189
essence of intelligence is the ability
to predict and so the because we're

5622
01:31:39,189 --> 01:31:39,199
to predict and so the because we're
 

5623
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:40,310
to predict and so the because we're
smarter

5624
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:40,320
smarter
 

5625
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,669
smarter
as a side effect we also have this

5626
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
as a side effect we also have this
 

5627
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,270
as a side effect we also have this
ability to kind of make predictions

5628
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
ability to kind of make predictions
 

5629
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,030
ability to kind of make predictions
about our own

5630
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:45,040
about our own
 

5631
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,310
about our own
future existence or lack thereof okay

5632
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:48,320
future existence or lack thereof okay
 

5633
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,629
future existence or lack thereof okay
you say religion helps with that i think

5634
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
you say religion helps with that i think
 

5635
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,790
you say religion helps with that i think
religion hurts actually

5636
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:52,800
religion hurts actually
 

5637
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,310
religion hurts actually

if you believe that you know
 

5645
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,790
if you believe that you know
you just don't exist after that so like

5646
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:00,800
you just don't exist after that so like
 

5647
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,830
you just don't exist after that so like
you know it solves completely the

5648

you know it solves completely the
 

5649
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,350
you know it solves completely the
problem at least you're saying if you

5650

life the consciousness the ego
is uh invested in this in this being and

5688
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
is uh invested in this in this being and
 

5689
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:47,510
is uh invested in this in this being and
then

5690
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,520
then
 

5691
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,910
then
science keeps bringing humanity down

5692
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:49,920
science keeps bringing humanity down
 

5693
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,350
science keeps bringing humanity down
from its pedestal

5694
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:51,360
from its pedestal
 

5695
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,149
from its pedestal
and yeah that's another another example

5696
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:54,159
and yeah that's another another example
 

5697
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,550
and yeah that's another another example
of it that's wonderful but for us

5698
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
of it that's wonderful but for us
 

5699
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,470
of it that's wonderful but for us
individual humans we don't like to be

5700
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:58,480
individual humans we don't like to be
 

5701
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,709
individual humans we don't like to be
brought down from a pedestal

5702
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:00,719
brought down from a pedestal
 

5703
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:01,590
brought down from a pedestal
like

5704
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:01,600
like
 

5705
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,990
like
but see you're fine with it because well

5706
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:04,000
but see you're fine with it because well
 

5707
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,510
but see you're fine with it because well
so what ernest becker would say is

5708
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
so what ernest becker would say is
 

5709
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,950
so what ernest becker would say is
you're fine with it because that's just

5710
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:06,960
you're fine with it because that's just
 

5711
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,550
you're fine with it because that's just
a more peaceful existence for you but

5712
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:08,560
a more peaceful existence for you but
 

5713
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,310
a more peaceful existence for you but
you're not really fine you're hiding

5714
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
you're not really fine you're hiding
 

5715
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,070
you're not really fine you're hiding
from in fact some of the people that

from in fact some of the people that
 

5717
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,149
from in fact some of the people that
experience the deepest trauma

5718
01:33:14,149 --> 01:33:14,159
experience the deepest trauma
 

5719
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,270
experience the deepest trauma
uh that

5720
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:15,280
uh that
 

5721

therapy will say i'm fine it's like when

5726
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
therapy will say i'm fine it's like when
 

5727
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,350
therapy will say i'm fine it's like when
you talk to people who are truly angry

5728
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:23,360
you talk to people who are truly angry
 

5729

how are you doing i'm fine
the question is what's going on

5732
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
the question is what's going on
 

5733
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,350
the question is what's going on
now i had a near death experience i had

5734
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:29,360
now i had a near death experience i had
 

5735
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,709
now i had a near death experience i had
a very bad uh motorbike accident when i

5736
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:32,719
a very bad uh motorbike accident when i
 

5737
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,870
a very bad uh motorbike accident when i
was 17. so

5738
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
was 17. so
 

5739
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,750
was 17. so
but that didn't have any impact on

5740
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:37,760
but that didn't have any impact on
 

5741
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,110
but that didn't have any impact on
my

5742
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
my
 

5743
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,870
my
reflection on that topic so i'm

5744
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
reflection on that topic so i'm
 

5745
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,229
reflection on that topic so i'm
basically just playing a bit of a

5746
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
basically just playing a bit of a
 

5747
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,310
basically just playing a bit of a
devil's advocate pushing back and

5748
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:44,320
devil's advocate pushing back and
 

5749
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,669
devil's advocate pushing back and
wondering

5750
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:45,679
wondering
 

5751
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,830
wondering
is it truly possible to accept death and

5752
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:47,840
is it truly possible to accept death and
 

5753
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,350
is it truly possible to accept death and
the flip side that's more interesting i

5754
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
the flip side that's more interesting i
 

5755
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,350
the flip side that's more interesting i
think for ai and

5756
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:51,360
think for ai and
 

5757
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,470
think for ai and
robotics is how important is it to have

5758
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
robotics is how important is it to have
 

5759
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,030
robotics is how important is it to have
this as one of the suite of motivations

5760
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
this as one of the suite of motivations
 

5761
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,350
this as one of the suite of motivations
is to

5762
01:33:59,350 --> 01:33:59,360
is to
 

5763
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,229
is to
not just avoid

5764
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
not just avoid
 

5765
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,669
not just avoid
falling off the roof or something like

5766
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
falling off the roof or something like
 

5767
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,270
falling off the roof or something like
that but

5768
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
that but
 

5769
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,870
that but
ponder

5770
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:06,880
ponder
 

5771
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,590
ponder
the

5772
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:07,600
the
 

5773
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,070
the
the end of the ride

5774
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,080
the end of the ride
 

5775
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,550
the end of the ride
if you listen to the stoics

5776
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:12,560
if you listen to the stoics
 

5777
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,709
if you listen to the stoics
it's uh it's a great motivator

5778
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
it's uh it's a great motivator
 

5779
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,070
it's uh it's a great motivator
it adds a sense of urgency so maybe to

5780
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
it adds a sense of urgency so maybe to
 

5781
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,430
it adds a sense of urgency so maybe to
truly fear death or be cognizant of it

5782
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
truly fear death or be cognizant of it
 

5783
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,189
truly fear death or be cognizant of it
might give

5784
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:23,199
might give
 

5785
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,669
might give
a deeper meaning and urgency to the

5786
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
a deeper meaning and urgency to the
 

5787
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,590
a deeper meaning and urgency to the
moment to live

5788
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
moment to live
 

5789
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,709
moment to live
fully

5790
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
fully
 

5791
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,470
fully
well

5792
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
well
 

5793
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,310
well
maybe i don't disagree with that uh i

5794
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,320
maybe i don't disagree with that uh i
 

5795
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,790
maybe i don't disagree with that uh i
mean i think what motivates me here is

5796
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:34,800
mean i think what motivates me here is
 

5797
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,629
mean i think what motivates me here is
uh

5798
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:36,639
uh
 

5799
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,310
uh
you know knowing more about about human

5800
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
you know knowing more about about human
 

5801
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,709
you know knowing more about about human
nature i mean i think uh human nature

5802
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:40,719
nature i mean i think uh human nature
 

5803
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,390
nature i mean i think uh human nature
and human intelligence is a big mystery

5804
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,400
and human intelligence is a big mystery
 

5805
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,390
and human intelligence is a big mystery
it's a scientific mystery

5806
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:44,400
it's a scientific mystery
 

5807
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,270
it's a scientific mystery
uh in addition to you know philosophical

5808
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
uh in addition to you know philosophical
 

5809
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,070
uh in addition to you know philosophical
and etc but you know i'm a true believer

5810
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,080
and etc but you know i'm a true believer
 

5811
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,510
and etc but you know i'm a true believer
in science so

5812
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:51,520
in science so
 

5813
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,109
in science so
um

5814
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:53,119
um
 

5815
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,070
um
and and and i do have kind of a belief

5816
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
and and and i do have kind of a belief
 

5817
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,070
and and and i do have kind of a belief
that for complex systems like like the

5818
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,080
that for complex systems like like the
 

5819
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,390
that for complex systems like like the
brain on the mind the the way to

5820
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
brain on the mind the the way to
 

5821
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,390
brain on the mind the the way to
understand it is try to reproduce it

5822
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:04,400
understand it is try to reproduce it
 

5823
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,950
understand it is try to reproduce it
with you know artifacts that you build

5824
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
with you know artifacts that you build
 

5825
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,709
with you know artifacts that you build
because you know what's essential to it

5826
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
because you know what's essential to it
 

5827
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,149
because you know what's essential to it
when you try to build it you know the

5828
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:10,159
when you try to build it you know the
 

5829
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,109
when you try to build it you know the
same way

5830
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
same way
 

5831
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,709
same way
i've used this analogy before with you i

5832
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
i've used this analogy before with you i
 

5833
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,669
i've used this analogy before with you i
believe um the same way we only started

5834
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
believe um the same way we only started
 

5835
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,350
believe um the same way we only started
to understand uh

5836
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
to understand uh
 

5837
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,709
to understand uh
aerodynamics when we started building

5838
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
aerodynamics when we started building
 

5839
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,310
aerodynamics when we started building
airplanes and that helped us understand

5840
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:20,320
airplanes and that helped us understand
 

5841
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,990
airplanes and that helped us understand
how birds fly

5842
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
how birds fly
 

5843
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,070
how birds fly
you know so i think there's kind of a

5844
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:24,080
you know so i think there's kind of a
 

5845
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,310
you know so i think there's kind of a
similar process here where

5846
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:26,320
similar process here where
 

5847
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,990
similar process here where
we don't have a theory of a full theory

5848
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
we don't have a theory of a full theory

01:36:59,430 --> 01:36:59,440
i'm just fine with it that's just the
 

5939
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,870
i'm just fine with it that's just the

reality of life
 

5941
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,030

um so i'm fine with that now you were

5942
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,040
um so i'm fine with that now you were
 

5943
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,270
um so i'm fine with that now you were
asking me about things that uh opinions

5944
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280
asking me about things that uh opinions
 

5945
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,870
asking me about things that uh opinions
i have that a lot of people may disagree

i have that a lot of people may disagree
 

5947

to have fear yes
when it predicts that the outcome is

6020
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
when it predicts that the outcome is
 

6021
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:17,990
when it predicts that the outcome is
gonna is gonna be bad

6022
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
gonna is gonna be bad
 

6023
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,070
gonna is gonna be bad
and and something to avoid is gonna have

6024
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:20,080
and and something to avoid is gonna have
 

6025
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,590
and and something to avoid is gonna have
elation when it predicts it's gonna be

6026
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:21,600
elation when it predicts it's gonna be
 

6027
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,790
elation when it predicts it's gonna be
good

6028
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
good
 

6029
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,149
good
um uh if it has drives to

6030
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:26,159
um uh if it has drives to
 

6031
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:28,790
um uh if it has drives to
relate with humans um you know in some

6032
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:28,800
relate with humans um you know in some
 

6033
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,109
relate with humans um you know in some
ways the way humans have

6034
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:31,119
ways the way humans have
 

6035
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:32,229
ways the way humans have
um

6036
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
um
 

6037
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,310
um
you know it's it's gonna be social right

6038
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,320
you know it's it's gonna be social right
 

6039
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,629
you know it's it's gonna be social right
and so it's gonna have emotions about

6040
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:36,639
and so it's gonna have emotions about
 

6041
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,550
and so it's gonna have emotions about
attachment and and things of that type

6042
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
attachment and and things of that type
 

6043
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,350
attachment and and things of that type
so

6044
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
so
 

6045
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,750
so
um so i think uh you know the the sort

6046
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
um so i think uh you know the the sort
 

6047
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,709
um so i think uh you know the the sort
of

6048
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:42,719
of
 

6049
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,229
of
sci-fi

6050
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:44,239
sci-fi
 

6051
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,229
sci-fi
thing where you know you see commander

6052
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:46,239
thing where you know you see commander
 

6053
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:47,910
thing where you know you see commander
data like having an emotion chip that

6054
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:47,920
data like having an emotion chip that
 

6055
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,910
data like having an emotion chip that
you can turn off right

6056
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:49,920
you can turn off right
 

6057
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,590
you can turn off right
i think that's ridiculous

6058
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
i think that's ridiculous
 

6059
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,270
i think that's ridiculous
so i mean here's the difficult

6060
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
so i mean here's the difficult
 

6061
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,189
so i mean here's the difficult
philosophical

6062
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199

social question
 

6065
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,830
social question
do you think there will be a time

6066
01:38:59,830 --> 01:38:59,840
do you think there will be a time
 

6067
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,310
do you think there will be a time
like a civil rights movement for robots

6068
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
like a civil rights movement for robots
 

6069
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,510
like a civil rights movement for robots
where

6070
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
where
 

6071
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,510
where
um okay forget the movement but a

6072
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
um okay forget the movement but a
 

6073
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,669
um okay forget the movement but a
discussion like the supreme court

6074
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679

 

6075
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,870

that particular kinds of robots

6076
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:12,880
that particular kinds of robots
 

6077
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,510
that particular kinds of robots
you know particular kinds of systems

6078
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,520
you know particular kinds of systems
 

6079
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,229
you know particular kinds of systems
um deserve the same rights as humans

6080
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:18,239
um deserve the same rights as humans
 

6081
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,229
um deserve the same rights as humans
because they can suffer

6082
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
because they can suffer
 

6083
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,790
because they can suffer
just as humans can

6084
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:22,800
just as humans can
 

6085
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,830
just as humans can
all those kinds of things

6086
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:24,840
all those kinds of things
 

6087
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,750
all those kinds of things
well perhaps perhaps not like imagine

6088
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
well perhaps perhaps not like imagine
 

6089
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,189
well perhaps perhaps not like imagine
that humans were

6090
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
that humans were
 

6091
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,830

our ideas of rights will change in that

6102
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
our ideas of rights will change in that
 

6103
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,030
our ideas of rights will change in that

case
 

6105
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,750

there's always a backup you could always

restore maybe like the importance of

6110
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
restore maybe like the importance of

murder will go down one notch that's

6112
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,000
murder will go down one notch that's
 

6113
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,070
murder will go down one notch that's
right but also the uh

6114
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:54,080
right but also the uh
 

6115
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,750
right but also the uh
your your

6116
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760
your your
 

6117
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,430
your your
you know desire to do dangerous things

6118
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440
you know desire to do dangerous things
 

6119
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,030
you know desire to do dangerous things
like you know

6120
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
like you know
 

6121
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:03,189
like you know
you know doing skydiving or or you know

6122
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:03,199
you know doing skydiving or or you know
 

6123
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,669
you know doing skydiving or or you know
or or you know race car driving

6124
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:05,679
or or you know race car driving
 

6125
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:06,870
or or you know race car driving
you know car racing all that kind of

6126
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
you know car racing all that kind of
 

6127
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,270
you know car racing all that kind of
stuff you know would probably increase

6128
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,280
stuff you know would probably increase
 

6129
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,109
stuff you know would probably increase
or or you know airplane aerobatics or

6130
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:11,119
or or you know airplane aerobatics or
 

6131
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:12,629
or or you know airplane aerobatics or
that kind of stuff right yeah it would

6132
01:40:12,629 --> 01:40:12,639
that kind of stuff right yeah it would
 

6133
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,310
that kind of stuff right yeah it would
be fine to do a lot of those things or

6134
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
be fine to do a lot of those things or
 

6135
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,270
be fine to do a lot of those things or
explore

6136
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280
explore
 

6137
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,030
explore
you know dangerous areas and things like

6138
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,040
you know dangerous areas and things like
 

6139
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,470
you know dangerous areas and things like
that it would kind of change your

6140
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
that it would kind of change your
 

6141
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,910
that it would kind of change your
relationship so

6142
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:19,920
relationship so
 

6143
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,590
relationship so
now it's very likely that robots would

6144
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
now it's very likely that robots would
 

6145
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,189
now it's very likely that robots would
be like that because you know they'll be

6146
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:25,199
be like that because you know they'll be
 

6147
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,109
be like that because you know they'll be
based on perhaps technology that is

6148
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:27,119
based on perhaps technology that is
 

6149
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:29,189
based on perhaps technology that is
somewhat similar to

6150
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:29,199
somewhat similar to
 

6151
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,709
somewhat similar to
today's technology and you can you can

6152
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:30,719
today's technology and you can you can
 

6153
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,149
today's technology and you can you can
always have a backup

6154
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
always have a backup
 

6155
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,390
always have a backup
so it's possible

6156
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:34,400
so it's possible
 

6157
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,669
so it's possible
i don't know if you like video games but

6158
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:35,679
i don't know if you like video games but
 

6159
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:38,229
i don't know if you like video games but
there's a there's a game called diablo

6160
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:38,239
there's a there's a game called diablo
 

6161
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,270

this yes uh
and in fact they made a game that's

6166
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,520
and in fact they made a game that's
 

6167
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,950
and in fact they made a game that's
inspired by it

6168
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:46,960
inspired by it
 

6169
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,750
inspired by it
awesome

6170
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
awesome
 

6171
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,629
awesome
like built a game my three sons have a

6172
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:50,639
like built a game my three sons have a
 

6173
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,470
like built a game my three sons have a
game design studio between them yeah

6174
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
game design studio between them yeah
 

6175
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,990
game design studio between them yeah
that's awesome they came out with a game

6176
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
that's awesome they came out with a game
 

6177

that's awesome they came out with a game
like it just came out nice again last

6178
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
like it just came out nice again last
 

6179
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,270
like it just came out nice again last
year no this was last year earlier about

6180
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:57,280
year no this was last year earlier about
 

6181
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,350
year no this was last year earlier about
a year ago that's awesome but so in

6182
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,360
a year ago that's awesome but so in
 

6183
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,870
a year ago that's awesome but so in
diablo there's a something called

6184
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:00,880
diablo there's a something called
 

6185
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,510
diablo there's a something called
hardcore mode which if you die there's

6186
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:03,520
hardcore mode which if you die there's
 

6187
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,629
hardcore mode which if you die there's
no

6188
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
no
 

6189
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,669
no
you're gone right that's it and so it's

6190
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:07,679
you're gone right that's it and so it's
 

6191
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,550
you're gone right that's it and so it's
possible with ai systems

6192
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,560
possible with ai systems
 

6193
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,470
possible with ai systems
for them to be able to operate

6194
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:12,480
for them to be able to operate
 

6195
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,629
for them to be able to operate
successfully and for us to treat them in

6196
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:14,639
successfully and for us to treat them in
 

6197
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,229
successfully and for us to treat them in
a certain way because they have to be

6198
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:16,239
a certain way because they have to be
 

6199
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,390
a certain way because they have to be
integrated in human society

6200
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
integrated in human society
 

6201
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,109
integrated in human society
they have to be able to die no copies

6202
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119
they have to be able to die no copies
 

6203
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,830
they have to be able to die no copies
allowed in fact copying is illegal it's

6204
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:23,840
allowed in fact copying is illegal it's
 

6205
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,350
allowed in fact copying is illegal it's
possible with humans as well like

6206
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:25,360
possible with humans as well like
 

6207
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,430
possible with humans as well like
cloning will be illegal even what's

6208
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
cloning will be illegal even what's
 

6209
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,550
cloning will be illegal even what's
possible because

6210
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:28,560
possible because
 

6211
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,149
possible because
cloning is not copying right i mean you

6212
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:30,159
cloning is not copying right i mean you
 

6213
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:31,910
cloning is not copying right i mean you
don't reproduce the

6214
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:31,920
don't reproduce the
 

6215
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,270
don't reproduce the
the mind of the person and like

6216
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:33,280
the mind of the person and like
 

6217
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,510
the mind of the person and like
experience right it's just a delay twin

6218
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
experience right it's just a delay twin
 

6219
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,229
experience right it's just a delay twin
so

6220
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
so
 

6221
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,229
so
but then it's what we were talking about

6222
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:38,239
but then it's what we were talking about
 

6223
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:39,830
but then it's what we were talking about
with computers that you'll be able to

6224
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:39,840
with computers that you'll be able to
 

6225
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,350
with computers that you'll be able to
copy you right you'll be able to

6226
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:41,360
copy you right you'll be able to
 

6227
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,510
copy you right you'll be able to
perfectly save pickle

6228
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:43,520
perfectly save pickle
 

6229
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,030
perfectly save pickle
the the

6230
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:45,040
the the
 

6231
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,430
the the
the mind state and

6232
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:47,440
the mind state and
 

6233
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,510
the mind state and
it's possible that that would be illegal

6234
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:49,520
it's possible that that would be illegal
 

6235
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,709
it's possible that that would be illegal
because

6236
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
because
 

6237
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,350
because
that goes against um

6238
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:53,360
that goes against um
 

6239
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,870
that goes against um
that will destroy the motivations of the

6240
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:54,880
that will destroy the motivations of the
 

6241
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,830
that will destroy the motivations of the
system

6242
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
system
 

6243
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,830
system
okay so let's say you you have a

6244
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
okay so let's say you you have a
 

6245
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,709
okay so let's say you you have a
domestic robot okay sometime in the

6246
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:00,719
domestic robot okay sometime in the
 

6247
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,310
domestic robot okay sometime in the
future yes

6248
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:02,320
future yes
 

6249
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,030
future yes
and uh the domestic robot you know comes

6250
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,040
and uh the domestic robot you know comes
 

6251
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,030
and uh the domestic robot you know comes
to you kind of somewhat pre-trained you

6252
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040
to you kind of somewhat pre-trained you
 

6253
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,870
to you kind of somewhat pre-trained you
know it can do a bunch of things yes but

6254
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:08,880
know it can do a bunch of things yes but
 

6255
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,550
know it can do a bunch of things yes but
it has a particular personality that

6256
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:10,560
it has a particular personality that
 

6257
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,590
it has a particular personality that
makes it slightly different from the

6258
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:11,600
makes it slightly different from the
 

6259
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,109
makes it slightly different from the
other robots because that makes them

6260
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:13,119
other robots because that makes them
 

6261
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,189
other robots because that makes them
more interesting and then because it's

6262
01:42:15,189 --> 01:42:15,199
more interesting and then because it's
 

6263
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,030
more interesting and then because it's
you know it's live with you for five

6264
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
you know it's live with you for five
 

6265
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,870
you know it's live with you for five
years you've you've grown some

6266
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:18,880
years you've you've grown some
 

6267
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,470
years you've you've grown some
attachment to it and vice versa and it's

6268
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:22,480
attachment to it and vice versa and it's
 

6269
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,070
attachment to it and vice versa and it's
learned a lot about you

6270
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,080
learned a lot about you
 

6271
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,750
learned a lot about you
or maybe it's not a household robot

6272
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
or maybe it's not a household robot
 

6273
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,750
or maybe it's not a household robot
maybe it's uh maybe it's a virtual

6274
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:27,760
maybe it's uh maybe it's a virtual
 

6275
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,590
maybe it's uh maybe it's a virtual
assistant that lives in your you know

6276
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:29,600
assistant that lives in your you know
 

6277
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,350
assistant that lives in your you know
augmented reality glasses or whatever

6278
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,360
augmented reality glasses or whatever
 

6279
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,149
augmented reality glasses or whatever
right

6280
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,159
right
 

6281
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,470
right
uh you know the horror movie type thing

6282
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:34,480
uh you know the horror movie type thing
 

6283
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,270
uh you know the horror movie type thing
right

6284
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
right
 

6285
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,550
right
um

6286
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
um
 

6287
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,510
um
and that system to some extent

6288
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:39,520
and that system to some extent
 

6289
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,550
and that system to some extent
the the

6290
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,560
the the
 

6291
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,390
the the
intelligence in that system

6292
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:42,400
intelligence in that system
 

6293
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,390
intelligence in that system
is a bit like your child or maybe your

6294
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:44,400
is a bit like your child or maybe your
 

6295
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,950
is a bit like your child or maybe your
phd student in a sense that

6296
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:46,960
phd student in a sense that
 

6297
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,790
phd student in a sense that
there's a lot of you in that in that

6298
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
there's a lot of you in that in that
 

6299
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,030
there's a lot of you in that in that
machine now right yeah and so

6300
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
machine now right yeah and so
 

6301
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,510
machine now right yeah and so
if it were a living thing

6302
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:53,520
if it were a living thing
 

6303
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,870
if it were a living thing
you would do this

6304
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:54,880
you would do this
 

6305
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,870
you would do this
for free if you want right if it's your

6306
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
for free if you want right if it's your
 

6307
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,750
for free if you want right if it's your
child your child can you know then

6308
01:42:59,750 --> 01:42:59,760
child your child can you know then
 

6309
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,070
child your child can you know then
live his or her own life and you know

6310
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
live his or her own life and you know
 

6311
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,830
live his or her own life and you know
the fact that they learn stuff from you

6312
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
the fact that they learn stuff from you
 

6313
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,350
the fact that they learn stuff from you
doesn't mean that you have any ownership

6314
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360
doesn't mean that you have any ownership
 

6315
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,070
doesn't mean that you have any ownership
of it right yeah but if it's a robot

6316
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:08,080
of it right yeah but if it's a robot
 

6317
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,310
of it right yeah but if it's a robot
that you've trained perhaps you have

6318
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:10,320
that you've trained perhaps you have
 

6319
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,430
that you've trained perhaps you have
some uh yeah intellectual property claim

6320
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:13,440
some uh yeah intellectual property claim
 

6321
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,430
some uh yeah intellectual property claim
about intellectual property oh i thought

6322
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,440
about intellectual property oh i thought
 

6323
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,310
about intellectual property oh i thought
you meant like uh permanent value in the

6324
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,320
you meant like uh permanent value in the
 

6325
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,149
you meant like uh permanent value in the
sense this part of you is in well there

6326
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
sense this part of you is in well there
 

6327
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,990
sense this part of you is in well there
is permanent value right so you would

6328
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,000
is permanent value right so you would
 

6329
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,070
is permanent value right so you would
lose a lot if that robot were to be

6330
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,080
lose a lot if that robot were to be
 

6331
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,669
lose a lot if that robot were to be
destroyed and you you had no backup you

6332
01:43:25,669 --> 01:43:25,679
destroyed and you you had no backup you
 

6333
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,189
destroyed and you you had no backup you
would lose a lot you know you a lot of

6334
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
would lose a lot you know you a lot of
 

6335
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,350
would lose a lot you know you a lot of
investment you know kind of like a

6336
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:29,360
investment you know kind of like a
 

6337
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,669
investment you know kind of like a
uh you know a person dying you know um

6338
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:31,679
uh you know a person dying you know um
 

6339
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,750
uh you know a person dying you know um
that that a friend of a friend of you

6340
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760
that that a friend of a friend of you
 

6341
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,910
that that a friend of a friend of you
was dying or or a co-worker or something

6342
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
was dying or or a co-worker or something
 

6343
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,390
was dying or or a co-worker or something
like that um

6344
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
like that um
 

6345
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,629
like that um
but also uh you have like

6346
01:43:40,629 --> 01:43:40,639
but also uh you have like
 

6347
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,470
but also uh you have like
intellectual property rights in the

6348
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:42,480
intellectual property rights in the
 

6349
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,310
intellectual property rights in the
sense that that

6350
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:44,320
sense that that
 

6351
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,149
sense that that
that system is fine-tuned to your

6352
01:43:46,149 --> 01:43:46,159
that system is fine-tuned to your
 

6353
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,070
that system is fine-tuned to your
particular existence so that's now a

6354
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,080
particular existence so that's now a
 

6355
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,550
particular existence so that's now a
very unique instantiation of that

6356
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
very unique instantiation of that
 

6357
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,229
very unique instantiation of that
original background model whatever it

6358
01:43:52,229 --> 01:43:52,239
original background model whatever it
 

6359
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,070
original background model whatever it
was that arrived

6360
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
was that arrived
 

6361
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,350
was that arrived
and then there are issues of privacy

6362
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,360
and then there are issues of privacy
 

6363
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,790
and then there are issues of privacy
right because now

6364
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:56,800
right because now
 

6365
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,830
right because now
imagine that that robot has its own kind

6366
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
imagine that that robot has its own kind
 

6367
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,590
imagine that that robot has its own kind
of volition and decides to work from

6368
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:01,600
of volition and decides to work from
 

6369
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,750
of volition and decides to work from
someone else yes or kind of you know

6370
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:03,760
someone else yes or kind of you know
 

6371
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,189
someone else yes or kind of you know
thinks

6372
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:05,199
thinks
 

6373
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,189
thinks
life with you is sort of untenable or

6374
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:07,199
life with you is sort of untenable or
 

6375
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,510
life with you is sort of untenable or
whatever right um

6376
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:09,520
whatever right um
 

6377
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,669
whatever right um
now all the things that that system

6378
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
now all the things that that system
 

6379
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,590
now all the things that that system
learned from you

6380
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
learned from you
 

6381
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,550
learned from you
uh

6382
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:14,560
uh
 

6383
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,830
uh
you know how

6384
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:15,840
you know how
 

6385
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,189
you know how
can you like you know delete all the

6386
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:17,199
can you like you know delete all the
 

6387
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,470
can you like you know delete all the
personal information that that system

6388
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
personal information that that system
 

6389
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,470
personal information that that system
knows about you yeah

6390
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:20,480
knows about you yeah
 

6391
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,750
knows about you yeah
i mean that would be kind of an ethical

6392
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:21,760
i mean that would be kind of an ethical
 

6393
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,149
i mean that would be kind of an ethical
question like you know can you erase the

6394
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:24,159
question like you know can you erase the
 

6395
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:27,350
question like you know can you erase the
the mind of a of a intelligent robot

6396
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
the mind of a of a intelligent robot
 

6397
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,990
the mind of a of a intelligent robot
uh to protect your your privacy yeah you

6398
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,000
uh to protect your your privacy yeah you
 

6399
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,750
uh to protect your your privacy yeah you
can't do this with humans you can ask

6400
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:31,760
can't do this with humans you can ask
 

6401
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,550
can't do this with humans you can ask
them to shut up but that you don't have

6402
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
them to shut up but that you don't have
 

6403
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,149
them to shut up but that you don't have
complete power over them can't erase

6404
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
complete power over them can't erase
 

6405
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,590
complete power over them can't erase
humans yeah it's the problem with

6406
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:37,600
humans yeah it's the problem with
 

6407
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,990
humans yeah it's the problem with
relationships you know that you break up

6408
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,000
relationships you know that you break up
 

6409
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,510
relationships you know that you break up
you can't you can't erase the other

6410
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520
you can't you can't erase the other
 

6411
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,390
you can't you can't erase the other
human

6412
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:42,400
human
 

6413
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,310
human
with robots i think it'll have to be the

6414
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
with robots i think it'll have to be the
 

6415
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,950
with robots i think it'll have to be the
same thing with robots that that risk

6416
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:46,960
same thing with robots that that risk
 

6417
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,070
same thing with robots that that risk
that there has to be um

6418
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,080
that there has to be um
 

6419
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,830
that there has to be um
some

6420
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
some
 

6421
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,830
some
risk to our interactions to truly

6422
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:53,840
risk to our interactions to truly
 

6423
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,709
risk to our interactions to truly
experience them deeply it feels like so

6424
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:56,719
experience them deeply it feels like so
 

6425
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,470
experience them deeply it feels like so
you have to be able to lose your robot

6426
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:58,480
you have to be able to lose your robot
 

6427
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,510
you have to be able to lose your robot
friend

6428
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,520
friend
 

6429
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,510
friend
and that robot friend to go tweeting

6430
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
and that robot friend to go tweeting
 

6431
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,149
and that robot friend to go tweeting
about how much of an you are but

6432
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:04,159
about how much of an you are but
 

6433
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,390
about how much of an you are but
then are you allowed to you know murder

6434
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:06,400
then are you allowed to you know murder
 

6435
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,070
then are you allowed to you know murder
the robot to protect your private

6436
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:08,080
the robot to protect your private
 

6437
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,510
the robot to protect your private
information yeah probably decides to

6438
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:09,520
information yeah probably decides to
 

6439
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,070
information yeah probably decides to
leave i have the situation that for

6440
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
leave i have the situation that for
 

6441
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,390
leave i have the situation that for
robots with with certain

6442
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
robots with with certain
 

6443
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,870
robots with with certain
like it's almost like uh regulation if

6444
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:16,880
like it's almost like uh regulation if
 

6445
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,030
like it's almost like uh regulation if
you declare your robot to be

6446
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:19,040
you declare your robot to be
 

6447
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,629
you declare your robot to be
let's call it sentient or something like

6448
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
let's call it sentient or something like
 

6449
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,870
let's call it sentient or something like
that like this this robot is designed

6450
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:22,880
that like this this robot is designed
 

6451
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,550
that like this this robot is designed
for human interaction then you're not

6452
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,560
for human interaction then you're not
 

6453
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,149
for human interaction then you're not
allowed to murder these robots it's the

6454
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
allowed to murder these robots it's the
 

6455
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,470
allowed to murder these robots it's the
same as murdering other humans well but

6456
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:28,480
same as murdering other humans well but
 

6457
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,070
same as murdering other humans well but
what about you do a backup of the robot

6458
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:30,080
what about you do a backup of the robot
 

6459
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,149
what about you do a backup of the robot
you do preserve on the on on a hard

6460
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:32,159
you do preserve on the on on a hard
 

6461
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,669
you do preserve on the on on a hard
drive or the equivalent in the future

6462
01:45:33,669 --> 01:45:33,679
drive or the equivalent in the future
 

6463
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,109
drive or the equivalent in the future
that might be illegal just like it's

6464
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:35,119
that might be illegal just like it's
 

6465
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:36,149
that might be illegal just like it's
like

6466
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:36,159
like
 

6467
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,229
like
priority uh piracy is illegal but it's

6468
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:38,239
priority uh piracy is illegal but it's
 

6469
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,910
priority uh piracy is illegal but it's
your own it's your own robot right but

6470
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:39,920
your own it's your own robot right but
 

6471
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,990
your own it's your own robot right but
you can't you don't but then but then

6472
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,000
you can't you don't but then but then
 

6473
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,390
you can't you don't but then but then
you can wipe out

6474
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
you can wipe out
 

6475
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,229
you can wipe out
his brain so the this robot doesn't know

6476
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
his brain so the this robot doesn't know
 

6477
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,070
his brain so the this robot doesn't know
anything about you anymore but you still

6478
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:48,080
anything about you anymore but you still
 

6479
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,870
anything about you anymore but you still
have

6480
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:48,880
have
 

6481
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,470
have
technically a certain existence because

6482
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:50,480
technically a certain existence because
 

6483
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,229
technically a certain existence because
you backed it up and then there'll be

6484
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:52,239
you backed it up and then there'll be
 

6485
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:54,070
you backed it up and then there'll be
these great speeches at the supreme

6486
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:54,080
these great speeches at the supreme
 

6487
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,550
these great speeches at the supreme
court by saying oh sure you can erase

6488
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:56,560
court by saying oh sure you can erase
 

6489
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,310
court by saying oh sure you can erase
the mind of the robot just like you can

6490
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,320
the mind of the robot just like you can
 

6491
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,629
the mind of the robot just like you can
erase the mind of a human we both can

6492
01:46:00,629 --> 01:46:00,639
erase the mind of a human we both can
 

6493
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,550
erase the mind of a human we both can
suffer there'll be some epic like obama

6494
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:02,560
suffer there'll be some epic like obama
 

6495
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,510
suffer there'll be some epic like obama
type character with a speech that we we

6496

6497
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,350
type character with a speech that we we
like the robots and the humans are the

6498
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:07,360
like the robots and the humans are the
 

6499
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,629
like the robots and the humans are the
same

6500
01:46:08,629 --> 01:46:08,639
same
 

6501
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,189
same
we can both suffer we can both hope

6502
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
we can both suffer we can both hope
 

6503
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:12,709
we can both suffer we can both hope
we can both

6504
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
we can both
 

6505
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,790
we can both
all those all those kinds of things

6506
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
all those all those kinds of things
 

6507
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,109
all those all those kinds of things
raise families all that kind of stuff

6508
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:17,119
raise families all that kind of stuff
 

6509
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,430
raise families all that kind of stuff
it's it's uh interesting for these just

6510
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:19,440
it's it's uh interesting for these just
 

6511
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,030
it's it's uh interesting for these just
like you said emotion seems to be a

6512
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,040
like you said emotion seems to be a
 

6513
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,870
like you said emotion seems to be a
fascinatingly powerful aspect of human

6514
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:24,880
fascinatingly powerful aspect of human
 

6515
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,310
fascinatingly powerful aspect of human
human interaction human robot

6516
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:26,320
human interaction human robot
 

6517
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,310
human interaction human robot
interaction and if they're able to

6518
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:28,320
interaction and if they're able to
 

6519
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,310
interaction and if they're able to
exhibit emotions

6520
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,320
exhibit emotions
 

6521
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,229
exhibit emotions
at the end of the day that's probably

6522
01:46:32,229 --> 01:46:32,239
at the end of the day that's probably
 

6523
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:33,510
at the end of the day that's probably
going to

6524
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:33,520
going to
 

6525
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,830
going to
have us deeply consider

6526
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:35,840
have us deeply consider
 

6527
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,910
have us deeply consider
human rights like what we value in

6528
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:37,920
human rights like what we value in
 

6529
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,229
human rights like what we value in
humans what we value in other animals

6530
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239
humans what we value in other animals
 

6531
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,149
humans what we value in other animals
that's why robots and ai is great it

6532
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:42,159
that's why robots and ai is great it
 

6533
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,149
that's why robots and ai is great it
makes us ask uh really good questions

6534
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:44,159
makes us ask uh really good questions
 

6535
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:46,070
makes us ask uh really good questions
the hard questions yeah but

6536
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
the hard questions yeah but
 

6537
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,750
the hard questions yeah but
you ask about you asked about the

6538
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:47,760
you ask about you asked about the
 

6539
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,590
you ask about you asked about the
chinese room type argument you know is

6540
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,600
chinese room type argument you know is
 

6541
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,590
chinese room type argument you know is
it real if it looks real yeah i think

6542
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:51,600
it real if it looks real yeah i think
 

6543
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,109
it real if it looks real yeah i think
the chinese room argument is the

6544
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:53,119
the chinese room argument is the
 

6545
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,030
the chinese room argument is the
ridiculous one so

6546
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:55,040
ridiculous one so
 

6547
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,629
ridiculous one so
so so for people who don't know chinese

6548
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:56,639
so so for people who don't know chinese
 

6549
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:57,669
so so for people who don't know chinese
room is

6550
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,679
room is
 

6551
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,830
room is
uh you ca you can i don't even know how

6552
01:46:59,830 --> 01:46:59,840
uh you ca you can i don't even know how
 

6553
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,390
uh you ca you can i don't even know how
to formulate it well but basically

6554
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:02,400
to formulate it well but basically
 

6555
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,870
to formulate it well but basically
you can mimic the behavior of an

6556
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:04,880
you can mimic the behavior of an
 

6557
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,790
you can mimic the behavior of an
intelligent system by just following a

6558
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:06,800
intelligent system by just following a
 

6559
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,149
intelligent system by just following a
giant algorithm code book that tells you

6560
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
giant algorithm code book that tells you
 

6561
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,470
giant algorithm code book that tells you
exactly how to respond in exactly each

6562
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
exactly how to respond in exactly each
 

6563
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,709
exactly how to respond in exactly each
case but is that really intelligent it's

6564
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:14,719
case but is that really intelligent it's
 

6565
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,709
case but is that really intelligent it's
like a giant lookup table when this

6566
01:47:16,709 --> 01:47:16,719
like a giant lookup table when this
 

6567
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:18,550
like a giant lookup table when this
person says this you answer this when

6568
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:18,560
person says this you answer this when
 

6569
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,950
person says this you answer this when
this person says this you answer this

6570
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:20,960
this person says this you answer this
 

6571
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,629
this person says this you answer this
and

6572
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:22,639
and
 

6573
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,229
and
if you understand how that works you

6574
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:24,239
if you understand how that works you
 

6575
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,390
if you understand how that works you
have this giant nearly infinite lookup

6576
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
have this giant nearly infinite lookup
 

6577
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,470
have this giant nearly infinite lookup
table is that really intelligence

6578
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,480
table is that really intelligence
 

6579
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,390
table is that really intelligence
because intelligence seems to be

6580
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,400
because intelligence seems to be
 

6581
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,629
because intelligence seems to be
a mechanism that's much more interesting

6582
01:47:32,629 --> 01:47:32,639
a mechanism that's much more interesting
 

6583
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,550
a mechanism that's much more interesting
and complex than this lookup table i

6584
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:34,560
and complex than this lookup table i
 

6585
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,030
and complex than this lookup table i
don't think so so the i mean the real

6586
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:37,040
don't think so so the i mean the real
 

6587
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,790
don't think so so the i mean the real
question comes down to

6588
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
question comes down to
 

6589
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,990
question comes down to
do you think

6590
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
do you think
 

6591
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,350
do you think
uh

6592
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:41,360
uh
 

6593
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,189
uh
you know you can you can mechanize uh

6594
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
you know you can you can mechanize uh
 

6595
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,109
you know you can you can mechanize uh
intelligence in some way even if that

6596
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:45,119
intelligence in some way even if that
 

6597
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:47,350
intelligence in some way even if that
involves uh learning

6598
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,360
involves uh learning
 

6599
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,270
involves uh learning
and the answer is of course yes there's

6600
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
and the answer is of course yes there's
 

6601
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,550
and the answer is of course yes there's
no question

6602
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:50,560
no question
 

6603
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,950
no question
there's a second question then which is

6604
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
there's a second question then which is
 

6605
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,590
there's a second question then which is
uh assuming you can uh reproduce

6606
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,600
uh assuming you can uh reproduce
 

6607
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,350
uh assuming you can uh reproduce
intelligence in sort of different

6608
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:57,360
intelligence in sort of different
 

6609
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,270
intelligence in sort of different
hardware than biological hardware you

01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,280
hardware than biological hardware you
 

6611
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,950
hardware than biological hardware you
know like computers

uh
 

6615
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,350
uh
can you

can you
 

6617
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,709
can you
you know

6618
01:48:04,709 --> 01:48:04,719
you know
 

6619
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:08,310
you know
match uh human intelligence in

6620
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:08,320
match uh human intelligence in
 

6621
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,470
match uh human intelligence in
all the domains in which

humans are intelligent
 

6625
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,790
humans are intelligent
is it possible right so that's the

6626
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:14,800
is it possible right so that's the
 

6627
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,430
is it possible right so that's the

intelligent than humans in all domains
 

6641

for tomorrow it's going to take a long
 

6645
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,629
for tomorrow it's going to take a long
time regardless of what you know

this is a lot a lot harder than many of

6650
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:40,560
this is a lot a lot harder than many of
 

6651
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,189
this is a lot a lot harder than many of
many of those guys think it is

6652
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:43,199
many of those guys think it is
 

6653
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,629
many of those guys think it is
and many of those guys who thought it

6654
01:48:44,629 --> 01:48:44,639
and many of those guys who thought it
 

6655
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,550
and many of those guys who thought it
was simpler than that years you know

6656
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:46,560
was simpler than that years you know
 

6657
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,229
was simpler than that years you know
five years ago now i think it's hard

6658
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:48,239

urgency because you know you have to

6684
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:13,520
urgency because you know you have to
 

6685
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,109
urgency because you know you have to

order to accomplish it and there's of
 

6689
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,870
order to accomplish it and there's of
course a flip side to that coin but it's

6690
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
course a flip side to that coin but it's
 

6691
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,990
course a flip side to that coin but it's
it's a weird

6692
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:20,000
it's a weird
 

6693

it's a weird
you can't be too cynical if you want to

6694
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:21,520
you can't be too cynical if you want to
 

6695

6697
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,430
get something done absolutely i i agree
with that but um

6698
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:25,440
with that but um
 

6699
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,709
with that but um
i mean you have to inspire people right

6700
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:26,719
i mean you have to inspire people right
 

6701
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:29,270
i mean you have to inspire people right
to work on certain ambitious things

6702
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:29,280
to work on certain ambitious things
 

6703
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,270
to work on certain ambitious things
um

6704
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,280
um
 

6705
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,830
um
so you know it's it's uh it's certainly

6706
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:33,840
so you know it's it's uh it's certainly
 

6707
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,669
so you know it's it's uh it's certainly
a lot harder than we believe but there's

6708
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:35,679
a lot harder than we believe but there's
 

6709
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:37,109
a lot harder than we believe but there's
no question in my mind that this will

6710
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:37,119
no question in my mind that this will
 

6711
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,950
no question in my mind that this will
this will happen and now you know people

6712
01:49:38,950 --> 01:49:38,960
this will happen and now you know people
 

6713
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:40,550
this will happen and now you know people
are kind of worried about what does that

6714
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:40,560
are kind of worried about what does that
 

6715
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,430
are kind of worried about what does that
mean

01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:45,990
they are going to be brought down from
their pedestal you know a bunch of

6722
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
their pedestal you know a bunch of
 

6723
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,189
their pedestal you know a bunch of
notches

6724
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:47,199
notches
 

6725
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:49,750
notches
with that and uh

you know
 

6729
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:51,750
you know
is that going to be good or bad i mean

is that going to be good or bad i mean
 

6731
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,350
is that going to be good or bad i mean
it's just going to give more power right

6732
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:53,360
it's just going to give more power right
 

6733

the facebook ai research group has
 

6743
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,350
the facebook ai research group has
recently celebrated its 8th birthday

6744
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:05,360
recently celebrated its 8th birthday
 

6745

or
 

6747
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,470
or
maybe you can correct me on that

looking back what has been
 

6751
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,870
looking back what has been
the successes the failures the lessons

6752
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:12,880
the successes the failures the lessons
 

6753
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,310
the successes the failures the lessons
learned from the eight years affair and

6754
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:14,320
learned from the eight years affair and
 

6755
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,629
learned from the eight years affair and
maybe you can also give context of where

6756
01:50:16,629 --> 01:50:16,639
maybe you can also give context of where
 

6757
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:17,510
maybe you can also give context of where
does

01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:20,159
the newly minted meta ai
 

6761
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,470
the newly minted meta ai
fit into how does it relate to fare

6762
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:22,480
fit into how does it relate to fare
 

6763
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,589
fit into how does it relate to fare
right so let me tell you a little bit

6764
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
right so let me tell you a little bit
 

6765

6771
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,950
eight years ago uh it wasn't called fair
yet it took that name a few a few months

6772
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
yet it took that name a few a few months
 

6773

engineers and a few science a few
scientists like you know ten engineers

6784
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:44,639
scientists like you know ten engineers
 

6785
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:45,830
scientists like you know ten engineers
and two scientists or something like

6786
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
and two scientists or something like
 

6787
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,870
and two scientists or something like
that

6788
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:46,880
that

fundamental research was about and how

6802
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
fundamental research was about and how
 

6803
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,870
fundamental research was about and how
it can work within uh

6804
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
it can work within uh
 

6805
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,870
it can work within uh
industry and how it needs to be open and

01:51:59,750 --> 01:51:59,760
it's completely built around
 

6859
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,669
it's completely built around
around ai these days and it's really

6860
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
around ai these days and it's really
 

6861
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,830
around ai these days and it's really
essential to the operations

6862

so what happened after three and a half

6864
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
so what happened after three and a half
 

6865
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,990
so what happened after three and a half
years is that

6866
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,000
years is that
 

6867
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,070
years is that

supervision and things like this which i

6886
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,360
supervision and things like this which i
 

6887
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,390
supervision and things like this which i
didn't have time to do when i was

so now uh fair is run by uh joel pineau

6892
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:31,599
so now uh fair is run by uh joel pineau
 

6893
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,990
so now uh fair is run by uh joel pineau
and antoine board

6894
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:34,000
and antoine board
 

6895
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,669
and antoine board
together because fair is kind of split

6896
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
together because fair is kind of split
 

6897
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,109
together because fair is kind of split
in two now there's something called fair

6898
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:37,119
in two now there's something called fair
 

6899
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,189
in two now there's something called fair
labs which is sort of

6900
01:52:39,189 --> 01:52:39,199
labs which is sort of
 

6901
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,870
labs which is sort of
bottom-up scientist-driven research and

6902
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:40,880
bottom-up scientist-driven research and
 

6903
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,870
bottom-up scientist-driven research and
fair excel which is slightly more

6904
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,880
fair excel which is slightly more
 

6905
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,390
fair excel which is slightly more
organized for bigger projects that

6906
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:44,400
organized for bigger projects that
 

6907
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,669
organized for bigger projects that
require

6908
01:52:45,669 --> 01:52:45,679
require
 

6909
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:47,910
require
a little more kind of focus and more

6910
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:47,920
a little more kind of focus and more
 

6911
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,589
a little more kind of focus and more
engineering support and things like that

6912

engineering support and things like that
 

6913
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,910
engineering support and things like that
so joelle needs fair lab and antoine

6914
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:51,920
so joelle needs fair lab and antoine
 

6915
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,990
so joelle needs fair lab and antoine
bourne leads very where are they located

6916
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
bourne leads very where are they located
 

6917
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,830
bourne leads very where are they located
uh it's always delocalized all over

6918
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:56,840
uh it's always delocalized all over
 

6919
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,589
uh it's always delocalized all over
um so there's no question that the

6920
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
um so there's no question that the
 

6921

a way to you kind of scale up

6996
01:54:12,709 --> 01:54:12,719
a way to you kind of scale up
 

6997
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,310
a way to you kind of scale up
if you want um

6998
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,320
if you want um
 

6999
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,390
if you want um
sort of ai technology which you know may

7000
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,400
sort of ai technology which you know may
 

7001
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,709
sort of ai technology which you know may
be very experimental and and sort of lab

7002
01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:18,719
be very experimental and and sort of lab
 

7003
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,390
be very experimental and and sort of lab
prototypes into things that are usable

7004
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:20,400
prototypes into things that are usable
 

7005
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,430
prototypes into things that are usable
so fair is a subset of meta ai it's fair

7006
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:23,440
so fair is a subset of meta ai it's fair
 

7007
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,470
so fair is a subset of meta ai it's fair
become like kfc it it'll just keep the f

7008
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:26,480
become like kfc it it'll just keep the f
 

7009
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,350
become like kfc it it'll just keep the f
nobody cares what the f stands for

7010
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:29,360
nobody cares what the f stands for
 

7011
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,310
nobody cares what the f stands for
we'll know

7012
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
we'll know
 

7013
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,350
we'll know
soon enough uh by uh probably probably

7014
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:33,360
soon enough uh by uh probably probably
 

7015
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,550
soon enough uh by uh probably probably
by the end of the

by the end of the
 

7017
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,830
by the end of the
of 2021 this is not a giant change mayor

7018
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:37,840
of 2021 this is not a giant change mayor
 

7019
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,430
of 2021 this is not a giant change mayor
fair well mayor doesn't sound too good

7020
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:39,440
fair well mayor doesn't sound too good

of deciding on this

7026
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
of deciding on this
 

7027
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,189
of deciding on this
and they've been hesitating for for a

7028
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:45,199
and they've been hesitating for for a
 

7029
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:46,950
and they've been hesitating for for a
while now and they you know they tell us

01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:46,960
while now and they you know they tell us
 

7031
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,310
while now and they you know they tell us
they're going to come up with an answer

7032
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:48,320
they're going to come up with an answer
 

7033
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,830
they're going to come up with an answer
as to whether fair is going to change

7034
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:49,840
as to whether fair is going to change
 

7035
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,189
as to whether fair is going to change
name or whether we're going to change

7036

name or whether we're going to change
 

7037
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,109
name or whether we're going to change
just the meaning of the f

7038
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
just the meaning of the f
 

7039
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,790
just the meaning of the f
oh that's a good call i would keep fair

7040
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
oh that's a good call i would keep fair
 

7041
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,229
oh that's a good call i would keep fair
and change the meaning of the f that

7042
01:54:56,229 --> 01:54:56,239
and change the meaning of the f that
 

7043
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:57,750
and change the meaning of the f that
would be my preference you know i would

7044
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:57,760
would be my preference you know i would
 

7045
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,790
would be my preference you know i would
tend i would turn the f into fundamental

7046
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:00,800
tend i would turn the f into fundamental
 

7047
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,470
tend i would turn the f into fundamental
oh that's what i researched oh that's

7048
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
oh that's what i researched oh that's
 

7049
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,470
oh that's what i researched oh that's
really good yeah then meta ai so this

7050
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
really good yeah then meta ai so this
 

7051
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,950
really good yeah then meta ai so this
would be fair affair yeah but you know

7052
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
would be fair affair yeah but you know
 

7053

i have to have research but by the way
the touch sensors are super interesting

7122
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
the touch sensors are super interesting
 

7123
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,229
the touch sensors are super interesting
uh like integrating that modality into

7124
01:56:16,229 --> 01:56:16,239
uh like integrating that modality into
 

7125
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:17,270
uh like integrating that modality into
the whole

7126
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:17,280
the whole
 

7127
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,070
the whole
uh sensing uh suite is very interesting

7128
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,080
uh sensing uh suite is very interesting
 

7129
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,350
uh sensing uh suite is very interesting
so

7130
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:21,360
so
 

7131
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,310

01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,310
should be thought of as the next step in
the internet right sort of

7146
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
the internet right sort of
 

7147
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,790
the internet right sort of
trying to

7148
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:38,800
trying to
 

7149
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,589
trying to
kind of you know make the experience

7150
01:56:41,589 --> 01:56:41,599
kind of you know make the experience
 

7151
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:43,109
kind of you know make the experience
more compelling

7152
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:43,119
more compelling
 

7153
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:45,510
more compelling
of you know being

7154
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:45,520
of you know being
 

7155
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,030
of you know being
connected either with other people or

7156
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,040
connected either with other people or
 

7157
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,350
connected either with other people or
with content

7158
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
with content
 

7159
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,270
with content
and you know we are

7160
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,280
and you know we are
 

7161
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,430
and you know we are
evolved and trained to

7162
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,440
evolved and trained to
 

7163
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,470
evolved and trained to
evolve in you know 3d environments where

7164
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:56,480
evolve in you know 3d environments where
 

7165
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,629
evolve in you know 3d environments where
uh you know we can see other people we

7166
01:56:58,629 --> 01:56:58,639
uh you know we can see other people we
 

7167
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:00,550
uh you know we can see other people we
can talk to them when when we're near

7168
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,560
can talk to them when when we're near
 

7169
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,070
can talk to them when when we're near
them or

7170
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,080
them or
 

7171
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,350
them or
you know and other people are far away

7172
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
you know and other people are far away
 

7173
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,709
you know and other people are far away
can hear us you know things like that

7174
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
can hear us you know things like that
 

7175
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,350
can hear us you know things like that
right so it it there's a lot of social

7176
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:07,360
right so it it there's a lot of social
 

7177
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,109
right so it it there's a lot of social
conventions that exist in the real world

7178
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:09,119
conventions that exist in the real world
 

7179
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,589
conventions that exist in the real world
that we can try to transpose now what is

7180
01:57:11,589 --> 01:57:11,599
that we can try to transpose now what is
 

7181
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,070
that we can try to transpose now what is
going to be eventually the

7182
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,080
going to be eventually the
 

7183
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,149
going to be eventually the
the uh how compelling is it going to be

7184
01:57:16,149 --> 01:57:16,159
the uh how compelling is it going to be
 

7185
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:18,229
the uh how compelling is it going to be
like our you know uh is it going to be

7186
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:18,239
like our you know uh is it going to be
 

7187
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:19,350
like our you know uh is it going to be
the case that people are going to be

7188
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,360
the case that people are going to be
 

7189
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,709
the case that people are going to be
willing to

7190
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:20,719
willing to
 

7191
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:22,550
willing to
do this if they have to wear you know a

7192
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
do this if they have to wear you know a
 

7193
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,550
do this if they have to wear you know a
huge pair of goggles all day

7194
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:24,560
huge pair of goggles all day
 

7195
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,950
huge pair of goggles all day
maybe not right but then again if the

7196
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:26,960
maybe not right but then again if the
 

7197
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,350
maybe not right but then again if the
experience is sufficiently compelling

7198
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:29,360
experience is sufficiently compelling
 

7199
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,669
experience is sufficiently compelling
maybe so or if the device that you have

7200
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
maybe so or if the device that you have
 

7201
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,030
maybe so or if the device that you have
to wear is just basically a pair of

7202
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:33,040
to wear is just basically a pair of
 

7203
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,030
to wear is just basically a pair of
glasses you know technology makes

7204
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
glasses you know technology makes
 

7205
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,830
glasses you know technology makes
sufficient progress for that

7206
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:36,840
sufficient progress for that
 

7207
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,149
sufficient progress for that
um you know ar is a much easier

7208
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:40,159
um you know ar is a much easier
 

7209
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:42,310
um you know ar is a much easier
concept to grasp that you're going to

7210
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:42,320
concept to grasp that you're going to
 

7211
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,870
concept to grasp that you're going to
have you know augmented reality glasses

7212
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:44,880
have you know augmented reality glasses
 

7213
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,750
have you know augmented reality glasses
that

7214
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:45,760
that
 

7215
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,589
that
basically contain some sort of you know

7216
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:47,599
basically contain some sort of you know
 

7217
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:49,270
basically contain some sort of you know
virtual assistant that can help you in

7218
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:49,280
virtual assistant that can help you in
 

7219
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,189
virtual assistant that can help you in
your daily lives but at the same time

7220
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:51,199
your daily lives but at the same time
 

7221
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,709
your daily lives but at the same time
with the ar you have to contend with

7222
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
with the ar you have to contend with
 

7223
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,470
with the ar you have to contend with
reality with vr you can completely

7224
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:54,480
reality with vr you can completely
 

7225
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,149
reality with vr you can completely
detach yourself from reality so it gives

7226
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:56,159
detach yourself from reality so it gives
 

7227
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:58,390
detach yourself from reality so it gives
you freedom it might be easier to design

7228
01:57:58,390 --> 01:57:58,400
you freedom it might be easier to design
 

7229
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,229
you freedom it might be easier to design
worlds in in vr

7230
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:00,239
worlds in in vr
 

7231
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,990
worlds in in vr
yeah but you you can imagine how you

7232
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,000
yeah but you you can imagine how you
 

7233
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,550
yeah but you you can imagine how you
know the metaverse being

7234
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,560
know the metaverse being
 

7235
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:07,350
know the metaverse being
a mix a mix right or or like you can

7236
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,360
a mix a mix right or or like you can
 

7237
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,189
a mix a mix right or or like you can
have objects that exist in the metaverse

7238
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:09,199
have objects that exist in the metaverse
 

7239
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:10,790
have objects that exist in the metaverse
that you know pop up on top of the real

7240
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:10,800
that you know pop up on top of the real
 

7241
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,229
that you know pop up on top of the real
world or only exist in virtual reality

7242
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,239
world or only exist in virtual reality
 

7243
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:16,790
world or only exist in virtual reality
okay let me ask the hard question

7244
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:16,800
okay let me ask the hard question
 

7245
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,550
okay let me ask the hard question
oh because all of this was easy so this

7246
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:18,560
oh because all of this was easy so this
 

7247

polarized than they were at the
 

7415
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,270
polarized than they were at the
beginning and the people who were more

beginning and the people who were more
 

7417
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,470

there's a study you know from stanford

7420
02:01:08,149 --> 02:01:08,159
there's a study you know from stanford
 

7421
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:09,189
there's a study you know from stanford
of uh

7422
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
of uh
 

7423
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,189
of uh
economists at stanford that

7424
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:11,199
economists at stanford that
 

7425
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:13,350
economists at stanford that
tried to identify the causes of uh

7426
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:13,360
tried to identify the causes of uh
 

7427
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:15,910
tried to identify the causes of uh
increasing polarization in the u.s

7428
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:15,920
increasing polarization in the u.s
 

7429
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,669
increasing polarization in the u.s
and it's been going on for 40 years

7430
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:17,679
and it's been going on for 40 years
 

7431
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:20,390
and it's been going on for 40 years
before you know mark zuckerberg was born

7432
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400
before you know mark zuckerberg was born
 

7433
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,390
before you know mark zuckerberg was born
yeah uh continuously

7434
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:22,400
yeah uh continuously
 

7435
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:25,510
yeah uh continuously
and um and uh so if there is a cause

7436
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:25,520
and um and uh so if there is a cause
 

7437
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,470
and um and uh so if there is a cause
it's not

7438
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:26,480
it's not
 

7439
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:27,830
it's not
facebook or social media so you could

7440
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:27,840
facebook or social media so you could
 

7441
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,910
facebook or social media so you could
say social media just accelerated but no

7442
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
say social media just accelerated but no
 

7443
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,149
say social media just accelerated but no
i mean it's basically a continuous

7444
02:01:32,149 --> 02:01:32,159
i mean it's basically a continuous
 

7445
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,070
i mean it's basically a continuous
uh evolution by some measure of

7446
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:34,080
uh evolution by some measure of
 

7447
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,070
uh evolution by some measure of
polarization in the us and then you

7448
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:36,080
polarization in the us and then you
 

7449
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,830
polarization in the us and then you
compare this with other countries like

7450
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:37,840
compare this with other countries like
 

7451
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,430
compare this with other countries like
uh

7452
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:39,440
uh
 

7453
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,830
uh
the the west half of germany because you

7454
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:41,840
the the west half of germany because you
 

7455
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,629
the the west half of germany because you
can't go 40 years in east eastside or

7456
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
can't go 40 years in east eastside or
 

7457
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,510
can't go 40 years in east eastside or
denmark or or other countries

7458
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:47,520
denmark or or other countries
 

7459
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,350
denmark or or other countries
and they use facebook just as much and

7460
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:49,360
and they use facebook just as much and
 

7461
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,470
and they use facebook just as much and
they're not getting more polarized

7462
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:50,480
they're not getting more polarized
 

7463
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,390
they're not getting more polarized
they're getting less polarized so if you

7464
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,400
they're getting less polarized so if you
 

7465
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,790
they're getting less polarized so if you
want to look for you know a causal

7466
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:54,800
want to look for you know a causal
 

7467
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,430
want to look for you know a causal
relationship there

7468
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:57,440
relationship there

them
 

7501
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,750
them
because it's very interesting to me even

7502
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:27,760
because it's very interesting to me even
 

7503
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,589
because it's very interesting to me even
if facebook has

7504
02:02:29,589 --> 02:02:29,599
if facebook has
 

7505
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:31,750
if facebook has
some measurable negative effect

7506
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:31,760
some measurable negative effect
 

7507
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,109
some measurable negative effect
you can't just consider that in

7508
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
you can't just consider that in
 

7509
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:34,790
you can't just consider that in
isolation you have to consider about all

7510
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
isolation you have to consider about all
 

7511
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,790
isolation you have to consider about all
the positive ways that it connects us so

7512
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:36,800
the positive ways that it connects us so
 

7513
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,709
the positive ways that it connects us so
like every technology there's people

7514
02:02:38,709 --> 02:02:38,719
like every technology there's people
 

7515
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:40,310
like every technology there's people
it's that question you can't just say

7516
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,320
it's that question you can't just say
 

7517
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,270
it's that question you can't just say
like

7518
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:41,280
like
 

7519
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,750
like
uh there's an increase in division

7520
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:43,760
uh there's an increase in division
 

7521
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:46,149
uh there's an increase in division
yes probably google search engine has

7522
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
yes probably google search engine has
 

7523
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:48,070
yes probably google search engine has
created increase in division we have to

7524
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:48,080
created increase in division we have to
 

7525
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,830
created increase in division we have to
consider about how much information it

7526
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
consider about how much information it
 

7527
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,830
consider about how much information it
brought to the world like i'm sure

7528
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
brought to the world like i'm sure
 

7529
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,750
brought to the world like i'm sure
wikipedia created more division if you

7530
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:53,760
wikipedia created more division if you
 

7531
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,510
wikipedia created more division if you
just look at the division we have to

7532
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:55,520
just look at the division we have to
 

7533
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,510
just look at the division we have to
look at the full context of the world

7534
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:57,520
look at the full context of the world
 

7535
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,589
look at the full context of the world
and didn't make a better world yeah the

7536
02:02:59,589 --> 02:02:59,599
and didn't make a better world yeah the
 

7537
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:00,870
and didn't make a better world yeah the
printing press has created more

7538
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:00,880
printing press has created more
 

7539
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:02,950
printing press has created more
differences right exactly

7540
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:02,960
differences right exactly
 

7541
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,550
differences right exactly
so you know when the

7542
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
so you know when the
 

7543
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,510
so you know when the
printing press was invented uh the first

7544
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,520
printing press was invented uh the first
 

7545
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,669
printing press was invented uh the first
books that were that were printed were

7546
02:03:09,669 --> 02:03:09,679
books that were that were printed were
 

7547
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:11,510
books that were that were printed were
things like the bible and that allowed

7548
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,520
things like the bible and that allowed
 

7549
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,589
things like the bible and that allowed
people to read the bible by themselves

7550
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:13,599
people to read the bible by themselves
 

7551
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,270
people to read the bible by themselves
not get the message uniquely from

7552
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:15,280
not get the message uniquely from
 

7553
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,270
not get the message uniquely from
priests in europe

7554
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
priests in europe
 

7555
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,750
priests in europe
and they created you know the protest

7556
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
and they created you know the protest
 

7557
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,910
and they created you know the protest
movement and 200 years of religious

7558
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:21,920
movement and 200 years of religious
 

7559
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,589
movement and 200 years of religious
persecution and wars

7560
02:03:23,589 --> 02:03:23,599
persecution and wars
 

7561
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:25,270
persecution and wars
so that's a bad side effect of the

7562
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:25,280
so that's a bad side effect of the
 

7563
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,870
so that's a bad side effect of the
printing press you know social networks

7564
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:26,880
printing press you know social networks
 

7565
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,550
printing press you know social networks
aren't being nearly as bad as the

7566
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
aren't being nearly as bad as the
 

7567
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:29,990
aren't being nearly as bad as the
printing press but nobody would say that

7568
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:30,000
printing press but nobody would say that
 

7569
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,430
printing press but nobody would say that
printing price was a bad idea

7570
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:33,440

 

7571
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,109

yeah a lot of it's perception and

7572
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:35,119
yeah a lot of it's perception and
 

7573
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:36,870
yeah a lot of it's perception and
there's a lot of different incentives

7574
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:36,880
there's a lot of different incentives
 

7575
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,910
there's a lot of different incentives
operating here um maybe a quick comment

7576
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:39,920
operating here um maybe a quick comment
 

7577

tech space
 

7583
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:48,950
tech space
i'm sure facebook involves a lot of

7584
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:48,960
i'm sure facebook involves a lot of
 

7585
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,830
i'm sure facebook involves a lot of
incredible technological uh challenges

7586
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
incredible technological uh challenges
 

7587
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,350
incredible technological uh challenges
that need to be solved a lot of it

7588
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:53,360
that need to be solved a lot of it
 

7589
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,229
that need to be solved a lot of it
probably is on the computer

7590
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:54,239
probably is on the computer
 

7591
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:56,229
probably is on the computer
infrastructure the hardware the i mean

7592
02:03:56,229 --> 02:03:56,239
infrastructure the hardware the i mean
 

7593
02:03:56,239 --> 02:03:58,870
infrastructure the hardware the i mean
it's just a huge amount

7594
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
it's just a huge amount
 

7595
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,270
it's just a huge amount
maybe can you give me context about

7596
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
maybe can you give me context about
 

7597
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,510
maybe can you give me context about
how much of shrek's life

7598
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:03,520
how much of shrek's life
 

7599
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,589
how much of shrek's life
is ai and how much of it is low level

7600
02:04:05,589 --> 02:04:05,599
is ai and how much of it is low level
 

7601
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:07,750
is ai and how much of it is low level
compute how much of it is

7602
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:07,760
compute how much of it is
 

7603
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,430
compute how much of it is
flying all around doing business stuff

02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
variance covariance regularization and
 

7791
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,189
variance covariance regularization and
it's a technique a non-contrastive

7792
02:07:17,189 --> 02:07:17,199
it's a technique a non-contrastive
 

7793
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:19,430
it's a technique a non-contrastive
learning technique for

7794
02:07:19,430 --> 02:07:19,440
learning technique for
 

7795
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,189
learning technique for
what i call joint embedding architecture

7796
02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:21,199
what i call joint embedding architecture
 

7797
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,510
what i call joint embedding architecture
so siamese nets are an example of joint

7798
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:23,520
so siamese nets are an example of joint
 

7799
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,350
so siamese nets are an example of joint
invading architecture so gentlemen

7800
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:25,360
invading architecture so gentlemen
 

7801
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:26,790
invading architecture so gentlemen
architecture is

7802
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800
architecture is
 

7803
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,270
architecture is
uh

7804
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280

 

7805
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,709

let me back up a little bit right so if

7806
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:30,719
let me back up a little bit right so if
 

7807
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:33,189
let me back up a little bit right so if
you want to do supervised running

7808
02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:33,199
you want to do supervised running
 

7809
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:36,310
you want to do supervised running
you can you can do it by prediction

7810
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,320
you can you can do it by prediction
 

7811
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:37,510
you can you can do it by prediction
so let's say you want to train your

7812
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:37,520
so let's say you want to train your
 

7813
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,870
so let's say you want to train your
system to predict video right you show

7814
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:38,880
system to predict video right you show
 

7815
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,109
system to predict video right you show
it a video clip and

7816
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:41,119
it a video clip and
 

7817
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:42,870
it a video clip and
and you train the system to predict the

7818
02:07:42,870 --> 02:07:42,880
and you train the system to predict the
 

7819
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,950
and you train the system to predict the
next the continuation of that video clip

7820
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:44,960
next the continuation of that video clip
 

7821
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,629
next the continuation of that video clip
now because you need to handle

7822
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
now because you need to handle
 

7823
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:48,550
now because you need to handle
uncertainty because there are many you

7824
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
uncertainty because there are many you
 

7825
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,990
uncertainty because there are many you
know many continuations that are

7826
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
know many continuations that are
 

7827
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,430
know many continuations that are
plausible

7828
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:51,440
plausible
 

7829
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,350
plausible
you need to have you need to handle this

7830
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360
you need to have you need to handle this
 

7831
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,910
you need to have you need to handle this
in some way you need to have a way for

7832
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:55,920
in some way you need to have a way for
 

7833
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,709
in some way you need to have a way for
the system to be able to produce

7834
02:07:58,709 --> 02:07:58,719
the system to be able to produce
 

7835
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,470
the system to be able to produce
multiple predictions

7836
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:00,480
multiple predictions
 

7837
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,550
multiple predictions
and the way the only way i know to do

7838
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:02,560
and the way the only way i know to do
 

7839
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,350
and the way the only way i know to do
this

7840
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
this
 

7841
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,950
this
is through what's called a latent

7842
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:04,960
is through what's called a latent
 

7843
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:07,510
is through what's called a latent
variable so you have some sort of

7844
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:07,520
variable so you have some sort of
 

7845
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,510
variable so you have some sort of
hidden vector of a variable that you can

7846
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:09,520
hidden vector of a variable that you can
 

7847
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,669
hidden vector of a variable that you can
vary over a set or draw from a

7848
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:11,679
vary over a set or draw from a
 

7849
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:13,750
vary over a set or draw from a
distribution and as you vary this vector

7850
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:13,760
distribution and as you vary this vector
 

7851
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,510
distribution and as you vary this vector
over a set the output the prediction

7852
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:15,520
over a set the output the prediction
 

7853
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,030
over a set the output the prediction
varies over a set of plausible

7854
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:17,040
varies over a set of plausible
 

7855
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,310
varies over a set of plausible
predictions

7856
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:18,320
predictions
 

7857
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,830
predictions
okay so that's called i call this a

7858
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:20,840
okay so that's called i call this a
 

7859
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:24,629
okay so that's called i call this a
generative latent variable model

7860
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,639
generative latent variable model
 

7861
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:26,790
generative latent variable model
okay now there is an alternative to this

7862
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
okay now there is an alternative to this
 

7863
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,550
okay now there is an alternative to this
to handle uncertainty

7864
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:28,560
to handle uncertainty
 

7865
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,069
to handle uncertainty
and instead of directly predicting the

7866
02:08:32,069 --> 02:08:32,079
and instead of directly predicting the
 

7867
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:34,229
and instead of directly predicting the
the next frames of the of the of the

7868
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:34,239
the next frames of the of the of the
 

7869
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:35,669
the next frames of the of the of the
clip

7870
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
clip
 

7871
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,069
clip
you also run those

7872
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:38,079
you also run those
 

7873
02:08:38,079 --> 02:08:40,550
you also run those
through another neural net

7874
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:40,560
through another neural net
 

7875
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,550
through another neural net
uh so you now have two neural nets one

7876
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,560
uh so you now have two neural nets one
 

7877
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,390
uh so you now have two neural nets one
that looks at the

7878
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
that looks at the
 

7879
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:45,430
that looks at the
the uh

7880
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
the uh
 

7881
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,470
the uh
you know the

7882
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:46,480
you know the
 

7883
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:48,629
you know the
initial segment of the video clip and

7884
02:08:48,629 --> 02:08:48,639
initial segment of the video clip and
 

7885
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:50,149
initial segment of the video clip and
another one that looks at the the

7886
02:08:50,149 --> 02:08:50,159
another one that looks at the the
 

7887
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:53,350
another one that looks at the the
continuation during training right

7888
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:53,360
continuation during training right
 

7889
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,870
continuation during training right
and what what you're trying to do is

7890
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,880
and what what you're trying to do is
 

7891
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,510
and what what you're trying to do is
learn a representation

7892
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:57,520
learn a representation
 

7893
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,270
learn a representation
of those two video clips that is

7894
02:08:59,270 --> 02:08:59,280
of those two video clips that is
 

7895
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,750
of those two video clips that is
maximally informative about the video

7896
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:01,760
maximally informative about the video
 

7897
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,350
maximally informative about the video
clips themselves

7898
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:03,360
clips themselves
 

7899
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,390
clips themselves
but

7900
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:04,400
but
 

7901
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,069
but
it's such that you can predict the

7902
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:06,079
it's such that you can predict the
 

7903
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:08,390
it's such that you can predict the
representation of the second video clip

7904
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
representation of the second video clip
 

7905
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,390
representation of the second video clip
from the representation of the first one

7906
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:10,400
from the representation of the first one
 

7907
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,149
from the representation of the first one
easily okay

7908
02:09:12,149 --> 02:09:12,159
easily okay
 

7909
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:13,510
easily okay
and you can sort of formalize this in

7910
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:13,520
and you can sort of formalize this in
 

7911
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:15,189
and you can sort of formalize this in
terms of maximizing virtual information

7912
02:09:15,189 --> 02:09:15,199
terms of maximizing virtual information
 

7913
02:09:15,199 --> 02:09:16,390
terms of maximizing virtual information
some stuff like that but it doesn't

7914
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:16,400
some stuff like that but it doesn't
 

7915
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:17,910
some stuff like that but it doesn't
matter

7916
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:17,920
matter
 

7917
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,750
matter
what you want is

7918
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,760
what you want is
 

7919
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,910
what you want is
informative representative represent you

7920
02:09:21,910 --> 02:09:21,920
informative representative represent you
 

7921
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,629
informative representative represent you
know

7922
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:22,639
know
 

7923
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,709
know
informative representations of the two

7924
02:09:24,709 --> 02:09:24,719
informative representations of the two
 

7925
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:26,550
informative representations of the two
video clips that are mutually

02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:26,560
video clips that are mutually
 

7927
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,229
video clips that are mutually
predictable

7928
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
predictable
 

7929
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:29,990
predictable
what that means is that there's a lot of

7930
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,000
what that means is that there's a lot of
 

7931
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,910
what that means is that there's a lot of
details in the second video clips that

details in the second video clips that
 

7933
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,149
details in the second video clips that
are irrelevant

02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:35,760
you know
 

7937
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,790
you know
i let's say a video clip consists in you

7938
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:38,800
i let's say a video clip consists in you
 

7939
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,830
i let's say a video clip consists in you
know a camera panning the scene

7940
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:41,840
know a camera panning the scene
 

7941
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,189
know a camera panning the scene
there's going to be a piece of that room

7942
02:09:43,189 --> 02:09:43,199
there's going to be a piece of that room
 

7943
02:09:43,199 --> 02:09:45,030
there's going to be a piece of that room
that is going to be revealed and i can

02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,040
that is going to be revealed and i can
 

7945
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,109
that is going to be revealed and i can
somewhat predict what the what that room

02:09:47,109 --> 02:09:47,119
somewhat predict what the what that room
 

7947
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:48,550
somewhat predict what the what that room
is going to look like but i may not be

02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:48,560
is going to look like but i may not be
 

7949
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:51,030
is going to look like but i may not be
able to predict the details of the

02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
able to predict the details of the

02:09:54,149 --> 02:09:54,159
tiles are ending and stuff like that
 

7955
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:56,229
tiles are ending and stuff like that
right so those are irrelevant details

7956
02:09:56,229 --> 02:09:56,239
right so those are irrelevant details
 

7957
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:58,149
right so those are irrelevant details
that perhaps my representation will

7958
02:09:58,149 --> 02:09:58,159
that perhaps my representation will
 

7959
02:09:58,159 --> 02:09:59,510
that perhaps my representation will
eliminate

7960
02:09:59,510 --> 02:09:59,520
eliminate
 

7961
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,709
eliminate
and so

7962
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
and so
 

7963
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:02,709
and so
what i need is to train this second

7964
02:10:02,709 --> 02:10:02,719
what i need is to train this second
 

7965
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:05,109
what i need is to train this second
neural net in such a way that

7966
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:05,119
neural net in such a way that
 

7967
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,990
neural net in such a way that
uh whenever the the

7968
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:08,000
uh whenever the the
 

7969
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,069
uh whenever the the
the continuation video clip varies over

7970
02:10:10,069 --> 02:10:10,079
the continuation video clip varies over
 

7971
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:13,350
the continuation video clip varies over
all the plausible continuations

7972
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:13,360
all the plausible continuations
 

7973
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,510
all the plausible continuations
the representation doesn't change

7974
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:15,520
the representation doesn't change
 

7975
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,229
the representation doesn't change
got it okay so it's the yeah yeah got it

7976
02:10:18,229 --> 02:10:18,239
got it okay so it's the yeah yeah got it
 

7977
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:20,709
got it okay so it's the yeah yeah got it
all over the space of representations

7978
02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:20,719
all over the space of representations
 

7979
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,149
all over the space of representations
doing the same kind of thing as you're

7980
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
doing the same kind of thing as you're
 

7981
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:25,270
doing the same kind of thing as you're
doing with similarity learning right

7982
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:25,280
doing with similarity learning right
 

7983
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:27,910
doing with similarity learning right
yeah so so these are two ways to handle

7984
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:27,920
yeah so so these are two ways to handle
 

7985
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:29,589
yeah so so these are two ways to handle
multi-modality in a prediction right in

7986
02:10:29,589 --> 02:10:29,599
multi-modality in a prediction right in
 

7987
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:31,750
multi-modality in a prediction right in
the first way you parameterize the

7988
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
the first way you parameterize the
 

7989
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,589
the first way you parameterize the
prediction with a latin variable but you

7990
02:10:33,589 --> 02:10:33,599
prediction with a latin variable but you
 

7991
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:35,830
prediction with a latin variable but you
predict pixels essentially right in the

7992
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:35,840
predict pixels essentially right in the
 

7993
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,830
predict pixels essentially right in the
second one you want you don't predict

7994
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:37,840
second one you want you don't predict
 

7995
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,189
second one you want you don't predict
pixels you predict an abstract

7996
02:10:39,189 --> 02:10:39,199
pixels you predict an abstract
 

7997
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:40,709
pixels you predict an abstract
representation of pixels and you

7998
02:10:40,709 --> 02:10:40,719
representation of pixels and you
 

7999
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:41,910
representation of pixels and you
guarantee that this has track

8000
02:10:41,910 --> 02:10:41,920
guarantee that this has track
 

8001
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,270
guarantee that this has track
representation

8002
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:43,280

8005
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,870

about the input but sort of you know

8006
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:46,880
about the input but sort of you know
 

8007
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,390
about the input but sort of you know
drops all the stuff that you really

8008
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:48,400
drops all the stuff that you really
 

8009
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:51,830
drops all the stuff that you really
can't predict essentially

8010
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:51,840
can't predict essentially
 

8011
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,189
can't predict essentially

02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:31,669
now that kind of work similarly so
they're all based on this idea of joint

aol work but we don't really know why

8058
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:39,199
aol work but we don't really know why
 

8059
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:40,229
aol work but we don't really know why
and there's been like lots of

8060
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:40,239
and there's been like lots of
 

8061
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:41,910
and there's been like lots of
theoretical papers but why be where it

8062
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:41,920
theoretical papers but why be where it
 

8063
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:43,669
theoretical papers but why be where it
works no it's not bad because we take it

8064
02:11:43,669 --> 02:11:43,679
works no it's not bad because we take it
 

8065
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:45,189
works no it's not bad because we take it
out and it still works and

8066
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:45,199
out and it still works and
 

8067
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:46,229
out and it still works and
you know blah blah blah i mean so

8068
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,239
you know blah blah blah i mean so
 

8069
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:48,950
you know blah blah blah i mean so
there's like a big big debate but um

8070
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:48,960
there's like a big big debate but um
 

8071
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,470
there's like a big big debate but um
uh but the important point is that we

8072
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:50,480
uh but the important point is that we
 

8073
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:52,550
uh but the important point is that we
now have a collection of non-contrastive

8074
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:52,560
now have a collection of non-contrastive
 

8075
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,629
now have a collection of non-contrastive
joint embedding methods which i think is

8076
02:11:54,629 --> 02:11:54,639
joint embedding methods which i think is
 

8077
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:57,109
joint embedding methods which i think is
the best thing since sliced bread so i'm

8078
02:11:57,109 --> 02:11:57,119
the best thing since sliced bread so i'm
 

8079
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,510
the best thing since sliced bread so i'm
super excited about this because i think

8080
02:11:59,510 --> 02:11:59,520
super excited about this because i think
 

8081
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,109
super excited about this because i think
it's our best shot

8082
02:12:01,109 --> 02:12:01,119
it's our best shot
 

8083
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:03,030
it's our best shot
for techniques that would allow us to

for techniques that would allow us to
 

8085
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,709
for techniques that would allow us to
kind of build

8086
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:04,719
kind of build
 

8087
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:06,950
kind of build
predictive world models and at the same

8088
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:06,960
predictive world models and at the same
 

8089
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,790
predictive world models and at the same
time learn hierarchical representations

8090
02:12:08,790 --> 02:12:08,800
time learn hierarchical representations
 

8091
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,790
time learn hierarchical representations

02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
of the world where what matters about
 

8093
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,149
of the world where what matters about
the world is preserved and what is

8094
02:12:12,149 --> 02:12:12,159
the world is preserved and what is
 

8095
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:14,470
the world is preserved and what is
irrelevant is eliminated

8096
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:14,480
irrelevant is eliminated
 

8097
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,830
irrelevant is eliminated
by the way the representation is the

02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:26,079
have to be images this could be applied
 

8111
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:27,589
have to be images this could be applied
to text it could be applied to just

and
 

8167
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,669
and
one of the main criticism from reviewers

8168
02:13:27,669 --> 02:13:27,679
one of the main criticism from reviewers
 

8169
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:29,589
one of the main criticism from reviewers
is that v craig is not different enough

8170
02:13:29,589 --> 02:13:29,599
is that v craig is not different enough
 

8171
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:32,870
is that v craig is not different enough
from battle twins but

8172
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:32,880
from battle twins but
 

8173
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,510
from battle twins but
you know my impression is that

8174
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:35,520
you know my impression is that
 

8175
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,709
you know my impression is that
it's you know

8176
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:36,719
it's you know
 

8177
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:39,109
it's you know
bottle twins with a few bugs fixed

8178
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:39,119
bottle twins with a few bugs fixed
 

8179
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:41,750
bottle twins with a few bugs fixed
essentially and uh in the end this is

8180
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:41,760
essentially and uh in the end this is
 

8181
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,109
essentially and uh in the end this is
what people will use

8182
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:43,119
what people will use
 

8183
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:46,550
what people will use
right so but you know i'm used to stuff

8184
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:46,560
right so but you know i'm used to stuff
 

8185
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,550
right so but you know i'm used to stuff
yeah that assume it being rejected

8186
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:48,560
yeah that assume it being rejected
 

8187
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:49,830
yeah that assume it being rejected
forward so it might be rejected and

8188
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:49,840
forward so it might be rejected and
 

8189
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,270
forward so it might be rejected and
actually exceptional excited because

8190
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
actually exceptional excited because
 

8191
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,270
actually exceptional excited because
people use it well it's already decided

8192
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:53,280
people use it well it's already decided
 

8193
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,669
people use it well it's already decided
like a bunch of times so i mean the the

8194
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
like a bunch of times so i mean the the
 

8195
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,430
like a bunch of times so i mean the the
question is then to the deeper question

8196
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:57,440
question is then to the deeper question
 

8197
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:00,310
question is then to the deeper question
about peer review and conferences i mean

8198
02:14:00,310 --> 02:14:00,320
about peer review and conferences i mean
 

8199
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:01,910
about peer review and conferences i mean
computer science is a field is kind of

8200
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
computer science is a field is kind of
 

8201
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,750
computer science is a field is kind of
unique that the conference is highly

8202
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:03,760
unique that the conference is highly
 

8203
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:04,709
unique that the conference is highly
prized

8204
02:14:04,709 --> 02:14:04,719
prized
 

8205
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:07,109
prized
that's one right and uh it's interesting

8206
02:14:07,109 --> 02:14:07,119
that's one right and uh it's interesting
 

8207
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:09,030
that's one right and uh it's interesting
because the peer review process there is

8208
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,040
because the peer review process there is
 

8209
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,589
because the peer review process there is
similar as opposed to journals but it's

8210
02:14:11,589 --> 02:14:11,599
similar as opposed to journals but it's
 

8211
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:13,990
similar as opposed to journals but it's
accelerated significantly well not

8212
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:14,000
accelerated significantly well not
 

8213
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,310
accelerated significantly well not
significantly but it goes fast

8214
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
significantly but it goes fast
 

8215
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,390
significantly but it goes fast
and it's nice way to get stuff out

8216
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:18,400
and it's nice way to get stuff out
 

8217
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,950
and it's nice way to get stuff out
quickly uh to be reviewed quickly go to

8218
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:20,960
quickly uh to be reviewed quickly go to
 

8219
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:23,109
quickly uh to be reviewed quickly go to
present it quickly to the community so

8220
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:23,119
present it quickly to the community so
 

8221
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:25,830
present it quickly to the community so
not quickly but quicker yeah but

8222
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:25,840
not quickly but quicker yeah but
 

8223
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:27,270
not quickly but quicker yeah but
nevertheless it has many of the same

8224
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
nevertheless it has many of the same
 

8225
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,430
nevertheless it has many of the same
flaws of uh peer review because it's a

8226
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:29,440
flaws of uh peer review because it's a
 

8227
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:31,270
flaws of uh peer review because it's a
limited number of people look at it

8228
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:31,280
limited number of people look at it
 

8229
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,510
limited number of people look at it
there's bias in the following like that

8230
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:33,520
there's bias in the following like that
 

8231
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,350
there's bias in the following like that
if you if you want to do new ideas

8232
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:35,360
if you if you want to do new ideas
 

8233
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,430
if you if you want to do new ideas
you're going to get pushed back

8234
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
you're going to get pushed back
 

8235
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,589
you're going to get pushed back
um they're self-interested people that

8236
02:14:39,589 --> 02:14:39,599
um they're self-interested people that
 

8237
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:40,870
um they're self-interested people that
kind of

8238
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:40,880
kind of
 

8239
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,430
kind of
can infer who submitted it

8240
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
can infer who submitted it
 

8241
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,870
can infer who submitted it
and kind of

8242
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:44,880
and kind of
 

8243
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,870
and kind of
you know be cranky about it all that

8244
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:46,880
you know be cranky about it all that
 

8245
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,390
you know be cranky about it all that
kind of stuff yeah i mean there's a lot

8246
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,400
kind of stuff yeah i mean there's a lot
 

8247
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,790
kind of stuff yeah i mean there's a lot
of you know social phenomena there um

8248
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:50,800
of you know social phenomena there um
 

8249
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,390
of you know social phenomena there um
there's one social phenomenon which is

8250
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:52,400
there's one social phenomenon which is
 

8251
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:55,030
there's one social phenomenon which is
that because the field has been growing

8252
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
that because the field has been growing
 

8253
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,550
that because the field has been growing
exponentially

8254
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
exponentially
 

8255
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,470
exponentially
the vast majority of people in the field

8256
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:58,480
the vast majority of people in the field
 

8257
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:01,270
the vast majority of people in the field
are extremely junior yeah so as a

8258
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:01,280
are extremely junior yeah so as a
 

8259
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,470
are extremely junior yeah so as a
consequence and that's just a

8260
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:02,480
consequence and that's just a
 

8261
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:04,790
consequence and that's just a
consequence of the field growing right

8262
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:04,800
consequence of the field growing right
 

8263
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,430
consequence of the field growing right
so as the number of the size of the

8264
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:07,440
so as the number of the size of the
 

8265
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,350
so as the number of the size of the
field kind of starts saturating you you

8266
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:09,360
field kind of starts saturating you you
 

8267
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,270
field kind of starts saturating you you
will have less of that problem

8268
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:11,280
will have less of that problem
 

8269
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:15,109
will have less of that problem
of reviewers being very uh inexperienced

8270
02:15:15,109 --> 02:15:15,119
of reviewers being very uh inexperienced
 

8271
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:18,149
of reviewers being very uh inexperienced
a consequence of this is that you know

8272
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:18,159
a consequence of this is that you know
 

8273
02:15:18,159 --> 02:15:19,990
a consequence of this is that you know
young reviewers

8274
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,000
young reviewers
 

8275
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:20,790
young reviewers
i mean

8276
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800
i mean
 

8277
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,790
i mean
there's a phenomenon which is that

8278
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
there's a phenomenon which is that
 

8279
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,550
there's a phenomenon which is that
reviewers try to make their life easy

8280
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:24,560
reviewers try to make their life easy
 

8281
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:25,910
reviewers try to make their life easy
and to make their life easy when

8282
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:25,920
and to make their life easy when
 

8283
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,270
and to make their life easy when
reviewing a paper

8284
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:27,280
reviewing a paper
 

8285
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,629
reviewing a paper
is very simple you just have to find a

8286
02:15:28,629 --> 02:15:28,639
is very simple you just have to find a
 

8287
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:30,629
is very simple you just have to find a
flaw in the paper right so

8288
02:15:30,629 --> 02:15:30,639
flaw in the paper right so
 

8289
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:32,629
flaw in the paper right so
basically they see their task as finding

8290
02:15:32,629 --> 02:15:32,639
basically they see their task as finding
 

8291
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:33,750
basically they see their task as finding
flaws

8292
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:33,760
flaws
 

8293
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,830
flaws
in papers and most papers have flaws

8294
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:35,840
in papers and most papers have flaws
 

8295
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,510
in papers and most papers have flaws
even the good ones yeah

8296
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:37,520
even the good ones yeah
 

8297
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,550
even the good ones yeah
um so it's it's easy to you know

8298
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:40,560
um so it's it's easy to you know
 

8299
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,950
um so it's it's easy to you know
to do that you your job is

8300
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:42,960
to do that you your job is
 

8301
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,709
to do that you your job is
easier as a reviewer

8302
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:44,719
easier as a reviewer
 

8303
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:46,550
easier as a reviewer
if you just focus on this but what's

8304
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:46,560
if you just focus on this but what's
 

8305
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:48,870
if you just focus on this but what's
important is

8306
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:48,880
important is
 

8307
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:51,430
important is
like is there a new idea in that paper

8308
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,440
like is there a new idea in that paper
 

8309
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:53,910
like is there a new idea in that paper
that is likely to influence

8310
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:53,920
that is likely to influence
 

8311
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:55,430
that is likely to influence
it doesn't matter if the experiments are

8312
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:55,440
it doesn't matter if the experiments are
 

8313
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,270
it doesn't matter if the experiments are
not that great if the protocol is you

8314
02:15:57,270 --> 02:15:57,280
not that great if the protocol is you
 

8315
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,470
not that great if the protocol is you
know

8316
02:15:58,470 --> 02:15:58,480
know
 

8317
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:59,669
know
uh

8318
02:15:59,669 --> 02:15:59,679
uh
 

8319
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:01,589
uh
so so you know things like that as long

8320
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
so so you know things like that as long
 

8321
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,950
so so you know things like that as long
as there is a worthy idea in it

8322
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:04,960
as there is a worthy idea in it
 

8323
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,629
as there is a worthy idea in it
that will influence the way people think

8324
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:06,639
that will influence the way people think
 

8325
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:08,470
that will influence the way people think
about the problem

8326
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:08,480
about the problem
 

8327
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:10,470
about the problem
um even if they make it better you know

8328
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:10,480
um even if they make it better you know
 

8329
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:12,790
um even if they make it better you know
eventually i think that's uh that's

8330
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:12,800
eventually i think that's uh that's
 

8331
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,350
eventually i think that's uh that's
really what what makes a paper useful

8332
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
really what what makes a paper useful
 

8333
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,550
really what what makes a paper useful
and so

8334
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:16,560
and so
 

8335
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:19,430
and so
this combination of uh social phenomena

8336
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:19,440
this combination of uh social phenomena
 

8337
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,589
this combination of uh social phenomena
creates a a

8338
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
creates a a
 

8339
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:24,069
creates a a
a disease that has plagued you know

8340
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:24,079
a disease that has plagued you know
 

8341
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:25,430
a disease that has plagued you know
other fields in the past like speech

8342
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:25,440
other fields in the past like speech
 

8343
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,350
other fields in the past like speech
recognition where basically you know

8344
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
recognition where basically you know
 

8345
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,750
recognition where basically you know
people chase numbers on uh

8346
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:29,760
people chase numbers on uh
 

8347
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,589
people chase numbers on uh
on benchmarks

8348
02:16:31,589 --> 02:16:31,599
on benchmarks
 

8349
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:32,469
on benchmarks
and

8350
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479
and
 

8351
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:33,990
and
and it's much easier to get a paper

8352
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:34,000
and it's much easier to get a paper
 

8353
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,309
and it's much easier to get a paper
accepted if it brings an incremental

8354
02:16:36,309 --> 02:16:36,319
accepted if it brings an incremental
 

8355
02:16:36,319 --> 02:16:38,070
accepted if it brings an incremental
improvement on a

8356
02:16:38,070 --> 02:16:38,080
improvement on a
 

8357
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:40,870
improvement on a
sort of mainstream well-accepted

8358
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:40,880
sort of mainstream well-accepted

02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:42,230
sort of mainstream well-accepted
method

8360
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:42,240

or problem

8362
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,000
or problem
 

8363
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,070
or problem
and those are to me boring papers i mean

8364
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:46,080
and those are to me boring papers i mean
 

8365
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,709
and those are to me boring papers i mean
they're not useless right because uh

8366
02:16:48,709 --> 02:16:48,719
they're not useless right because uh
 

8367
02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:50,870
they're not useless right because uh
industries you know strives on on those

8368
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:50,880
industries you know strives on on those
 

8369
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,070
industries you know strives on on those
kind of progress

8370
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,080
kind of progress
 

8371
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,190
kind of progress
but they're not the one that i'm

8372
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:53,200
but they're not the one that i'm
 

8373
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,629
but they're not the one that i'm
interested in in terms of like new

8374
02:16:54,629 --> 02:16:54,639
interested in in terms of like new
 

8375
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:56,870
interested in in terms of like new
concepts and new ideas so uh papers that

concepts and new ideas so uh papers that
 

8377
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,389
concepts and new ideas so uh papers that
are really uh

8378
02:16:58,389 --> 02:16:58,399
are really uh
 

8379

trying to strike kind of new advances
 

8381
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,389
trying to strike kind of new advances
generally don't make it

you know if if your evaluation of papers
is

8596
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:34,560
is
 

8597
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,630
is
predictive of future success yes yes

8598
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:36,640
predictive of future success yes yes
 

8599
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:37,429
predictive of future success yes yes
okay

8600
02:20:37,429 --> 02:20:37,439
okay
 

8601
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:39,750
okay
then your reputation should go up as a

8602
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:39,760
then your reputation should go up as a
 

8603
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:42,469
then your reputation should go up as a
reviewing entity

8604
02:20:42,469 --> 02:20:42,479
reviewing entity
 

8605
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:44,550
reviewing entity
so yeah exactly i mean that

8606
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:44,560
so yeah exactly i mean that
 

8607
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:46,469
so yeah exactly i mean that
um i even had a master's student who was

8608
02:20:46,469 --> 02:20:46,479
um i even had a master's student who was
 

8609
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:47,190
um i even had a master's student who was
a

8610
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:47,200
a
 

8611
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,429
a
master student in uh library science and

8612
02:20:49,429 --> 02:20:49,439
master student in uh library science and
 

8613
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:51,030
master student in uh library science and
computer science actually kind of work

8614
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,040
computer science actually kind of work
 

8615
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,349
computer science actually kind of work
out exactly how that should work with

8616
02:20:53,349 --> 02:20:53,359
out exactly how that should work with
 

8617
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,830
out exactly how that should work with
formulas and everything but so in terms

8618
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:55,840
formulas and everything but so in terms
 

8619
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,110
formulas and everything but so in terms
of implementation do you think that's

8620
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,120
of implementation do you think that's
 

8621
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,950
of implementation do you think that's
something that's doable i mean i've been

8622
02:20:58,950 --> 02:20:58,960
something that's doable i mean i've been
 

8623
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,870
something that's doable i mean i've been
sort of you know talking about this to

8624
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:00,880
sort of you know talking about this to
 

8625
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,790
sort of you know talking about this to
sort of various people like you know

8626
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:02,800
sort of various people like you know
 

8627
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:05,750
sort of various people like you know
andrew mccallum who started open review

8628
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,760
andrew mccallum who started open review
 

8629
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,590
andrew mccallum who started open review
and the reason why we picked open review

8630
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:07,600
and the reason why we picked open review
 

8631
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:09,510
and the reason why we picked open review
for iclear initially even though it was

8632
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
for iclear initially even though it was
 

8633
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,270
for iclear initially even though it was
very early for them

8634
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,280
very early for them
 

8635
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,270
very early for them
is because my hope was that

8636
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:13,280
is because my hope was that
 

8637
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:15,270
is because my hope was that
iclear were it was eventually going to

8638
02:21:15,270 --> 02:21:15,280
iclear were it was eventually going to
 

8639
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,550
iclear were it was eventually going to
kind of

8640
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:16,560
kind of
 

8641
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:19,190
kind of
inaugurate this type of system so iclear

8642
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:19,200
inaugurate this type of system so iclear
 

8643
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:22,070
inaugurate this type of system so iclear
kept the idea of open reviews

8644
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:22,080
kept the idea of open reviews
 

8645
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,670
kept the idea of open reviews
so where the reviews are you know

8646
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:23,680
so where the reviews are you know
 

8647
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:25,590
so where the reviews are you know
published with the paper which i think

8648
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:25,600
published with the paper which i think
 

8649
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,270
published with the paper which i think
is very useful

8650
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:27,280
is very useful
 

8651
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:28,150
is very useful
but

8652
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,160
but
 

8653
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,830
but
in many ways that's kind of reverted to

8654
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:29,840
in many ways that's kind of reverted to
 

8655
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,030
in many ways that's kind of reverted to
kind of more of a

8656
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:31,040
kind of more of a
 

8657
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,349
kind of more of a
conventional type conferences for

8658
02:21:33,349 --> 02:21:33,359
conventional type conferences for
 

8659
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:35,190
conventional type conferences for
everything else and that

8660
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:35,200
everything else and that
 

8661
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,630
everything else and that
i mean i

8662
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:36,640
i mean i
 

8663
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:39,110
i mean i
i don't run ikea i'm just the president

8664
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:39,120
i don't run ikea i'm just the president
 

8665
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,550
i don't run ikea i'm just the president
of the

8666
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:40,560
of the
 

8667
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,630
of the
foundation but um

8668
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:42,640
foundation but um
 

8669
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,389
foundation but um
you know people who run it should make

8670
02:21:44,389 --> 02:21:44,399
you know people who run it should make
 

8671
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:45,670
you know people who run it should make
decisions about how to run it and i'm

8672
02:21:45,670 --> 02:21:45,680
decisions about how to run it and i'm
 

8673
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,190
decisions about how to run it and i'm
not going to tell them

8674
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:47,200
not going to tell them
 

8675
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:48,950
not going to tell them
because they're volunteers and i'm

8676
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:48,960
because they're volunteers and i'm
 

8677
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:51,349
because they're volunteers and i'm
really thankful that they do that so but

8678
02:21:51,349 --> 02:21:51,359
really thankful that they do that so but
 

8679
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:53,670
really thankful that they do that so but
i'm saddened by the fact that

8680
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:53,680
i'm saddened by the fact that
 

8681
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:55,190
i'm saddened by the fact that
we're not being

8682
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
we're not being
 

8683
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,870
we're not being
innovative enough

8684
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:56,880
innovative enough
 

8685
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:00,309
innovative enough
yeah me too i hope that changes uh yeah

8686
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:00,319
yeah me too i hope that changes uh yeah
 

8687
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:01,510
yeah me too i hope that changes uh yeah
because the communication of science

8688
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:01,520
because the communication of science
 

8689
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:03,030
because the communication of science
broadly but communication computer

8690
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:03,040
broadly but communication computer
 

8691
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,349
broadly but communication computer
science ideas

8692
02:22:05,349 --> 02:22:05,359
science ideas
 

8693
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,910
science ideas
is how you make those ideas have impact

8694
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
is how you make those ideas have impact
 

8695
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,590
is how you make those ideas have impact
i think yeah and i think you know a lot

8696
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:09,600
i think yeah and i think you know a lot
 

8697
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,870
i think yeah and i think you know a lot
of this is um because people have in

8698
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:12,880
of this is um because people have in
 

8699
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:13,990
of this is um because people have in
their mind

8700
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
their mind
 

8701
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,070
their mind
kind of an objective

8702
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:16,080
kind of an objective
 

8703
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:19,110
kind of an objective
which is you know fairness for authors

8704
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:19,120
which is you know fairness for authors
 

8705
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,590
which is you know fairness for authors
and the ability to count points

8706
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:21,600
and the ability to count points
 

8707
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,349
and the ability to count points
basically and and give credits

8708
02:22:23,349 --> 02:22:23,359
basically and and give credits
 

8709
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:24,630
basically and and give credits
accurately

8710
02:22:24,630 --> 02:22:24,640
accurately
 

8711
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:27,110
accurately
but that comes at the expense of the

8712
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:27,120
but that comes at the expense of the
 

8713
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:28,630
but that comes at the expense of the
progress of science

8714
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:28,640
progress of science
 

8715
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:30,389
progress of science
so to some extent we're slowing down the

8716
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:30,399
so to some extent we're slowing down the
 

8717
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:31,990
so to some extent we're slowing down the
progress of science

8718
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:32,000
progress of science
 

8719
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,150
progress of science
and are we actually achieving fairness

8720
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
and are we actually achieving fairness
 

8721
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:35,910
and are we actually achieving fairness
and we're not achieving fairness you

8722
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:35,920
and we're not achieving fairness you
 

8723
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:38,469
and we're not achieving fairness you
know we have biases you know we're doing

8724
02:22:38,469 --> 02:22:38,479
know we have biases you know we're doing
 

8725
02:22:38,479 --> 02:22:40,630
know we have biases you know we're doing
you know double blind review but

8726
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:40,640
you know double blind review but
 

8727
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,150
you know double blind review but
uh

8728
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,160
uh
 

8729
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:44,230
uh
you know the the biases are still there

8730
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:44,240
you know the the biases are still there
 

8731
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:45,270
you know the the biases are still there
there are different different kinds of

8735
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:48,469

you write that the phenomenon of
 

8737
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:50,630
you write that the phenomenon of

you shake the box gently and the magnets
 

8909
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,150
you shake the box gently and the magnets
will kind of stick to themselves and

lots of examples neural nets are an

8920
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:58,960
lots of examples neural nets are an
 

8921
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:01,030
lots of examples neural nets are an
example of self-organization to

8922
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:01,040
example of self-organization to
 

8923
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:02,870
example of self-organization to
you know in many respects

8924
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:02,880
you know in many respects
 

8925
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,510
you know in many respects
and it's a it's a bit of a mystery um

8926
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,520
and it's a it's a bit of a mystery um
 

8927
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,790
and it's a it's a bit of a mystery um
you know how

8928
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:06,800
you know how
 

8929
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:09,030
you know how
like what what is possible with this um

8930
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,040
like what what is possible with this um
 

8931
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,550
like what what is possible with this um
you know pattern formation in physical

8932
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:10,560
you know pattern formation in physical
 

8933
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,750
you know pattern formation in physical
systems

8934
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:11,760
systems
 

8935
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:13,590
systems
in chaotic system and things like that

8936
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,600
in chaotic system and things like that
 

8937
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,910
in chaotic system and things like that
you know you know the emergence of life

8938
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:15,920
you know you know the emergence of life
 

8939
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:17,190
you know you know the emergence of life
you know things like that so you know

8940
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:17,200
you know things like that so you know
 

8941
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,150
you know things like that so you know
how does

8942
02:26:18,150 --> 02:26:18,160
how does
 

8943
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,349
how does
does that happen

8944
02:26:19,349 --> 02:26:19,359
does that happen
 

8945
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:21,429
does that happen
it's a it's a big puzzle for for

8946
02:26:21,429 --> 02:26:21,439
it's a it's a big puzzle for for
 

8947
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:23,030
it's a it's a big puzzle for for
physicists as well it feels like

8948
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:23,040
physicists as well it feels like
 

8949
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:24,630
physicists as well it feels like
understanding this

8950
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:24,640
understanding this
 

8951
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,550
understanding this
the the mathematics

8952
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,560
the the mathematics
 

8953
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:28,790
the the mathematics
of emergence in some constrained

02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
of emergence in some constrained
 

8955
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,630
of emergence in some constrained
situations might help us create

8956
02:26:30,630 --> 02:26:30,640
situations might help us create
 

8957
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:32,070

intelligence

8958
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:32,080
intelligence
 

8959
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:35,190
intelligence
like uh help us add a little spice to

8960
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:35,200
like uh help us add a little spice to
 

8961
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:37,830
like uh help us add a little spice to
the systems because um you seem to be

8962
02:26:37,830 --> 02:26:37,840
the systems because um you seem to be
 

8963
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:39,429
the systems because um you seem to be
able to

8964
02:26:39,429 --> 02:26:39,439
able to
 

8965
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:42,150
able to
in complex systems with emergence to be

8966
02:26:42,150 --> 02:26:42,160
in complex systems with emergence to be
 

8967
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:44,469
in complex systems with emergence to be
able to get a lot from little

8968
02:26:44,469 --> 02:26:44,479
able to get a lot from little
 

8969
02:26:44,479 --> 02:26:46,870
able to get a lot from little
and so that seems like a shortcut

8970
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
and so that seems like a shortcut
 

8971
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,670
and so that seems like a shortcut
to get big leaps in performance

8972
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:49,680
to get big leaps in performance
 

8973
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,910
to get big leaps in performance
but um but there's there's a missing

8974
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:51,920
but um but there's there's a missing
 

8975
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:54,309
but um but there's there's a missing
conservative concept that we are we

8976
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
conservative concept that we are we
 

8977
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,630
conservative concept that we are we
don't have yeah uh and it's uh it's

8978
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:56,640
don't have yeah uh and it's uh it's
 

8979
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,309
don't have yeah uh and it's uh it's
something also i've been fascinated by

8980
02:26:58,309 --> 02:26:58,319
something also i've been fascinated by
 

8981
02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:01,030
something also i've been fascinated by
since uh my undergrad days and it's how

8982
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:01,040
since uh my undergrad days and it's how
 

8983
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,510
since uh my undergrad days and it's how
you measure complexity

8984
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:03,520
you measure complexity
 

8985
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:05,750
you measure complexity
right so we don't actually have good

8986
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:05,760
right so we don't actually have good
 

8987
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,670
right so we don't actually have good
ways of measuring or at least we don't

8988
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:07,680
ways of measuring or at least we don't
 

8989
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,670
ways of measuring or at least we don't
have good ways of interpreting

8990
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:09,680
have good ways of interpreting
 

8991
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,110
have good ways of interpreting
the measures that we we have at our

8992
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,120
the measures that we we have at our
 

8993
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,469
the measures that we we have at our
disposal like how do you measure the

8994
02:27:12,469 --> 02:27:12,479
disposal like how do you measure the
 

8995
02:27:12,479 --> 02:27:14,710
disposal like how do you measure the
complexity of something right so there's

8996
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:14,720
complexity of something right so there's
 

8997
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:16,230
complexity of something right so there's
all those things you know like you know

8998
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:16,240
all those things you know like you know
 

8999
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:17,750
all those things you know like you know
common goal of chatting solomon of

9000
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:17,760
common goal of chatting solomon of
 

9001
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:19,910
common goal of chatting solomon of
complexity of you know the length of the

9002
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:19,920
complexity of you know the length of the
 

9003
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,670
complexity of you know the length of the
shortest program that would generate a b

9004
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:21,680
shortest program that would generate a b
 

9005
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:23,670
shortest program that would generate a b
string can be thought of as the

9006
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:23,680
string can be thought of as the
 

9007
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:25,750
string can be thought of as the
complexity of that bit string right

9008
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:25,760
complexity of that bit string right
 

9009
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:26,630
complexity of that bit string right
um

9010
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:26,640
um
 

9011
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:28,150
um
i've been fascinated by that concept the

9012
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:28,160
i've been fascinated by that concept the
 

9013
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:31,429
i've been fascinated by that concept the
problem with that is that

9014
02:27:31,429 --> 02:27:31,439
problem with that is that
 

9015
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:33,270
problem with that is that
that complexity is defined up to a

9016
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:33,280
that complexity is defined up to a
 

9017
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,750
that complexity is defined up to a
constant which can be very large

9018
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:35,760
constant which can be very large
 

9019
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,590
constant which can be very large
right there's there are similar concepts

9020
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,600
right there's there are similar concepts
 

9021
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,710
right there's there are similar concepts
that are derived from you know

9022
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:40,720
that are derived from you know
 

9023
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:43,270
that are derived from you know
you know bayesian probability theory

9024
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:43,280
you know bayesian probability theory
 

9025
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,030
you know bayesian probability theory
where you know the complexity of

9026
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:45,040
where you know the complexity of
 

9027
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,230
where you know the complexity of
something is

9028
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:46,240
something is
 

9029
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,230
something is
the negative log of its probability

9030
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:48,240
the negative log of its probability
 

9031
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,670
the negative log of its probability
essentially right and you have a

9032
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,680
essentially right and you have a
 

9033
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:50,950
essentially right and you have a
complete equivalence between the two

9034
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:50,960
complete equivalence between the two
 

9035
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,070
complete equivalence between the two
things

9036
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,080
things
 

9037
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:53,190
things
and there you would think you know the

9038
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:53,200
and there you would think you know the
 

9039
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,110
and there you would think you know the
probability is something that's well

9040
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:55,120
probability is something that's well
 

9041
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,630
probability is something that's well
defined mathematically which means

9042
02:27:56,630 --> 02:27:56,640
defined mathematically which means
 

9043
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:58,469
defined mathematically which means
complexity is well-defined but it's not

9044
02:27:58,469 --> 02:27:58,479
complexity is well-defined but it's not
 

9045
02:27:58,479 --> 02:28:00,469
complexity is well-defined but it's not
true you need to have a model of

9046
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:00,479
true you need to have a model of
 

9047
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:02,230
true you need to have a model of
of of the distribution

9048
02:28:02,230 --> 02:28:02,240
of of the distribution
 

9049
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:03,750
of of the distribution
and you may need to have a prior if

9050
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:03,760
and you may need to have a prior if
 

9051
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,190
and you may need to have a prior if
you're doing bayesian inference and the

9052
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:05,200
you're doing bayesian inference and the
 

9053
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,270
you're doing bayesian inference and the
prior plays the same role as the choice

9054
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:07,280
prior plays the same role as the choice
 

9055
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:08,550
prior plays the same role as the choice
of the computer with which you measure

9056
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:08,560
of the computer with which you measure
 

9057
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,349
of the computer with which you measure
your graph complexity and so every

9058
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
your graph complexity and so every
 

9059
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:13,270
your graph complexity and so every
measure of complexity we have has some

9060
02:28:13,270 --> 02:28:13,280
measure of complexity we have has some
 

9061
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,110
measure of complexity we have has some
arbitrary necessity

9062
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
arbitrary necessity
 

9063
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,150
arbitrary necessity
um

9064
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:16,160
um
 

9065
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:18,710
um
you know an additive constant which

9066
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:18,720
you know an additive constant which
 

9067
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:21,830
you know an additive constant which
is can be arbitrarily large and so

9068
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:21,840
is can be arbitrarily large and so
 

9069
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:23,670
is can be arbitrarily large and so
you know how can we come up with a good

9070
02:28:23,670 --> 02:28:23,680
you know how can we come up with a good
 

9071
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,429
you know how can we come up with a good
theory of how things become more complex

9072
02:28:25,429 --> 02:28:25,439
theory of how things become more complex
 

9073
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:26,230
theory of how things become more complex
if we don't have a good measure of

9074
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:26,240
if we don't have a good measure of
 

9075
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,030
if we don't have a good measure of
complexity yeah which we need for this

9076
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,040
complexity yeah which we need for this
 

9077
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,510
complexity yeah which we need for this
one way that people study this in the

9078
02:28:31,510 --> 02:28:31,520
one way that people study this in the
 

9079
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:33,590
one way that people study this in the

how do we recognize this life

9090
02:28:44,469 --> 02:28:44,479
how do we recognize this life
 

9091
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:46,630
how do we recognize this life
because you know complexity we associate

9092
02:28:46,630 --> 02:28:46,640
because you know complexity we associate
 

9093
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,950
because you know complexity we associate
complexity maybe some level of mobility

02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:13,840
an image of the endless digits right and
 

9117
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:16,309
an image of the endless digits right and
i flip through any digits there is some

i flip through any digits there is some
 

9119
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:17,910
i flip through any digits there is some
obviously some

02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:28,240
now imagine that
 

9131
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:31,110
now imagine that
i apply a random permutation to all the

9143
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:42,710

in fact they're not more complex in
 

9145
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,309
in fact they're not more complex in
absolute terms they're exactly the same

02:29:44,309 --> 02:29:44,319
absolute terms they're exactly the same
 

9147
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:46,469
absolute terms they're exactly the same
as originally right and if you knew what

9148
02:29:46,469 --> 02:29:46,479
as originally right and if you knew what
 

9149
02:29:46,479 --> 02:29:48,150
as originally right and if you knew what
the permutation was you know you could

9150
02:29:48,150 --> 02:29:48,160
the permutation was you know you could
 

9151
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:51,110
the permutation was you know you could
undo the permutation now

9152
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:51,120
undo the permutation now
 

9153
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,950
undo the permutation now
imagine i give you special glasses that

9154
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:52,960
imagine i give you special glasses that
 

9155
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:54,469
imagine i give you special glasses that
undo that permutation

9156
02:29:54,469 --> 02:29:54,479
undo that permutation
 

9157
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:55,990
undo that permutation
now all of a sudden what looked

9158
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
now all of a sudden what looked
 

9159
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,710
now all of a sudden what looked
complicated becomes simple right so if

9160
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
complicated becomes simple right so if
 

9161
02:29:58,720 --> 02:29:59,990
complicated becomes simple right so if
you have two

9162
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:00,000
you have two
 

9163
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,070
you have two
if you have you know humans on one end

9164
02:30:02,070 --> 02:30:02,080
if you have you know humans on one end
 

9165
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:03,830
if you have you know humans on one end
and then another race of aliens that

9166
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:03,840
and then another race of aliens that
 

9167
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,349
and then another race of aliens that
sees the universe with permutation

9168
02:30:05,349 --> 02:30:05,359
sees the universe with permutation
 

9169
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:06,790
sees the universe with permutation
glasses yeah with the permutation

9170
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:06,800
glasses yeah with the permutation
 

9171
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,550
glasses yeah with the permutation
glasses

9172
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:08,560
glasses
 

9173
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:10,309
glasses
what we perceive as simple to them is

9174
02:30:10,309 --> 02:30:10,319
what we perceive as simple to them is
 

9175
02:30:10,319 --> 02:30:12,230
what we perceive as simple to them is
hardly complicated it's probably heat

9176
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:12,240
hardly complicated it's probably heat
 

9177
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,550
hardly complicated it's probably heat
yeah heat yeah okay and what they

9178
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:14,560
yeah heat yeah okay and what they
 

9179
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:17,510
yeah heat yeah okay and what they
perceive as simple to us is is random uh

9180
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:17,520
perceive as simple to us is is random uh
 

9181
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:20,309
perceive as simple to us is is random uh
fluctuation it's heat yeah

9182
02:30:20,309 --> 02:30:20,319
fluctuation it's heat yeah
 

9183
02:30:20,319 --> 02:30:22,630
fluctuation it's heat yeah
so truly in the eye of the beholder it

9184
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
so truly in the eye of the beholder it
 

9185
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:23,910
so truly in the eye of the beholder it
depends what kind of glasses you're

9186
02:30:23,910 --> 02:30:23,920
depends what kind of glasses you're
 

9187
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:25,590
depends what kind of glasses you're
wearing right depends what kind of

9188
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
wearing right depends what kind of
 

9189
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,030
wearing right depends what kind of
algorithm you're running in your

9190
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:27,040
algorithm you're running in your
 

9191
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,030
algorithm you're running in your
perception system so i don't think we'll

9192
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
perception system so i don't think we'll
 

9193
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,950
perception system so i don't think we'll
have a theory of intelligence

9194
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:30,960
have a theory of intelligence
 

9195
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:33,590
have a theory of intelligence
self-organization evolution things like

9196
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:33,600
self-organization evolution things like
 

9197
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:37,030
self-organization evolution things like
that until we have a good handle on

9198
02:30:37,030 --> 02:30:37,040
that until we have a good handle on
 

9199
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,110
that until we have a good handle on
a notion of complexity which we know is

9200
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:39,120
a notion of complexity which we know is
 

9201
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:42,230
a notion of complexity which we know is
in the higher the eye of the beholder

9202
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,240
in the higher the eye of the beholder
 

9203
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,990
in the higher the eye of the beholder
yeah it's sad to think that we might not

9204
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:44,000
yeah it's sad to think that we might not
 

9205
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,630
yeah it's sad to think that we might not
be able to detect or interact with alien

9206
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:46,640
be able to detect or interact with alien
 

9207
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:48,630
be able to detect or interact with alien
species because we're wearing different

glasses
 

9211
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:51,349
glasses
um because their notion of locality

9212
02:30:51,349 --> 02:30:51,359
um because their notion of locality
 

9213
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:52,950
um because their notion of locality
might be different from ours yeah this

9214
02:30:52,950 --> 02:30:52,960
might be different from ours yeah this
 

9215
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,790

actually connects with fascinating
 

9217
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,150
actually connects with fascinating
questions in physics at the moment like

02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:56,160
questions in physics at the moment like
 

9219
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:57,990
questions in physics at the moment like

9223
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:01,349
quantum physics like you know
questions about like you know can we

9224
02:31:01,349 --> 02:31:01,359
questions about like you know can we
 

9225
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:03,030
questions about like you know can we
recover the information that's lost in a

02:31:03,030 --> 02:31:03,040
recover the information that's lost in a
 

9227
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:04,469
recover the information that's lost in a
black hole and things like this right

9228
02:31:04,469 --> 02:31:04,479
black hole and things like this right
 

9229
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:06,950
black hole and things like this right
and uh and that relies on notions of

02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
and uh and that relies on notions of
 

9231
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,870
and uh and that relies on notions of

9233
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:10,469

little was building model airplanes and
 

9263
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:40,389
little was building model airplanes and
stuff like that and i still do that to

9264
02:31:40,389 --> 02:31:40,399
stuff like that and i still do that to
 

9265

but also electronics i taught myself
 

9269
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,150
but also electronics i taught myself
electronics before i studied it

i always wanted to play improvised music
even though i don't know anything about

9338
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
even though i don't know anything about

was to
 

9347
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:03,830
was to
play electronic instruments so they

9348
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:03,840
play electronic instruments so they
 

9349
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,670
play electronic instruments so they
behave like the fingering is similar to

9350
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:05,680
behave like the fingering is similar to
 

9351
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:08,070
behave like the fingering is similar to
a saxophone but you know you have wide

9352
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:08,080
a saxophone but you know you have wide
 

9353
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:09,670
a saxophone but you know you have wide
variety of sound because you control the

9354
02:33:09,670 --> 02:33:09,680
variety of sound because you control the
 

9355
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,150
variety of sound because you control the
synthesizer with it so i had a bunch of

9356
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:12,160
synthesizer with it so i had a bunch of
 

9357
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:13,910
synthesizer with it so i had a bunch of
those you know going back to the late

9358
02:33:13,910 --> 02:33:13,920
those you know going back to the late
 

9359
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,429
those you know going back to the late
80s

9360
02:33:15,429 --> 02:33:15,439
80s
 

9361
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:16,790
80s
from either

akai they they're both kind of the main
 

9367
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:22,790
akai they they're both kind of the main
manufacturers of those so they were

9368
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:22,800
manufacturers of those so they were
 

9369
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,150

uh but i've never been completely
satisfied with them because of lack of

9376
02:33:28,309 --> 02:33:28,319
satisfied with them because of lack of
 

9377
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,950
satisfied with them because of lack of
exclusivity

9378

and you know those things you know are
 

9381
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:33,750
and you know those things you know are
somewhat expensive i mean they measure

somewhat expensive i mean they measure
 

9383
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:35,750
somewhat expensive i mean they measure
the breast pressure they measure the lip

9384

for machine learning
 

9657
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,030
for machine learning
uh basically comes out of uh was figured

9658
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:07,040
uh basically comes out of uh was figured
 

9659
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:08,950
uh basically comes out of uh was figured
out by statistical physicists in the you

9660
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:08,960
out by statistical physicists in the you
 

9661
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:10,870
out by statistical physicists in the you
know late 19th early 20th century right

9662
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:10,880
know late 19th early 20th century right
 

9663
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:11,990
know late 19th early 20th century right
so

9664
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,000
so
 

9665
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,590
so
uh and for some of them actually more

9666
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:13,600
uh and for some of them actually more
 

9667
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:15,590
uh and for some of them actually more
recently for by people like giorgio

9668
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:15,600
recently for by people like giorgio

9673
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:22,710
the replica method among other things um
it's used for a lot of different things

9674
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:22,720
it's used for a lot of different things
 

9675
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:25,510

uh you know variational inference

9676
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
uh you know variational inference
 

9677
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,550
uh you know variational inference
that math comes from statistical physics

9678
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:28,560
that math comes from statistical physics
 

9679

um
 

9683
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,790
um
so a lot of those kind of you know

9684
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:32,800
so a lot of those kind of you know
 

9685
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:35,190
so a lot of those kind of you know

is uh figuring out how to make fusion

9778
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:10,080
is uh figuring out how to make fusion
 

9779
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:11,750
is uh figuring out how to make fusion
work now the problem with fusion is that

9780
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:11,760
work now the problem with fusion is that
 

9781
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,670
work now the problem with fusion is that
you make a super hot plasma and the

9782
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:13,680
you make a super hot plasma and the
 

9783
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,429
you make a super hot plasma and the
plasma is unstable and you can't control

9784
02:40:15,429 --> 02:40:15,439
plasma is unstable and you can't control
 

9785
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:17,269
plasma is unstable and you can't control
it maybe with deep learning you can find

9786
02:40:17,269 --> 02:40:17,279
it maybe with deep learning you can find
 

9787
02:40:17,279 --> 02:40:19,030
it maybe with deep learning you can find
controllers that will sterilize plasma

i mean that's very speculative but you
 

9795
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:25,429
i mean that's very speculative but you
know it's worth trying because

and this is not even talking about all
 

9863
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:33,990
and this is not even talking about all
the sort of medicine biology and and

02:41:33,990 --> 02:41:34,000
the sort of medicine biology and and
 

9865
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,510
the sort of medicine biology and and
everything like that right

9866
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
everything like that right
 

9867
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:36,870
everything like that right
you know like you know

9868
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:36,880
you know like you know
 

9869
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:39,030
you know like you know
protein folding you know figuring out

9870
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:39,040
protein folding you know figuring out
 

9871
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:40,389
protein folding you know figuring out
like how can you design your proteins

9872
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:40,399
like how can you design your proteins
 

9873
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:41,910
like how can you design your proteins
that it sticks to another protein at a

9874
02:41:41,910 --> 02:41:41,920
that it sticks to another protein at a
 

9875
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:43,269
that it sticks to another protein at a
particular site because that's how you

9876
02:41:43,269 --> 02:41:43,279
particular site because that's how you
 

9877
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:45,269
particular site because that's how you
design drugs in the end

9878
02:41:45,269 --> 02:41:45,279
design drugs in the end
 

9879
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:47,429
design drugs in the end
um so you know diploma would be used for

9880
02:41:47,429 --> 02:41:47,439
um so you know diploma would be used for
 

9881
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:48,950
um so you know diploma would be used for
all of this and those are kind of you

9882
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:48,960
all of this and those are kind of you
 

9883
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:51,030
all of this and those are kind of you
know would be sort of enormous progress

9884
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:51,040
know would be sort of enormous progress
 

9885
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,510
know would be sort of enormous progress
if we could uh use it for that here's an

9886
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:53,520
if we could uh use it for that here's an
 

9887
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:55,429
if we could uh use it for that here's an
example if you take

9888
02:41:55,429 --> 02:41:55,439
example if you take
 

9889
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:57,429
example if you take
this is like from recent material

9890
02:41:57,429 --> 02:41:57,439
this is like from recent material
 

9891
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:01,190
this is like from recent material

physics you take a monoatomic layer of
 

9893
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:03,429
physics you take a monoatomic layer of
graphene right so it's just carbon

02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:05,830
graphene right so it's just carbon
on a hexagonal mesh and you make this

9896
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:05,840
on a hexagonal mesh and you make this
 

9897
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:08,870
on a hexagonal mesh and you make this
single single atom thick

9898

single single atom thick
 

9899
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,630

you put another one on top you twist

9900
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:10,640
you put another one on top you twist
 

9901
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:12,950
you put another one on top you twist
them by some magic number of degrees

it becomes super conductor

9906
02:42:16,550 --> 02:42:16,560
it becomes super conductor
 

9907
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:20,710
it becomes super conductor
nobody has any idea why

9908
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:20,720

 

9909
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:21,910

uh i want to know how that was

9910
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:21,920
uh i want to know how that was
 

9911
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,190
uh i want to know how that was
discovered but that's the kind of thing

9912
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
discovered but that's the kind of thing
 

9913
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,150
discovered but that's the kind of thing
that machine learning can actually

9914
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:24,160
that machine learning can actually
 

9915
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:26,389
that machine learning can actually
discover these well thanks maybe not but

9916
02:42:26,389 --> 02:42:26,399
discover these well thanks maybe not but
 

9917
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:27,990
discover these well thanks maybe not but
but there is uh

9918
02:42:27,990 --> 02:42:28,000
but there is uh
 

9919
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,990
but there is uh
a hint perhaps that with machine

9920
02:42:29,990 --> 02:42:30,000
a hint perhaps that with machine
 

9921
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,710
a hint perhaps that with machine
learning we could train a system to

9922
02:42:32,710 --> 02:42:32,720
learning we could train a system to
 

9923
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:35,269
learning we could train a system to
basically be a phenomenological model of

superconductivity is one of those
uh

9932
02:42:42,309 --> 02:42:42,319
uh
 

9933
02:42:42,319 --> 02:42:44,150
uh

and you can generate as much data as you

9970
02:43:19,269 --> 02:43:19,279
and you can generate as much data as you
 

9971
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:21,110
and you can generate as much data as you
want by just running computational free

want by just running computational free
 

9973
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:23,110
want by just running computational free
dynamics right so you give a

9974
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,120
dynamics right so you give a
 

9975
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:25,590
dynamics right so you give a
like a

9976
02:43:25,590 --> 02:43:25,600
like a
 

9977
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,030
like a
a wing

9978
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,040
a wing
 

9979
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,510
a wing
airfoil or something shape of some kind

9980
02:43:29,510 --> 02:43:29,520
airfoil or something shape of some kind
 

9981
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:31,269
airfoil or something shape of some kind
and you run computational free dynamics

9982
02:43:31,269 --> 02:43:31,279
and you run computational free dynamics
 

9983
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:33,510
and you run computational free dynamics
you get as a result the

9984
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:33,520
you get as a result the
 

9985
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:36,790
you get as a result the
drag and you know lyft and all that

9986
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:36,800
drag and you know lyft and all that
 

9987
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,790
drag and you know lyft and all that
stuff right and you can you can generate

9988
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:38,800
stuff right and you can you can generate
 

9989
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,950
stuff right and you can you can generate
lots of data train a neural net to make

9990
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:40,960
lots of data train a neural net to make
 

9991
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:42,230
lots of data train a neural net to make
those predictions and now what you have

9992
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:42,240
those predictions and now what you have
 

9993
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:43,990
those predictions and now what you have
is a differentiable model

9994
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:44,000
is a differentiable model
 

9995
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,030
is a differentiable model
of let's say dragon and lift as a

9996
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:47,040
of let's say dragon and lift as a
 

9997
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:48,630
of let's say dragon and lift as a
function of the shape of that solid and

9998
02:43:48,630 --> 02:43:48,640
function of the shape of that solid and
 

9999
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:49,830
function of the shape of that solid and
so you can do backward understand you

10000
02:43:49,830 --> 02:43:49,840
so you can do backward understand you
 

10001
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:51,830
so you can do backward understand you
can optimize the shape so you get the

10002
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:51,840
can optimize the shape so you get the
 

10003
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:54,710
can optimize the shape so you get the
properties you want

10004
02:43:54,710 --> 02:43:54,720

 

10005
02:43:54,720 --> 02:43:56,469

yeah that's incredible that's incredible

10006
02:43:56,469 --> 02:43:56,479
yeah that's incredible that's incredible
 

10007
02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:58,150
yeah that's incredible that's incredible
and on top of all that

10008
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:58,160
and on top of all that
 

10009
02:43:58,160 --> 02:43:59,510
and on top of all that
probably

10010
02:43:59,510 --> 02:43:59,520
probably
 

10011
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:00,630
probably
you should read a little bit of

10012
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:00,640
you should read a little bit of
 

10013
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:03,590
you should read a little bit of
literature and a little bit of history

10014
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:03,600
literature and a little bit of history
 

10015
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:04,469
literature and a little bit of history
for

10016
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
for
 

10017
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:07,030
for
inspiration and for wisdom because after

10018
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:07,040
inspiration and for wisdom because after
 

10019
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,950
inspiration and for wisdom because after
all all these technologies will have to

10020
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:08,960
all all these technologies will have to
 

10021
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:10,790
all all these technologies will have to
work in the human world yes and the

10022
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:10,800
work in the human world yes and the
 

10023
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:14,870
work in the human world yes and the
human world is complicated

10024
02:44:14,870 --> 02:44:14,880

 

10025
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:17,110

yeah and this is um
