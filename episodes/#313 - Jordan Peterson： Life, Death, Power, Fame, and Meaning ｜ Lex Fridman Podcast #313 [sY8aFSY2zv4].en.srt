i guess it's the divine that saves the

definition
 

63
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,350

and then you might say well

64
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
and then you might say well
 

65
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,510
and then you might say well
are there pointers to that which will

66
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
are there pointers to that which will
 

67
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,270
are there pointers to that which will
save the world or that which eternally

68
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
save the world or that which eternally
 

69

save the world or that which eternally
saves the world and

saves the world and
 

71
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,789
saves the world and
the answer to that in all likelihood is

72
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
the answer to that in all likelihood is
 

73
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,149
the answer to that in all likelihood is
yes and that's maybe truth and love and

74
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
yes and that's maybe truth and love and
 

75
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,510
yes and that's maybe truth and love and

and

80
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
the classical virtues beauty
 

81
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,429
the classical virtues beauty
perhaps in some sense foremost among

00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
perhaps in some sense foremost among
 

83
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,670
perhaps in some sense foremost among
them it's a that's a difficult case to

84
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
them it's a that's a difficult case to
 

85
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,670
them it's a that's a difficult case to
make but definitely a pointer which

86
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
make but definitely a pointer which
 

87
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,510
make but definitely a pointer which
direction is the arrow pointing well the

88
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
direction is the arrow pointing well the
 

89
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,590
direction is the arrow pointing well the
arrow is pointing up no i think that

90
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
arrow is pointing up no i think that
 

91
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,389
arrow is pointing up no i think that
that which it points to is what beauty

92
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
that which it points to is what beauty
 

93
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,630
that which it points to is what beauty
points to it transcends beauty it's more

94
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
points to it transcends beauty it's more
 

95
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,069
points to it transcends beauty it's more
than beauty and that speaks to the

96
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
than beauty and that speaks to the
 

97
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,270
than beauty and that speaks to the
divine

98
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
divine
 

99
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,030
divine
it points to the divine

100
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
it points to the divine
 

101
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,030
it points to the divine
yeah and i would say again by definition

102
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
yeah and i would say again by definition
 

103
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,550
yeah and i would say again by definition
because we could define the divine in

104
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
because we could define the divine in
 

105
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,389
because we could define the divine in
some real sense

106
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
some real sense
 

107
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,270
some real sense
so one way of defining the divine is

108
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
so one way of defining the divine is
 

109
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,749
so one way of defining the divine is
what is divine to you is your most

110
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
what is divine to you is your most
 

111
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,990
what is divine to you is your most
fundamental axiom and you might say well

112
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
fundamental axiom and you might say well
 

113
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,149
fundamental axiom and you might say well
i don't have a fundamental axiom then i

114
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
i don't have a fundamental axiom then i
 

115
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,670
i don't have a fundamental axiom then i
would say that's fine but then you're

116
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
would say that's fine but then you're
 

117
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,430
would say that's fine but then you're
just confused

118
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
just confused
 

119
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,389
just confused
because you have a bunch of

120
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
because you have a bunch of
 

121
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,309
because you have a bunch of
contradictory axioms and you might say

122
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
contradictory axioms and you might say
 

123
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150
contradictory axioms and you might say
well i have no axioms at all and then

124
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
well i have no axioms at all and then
 

125
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,190
well i have no axioms at all and then
i'd say well you're just

126
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
i'd say well you're just
 

127
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,110
i'd say well you're just
epistemologically ignorant beyond

128
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
epistemologically ignorant beyond
 

129
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,030
epistemologically ignorant beyond
comprehension if you think that because

130
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
comprehension if you think that because
 

131
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,790
comprehension if you think that because
that's just not true at all but you

132
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
that's just not true at all but you
 

133
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,229
that's just not true at all but you
don't think a human being can exist

134
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
don't think a human being can exist
 

135
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,990
don't think a human being can exist
within contradictions

136
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
within contradictions
 

137
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,589
within contradictions
well yeah we have to exist within

138
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
well yeah we have to exist within
 

139
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,869
well yeah we have to exist within
contradiction but

140
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
contradiction but
 

141
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,470
contradiction but
when the contradictions make themselves

142
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
when the contradictions make themselves
 

143
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,750
when the contradictions make themselves
manifest

144
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
manifest
 

145
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,750
manifest
say in confusion with regard to

146
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
say in confusion with regard to
 

147
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,949
say in confusion with regard to
direction

148
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
direction
 

149
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,830
direction
then

150
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
then
 

151
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,229
then
the consequence of that technically is

152
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
the consequence of that technically is
 

153
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,589
the consequence of that technically is
anxiety

154
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
anxiety
 

155

all sorts of other negative emotions but

all sorts of other negative emotions but
 

159
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,910
all sorts of other negative emotions but
the cardinal negative emotion

the cardinal negative emotion
 

161
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,190

is anxiety it's an entropy signal

166
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
is anxiety it's an entropy signal
 

167
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,949
is anxiety it's an entropy signal
but you don't think that kind of

168
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
but you don't think that kind of
 

169
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,150
but you don't think that kind of
entropy signal can be channeled into

439
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,950
why

440
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
well let's say that flaming swords are a
 

441
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,309
well let's say that flaming swords are a

442
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
symbol of death
 

443
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,629
symbol of death
that seems pretty obvious

444
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
that seems pretty obvious
 

445
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,309
that seems pretty obvious
let's say further

446
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
let's say further
 

447
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,950
let's say further
that they're a symbol of apocalypse and

448
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
that they're a symbol of apocalypse and
 

449
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,710
that they're a symbol of apocalypse and
hell

450
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
hell
 

451
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,990
hell
that doesn't seem completely

452
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
that doesn't seem completely
 

453
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,350
that doesn't seem completely
unreasonable

454
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
unreasonable
 

455
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,070
unreasonable
so here's an idea

456
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
so here's an idea
 

457
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,629
so here's an idea
not only do you have to face death

458
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
not only do you have to face death
 

459

before you can get to paradise

462
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
before you can get to paradise
 

463
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,629
before you can get to paradise

let's try to sneak up to this question
 

683
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
let's try to sneak up to this question
if it's at all possible is it possible

684
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
if it's at all possible is it possible
 

685
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,430
if it's at all possible is it possible
to even

to even
 

687
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,790
to even
talk about this

well it better be because otherwise
 

691
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,389
well it better be because otherwise
there's no communicating about it right

there's no communicating about it right
 

693
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,310
there's no communicating about it right
it it has to be something that can be

it it has to be something that can be
 

695
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,150
it it has to be something that can be
brought down to earth

brought down to earth
 

697
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,150
brought down to earth
well we might be too dumb to bring it

698
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
well we might be too dumb to bring it
 

699

right
 

705
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,629
right
so because there's not knowing and then

706
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
so because there's not knowing and then
 

707
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,110
so because there's not knowing and then
there's not wanting to know or refusing

thrive
 

735
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,430
thrive
how's that for a biological definition

736
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
how's that for a biological definition
 

737
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,269
how's that for a biological definition
spirit is a pattern

738

and you might say well what's the
 

753
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,990
and you might say well what's the
pattern okay well i can tell you that to

the set of all admirable people and you
 

815
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,590
the set of all admirable people and you
extracted out ai learning you extracted

816
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
extracted out ai learning you extracted
 

817
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,110
extracted out ai learning you extracted
out the central features of what

818
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
out the central features of what
 

819
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,110
out the central features of what
constitutes admirable

820
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
constitutes admirable
 

821
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,790
constitutes admirable
and then you did that repeatedly until

822
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
and then you did that repeatedly until
 

823
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,790
and then you did that repeatedly until
you purified it to what was most

824
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
you purified it to what was most
 

825
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,110
you purified it to what was most
admirable

826
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
admirable
 

827
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,430
admirable
that's as good as you're going to get

828
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
that's as good as you're going to get
 

829
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,550
that's as good as you're going to get
in

830
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
in
 

831
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,910
in
in terms of a representation of god

832
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
in terms of a representation of god
 

833
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,110
in terms of a representation of god
and you might say well i don't believe

834
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
and you might say well i don't believe
 

835
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,389
and you might say well i don't believe
in that it's like

836
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
in that it's like
 

837
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,269
in that it's like
well

838
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
well
 

839
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,750
well
what do you mean yeah it's not a set of

840
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
what do you mean yeah it's not a set of
 

841
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,670
what do you mean yeah it's not a set of
propositional facts

842
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
propositional facts
 

843
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,750
propositional facts
it's not a scientific theory about the

844
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
it's not a scientific theory about the
 

845
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,350
it's not a scientific theory about the
structure of the objective world and

846
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
structure of the objective world and
 

847
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,710
structure of the objective world and
then i could say something about that

848
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
then i could say something about that
 

849
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,910
then i could say something about that
too because i've been thinking about

850
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
too because i've been thinking about
 

851
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,509
too because i've been thinking about
this a lot especially since talking to

852
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
this a lot especially since talking to
 

853
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,110
this a lot especially since talking to
richard dawkins

854
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
richard dawkins
 

855
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,949
richard dawkins
it's like okay

856
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
it's like okay
 

857
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,189
it's like okay
the post-modernist types

858
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
the post-modernist types
 

859
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,509
the post-modernist types
going back way before daradan foucault

860
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
going back way before daradan foucault
 

861
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,509
going back way before daradan foucault
maybe back to nietzsche

862
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
maybe back to nietzsche
 

863
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,069
maybe back to nietzsche
who i admire greatly by the way

864
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
who i admire greatly by the way
 

865
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,310
who i admire greatly by the way
he says god is dead

866
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
he says god is dead
 

867
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,670
he says god is dead
it's like okay

868
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
it's like okay
 

869
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,430
it's like okay
but nietzsche said god is dead and we

870
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
but nietzsche said god is dead and we
 

871
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,030
but nietzsche said god is dead and we
have killed him and will not find enough

872
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
have killed him and will not find enough
 

873
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,110
have killed him and will not find enough
water to wash away all the blood so that

874
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
water to wash away all the blood so that
 

875
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,430
water to wash away all the blood so that
was nietzsche he's no fool he's got away

876
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
was nietzsche he's no fool he's got away
 

877
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,590
was nietzsche he's no fool he's got away
with words he certainly does

878
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
with words he certainly does
 

879
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,590
with words he certainly does
and so then you think okay well we

880
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
and so then you think okay well we
 

881
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,150
and so then you think okay well we
killed the transcendent

882
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
killed the transcendent
 

883
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,949
killed the transcendent
well

884
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
well
 

885
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,949
well
what does that mean for science well it

886
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
what does that mean for science well it
 

887
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,430
what does that mean for science well it
frees it up because all that nonsense

888
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
frees it up because all that nonsense
 

889
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,509
frees it up because all that nonsense
about a deity is just the idiot

890
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
about a deity is just the idiot
 

891
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,150
about a deity is just the idiot
superstition that stops the scientific

892
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
superstition that stops the scientific
 

893
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,269
superstition that stops the scientific
um

894
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
um
 

895
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,590
um
what process from moving forward that's

896
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
what process from moving forward that's
 

897
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,189
what process from moving forward that's
basically the new atheist claim

898
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
basically the new atheist claim
 

899
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,269
basically the new atheist claim
something like that it's like wait a

900
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
something like that it's like wait a
 

901
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,710
something like that it's like wait a
second

902
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
second
 

903
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,230
second
do you believe in the transcendent if

904
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
do you believe in the transcendent if
 

905
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,310
do you believe in the transcendent if
you're a scientist

906
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
you're a scientist
 

907
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,230
you're a scientist
and the answer is

908
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
and the answer is
 

909
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,829
and the answer is
well not only do you believe in it you

910
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
well not only do you believe in it you
 

911
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,350
well not only do you believe in it you
believe in it more than anything else

912
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
believe in it more than anything else
 

913
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,509
believe in it more than anything else
because if you're a scientist

914
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
because if you're a scientist
 

915
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,430
because if you're a scientist
you believe in

916
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
you believe in
 

917
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,150
you believe in
what objects to your theory

918
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
what objects to your theory
 

919
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,629
what objects to your theory
more than you believe in your theory now

920
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
more than you believe in your theory now
 

921
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,829
more than you believe in your theory now
we've got to think that through very

922
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
we've got to think that through very
 

923
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,509
we've got to think that through very
carefully so your theory describes the

924
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
carefully so your theory describes the
 

925
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,069
carefully so your theory describes the
world and as far as you're concerned

926
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
world and as far as you're concerned
 

927
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,590
world and as far as you're concerned
your description of the world is the

928
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
your description of the world is the
 

929
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,110
your description of the world is the
world

930
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
world
 

931
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,870
world
but because you're a scientist you think

932
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
but because you're a scientist you think
 

933
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,269
but because you're a scientist you think
well even though that's my description

934
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
well even though that's my description
 

935
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,670
well even though that's my description
of the world and that's what i believe

936
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
of the world and that's what i believe
 

937
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,870
of the world and that's what i believe
there's something beyond what i believe

938
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
there's something beyond what i believe
 

939
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,389
there's something beyond what i believe
and that's the object and so i'm going

940
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
and that's the object and so i'm going
 

941
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,150
and that's the object and so i'm going
to throw my theory against the object

942
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
to throw my theory against the object
 

943
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,749
to throw my theory against the object
and see where it'll break

944
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
and see where it'll break
 

945
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,910
and see where it'll break
and then i'm going to use the evidence

946
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
and then i'm going to use the evidence
 

947
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,189
and then i'm going to use the evidence
of the break

948
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
of the break
 

949
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,030
of the break
as a source of new information to

950
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
as a source of new information to
 

951
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,509
as a source of new information to
revitalize my theory so as a scientist

952
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
revitalize my theory so as a scientist
 

953
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,590
revitalize my theory so as a scientist
you have to posit the existence of the

954
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
you have to posit the existence of the
 

955
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,310
you have to posit the existence of the
ontological transcendent before you can

956
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
ontological transcendent before you can
 

957
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,389
ontological transcendent before you can
move forward at all but more

958
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
move forward at all but more
 

959
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,550
move forward at all but more
you have to pause it that contact with

960
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
you have to pause it that contact with
 

961
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,949
you have to pause it that contact with
the ontological transcendent

962
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
the ontological transcendent
 

963
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,110
the ontological transcendent
annoying though it is because it upsets

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
annoying though it is because it upsets

annoying though it is because it upsets
your apple cart is exactly what will in

966
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
your apple cart is exactly what will in
 

967
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,590
your apple cart is exactly what will in
fact set you free

fact set you free
 

969
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,350
fact set you free
so then you accept the proposition that

970
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
so then you accept the proposition that
 

971
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,310
so then you accept the proposition that
there is a transcendent reality

972
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
there is a transcendent reality
 

973
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,949
there is a transcendent reality
and that the that contact with that

and that the that contact with that
 

975
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,590
and that the that contact with that
transcendent reality is redemptive in

transcendent reality is redemptive in

transcendent reality is redemptive in

set you free as a scientist because you

990
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
set you free as a scientist because you
 

991
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,470
set you free as a scientist because you
assume that you assume i mean freedom in

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
assume that you assume i mean freedom in
 

993
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,150
assume that you assume i mean freedom in
the most fundamental sense it's like

994
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
the most fundamental sense it's like
 

995
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,390
the most fundamental sense it's like
well freedom from want freedom from

996
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
well freedom from want freedom from
 

997
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,870
well freedom from want freedom from
disease freedom from ignorance right

998
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
disease freedom from ignorance right
 

999
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,630
disease freedom from ignorance right
that it informs you

1000
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
that it informs you
 

1001
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,710
that it informs you
the logos in it of science

1002
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
the logos in it of science
 

1003
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,270
the logos in it of science
it is definitely that

1004
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
it is definitely that
 

1005
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,029
it is definitely that
yeah it's it's the what it's the

1006
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
yeah it's it's the what it's the
 

1007
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,710
yeah it's it's the what it's the
direction let's say the directionality

1008
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
direction let's say the directionality
 

1009
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,470
direction let's say the directionality
of science that's a narrative direction

1010
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
of science that's a narrative direction
 

1011
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,549
of science that's a narrative direction
not a scientific direction and then the

1012
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
not a scientific direction and then the
 

1013
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,470
not a scientific direction and then the
question is what is the narrative well

1014
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
question is what is the narrative well
 

1015
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,870
question is what is the narrative well
it posits a transcendent reality it

1016
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
it posits a transcendent reality it
 

1017
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,710
it posits a transcendent reality it
posits that the transcendent reality is

1018
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
posits that the transcendent reality is
 

1019
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,950
posits that the transcendent reality is
corrective it posits that our knowledge

1020
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
corrective it posits that our knowledge
 

1021
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,950
corrective it posits that our knowledge
structure should be regarded with

1022
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
structure should be regarded with
 

1023
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,750
structure should be regarded with
humility it posits that you should bow

1024
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
humility it posits that you should bow
 

1025
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,510
humility it posits that you should bow
down in the face of

1026
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
down in the face of
 

1027
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,150
down in the face of
of the transcendent evidence and you

1028
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
of the transcendent evidence and you
 

1029
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,909
of the transcendent evidence and you
have to take a vow you know this as a

1030
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
have to take a vow you know this as a
 

1031
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,510
have to take a vow you know this as a
scientist you have to take a vow to

1032
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
scientist you have to take a vow to
 

1033
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,870
scientist you have to take a vow to
follow that path if you're going to be a

1034
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
follow that path if you're going to be a
 

1035
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,310
follow that path if you're going to be a
real scientist it's like the truth no

1036
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
real scientist it's like the truth no
 

1037
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,549
real scientist it's like the truth no
matter what and that means you posit the

1038
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
matter what and that means you posit the
 

1039
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,029
matter what and that means you posit the
truth as a redemptive force

1040
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
truth as a redemptive force
 

1041
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,710
truth as a redemptive force
well what does redemptive mean well why

1042
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
well what does redemptive mean well why
 

1043
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,630
well what does redemptive mean well why
bother with science well so people don't

1044
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
bother with science well so people don't
 

1045
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,549
bother with science well so people don't
starve so people can move about more

1046
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
starve so people can move about more
 

1047
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,630
starve so people can move about more
effectively so life can be more abundant

1048
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
effectively so life can be more abundant
 

1049
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,270
effectively so life can be more abundant
right so it's all ensconced within an

1050
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
right so it's all ensconced within an
 

1051
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,150
right so it's all ensconced within an
underlying ethic so the the reason i i

1052
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
underlying ethic so the the reason i i
 

1053
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,669
underlying ethic so the the reason i i
was saying that while we were talking

1054
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
was saying that while we were talking
 

1055
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,190
was saying that while we were talking
about belief in god it's like this is a

1056
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
about belief in god it's like this is a
 

1057
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,270
about belief in god it's like this is a
very complicated topic right do you

1058
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
very complicated topic right do you
 

1059
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,270
very complicated topic right do you
believe in a transcendent reality see

1060
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
believe in a transcendent reality see
 

1061
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,950
believe in a transcendent reality see
okay now let's say

1062
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
okay now let's say
 

1063
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,190
okay now let's say
you buy the argument i just made on the

1064
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
you buy the argument i just made on the
 

1065
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,590
you buy the argument i just made on the
natural front you say yeah yeah that's

1066
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
natural front you say yeah yeah that's
 

1067
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,190
natural front you say yeah yeah that's
just nature

1068
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
just nature
 

1069
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,590
just nature
that's not god

1070
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
that's not god
 

1071
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,029
that's not god
and then i'd say well what makes you

1072
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
and then i'd say well what makes you
 

1073
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,590
and then i'd say well what makes you
think you know what nature is

1074
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
think you know what nature is
 

1075
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,830
think you know what nature is
like see the problem with that argument

1076
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
like see the problem with that argument
 

1077
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,310
like see the problem with that argument
is that it it already presumes

1078
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
is that it it already presumes
 

1079
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,110
is that it it already presumes
a materialist a reductionist materialist

1080
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
a materialist a reductionist materialist
 

1081
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,110
a materialist a reductionist materialist
objective view of what constitutes

1082
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
objective view of what constitutes
 

1083
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,270
objective view of what constitutes
nature but if you're a scientist you're

1084
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
nature but if you're a scientist you're
 

1085
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,390
nature but if you're a scientist you're
going to think

1086
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
going to think
 

1087
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,070
going to think
well in the final analysis i don't know

1088
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
well in the final analysis i don't know
 

1089
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,909
well in the final analysis i don't know
what nature is i certainly don't know

1090
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
what nature is i certainly don't know
 

1091
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,549
what nature is i certainly don't know
its origin or destination point i don't

1092
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
its origin or destination point i don't
 

1093
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,270
its origin or destination point i don't
know it's teleology i'm really ignorant

1094
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
know it's teleology i'm really ignorant
 

1095
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,630
know it's teleology i'm really ignorant
about nature

1096
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
about nature
 

1097
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,230
about nature
and so when i say it's nothing but

1098
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
and so when i say it's nothing but
 

1099
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,510
and so when i say it's nothing but
nature

1100
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
nature
 

1101
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,150
nature
i shouldn't mean it's nothing but what i

1102
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
i shouldn't mean it's nothing but what i
 

1103
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,549
i shouldn't mean it's nothing but what i
understand nature to be

1104
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
understand nature to be
 

1105
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,310
understand nature to be
so i could say will we have a fully

1106
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
so i could say will we have a fully
 

1107
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,630
so i could say will we have a fully
reductionist account of cognitive

1108
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
reductionist account of cognitive
 

1109
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,070
reductionist account of cognitive
processes

1110
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
processes
 

1111
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,990
processes
and the answer to that is yes but by the

1112
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
and the answer to that is yes but by the
 

1113
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,390
and the answer to that is yes but by the
time we do that our understanding of

1114
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
time we do that our understanding of
 

1115
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,390
time we do that our understanding of
matter will have transformed so much

1116
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
matter will have transformed so much
 

1117
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,150
matter will have transformed so much
that what we think of as reductionists

1118
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
that what we think of as reductionists
 

1119
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,909
that what we think of as reductionists
now won't look anything like this what

1120
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
now won't look anything like this what
 

1121
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,070
now won't look anything like this what
we think of reductionism now

1122
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
we think of reductionism now
 

1123
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,669
we think of reductionism now
matter isn't dead

1124
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
matter isn't dead
 

1125
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,870
matter isn't dead

1127
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,549
dust
i don't know what it is

1128
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
i don't know what it is
 

1129
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,270
i don't know what it is
i have no idea what it is matter is what

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
i have no idea what it is matter is what
 

1131
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,669
i have no idea what it is matter is what
matters there's a definition that's a

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
matters there's a definition that's a
 

1133
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,390
matters there's a definition that's a
very weird definition but

very weird definition but

00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
limited human assumptions of this
 

1151
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,630
limited human assumptions of this
century of this week that

1152
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
century of this week that
 

1153
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,669
century of this week that
so in that in some sense

1154
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
so in that in some sense
 

1155
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,669
so in that in some sense
without god

1156
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
without god
 

1157
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,310
without god
in this complicated big definition we're

1158
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
in this complicated big definition we're
 

1159
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,149
in this complicated big definition we're
talking about

1160
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
talking about
 

1161
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,270
talking about
the there's no humility or

1162
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
the there's no humility or
 

1163
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,310
the there's no humility or
it's not enough there's less likely to

1164
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
it's not enough there's less likely to
 

1165
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,110
it's not enough there's less likely to
be

1166
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
be
 

1167
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,630
be
or rather science can err in taking a

1168
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
or rather science can err in taking a
 

1169
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,190
or rather science can err in taking a
trajectory away from humility well

1170
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
trajectory away from humility well
 

1171
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,990
trajectory away from humility well
without something much more powerful

1172
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
without something much more powerful
 

1173
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,710
without something much more powerful
than uh individual human yeah well then

1174
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
than uh individual human yeah well then
 

1175
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,470
than uh individual human yeah well then
and we know you know the frankenstein

1176
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
and we know you know the frankenstein
 

1177
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,029
and we know you know the frankenstein
story comes out of that instantly and

1178
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
story comes out of that instantly and
 

1179
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,630
story comes out of that instantly and
that's a good story for the current

1180
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
that's a good story for the current
 

1181
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,549
that's a good story for the current
times it's like

1182
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
times it's like
 

1183
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,950
times it's like
you you're playing around with making

1184
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
you you're playing around with making
 

1185
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,789
you you're playing around with making
new life

1186
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
new life
 

1187
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,789
new life
you bloody well better make sure you

1188
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
you bloody well better make sure you
 

1189
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,270
you bloody well better make sure you
have your arrows pointed up

1190
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
have your arrows pointed up
 

1191
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,789
have your arrows pointed up
and it's interesting because you said

1192
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
and it's interesting because you said
 

1193
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,110
and it's interesting because you said
science has

1194
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
science has
 

1195
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,270
science has
um an ethic to it

1196
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
um an ethic to it
 

1197
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,510
um an ethic to it
i think it's embedded in an ethic well

1198
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
i think it's embedded in an ethic well
 

1199
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,710
i think it's embedded in an ethic well
there's a

1200
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
there's a
 

1201
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,830
there's a
you know

1202
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840
you know
 

1203
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,830
you know
science is a big word yeah and it

1204
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840
science is a big word yeah and it
 

1205
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,430
science is a big word yeah and it
includes a lot of disciplines that have

1206
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
includes a lot of disciplines that have
 

1207
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,190
includes a lot of disciplines that have
different traditions so biology

1208
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
different traditions so biology
 

1209
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,390
different traditions so biology
chemistry

1210
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
chemistry
 

1211
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,149
chemistry
uh genetics physics

1212
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159

 

1213
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,630

those are very different communities

1214
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
those are very different communities
 

1215
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,950
those are very different communities
and i think biology especially when you

1216
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
and i think biology especially when you
 

1217
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,710
and i think biology especially when you
get closer and closer to medicine into

1218
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
get closer and closer to medicine into
 

1219
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,070
get closer and closer to medicine into
the human body

1220
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
the human body
 

1221
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,310
the human body
does have a very serious first of all

1222
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
does have a very serious first of all
 

1223
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,230
does have a very serious first of all
has a history with nazi germany of being

1224
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
has a history with nazi germany of being
 

1225
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,230
has a history with nazi germany of being
abused and all those kinds of things but

1226
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
abused and all those kinds of things but
 

1227
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,909
abused and all those kinds of things but
it has a history of taking this stuff

1228
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
it has a history of taking this stuff
 

1229
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,230
it has a history of taking this stuff
seriously what doesn't have a history of

1230
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
seriously what doesn't have a history of
 

1231
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,230
seriously what doesn't have a history of
taking this stuff seriously is robotics

1232
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
taking this stuff seriously is robotics
 

1233
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,830
taking this stuff seriously is robotics
and artificial intelligence which is

1234
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
and artificial intelligence which is
 

1235
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,190
and artificial intelligence which is
really interesting

1236
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
really interesting
 

1237
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,310
really interesting
because

1238
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
because
 

1239
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,549
because
you don't uh you know you called me a

1240
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
you don't uh you know you called me a
 

1241
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,149
you don't uh you know you called me a
scientist but

1242
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
scientist but
 

1243
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,230
scientist but
and i i would like to wear that label

1244
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
and i i would like to wear that label
 

1245
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,950
and i i would like to wear that label
proudly but often people don't think of

1246
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
proudly but often people don't think of
 

1247
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,029
proudly but often people don't think of
computer science as a science but

1248
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
computer science as a science but
 

1249
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,510
computer science as a science but
nevertheless it will be i think the

1250
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
nevertheless it will be i think the
 

1251
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,310
nevertheless it will be i think the
science of one of the major scientific

1252
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
science of one of the major scientific
 

1253
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,470
science of one of the major scientific
fields of the 21st century and you

1254
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
fields of the 21st century and you
 

1255
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,549
fields of the 21st century and you
should take that very seriously

1256
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
should take that very seriously
 

1257
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,110
should take that very seriously
oftentimes when people build robots

1258
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
oftentimes when people build robots
 

1259
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,789
oftentimes when people build robots
or ai systems they think of them

1260
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
or ai systems they think of them
 

1261
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,750
or ai systems they think of them
as

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
as
 

1263
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,789
as
toys to tinker with oh isn't this cool

1264
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
toys to tinker with oh isn't this cool
 

1265
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,270
toys to tinker with oh isn't this cool
well i feel this too isn't this cool it

1266
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
well i feel this too isn't this cool it
 

1267
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,390
well i feel this too isn't this cool it
is cool

1268
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
is cool
 

1269
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,110
is cool
but

1270
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
but
 

1271
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,029
but
you know uh at a certain moment you

1272
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
you know uh at a certain moment you
 

1273
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,750
you know uh at a certain moment you
might

1274
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
might
 

1275
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,750
might
isn't this nuclear

1276
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
isn't this nuclear
 

1277
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,710
isn't this nuclear
uh explosion cool yes it is or birth

1278
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
uh explosion cool yes it is or birth
 

1279
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,350
uh explosion cool yes it is or birth
control pill cool it's like or or

1280
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
control pill cool it's like or or
 

1281
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,149
control pill cool it's like or or
transistor cool yeah well the other

1282
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
transistor cool yeah well the other
 

1283
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,630
transistor cool yeah well the other
thing too and and this is a weird

1284
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
thing too and and this is a weird
 

1285
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,950
thing too and and this is a weird
problem in some sense the robotics

1286
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
problem in some sense the robotics
 

1287
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,270
problem in some sense the robotics
engineer types they're thing people

1288
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
engineer types they're thing people
 

1289
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,909
engineer types they're thing people
right i mean the big classes of interest

1290
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
right i mean the big classes of interest
 

1291
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,149
right i mean the big classes of interest
are interesting things versus interest

1292
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
are interesting things versus interest
 

1293
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,909
are interesting things versus interest
in people some of my best friends are

1294
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
in people some of my best friends are
 

1295
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,390
in people some of my best friends are
thing people yeah right and thing people

1296
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
thing people yeah right and thing people
 

1297
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,390
thing people yeah right and thing people
are very very

1298
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
are very very
 

1299
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,230
are very very
clear logical thinkers and they're very

1300
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
clear logical thinkers and they're very
 

1301
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,029
clear logical thinkers and they're very
outcome oriented and practical

1302
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
outcome oriented and practical
 

1303
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,909
outcome oriented and practical
now and that's all good that makes the

1304
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
now and that's all good that makes the
 

1305
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,070
now and that's all good that makes the
machinery and keeps it functioning

1306
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
machinery and keeps it functioning
 

1307
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,350
machinery and keeps it functioning
but

1308
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
but
 

1309
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,230
but
there's a human side of the equation and

1310
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
there's a human side of the equation and
 

1311
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,470
there's a human side of the equation and
and you get the extreme thing people and

1312
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
and you get the extreme thing people and
 

1313
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,710
and you get the extreme thing people and
you think yeah well what about the human

1314
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
you think yeah well what about the human
 

1315
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,549
you think yeah well what about the human
here and

1316
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
here and
 

1317
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,310
here and
when we're talking about we've been

1318
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
when we're talking about we've been
 

1319
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,990
when we're talking about we've been
talking about the necessity of having a

1320
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
talking about the necessity of having a
 

1321
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,470
talking about the necessity of having a
technological enterprise embedded in an

1322
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
technological enterprise embedded in an
 

1323
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,950
technological enterprise embedded in an
ethic and you can ignore that like most

1324
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
ethic and you can ignore that like most
 

1325
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,110
ethic and you can ignore that like most
of the time right you can ignore the

1326
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
of the time right you can ignore the
 

1327
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,750
of the time right you can ignore the
overall ethic in some sense when you're

1328
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
overall ethic in some sense when you're
 

1329
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,990
overall ethic in some sense when you're
toying around with your toys but when

1330
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
toying around with your toys but when
 

1331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,190
toying around with your toys but when
you're building an artificial

1332
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
you're building an artificial
 

1333
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,789
you're building an artificial
intelligence it's like well

1334
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799

 

1335
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,950

that's not a toy

1336
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
that's not a toy
 

1337
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,390
that's not a toy
that might be

1338
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
that might be
 

1339
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,149
that might be
toy becomes the monster very quickly

1340
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
toy becomes the monster very quickly
 

1341
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,630
toy becomes the monster very quickly
yeah yeah yes yes and and this is a

1342
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
yeah yeah yes yes and and this is a
 

1343
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,789
yeah yeah yes yes and and this is a
whole new kind of monster

1344
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
whole new kind of monster
 

1345
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,110
whole new kind of monster
and maybe it's already here

1346
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120

 

1347
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,630

yes and you notice how many of those

1348
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
yes and you notice how many of those
 

1349
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,789
yes and you notice how many of those
things you can no longer turn off

1350
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799

 

1351
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,310

and what is it with you engineers and

1352
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
and what is it with you engineers and
 

1353
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,390
and what is it with you engineers and
your inability to put off switches on

1354
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
your inability to put off switches on
 

1355
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,470
your inability to put off switches on
things now

1356
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
things now
 

1357
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,310
things now
it's like i have to hold this for five

1358
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
it's like i have to hold this for five
 

1359
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,390
it's like i have to hold this for five
seconds for it to shut off or i can't

1360
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
seconds for it to shut off or i can't
 

1361
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,110
seconds for it to shut off or i can't
figure i just want to shut it off click

1362
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
figure i just want to shut it off click
 

1363
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,909
figure i just want to shut it off click
off well what is it with you humans that

1364
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
off well what is it with you humans that
 

1365
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,909
off well what is it with you humans that
don't uh put all switches on other

1366
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
don't uh put all switches on other
 

1367
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,310
don't uh put all switches on other
humans because there's a magic to the

1368
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
humans because there's a magic to the
 

1369
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,950
humans because there's a magic to the
thing that you notice and it hurts

1370
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
thing that you notice and it hurts
 

1371
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,430
thing that you notice and it hurts
uh for both you and perhaps one day the

1372
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
uh for both you and perhaps one day the
 

1373
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,750
uh for both you and perhaps one day the
thing itself to turn it off

1374
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
thing itself to turn it off
 

1375
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,590
thing itself to turn it off
and so you have to be very careful as an

1376
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
and so you have to be very careful as an
 

1377
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,310
and so you have to be very careful as an
engineer adding off switches to things

1378
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
engineer adding off switches to things
 

1379
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,029
engineer adding off switches to things
um i think it's a feature not a bug the

1380
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
um i think it's a feature not a bug the
 

1381
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,230
um i think it's a feature not a bug the
off switch

1382
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
off switch
 

1383
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,149
off switch
the off switch gives a deadline to us

1384
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
the off switch gives a deadline to us
 

1385
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,470
the off switch gives a deadline to us
humans to systems

1386
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
humans to systems
 

1387
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,350
humans to systems
of existence it makes you uh it's you

1388
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
of existence it makes you uh it's you
 

1389
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,549
of existence it makes you uh it's you
know death

1390
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
know death
 

1391
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,789
know death
is the thing that really brings clarity

1392
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
is the thing that really brings clarity
 

1393
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,269
is the thing that really brings clarity
to life and i do think yes hence the

1394
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
to life and i do think yes hence the
 

1395
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,830
to life and i do think yes hence the
flaming swords the flaming sword i do

1396
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
flaming swords the flaming sword i do
 

1397
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,230
flaming swords the flaming sword i do
like your view of the flame with the

1398
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
like your view of the flame with the
 

1399
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,190
like your view of the flame with the
bush and perhaps the sword as a thing of

1400
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
bush and perhaps the sword as a thing of
 

1401
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,750
bush and perhaps the sword as a thing of
transformation it's also

1402
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
transformation it's also
 

1403
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,669
transformation it's also
it's a transformation that kind of

1404
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
it's a transformation that kind of
 

1405
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,430
it's a transformation that kind of
consumes the thing in the process well

1406
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
consumes the thing in the process well
 

1407
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,190
consumes the thing in the process well
it depends on how much of the thing is

1408
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
it depends on how much of the thing is
 

1409
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,149
it depends on how much of the thing is
chaff

1410
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
chaff
 

1411
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,149
chaff
you know this is why you can't touch the

1412
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
you know this is why you can't touch the
 

1413
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,669
you know this is why you can't touch the
ark of the covenant

1414
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
ark of the covenant
 

1415
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,510
ark of the covenant
for example and this is why people can

1416
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
for example and this is why people can
 

1417
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,830
for example and this is why people can
have very bad psychedelic trips

1418
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
have very bad psychedelic trips
 

1419
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,789
have very bad psychedelic trips
it's like if you're 95 dead wood

1420
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
it's like if you're 95 dead wood
 

1421
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,029
it's like if you're 95 dead wood
and you get too close to the flame

1422
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
and you get too close to the flame
 

1423
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,350
and you get too close to the flame
the five percent that's left might not

1424
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
the five percent that's left might not
 

1425
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,190
the five percent that's left might not
be able to make it

1426
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200

 

1427
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,950

so you think it's all chat but i think

1428
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
so you think it's all chat but i think
 

1429
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,190
so you think it's all chat but i think
there is some aspect of destruction that

1430
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
there is some aspect of destruction that
 

1431
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,149
there is some aspect of destruction that
is

1432
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
is
 

1433
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,950
is
that's you know the the bukowski line of

1434
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
that's you know the the bukowski line of
 

1435
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,350
that's you know the the bukowski line of
uh do what you love and let it kill you

1436
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
uh do what you love and let it kill you
 

1437
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,950
uh do what you love and let it kill you
right don't you think it that

1438
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
right don't you think it that
 

1439
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,990
right don't you think it that
destruction is part of that's humility

1440
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
destruction is part of that's humility
 

1441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,470
destruction is part of that's humility
that's humility you bet you bet you bet

1442
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
that's humility you bet you bet you bet
 

1443
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,430
that's humility you bet you bet you bet
it's like

1444
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
it's like
 

1445
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,510
it's like
invite in the judgment invite in the

1446
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
invite in the judgment invite in the
 

1447
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,029
invite in the judgment invite in the
judgment because maybe you can die a

1448
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
judgment because maybe you can die a
 

1449
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,950
judgment because maybe you can die a
little bit instead of dying completely

1450
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
little bit instead of dying completely
 

1451
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,470
little bit instead of dying completely
yeah you know that's i think it's alfred

1452
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
yeah you know that's i think it's alfred
 

1453
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,990
yeah you know that's i think it's alfred
north whitehead

1454
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
north whitehead
 

1455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,950
north whitehead
we can let our ideas die instead of us

1456
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
we can let our ideas die instead of us
 

1457
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,630
we can let our ideas die instead of us
right we can have these partial

1458
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
right we can have these partial
 

1459
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,269
right we can have these partial
personalities that we can burn off

1460
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
personalities that we can burn off
 

1461
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,950
personalities that we can burn off
and we can let them go before they

1462
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
and we can let them go before they
 

1463
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,029
and we can let them go before they
become tyrannical pharaohs and

1464
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
become tyrannical pharaohs and
 

1465
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,110
become tyrannical pharaohs and
everything and we lose everything

1466
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
everything and we lose everything
 

1467
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,510
everything and we lose everything
and so yeah there's this optimal bite of

1468
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
and so yeah there's this optimal bite of
 

1469
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,750
and so yeah there's this optimal bite of
death and who knows

1470
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
death and who knows
 

1471
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,149
death and who knows
what it would mean to optimize that like

1472
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
what it would mean to optimize that like
 

1473
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,990
what it would mean to optimize that like
what if it was possible that if you died

1474
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
what if it was possible that if you died
 

1475
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,750
what if it was possible that if you died
enough all the time

1476
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
enough all the time
 

1477
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,310
enough all the time
that you could continue to live and the

1478
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
that you could continue to live and the
 

1479
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,350
that you could continue to live and the
thing is we already know that

1480
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
thing is we already know that
 

1481
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,029
thing is we already know that
biologically because

1482
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
biologically because
 

1483
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,310
biologically because
if you don't die properly all the time

1484
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
if you don't die properly all the time
 

1485
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,029
if you don't die properly all the time
well it's cancerous outgrowths and and

1486
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
well it's cancerous outgrowths and and
 

1487
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,710
well it's cancerous outgrowths and and
like it's a very fine balance between

1488
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
like it's a very fine balance between
 

1489
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,750
like it's a very fine balance between
productivity on the biological front and

1490
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
productivity on the biological front and
 

1491
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,909
productivity on the biological front and
the culling of that right

1492
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
the culling of that right
 

1493
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,310
the culling of that right
life is a real balance between growth

1494
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
life is a real balance between growth
 

1495
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,510
life is a real balance between growth
and death

1496
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
and death
 

1497
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,190
and death
and so what would happen if you got that

1498
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
and so what would happen if you got that
 

1499
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,430
and so what would happen if you got that
balance right well we kind of know right

1500
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
balance right well we kind of know right
 

1501
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,630
balance right well we kind of know right
because

1502
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
because
 

1503
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,870
because
if you live your life properly

1504
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
if you live your life properly
 

1505
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,269
if you live your life properly

so to speak and you're humble enough to
let your stupidity die before it takes

1508
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
let your stupidity die before it takes
 

1509

a fact
 

1513
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,750
a fact
well but then what's the ultimate

1514
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
well but then what's the ultimate
 

1515
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,669
well but then what's the ultimate
extension of that and the answer is we

1516
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
extension of that and the answer is we
 

1517
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,909
extension of that and the answer is we
don't know we have no idea

1518
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
don't know we have no idea
 

1519

1579
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,310
no doubt in some regard i mean it's very
difficult thing to

1580
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
difficult thing to
 

1581
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,510
difficult thing to
avoid you know because

1582
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
avoid you know because
 

1583
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,669
avoid you know because
things change around you people are much

1584
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
things change around you people are much
 

1585
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,350
things change around you people are much
more likely to do

1586
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
more likely to do
 

1587
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,990
more likely to do
what you ask for example right and so

1588
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
what you ask for example right and so
 

1589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,909
what you ask for example right and so
that's a danger because one of the

1590
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
that's a danger because one of the
 

1591
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,990
that's a danger because one of the
things that keeps you dying properly is

1592
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
things that keeps you dying properly is
 

1593
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,830
things that keeps you dying properly is
that people push back against you

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
who are critics
 

1635
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,190
who are critics
who are saying

1636
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
who are saying
 

1637
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,190
who are saying
yeah i could have done that better and

1638
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
yeah i could have done that better and
 

1639
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,269
yeah i could have done that better and
you're a little too harsh there and

1640
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
you're a little too harsh there and
 

1641
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,269
you're a little too harsh there and
you're alienating people unnecessarily

1642
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
you're alienating people unnecessarily
 

1643
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,630
you're alienating people unnecessarily
there and you should have done some more

1644
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
there and you should have done some more
 

1645
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,870
there and you should have done some more
background work there and

1646
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:58,880
background work there and
 

1647
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,350
background work there and
and i think the responsibility attendant

1648
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
and i think the responsibility attendant
 

1649
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,590
and i think the responsibility attendant
upon that increases as your influence

1650
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
upon that increases as your influence
 

1651
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,070
upon that increases as your influence
increases and that's

1652
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
increases and that's
 

1653
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,310
increases and that's
that's a as your influence increases

1654
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
that's a as your influence increases
 

1655
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,590
that's a as your influence increases
then that becomes a lot of

1656
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
then that becomes a lot of
 

1657
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,310
then that becomes a lot of
responsibility

1658
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
responsibility
 

1659
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,389
responsibility
so you know and then maybe have an off

1660
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
so you know and then maybe have an off
 

1661
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,029
so you know and then maybe have an off
day and well one here's an example

1662
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
day and well one here's an example
 

1663
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,190
day and well one here's an example
i've been writing some columns lately

1664
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
i've been writing some columns lately
 

1665
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,990
i've been writing some columns lately
about things that perturb me

1666
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
about things that perturb me
 

1667
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,430
about things that perturb me
like the forthcoming famine for example

1668
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
like the forthcoming famine for example
 

1669
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,389
like the forthcoming famine for example
and

1670
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
and
 

1671
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,470
and
it's hard to take those

1672
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
it's hard to take those
 

1673
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,950
it's hard to take those
um problems on

1674
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
um problems on
 

1675
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,190
um problems on
it's difficult to take those problems on

1676
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
it's difficult to take those problems on
 

1677
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,430
it's difficult to take those problems on
in a serious manner and it's frightening

1678
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
in a serious manner and it's frightening
 

1679
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,950
in a serious manner and it's frightening
and it would be easier just to go up to

1680
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
and it would be easier just to go up to
 

1681
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,630
and it would be easier just to go up to
the cottage with my wife and go out on

1682
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
the cottage with my wife and go out on
 

1683
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,710
the cottage with my wife and go out on
the lake and watch the sunset

1684
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:40,720
the lake and watch the sunset
 

1685
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,669
the lake and watch the sunset
and so

1686
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
and so
 

1687
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,950
and so
i'm tempted to draw on

1688
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
i'm tempted to draw on
 

1689
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,909
i'm tempted to draw on
anger as a motivating energy

1690
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
anger as a motivating energy
 

1691
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,909
anger as a motivating energy
to help me overcome the

1692
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
to help me overcome the
 

1693
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,909
to help me overcome the
resistance to doing this

1694
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
resistance to doing this
 

1695
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,669
resistance to doing this
but then that makes me more harsh and

1696
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
but then that makes me more harsh and
 

1697
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,830
but then that makes me more harsh and
judgmental in my tone

1698
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
judgmental in my tone
 

1699
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,830
judgmental in my tone
when i'm reading such things for example

1700
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
when i'm reading such things for example
 

1701
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,950
when i'm reading such things for example
on youtube

1702
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
on youtube
 

1703
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,950
on youtube
then might be optimal now i've had

1704
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
then might be optimal now i've had
 

1705
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,110
then might be optimal now i've had
debates about with people about that

1706
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
debates about with people about that
 

1707
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,190
debates about with people about that
because i have friends who say

1708
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
because i have friends who say
 

1709
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,110
because i have friends who say
no if you're calling out the

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
no if you're calling out the
 

1711
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,710
no if you're calling out the
environmental

environmental
environmentalist globalists who are

1714
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
environmentalist globalists who are
 

1715
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,789
environmentalist globalists who are
harassing the dutch farmers

1716
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
harassing the dutch farmers
 

1717
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,750
harassing the dutch farmers
then a little anger is just the ticket

1718
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
then a little anger is just the ticket
 

1719
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,669
then a little anger is just the ticket
but then others say well you know you

but then others say well you know you
 

1721
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,190
but then others say well you know you
don't want to be too harsh because you

1722
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
don't want to be too harsh because you
 

1723
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,789
don't want to be too harsh because you
alienate people who would otherwise

1724
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
alienate people who would otherwise
 

1725
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,950
alienate people who would otherwise

that's a hard balance to get right but
 

1729
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,190
that's a hard balance to get right but
also maybe anger

1730
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,200
also maybe anger
 

1731
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,870
also maybe anger
hardens your mind to where you don't

1798
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
radical acceptance of the worst possible
 

1799
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,830

the crucifix means psychologically it's
 

1803
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,590
the crucifix means psychologically it's
like gays upon that which you are most

1804
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
like gays upon that which you are most
 

1805
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,669
like gays upon that which you are most
afraid of but that story doesn't end

1806
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
afraid of but that story doesn't end
 

1807
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,710
afraid of but that story doesn't end
there because in in the in the story

christ goes through death into hell

1810
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
christ goes through death into hell
 

1811
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,110
christ goes through death into hell
so death isn't enough

1812
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
so death isn't enough
 

1813
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,830
so death isn't enough
the abyss the abyss of innocent death is

1814
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
the abyss the abyss of innocent death is
 

1815
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,549
the abyss the abyss of innocent death is
not sufficient to produce redemption

1816
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
not sufficient to produce redemption
 

1817
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,950
not sufficient to produce redemption
it has to be a voluntary journey to hell

it has to be a voluntary journey to hell
 

1819
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,990
it has to be a voluntary journey to hell
and maybe that's true for everyone

1820
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
and maybe that's true for everyone
 

1821
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,750
and maybe that's true for everyone
and that's like there is no more

works now does it work completely and
 

2105
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,270
works now does it work completely and
will it replace gas cars or should it i

2106
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
will it replace gas cars or should it i
 

2107
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,870
will it replace gas cars or should it i

don't know but
 

2109
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,870
don't know but
if we're going to build electric cars he

2110
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
if we're going to build electric cars he
 

2111
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,069
if we're going to build electric cars he
seems to be the best at that by a lot

2112
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
seems to be the best at that by a lot

00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
whether climate change is the cardinal
 

2273
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,950
whether climate change is the cardinal
one or not is a whole different question

2274
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
one or not is a whole different question
 

2275
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,950
one or not is a whole different question
but we won't get into that that's not

2276
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
but we won't get into that that's not
 

2277
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,790
but we won't get into that that's not
the issue you're clamoring about a

why should i listen to you
well let's see how you're reacting to

2286
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
well let's see how you're reacting to
 

2287
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,230
well let's see how you're reacting to
the dragon

2288
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
the dragon
 

2289
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,990
the dragon
first of all you're scared stiff and in

2290
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
first of all you're scared stiff and in
 

2291
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,470
first of all you're scared stiff and in
the state of panic

2292
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
the state of panic
 

2293
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,309
the state of panic
that might indicate you're not the man

2294
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
that might indicate you're not the man
 

2295
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,829
that might indicate you're not the man
for the job

2296
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:21,839
for the job
 

2297
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,430
for the job
second

2298
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
second
 

2299
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,270
second
you're willing to use compulsion to

2300
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
you're willing to use compulsion to
 

2301
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,109
you're willing to use compulsion to
harness other people to fight the dragon

2302
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
harness other people to fight the dragon
 

2303
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,230
harness other people to fight the dragon
for you

2304
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,240
for you
 

2305
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,870
for you
so now not only are you terrified

2306
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
so now not only are you terrified
 

2307
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,109
so now not only are you terrified
you're a terrified tyrant

2308
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
you're a terrified tyrant
 

2309
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,790
you're a terrified tyrant
so then i would say well then you're not

2310
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:34,800
so then i would say well then you're not
 

2311
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,870
so then i would say well then you're not
the moses that we need to lead us out of

2312
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
the moses that we need to lead us out of
 

2313
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,190
the moses that we need to lead us out of
this particular exodus

2314
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
this particular exodus
 

2315
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,710
this particular exodus
and maybe that's a neurological

2316
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
and maybe that's a neurological
 

2317
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,790
and maybe that's a neurological
explanation it's like if you're so

2318
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
explanation it's like if you're so
 

2319
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,870
explanation it's like if you're so
afraid of what you're facing

2320
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:44,880
afraid of what you're facing
 

2321
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,870
afraid of what you're facing
that you're terrified into paralysis and

2322
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
that you're terrified into paralysis and
 

2323
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,030
that you're terrified into paralysis and
nihilism and that you're willing to use

2324
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
nihilism and that you're willing to use
 

2325
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,430
nihilism and that you're willing to use
tyrannical compulsion to get your way

2326
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,440
tyrannical compulsion to get your way
 

2327
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,109
tyrannical compulsion to get your way
you are not the right leader for the

2328
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
you are not the right leader for the
 

2329
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,069
you are not the right leader for the
time

2330
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
time
 

2331
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,670
time
so then i like someone like bjorn

2332
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
so then i like someone like bjorn
 

2333
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,950
so then i like someone like bjorn
lomberg or matt ridley or marion toopey

2334
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
lomberg or matt ridley or marion toopey
 

2335
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,950
lomberg or matt ridley or marion toopey
and they say well look we've got our

2336
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:00,960
and they say well look we've got our
 

2337
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,030
and they say well look we've got our
environmental problems

2338
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
environmental problems
 

2339
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,990
environmental problems
and uh maybe there's a there you could

2340
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
and uh maybe there's a there you could
 

2341
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,990
and uh maybe there's a there you could
make a case that there's a malthusian

2342
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
make a case that there's a malthusian
 

2343
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,950
make a case that there's a malthusian
element in some situations

2344
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
element in some situations
 

2345
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,510
element in some situations
but fundamentally the track record of

2346
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
but fundamentally the track record of
 

2347
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,589
but fundamentally the track record of
the human race is that we learn very

2348
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:15,599
the human race is that we learn very
 

2349
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,390
the human race is that we learn very
fast and faster all the time

2350
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,400
fast and faster all the time
 

2351
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,710
fast and faster all the time
to do more with less

2352
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
to do more with less
 

2353
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,950
to do more with less
and we've got this

2354
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
and we've got this
 

2355
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,870
and we've got this
and i think

2356
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:24,880
and i think
 

2357
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,069
and i think
yes

2358
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079
yes
 

2359
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,589
yes
to that idea

2360
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
to that idea
 

2361
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,470
to that idea
and i think about it in it

2362
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
and i think about it in it
 

2363
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,670
and i think about it in it
in a fundamental way it's like i trust

2364
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
in a fundamental way it's like i trust
 

2365
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,950
in a fundamental way it's like i trust
lomberg

2366
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:34,960
lomberg
 

2367
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,470
lomberg
i trust tupi

2368
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
i trust tupi
 

2369
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,150
i trust tupi
trust matt ridley

2370
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
trust matt ridley
 

2371
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,990
trust matt ridley
they thought about these things deeply

2372
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:40,000
they thought about these things deeply
 

2373
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,109
they thought about these things deeply
they're not just saying oh the

2374
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
they're not just saying oh the
 

2375
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,710
they're not just saying oh the
environment doesn't matter whatever the

2376
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
environment doesn't matter whatever the
 

2377
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,950
environment doesn't matter whatever the
environment is

2378
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
environment is
 

2379
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,470
environment is
you know the environment i don't even

2380
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:46,480
you know the environment i don't even
 

2381
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,870
you know the environment i don't even
know what that is that's everything the

2382
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
know what that is that's everything the
 

2383
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,630
know what that is that's everything the
environment i'm concerned about the

2384
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
environment i'm concerned about the
 

2385
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,750
environment i'm concerned about the
environments like

2386
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760

 

2387
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,349

which is how is that different than

2388
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
which is how is that different than
 

2389
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,430
which is how is that different than
saying i'm worried about everything

2390
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
saying i'm worried about everything
 

2391
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,870
saying i'm worried about everything
how are those statements different

2392
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
how are those statements different
 

2393
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,630
how are those statements different
semantically

2394
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
semantically
 

2395
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,630
semantically
well yeah the environment it could be

2396
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
well yeah the environment it could be
 

2397
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,270
well yeah the environment it could be
i'm worried about human society a lot of

2398
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
i'm worried about human society a lot of
 

2399
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,870
i'm worried about human society a lot of
these complex systems are difficult to

2400
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
these complex systems are difficult to
 

2401
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,550
these complex systems are difficult to
talk about because there's so much

2402
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
talk about because there's so much
 

2403
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,870
talk about because there's so much
involved for sure yeah everything

2404
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
involved for sure yeah everything
 

2405
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,550
involved for sure yeah everything
and then these models

2406
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
and then these models
 

2407
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,990
and then these models
because people have gone after me

2408
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
because people have gone after me
 

2409
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,829
because people have gone after me
because i don't buy the climate models

2410
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:15,839
because i don't buy the climate models
 

2411
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:16,630
because i don't buy the climate models
well

2412
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
well
 

2413
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,309
well
i think about the climate models as

2414
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
i think about the climate models as
 

2415
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,270
i think about the climate models as
extended into the economic models

2416
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
extended into the economic models
 

2417
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,829
extended into the economic models
because the climate model is

2418
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
because the climate model is
 

2419
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,030
because the climate model is
well there's going to be a certain

2420
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
well there's going to be a certain
 

2421
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,510
well there's going to be a certain
degree of heating let's say by 2100 it's

2422
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
degree of heating let's say by 2100 it's
 

2423
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,190
degree of heating let's say by 2100 it's
like okay

2424
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
like okay
 

2425
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,790
like okay
some of that might be human generated

2426
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
some of that might be human generated
 

2427
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,470
some of that might be human generated
some of it's a consequence of warming

2428
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
some of it's a consequence of warming
 

2429
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,230
some of it's a consequence of warming
after the ice age this has happened

2430
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
after the ice age this has happened
 

2431
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,790
after the ice age this has happened
before but fair enough let's take your

2432
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
before but fair enough let's take your
 

2433
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,390
before but fair enough let's take your
presumption

2434
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
presumption
 

2435
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,630
presumption
although there are multiple presumptions

2436
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
although there are multiple presumptions
 

2437
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,349
although there are multiple presumptions
and any error in your model multiplies

2438
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:43,359
and any error in your model multiplies
 

2439
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,550
and any error in your model multiplies
as time extends but to have it your way

2440
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
as time extends but to have it your way
 

2441
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,750
as time extends but to have it your way
okay now we're going to extend the

2442
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760
okay now we're going to extend the
 

2443
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,510
okay now we're going to extend the
climate model so to speak into the

2444
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
climate model so to speak into the
 

2445
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,230
climate model so to speak into the
economic model so i just did an analysis

2446
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240

if we get the climate problem under

2466
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
if we get the climate problem under
 

2467
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,430
if we get the climate problem under
control

2468
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440

2469
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,109

economically because that's where the

2470
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
economically because that's where the
 

2471
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,190
economically because that's where the
models are now being generated on the

2472
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
models are now being generated on the
 

2473
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,950
models are now being generated on the
economic front so now we have to model

2474
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
economic front so now we have to model
 

2475
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,230
economic front so now we have to model
the environment

2476
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,240
the environment
 

2477
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,550
the environment
that's climate and we have to model the

2478
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
that's climate and we have to model the
 

2479
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,589
that's climate and we have to model the
economy

2480
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
economy
 

2481
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,349
economy
and then we have to model their joint

2482
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
and then we have to model their joint
 

2483
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,510
and then we have to model their joint
interaction and then we have to predict

2484
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
interaction and then we have to predict
 

2485
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,670
interaction and then we have to predict
100 years into the future

2486
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
100 years into the future
 

2487
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,430
100 years into the future
and then we have to put a dollar value

2488
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
and then we have to put a dollar value
 

2489
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,550
and then we have to put a dollar value
on that

2490
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
on that
 

2491
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,390
on that
and then we have to claim that we can do

2492
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
and then we have to claim that we can do
 

2493
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,270
and then we have to claim that we can do
that

2494
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
that
 

2495
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,710
that
which we can't

2496
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
which we can't
 

2497
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,150
which we can't
and then this is our conclusion

2498
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
and then this is our conclusion
 

2499
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,589
and then this is our conclusion
we're going to go through a difficult

2500
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599
we're going to go through a difficult
 

2501
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,670
we're going to go through a difficult
period of privation

2502
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
period of privation
 

2503
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,190
period of privation
because if we don't accept limits to

2504
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
because if we don't accept limits to
 

2505
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,190
because if we don't accept limits to
growth there's going to be a catastrophe

2506
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
growth there's going to be a catastrophe
 

2507
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,349
growth there's going to be a catastrophe
50 years in the future thereabouts and

2508
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
50 years in the future thereabouts and
 

2509
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,910
50 years in the future thereabouts and
so to avert that catastrophe

2510
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
so to avert that catastrophe
 

2511
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,470
so to avert that catastrophe
we are going to make people poorer

2512
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
we are going to make people poorer
 

2513
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,670
we are going to make people poorer
now

2514
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
now
 

2515
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,990
now
how much poor well not a lot compared to

2516
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,000
how much poor well not a lot compared to
 

2517
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,069
how much poor well not a lot compared to
how much richer they're going to be but

2518
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
how much richer they're going to be but
 

2519
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,270
how much richer they're going to be but
definitely

2520
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:01,280
definitely
 

2521
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,030
definitely
and they say this in their own models

2522
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
and they say this in their own models
 

2523
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,230
and they say this in their own models
definitely poorer definitely poorer

2524
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
definitely poorer definitely poorer
 

2525
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,069
definitely poorer definitely poorer
than they would be if we just left them

2526
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
than they would be if we just left them
 

2527
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,829
than they would be if we just left them
the hell alone

2528
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
the hell alone
 

2529
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,470
the hell alone
and so then i think okay

2530
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
and so then i think okay
 

2531
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,150
and so then i think okay
poor array

2532
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
poor array
 

2533
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,030
poor array
who

2534
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
who
 

2535
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,950
who
well let's look at it biologically

2536
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:16,960
well let's look at it biologically
 

2537
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,430
well let's look at it biologically
you've got a hierarchy right of

2538
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
you've got a hierarchy right of
 

2539
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,430
you've got a hierarchy right of
stability and

2540
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
stability and
 

2541
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,790
stability and
security

2542
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
security
 

2543
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,309
security
that's a hierarchy or one type

2544
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
that's a hierarchy or one type
 

2545
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,990
that's a hierarchy or one type
you stress a hierarchy like that a

2546
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,000
you stress a hierarchy like that a
 

2547
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,790
you stress a hierarchy like that a
social hierarchy so there's birds in a

2548
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:30,800
social hierarchy so there's birds in a
 

2549
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,430
social hierarchy so there's birds in a
environment and an avian flu comes in

2550
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
environment and an avian flu comes in
 

2551
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,710
environment and an avian flu comes in
and then you look at the birds in the

2552
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
and then you look at the birds in the
 

2553
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,030
and then you look at the birds in the
social hierarchy and the

2554
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,040
social hierarchy and the
 

2555
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,790
social hierarchy and the
the low ranking birds have the worst

2556
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
the low ranking birds have the worst
 

2557
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,790
the low ranking birds have the worst
nests so they're most exposed to wind

2558
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
nests so they're most exposed to wind
 

2559
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,030
nests so they're most exposed to wind
and rain and sun and farthest from

2560
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,040
and rain and sun and farthest from
 

2561
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,710
and rain and sun and farthest from
food supplies and most exposed to

2562
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
food supplies and most exposed to
 

2563
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,150
food supplies and most exposed to
predators and so those birds are

2564
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
predators and so those birds are
 

2565
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,910
predators and so those birds are
stressed which is what happens to you at

2566
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
stressed which is what happens to you at
 

2567
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,349

the bottom of a hierarchy you're more
 

2569
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,030
the bottom of a hierarchy you're more
stressed because your life is more

immunological function is compromised
because of that

2576
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
because of that
 

2577
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,750
because of that
you're sacrificing the future for the

you're sacrificing the future for the

an avian flu comes in and the birds die
 

2583
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,790
an avian flu comes in and the birds die

you die
 

2589
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,230
you die
from the bottom up okay

from the bottom up okay
so they say when the aristocracy catches

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
so they say when the aristocracy catches

2595
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,990
a cold
the working class dies of pneumonia all

2596
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
the working class dies of pneumonia all
 

2597
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,510
the working class dies of pneumonia all
right so now we're going to make people

2598
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
right so now we're going to make people
 

2599
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,589
right so now we're going to make people
poorer

2600
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
poorer
 

2601
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,270
poorer
okay who

2602
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
okay who
 

2603
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,030
okay who
well we know who we make poor when we

2604
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
well we know who we make poor when we
 

2605
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,870
well we know who we make poor when we
make people poorer

2606
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
make people poorer
 

2607
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,150
make people poorer
we make those who are barely hanging on

2608
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:26,160
we make those who are barely hanging on
 

2609
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,710
we make those who are barely hanging on
poorer and what does that mean

2610
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
poorer and what does that mean
 

2611
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,790
poorer and what does that mean
it means they die

2612
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,800
it means they die
 

2613
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,430
it means they die
and so what the deloitte consultants are

2614
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:33,440
and so what the deloitte consultants are
 

2615
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,309
and so what the deloitte consultants are
basically saying is well

2616
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
basically saying is well
 

2617
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,950
basically saying is well
you know it's kind of unfortunate

2618
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
you know it's kind of unfortunate
 

2619
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,589
you know it's kind of unfortunate
but according to our models

2620
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
but according to our models
 

2621
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,109
but according to our models
a lot of poor people are going to have

2622
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
a lot of poor people are going to have
 

2623
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,550
a lot of poor people are going to have
to die

2624
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,560
to die
 

2625
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,470
to die
so that a lot more poor people don't die

2626
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
so that a lot more poor people don't die
 

2627
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,470
so that a lot more poor people don't die
in the future it's like okay hold on a

00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
in the future it's like okay hold on a

1.2 billion and then that little spiral

2704
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
1.2 billion and then that little spiral

1.2 billion and then that little spiral
because he said what happens in a famine

2706
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
because he said what happens in a famine
 

2707

the farmers

2714
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
the farmers

then the farmers don't have any money
then they can't grow crops and i think

2718
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
then they can't grow crops and i think
 

2719

can you elaborate

3184
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559

00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,230
adam and eve are thrown out of paradise
for becoming self-conscious or when they

3192
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
for becoming self-conscious or when they
 

3193
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,990
for becoming self-conscious or when they
become self-conscious

3194
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
become self-conscious
 

3195
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,470
become self-conscious
they're destined to work

3196
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:42,480
they're destined to work
 

3197
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,150
they're destined to work
and the reason for that as far as i can

3198
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
and the reason for that as far as i can
 

3199
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,990
and the reason for that as far as i can
tell is that

3200
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
tell is that
 

3201
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,829
tell is that
to become self-conscious is to become

3202
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:47,839
to become self-conscious is to become
 

3203
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,910
to become self-conscious is to become
aware of the future that's to become

3204
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
aware of the future that's to become
 

3205
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,910
aware of the future that's to become
aware of death that certainly happens in

3206
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
aware of death that certainly happens in
 

3207
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,670
aware of death that certainly happens in
the adam and eve story to have the

3208
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
the adam and eve story to have the
 

3209
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,910
the adam and eve story to have the
scales fall from your eyes

3210
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
scales fall from your eyes
 

3211
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,950
scales fall from your eyes
and then

3212
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
and then
 

3213
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,789
and then
the consequence of that is that you now

3214
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
the consequence of that is that you now
 

3215
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,309
the consequence of that is that you now
have to labor

3216
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
have to labor
 

3217
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,309
have to labor
to prevent the catastrophes of the

00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:02,319
to prevent the catastrophes of the
 

3219
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,349
to prevent the catastrophes of the
future

3220
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:03,359
future
 

3221
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,390

4206
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:08,719
i was really trying to figure out you
 

4207
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,310
i was really trying to figure out you
know the last two weeks thinking this

4208
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:10,320
know the last two weeks thinking this
 

4209
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,189
know the last two weeks thinking this
through it's like how do you know

4210
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
through it's like how do you know
 

4211
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,510
through it's like how do you know
let's say someone asked me a question in

4212
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
let's say someone asked me a question in
 

4213
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,669
let's say someone asked me a question in
in the youtube comments said why why why

4214
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
in the youtube comments said why why why
 

4215
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,910
in the youtube comments said why why why
can i trust your advice on the

4216
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
can i trust your advice on the
 

4217
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,149
can i trust your advice on the
environmental front

4218
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
environmental front
 

4219
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,910
environmental front
and i thought that's really good

4220
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
and i thought that's really good
 

4221
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,350
and i thought that's really good
question

4222
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:25,360
question
 

4223
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,630
question
okay

4224
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
okay
 

4225
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,550
okay
let's see if we can figure out the

4226
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
let's see if we can figure out the
 

4227
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,470
let's see if we can figure out the
principles by which the advice would be

4228
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
principles by which the advice would be
 

4229
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,550
principles by which the advice would be
trustworthy okay how how do you know

4230
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,560
trustworthy okay how how do you know
 

4231
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,390
trustworthy okay how how do you know
it's not trustworthy

4232
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,400
it's not trustworthy
 

4233
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,750
it's not trustworthy
well

4234
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
well
 

4235
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,270
well
one

4236
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
one
 

4237
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,709
one
potential

4238
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
potential
 

4239
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,950
potential
response to that would be the claims are

4240
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:40,960
response to that would be the claims are
 

4241
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,270
response to that would be the claims are
not in accordance with the facts but you

4242
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:43,280
not in accordance with the facts but you
 

4243
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,870
not in accordance with the facts but you
know facts are tricky things and it

4244
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880
know facts are tricky things and it
 

4245
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,030
know facts are tricky things and it
depends on where you look for them so

4246
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
depends on where you look for them so
 

4247
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,590
depends on where you look for them so
that's a tough one to get right because

4248
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
that's a tough one to get right because
 

4249
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,430
that's a tough one to get right because
for example lomberg's fundamental

4250
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
for example lomberg's fundamental
 

4251
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,990
for example lomberg's fundamental
critics argue about his facts not just

4252
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
critics argue about his facts not just
 

4253
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,990
critics argue about his facts not just
his interpretation of them

4254
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
his interpretation of them
 

4255
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,910
his interpretation of them
so that can't be an unerring guide and

4256
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
so that can't be an unerring guide and
 

4257
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,149
so that can't be an unerring guide and
so i thought well the facts exactly

4258
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
so i thought well the facts exactly
 

4259
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,590
so i thought well the facts exactly
doesn't work

4260
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
doesn't work
 

4261
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,110
doesn't work
because when it's about everything

4262
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:03,120
because when it's about everything
 

4263
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,110
because when it's about everything
there's too many facts

4264
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,120
there's too many facts
 

4265
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,550
there's too many facts
so then how do you determine if

4266
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:06,560
so then how do you determine if
 

4267
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,030
so then how do you determine if
someone's a trustworthy guide in the

4268
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
someone's a trustworthy guide in the
 

4269
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,430
someone's a trustworthy guide in the
face of the apocalyptic unknown because

4270
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
face of the apocalyptic unknown because
 

4271
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,189
face of the apocalyptic unknown because
that's really the question

4272
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
that's really the question
 

4273
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,870
that's really the question
and the answer is

4274
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
and the answer is
 

4275
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,310
and the answer is
they're not terrified tyrants

4276
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
they're not terrified tyrants
 

4277
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,390
they're not terrified tyrants
i think that's the answer

4278
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
i think that's the answer
 

4279
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,910
i think that's the answer
now maybe that's wrong if someone has a

4280
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:21,920
now maybe that's wrong if someone has a
 

4281
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,669
now maybe that's wrong if someone has a
better answer how do you know if they're

4282
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:23,679
better answer how do you know if they're
 

4283
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,270
better answer how do you know if they're
a terrified tyrant because they're

4284
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,280
a terrified tyrant because they're
 

4285
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,870
a terrified tyrant because they're
willing to use compulsion on other

4286
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
willing to use compulsion on other
 

4287
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,870
willing to use compulsion on other
people when they could use goodwill like

4288
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:30,880
people when they could use goodwill like
 

4289
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,030
people when they could use goodwill like
the farmers in canada objected they said

4290
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,040
the farmers in canada objected they said
 

4291
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,030
the farmers in canada objected they said
look

4292
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:35,040
look
 

4293
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,030
look
we have every economic reason to use as

4294
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
we have every economic reason to use as
 

4295
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,030
we have every economic reason to use as
little fertilizer as we can

4296
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
little fertilizer as we can
 

4297
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,630
little fertilizer as we can
because it's expensive

4298
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,640
because it's expensive

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,430
because it's expensive
we have satellite maps of where we put

4300
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
we have satellite maps of where we put
 

4301
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,350
we have satellite maps of where we put
the fertilizer we have cut our

01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:45,360
the fertilizer we have cut our

01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,870
the fertilizer we have cut our
fertilizer use

fertilizer use
 

4305
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,870
fertilizer use
so substantially in the last 40 years

01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,880
so substantially in the last 40 years
 

4307

so substantially in the last 40 years
you can't believe it and we grow way

4308
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
you can't believe it and we grow way
 

4309
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,110
you can't believe it and we grow way
more food we're already breaking

4310
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
more food we're already breaking
 

4311
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,709
more food we're already breaking

ourselves in half
and if you know farmers especially the

and if you know farmers especially the
 

4315
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,709
and if you know farmers especially the
ones who still survive you think you

4316
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
ones who still survive you think you
 

4317
01:14:58,719 --> 01:14:59,910
ones who still survive you think you
think those people don't know what

4318
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
think those people don't know what
 

4319
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,830
think those people don't know what
they're doing it's like

4320
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
they're doing it's like
 

4321
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,470
they're doing it's like
they're pretty damn sophisticated man

4322
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
they're pretty damn sophisticated man
 

4323
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,669
they're pretty damn sophisticated man
like

4324
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
like
 

4325
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,510
like
way more sophisticated than our prime

4326
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
way more sophisticated than our prime
 

4327

way more sophisticated than our prime

minister
 

4329
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,950
minister
and now you tell them no it's a 30

4330
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
and now you tell them no it's a 30
 

4331
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,709
and now you tell them no it's a 30
reduction and we don't care how much

4332
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
reduction and we don't care how much
 

4333
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,310
reduction and we don't care how much
food you're growing so it's not a

food you're growing so it's not a

that's

4338
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:17,440
that's
 

4339
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,229
that's
dependent on amount of food produced per

01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
dependent on amount of food produced per
 

4341
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,470
dependent on amount of food produced per
unit of fertilizer used which would be

4342
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
unit of fertilizer used which would be
 

4343
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,790
unit of fertilizer used which would be
at least you could imagine it it's okay

4344
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
at least you could imagine it it's okay
 

4345
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,030
at least you could imagine it it's okay
so you're producing this much food

4346
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,040
so you're producing this much food
 

4347
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,790
so you're producing this much food
and you use this much fertilizer so

4348
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
and you use this much fertilizer so
 

4349
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,550
and you use this much fertilizer so
you're hyper efficient

4350
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
you're hyper efficient
 

4351
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,470
you're hyper efficient
maybe we take the 10 of farmers who are

4352
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:32,480
maybe we take the 10 of farmers who are
 

4353
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,310
maybe we take the 10 of farmers who are
the least efficient in that

4354
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
the least efficient in that
 

4355
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,550
the least efficient in that
metric and we say to them you have to

4356
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
metric and we say to them you have to
 

4357
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,590
metric and we say to them you have to
get as efficient as the average farmer

4358
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
get as efficient as the average farmer
 

4359
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,590
get as efficient as the average farmer
and then they say well look you know our

4360
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
and then they say well look you know our
 

4361
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,270
and then they say well look you know our
our situation is different we're in a

4362
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
our situation is different we're in a
 

4363
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,990
our situation is different we're in a
more northern clime the soil is weaker

4364
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,000
more northern clime the soil is weaker
 

4365
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,590
more northern clime the soil is weaker

now today today that's a crucial
 

4419

and the answer to that is well
absolutely we even know the neurology

4694
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
absolutely we even know the neurology
 

4695
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,830
absolutely we even know the neurology
it's like when you first formulate a

4696
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
it's like when you first formulate a
 

4697
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,310
it's like when you first formulate a
concept huge swaths of your cortex are

4698
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,320
concept huge swaths of your cortex are
 

4699
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,030
concept huge swaths of your cortex are
lit up so to speak but as you practice

4700
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
lit up so to speak but as you practice
 

4701
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,070
lit up so to speak but as you practice
that

4702
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:34,080
that
 

4703
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,830
that
first of all the right hemisphere stops

4704
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
first of all the right hemisphere stops
 

4705
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,270
first of all the right hemisphere stops
participating and then the the laugh

4706
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
participating and then the the laugh
 

4707
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,950
participating and then the the laugh
participates less and less until you

4708
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
participates less and less until you
 

4709
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,669
participates less and less until you
build specialized machinery for exactly

4710
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
build specialized machinery for exactly
 

4711
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,310
build specialized machinery for exactly
that conceptual frame and then you start

4712
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
that conceptual frame and then you start
 

4713
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,950
that conceptual frame and then you start
to see it not just think it

4714
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
to see it not just think it
 

4715
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,030
to see it not just think it
and so if you're telling the same lies

4716
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
and so if you're telling the same lies
 

4717
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,229
and so if you're telling the same lies
over and over

4718
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
over and over
 

4719
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:53,750
over and over
who do you think you're fooling think

4720
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:53,760
who do you think you're fooling think
 

4721
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,390
who do you think you're fooling think
well i can withstand my own lies

4722
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:56,400
well i can withstand my own lies
 

4723
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,470
well i can withstand my own lies
not if they're effective lies and if

4724
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
not if they're effective lies and if
 

4725
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,110
not if they're effective lies and if
they're effective enough to fool

4726
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,120
they're effective enough to fool
 

4727
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,270
they're effective enough to fool
millions of people and then they reflect

4728
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
millions of people and then they reflect
 

4729
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,590
millions of people and then they reflect
them back to you what makes you think

4730
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
them back to you what makes you think
 

4731
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,189
them back to you what makes you think
you're going to be able to withstand

4732
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:07,199
you're going to be able to withstand
 

4733
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,070
you're going to be able to withstand
that

4734
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
that
 

4735
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,390
that
you aren't and so i do think putin

against the degeneration of the west and
 

4749
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,149
against the degeneration of the west and
that's that third way that dugan and

4750
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
that's that third way that dugan and
 

4751
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,910
that's that third way that dugan and
putin have been talking about the

01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
putin have been talking about the

for 15 years now what that is
 

4757
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,830
for 15 years now what that is
is very amorphous solzhenitsyn thought

the russians would have to re return to
the incremental development of orthodox

the incremental development of orthodox

01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,590
the incremental development of orthodox
christianity to escape from the

4764
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
christianity to escape from the
 

4765
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,070
christianity to escape from the
communist trap and to some degree that's

4766
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080
communist trap and to some degree that's
 

4767
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,270
communist trap and to some degree that's
happened in russia because there's been

4768
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
happened in russia because there's been
 

4769
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,590
happened in russia because there's been
a return to orthodox christianity now

4770
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,600
a return to orthodox christianity now
 

4771
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,350
a return to orthodox christianity now
you could say yeah but the orthodox

4772
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
you could say yeah but the orthodox
 

4773
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,950
you could say yeah but the orthodox
church has just been co-opted by the

4774
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
church has just been co-opted by the
 

4775
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,030
church has just been co-opted by the
state and i would say there's some

4776
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,040
state and i would say there's some
 

4777
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,950
state and i would say there's some
evidence for that i've heard for example

4778
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:56,960
evidence for that i've heard for example
 

4779
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,149
evidence for that i've heard for example
that the

4780
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
that the
 

4781
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,310
that the
metropolitan

4782
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
metropolitan
 

4783
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:03,110
metropolitan
owns now i don't know if this is true

4784
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
owns now i don't know if this is true
 

4785
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,709
owns now i don't know if this is true
owns five billion dollars worth of

4786
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,719
owns five billion dollars worth of
 

4787
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,870
owns five billion dollars worth of
personal property and i would say

4788
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:06,880
personal property and i would say
 

4789
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,950
personal property and i would say
there's a bit of a moral hazard in that

4790
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:08,960
there's a bit of a moral hazard in that
 

4791
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,270
there's a bit of a moral hazard in that
and it's possible that the orthodox

4792
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
and it's possible that the orthodox
 

4793
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,270
and it's possible that the orthodox
church has been co-opted but there has

4794
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:13,280
church has been co-opted but there has
 

4795
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,910
church has been co-opted but there has
been somewhat of an orthodox revival in

4796
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:15,920
been somewhat of an orthodox revival in
 

4797
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,470
been somewhat of an orthodox revival in
russia and i don't think that's all bad

4798
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
russia and i don't think that's all bad
 

4799
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,950
russia and i don't think that's all bad
now even if putin doesn't believe any of

4800
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:20,960
now even if putin doesn't believe any of
 

4801
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,950
now even if putin doesn't believe any of
this if he's just a psychopathic

4802
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
this if he's just a psychopathic
 

4803
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,790
this if he's just a psychopathic
manipulator and

4804
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,800
manipulator and
 

4805
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,629
manipulator and
unfortunately

4806
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
unfortunately
 

4807
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,110
unfortunately
i don't think that's true

4808
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,120
i don't think that's true
 

4809
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,430
i don't think that's true
i've read his speeches it doesn't look

4810
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
i've read his speeches it doesn't look
 

4811
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,669
i've read his speeches it doesn't look
like it to me and he is by no means the

4812
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:33,679
like it to me and he is by no means the
 

4813
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,510
like it to me and he is by no means the
worst russian leader of the last hundred

4814
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,520
worst russian leader of the last hundred
 

4815
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,189
worst russian leader of the last hundred
years

4816
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
years
 

4817
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,270
years
well there's quite a selection there

4818
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
well there's quite a selection there
 

4819
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,430
well there's quite a selection there
there certainly is but

4820
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,440
there certainly is but
 

4821
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,350
there certainly is but
and i say that knowing that

4822
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
and i say that knowing that
 

4823
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,550
and i say that knowing that
even if he doesn't believe it

4824
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
even if he doesn't believe it
 

4825
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,350
even if he doesn't believe it
he's convinced his people that it's true

4826
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
he's convinced his people that it's true
 

4827
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,990
he's convinced his people that it's true
and so we're stuck with the we're stuck

4828
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
and so we're stuck with the we're stuck
 

4829
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,430
and so we're stuck with the we're stuck
with the claim

4830
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,440
with the claim
 

4831
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,110
with the claim
in either case

01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
in either case
 

4833
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,390
in either case
and that's the point i was trying to

4834
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,400
and that's the point i was trying to
 

4835
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,750
and that's the point i was trying to
make in the article

4836
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760
make in the article
 

4837
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,350
make in the article
sometimes i'm troubled by

to sit for an hour and then i think okay

5650
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040

 

5651
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,430

what question am i trying to investigate

5652
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:07,440
what question am i trying to investigate
 

5653
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,669
what question am i trying to investigate
i have to have that that's the point

5654
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
i have to have that that's the point
 

5655
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,149
i have to have that that's the point
what mystery am i trying to

5656
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
what mystery am i trying to
 

5657
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,390
what mystery am i trying to
unravel it's usually associated with one

5658
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
unravel it's usually associated with one
 

5659
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,310
unravel it's usually associated with one
of the rules in my book because

5660
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:16,320
of the rules in my book because
 

5661
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,390
of the rules in my book because
technically it's a book tour but each of

5662
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,400
technically it's a book tour but each of
 

5663
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,709
technically it's a book tour but each of
those rules is an investigation into an

5664
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
those rules is an investigation into an
 

5665
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:21,590
those rules is an investigation into an
ethic

5666
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:21,600
ethic
 

5667
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,830
ethic
and each of them points to a deeper sort

5668
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
and each of them points to a deeper sort
 

5669
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,910
and each of them points to a deeper sort
of mystery in some sense and

5670
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
of mystery in some sense and
 

5671
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,510
of mystery in some sense and
there's no end to the amount it can be

5672
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:27,520
there's no end to the amount it can be
 

5673
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,629
there's no end to the amount it can be
explored

5674
01:38:28,629 --> 01:38:28,639
explored
 

5675
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:30,709
explored
and so i have the question

5676
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
and so i have the question
 

5677
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,510
and so i have the question
the question might be something like uh

5678
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,520
the question might be something like uh
 

5679
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,709
the question might be something like uh
put your

5700
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,960
mean to criticize the world how can you
 

5701
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,950
mean to criticize the world how can you
do that properly or improperly so i

5702
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
do that properly or improperly so i
 

5703
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,550
do that properly or improperly so i
start to think about how to decompose

5704
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560
start to think about how to decompose
 

5705
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,229
start to think about how to decompose
the question and you start to think

5706
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
the question and you start to think
 

5707
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:02,229
the question and you start to think
which of these decompositions are

5708
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:02,239
which of these decompositions are
 

5709
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,990
which of these decompositions are
important to really dig into yeah well

5710
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
important to really dig into yeah well
 

5711
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,590
important to really dig into yeah well
then they'll strike me it's like okay

5712
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
then they'll strike me it's like okay
 

5713
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,189
then they'll strike me it's like okay
there's something there that that i've

5714
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:07,199
there's something there that that i've
 

5715
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,270
there's something there that that i've
been maybe noodling around on that i

5716
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
been maybe noodling around on that i
 

5717
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,270
been maybe noodling around on that i
would like to investigate further then i

5718
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:11,280
would like to investigate further then i
 

5719
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,270
would like to investigate further then i
think okay how can i approach this

5720
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
think okay how can i approach this
 

5721
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,189
think okay how can i approach this
problem i think well i have this story

5722
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:15,199
problem i think well i have this story
 

5723
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,350
problem i think well i have this story
that i know i have this story and i have

5724
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:17,360
that i know i have this story and i have
 

5725
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,109
that i know i have this story and i have
this story but i haven't juxtaposed them

5726
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
this story but i haven't juxtaposed them
 

5727
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,709
this story but i haven't juxtaposed them
before and there's going to be some

5728
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
before and there's going to be some
 

5729
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:21,990
before and there's going to be some
interesting interaction in the

5730
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,000
interesting interaction in the
 

5731
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,790
interesting interaction in the
juxtaposition so i have the question and

5732
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:24,800
juxtaposition so i have the question and
 

5733
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,070
juxtaposition so i have the question and
i kind of have a framework of

5734
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
i kind of have a framework of
 

5735
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,229
i kind of have a framework of
interpretation and then i have some

5736
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:28,239
interpretation and then i have some
 

5737
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,030
interpretation and then i have some
potential narrative places i can go and

5738
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:31,040
potential narrative places i can go and
 

5739
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,189
potential narrative places i can go and
then i think okay i can go juggle that

5740
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:33,199
then i think okay i can go juggle that
 

5741
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:34,950
then i think okay i can go juggle that
and see what happens

5742
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:34,960
and see what happens
 

5743
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,870
and see what happens
and so then what i want to do is

5744
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:36,880
and so then what i want to do is
 

5745
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,109
and so then what i want to do is
concentrate on that process while

5746
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
concentrate on that process while
 

5747
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,709
concentrate on that process while
attending to the audience to make sure

5748
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
attending to the audience to make sure
 

5749
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,550
attending to the audience to make sure
that the words are landing

5750
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:42,560
that the words are landing
 

5751
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,229
that the words are landing
and then see if i can delve into it

5752
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:44,239
and then see if i can delve into it
 

5753
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,709
and then see if i can delve into it
deeply enough so that a narrative

5754
01:39:46,709 --> 01:39:46,719
deeply enough so that a narrative
 

5755
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:49,270
deeply enough so that a narrative
emerges spontaneously

5756
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:49,280
emerges spontaneously
 

5757
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,350
emerges spontaneously
with an ending now i'm sure you've

5758
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
with an ending now i'm sure you've
 

5759
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,590
with an ending now i'm sure you've
experienced this in podcasts right

5760
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:53,600
experienced this in podcasts right
 

5761
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,189
experienced this in podcasts right
maybe i'm wrong but my experience has

5762
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:55,199
maybe i'm wrong but my experience has
 

5763
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:55,990
maybe i'm wrong but my experience has
been

5764
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,000
been
 

5765
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,310
been
if i fall into the conversation

5766
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
if i fall into the conversation
 

5767
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,629
if i fall into the conversation
and we know about the time frame

5768
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
and we know about the time frame
 

5769
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,590
and we know about the time frame
there'll be a natural narrative arc

5770
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
there'll be a natural narrative arc
 

5771
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,109
there'll be a natural narrative arc
and then so you'll kind of know when the

5772
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
and then so you'll kind of know when the
 

5773
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,870
and then so you'll kind of know when the
midpoint is and you'll kind of see when

5774
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
midpoint is and you'll kind of see when
 

5775
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,310
midpoint is and you'll kind of see when
you're reaching a conclusion and then if

5776
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:08,320
you're reaching a conclusion and then if
 

5777
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,390
you're reaching a conclusion and then if
you really pay attention you can see

5778
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
you really pay attention you can see
 

5779
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,790
you really pay attention you can see
that's a good place to stop

5780
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:12,800
that's a good place to stop
 

5781
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,270
that's a good place to stop
it's kind of you come to a point

5782
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280
it's kind of you come to a point
 

5783
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,790
it's kind of you come to a point
and

5784
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
and
 

5785
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,270
and
you have to be alert and patient to see

5786
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,280
you have to be alert and patient to see
 

5787
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,070
you have to be alert and patient to see
that

5788
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
that
 

5789
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,590
that
and you have to be willing to be

5790
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
and you have to be willing to be
 

5791
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,990
and you have to be willing to be
satisfied with where you've got to

5792
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
satisfied with where you've got to
 

5793
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,830
satisfied with where you've got to
but if you do that and then it's like a

5794
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:25,840
but if you do that and then it's like a
 

5795
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,669
but if you do that and then it's like a
comedian making the

5796
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
comedian making the
 

5797
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,750
comedian making the
punch line work it's like

5798
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:29,760
punch line work it's like
 

5799
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,070
punch line work it's like
i've got all these balls in the air

5800
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,080
i've got all these balls in the air
 

5801
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,750
i've got all these balls in the air
and they're going somewhere

5802
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:33,760
and they're going somewhere
 

5803
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,109
and they're going somewhere
and this is

5804
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:35,119
and this is
 

5805
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,950
and this is
how they come together and people love

5806
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:36,960
how they come together and people love
 

5807
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,109
how they come together and people love
that right they say oh this and this

01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:37,679
well it's a tough one right because you
 

5973
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:38,950
well it's a tough one right because you
have to

5974
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:38,960
have to
 

5975
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,310
have to
because if you're a scientist a

5976
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:40,320
because if you're a scientist a
 

5977
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,590
because if you're a scientist a
materialist think well

5978
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600

 

5979
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,109

the matter is the most real it's like

5980
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:45,119
the matter is the most real it's like
 

5981
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,430
the matter is the most real it's like
well you don't know what the matter is

5982
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:47,440
well you don't know what the matter is
 

5983
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,270
well you don't know what the matter is
yeah and so and then when push comes to

5984
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,280
yeah and so and then when push comes to
 

5985
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,109
yeah and so and then when push comes to
shove and it will

5986
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:51,119
shove and it will
 

5987
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:54,790
shove and it will
you'll find out what's most real yeah

5988
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
you'll find out what's most real yeah
 

5989
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,750
you'll find out what's most real yeah
i i feel like this is uh

5990
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:57,760
i i feel like this is uh
 

5991
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,430
i i feel like this is uh
missing

5992
01:43:59,430 --> 01:43:59,440
missing
 

5993
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,830
missing
physical reality is is missing some of

5994
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:01,840
physical reality is is missing some of
 

5995
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,350
physical reality is is missing some of
the things

5996
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
the things
 

5997
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,350
the things
so of course pain has a biological

5998
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
so of course pain has a biological
 

5999
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,709
so of course pain has a biological
component and all those kinds of things

6000
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:06,719
component and all those kinds of things
 

6001
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,350
component and all those kinds of things
but it it's missing something deep about

6002
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,360
but it it's missing something deep about
 

6003
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,430
but it it's missing something deep about
the human condition that

6004
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
the human condition that
 

6005
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,270
the human condition that
at least the modern science is not able

6006
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:13,280
at least the modern science is not able
 

6007
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,229
at least the modern science is not able
to

6008
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
to
 

6009
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,870
to
uh describe but it is reaching towards

6010
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:16,880
uh describe but it is reaching towards
 

6011
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,669
uh describe but it is reaching towards
that yeah it is the reason

6012
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
that yeah it is the reason
 

6013
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,350
that yeah it is the reason
one way to describe it as you're

6014
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
one way to describe it as you're
 

6015
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,270
one way to describe it as you're
describing is the reason it's reaching

6016
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:23,280
describing is the reason it's reaching
 

6017
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,910
describing is the reason it's reaching
it is because underneath of science is

6018
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:25,920
it is because underneath of science is
 

6019
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,390
it is because underneath of science is

01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:28,400
this assumption that
 

6021
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,390
this assumption that
there's a deep

there's a deep

01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,229
to do
well you know there's two traditions

6030
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
well you know there's two traditions
 

6031
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,070
well you know there's two traditions
right in some sense there's two logos

6032
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:38,080
right in some sense there's two logos
 

6033
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,430
right in some sense there's two logos
traditions

6034
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
traditions
 

6035
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,390
traditions
there's the

6036
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,400
there's the
 

6037
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,590
there's the
the greek

6038
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:41,600
the greek
 

6039
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,950
the greek
rational

6040
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
rational
 

6041
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,950
rational
enlightenment tradition that's a logos

6042
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:44,960
enlightenment tradition that's a logos
 

6043
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,870
enlightenment tradition that's a logos
tradition and it insists that there's a

6044
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
tradition and it insists that there's a
 

6045
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,270
tradition and it insists that there's a
logos in nature and that science is the

6046
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
logos in nature and that science is the
 

6047
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,109
logos in nature and that science is the
way to approach it and then there's the

6048
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
way to approach it and then there's the
 

6049
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,950
way to approach it and then there's the
judeo-christian logos which is more

6050
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
judeo-christian logos which is more
 

6051
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,350
judeo-christian logos which is more
embodied and more spiritual and i would

6052
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,360
embodied and more spiritual and i would
 

6053
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,189
embodied and more spiritual and i would
say the west is actually an attempt to

6054
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
say the west is actually an attempt to
 

6055
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,870
say the west is actually an attempt to
unite those two

6056
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,880
unite those two
 

6057
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,950
unite those two
and it's the proper attempt to unite

6058
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:00,960
and it's the proper attempt to unite
 

6059
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,390
and it's the proper attempt to unite
those two

6060
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:02,400
those two
 

6061
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,709
those two
because they need to be united

6062
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
because they need to be united
 

6063
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,350
because they need to be united
and i see the union coming in near terms

6064
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
and i see the union coming in near terms
 

6065
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,189
and i see the union coming in near terms
you know i talk to friends to wall for

6066
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:09,199
you know i talk to friends to wall for
 

6067
01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:11,109

example about the animating principle of

6070
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
chimpanzee sovereignty
 

6071
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,350
chimpanzee sovereignty
and that's pretty close biologically is

6072
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
and that's pretty close biologically is
 

6073
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,629
and that's pretty close biologically is
it power

it power
 

6075
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:18,070
it power
because that's the claim even from the

01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
because that's the claim even from the

01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,870
because that's the claim even from the
biologists often the most dominant chimp

01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:20,880
biologists often the most dominant chimp
 

6079
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,430
biologists often the most dominant chimp
has the best reproductive success

6080
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
has the best reproductive success
 

6081
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,470
has the best reproductive success
it's like

6082
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
it's like
 

6083
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,510
it's like
oh yeah

6084
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,520
oh yeah
 

6085
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,229
oh yeah
dominant eh you mean using compulsion

6086
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:28,239
dominant eh you mean using compulsion
 

6087
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:31,030
dominant eh you mean using compulsion
okay let's look are the chimps who use

6088
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:31,040
okay let's look are the chimps who use
 

6089
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,790
okay let's look are the chimps who use
compulsion

6090
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:32,800

the most successful

6092
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:34,480
the most successful
 

6093
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,790
the most successful
and the answer is

6094
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:36,800
and the answer is
 

6095
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,950
and the answer is
sporadically and rarely

6096
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:38,960
sporadically and rarely
 

6097
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:41,350
sporadically and rarely
and for short well that's sporadically

6098
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:41,360
and for short well that's sporadically
 

6099
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,229
and for short well that's sporadically
for short periods of time why because

6100
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
for short periods of time why because
 

6101
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,590
for short periods of time why because
they meet an unpleasant end

6102
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:47,600
they meet an unpleasant end
 

6103
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,390
they meet an unpleasant end

of sovereignty is something like

reciprocity
 

6139
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,750
reciprocity
and that's a way better principle than

01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:25,760
and that's a way better principle than

6153
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:37,910
and you know you i don't know what you
think about that but when you have a

6154
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:37,920
think about that but when you have a
 

6155
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,830
think about that but when you have a
good podcast conversation you already

6156
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:39,840
good podcast conversation you already
 

6157
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,910
good podcast conversation you already
described it in some sense as play it's

6158
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:41,920
described it in some sense as play it's
 

6159
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,830
described it in some sense as play it's
like there's a structure right because

6160
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:43,840
like there's a structure right because
 

6161
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,070
like there's a structure right because
it's an ordered conversation but you

6162
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
it's an ordered conversation but you
 

6163
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,149
it's an ordered conversation but you
want there to be play in the system and

6164
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:48,159
want there to be play in the system and
 

6165
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,990
want there to be play in the system and
if you get that right then it's really

6166
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,000
if you get that right then it's really
 

6167
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,390
if you get that right then it's really
engaging and then it seems to have its

instead of the q and a's
 

6241
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,270
instead of the q and a's
basically what i was doing was writing a

6242
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:15,280
basically what i was doing was writing a
 

6243
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,669
basically what i was doing was writing a
whole book chapter every night

whole book chapter every night
 

6245

6246
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:19,520
and you know now that's a bit of an
 

6247
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,270
and you know now that's a bit of an
exaggeration because i would return to

6248
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:21,280
exaggeration because i would return to
 

6249
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,109
exaggeration because i would return to
themes that i had developed but it's not

6250
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:23,119
themes that i had developed but it's not
 

6251
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,270
themes that i had developed but it's not
really an exaggeration because i didn't

6252
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,280
really an exaggeration because i didn't
 

6253
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,149
really an exaggeration because i didn't
ever

and you know the answer is well you did
it

6270
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:43,199
it
 

6271
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,870

and then you just wait because that
 

6375
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,790
and then you just wait because that
stillness turns into an expectation and

6376
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:30,800
stillness turns into an expectation and
 

6377

01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:32,800
then it comes turns into a kind of
 

6379
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,950
then it comes turns into a kind of
nervous expectations like what the hell

6410
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:04,239
attention is unified and everyone's
 

6411
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,149
attention is unified and everyone's
moving in unison it's like we're all

6412
01:51:06,149 --> 01:51:06,159
moving in unison it's like we're all
 

6413
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,550
moving in unison it's like we're all
worshiping the same thing

6414
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,560
worshiping the same thing
 

6415
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,310
worshiping the same thing
right it's when that would be the point

6416
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:10,320
right it's when that would be the point
 

6417
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,629
right it's when that would be the point
of the conversation the point of the

6418
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:12,639
of the conversation the point of the
 

6419
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:14,870
of the conversation the point of the
lecture and the worship is the direction

6420
01:51:14,870 --> 01:51:14,880
lecture and the worship is the direction
 

6421
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,270
lecture and the worship is the direction
of attention towards it and it's uni

6422
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
of attention towards it and it's uni
 

6423
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,950
of attention towards it and it's uni
it's communion because everyone's doing

6424
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:18,960
it's communion because everyone's doing
 

6425
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,470
it's communion because everyone's doing
it at the same time

6426
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:20,480
it at the same time
 

6427
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,990
it at the same time
and so

6428
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,000
and so
 

6429
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,109
and so
i mean there's not much difference

6430
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:23,119
i mean there's not much difference
 

6431
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:24,629
i mean there's not much difference
between lecture theater and a church in

6432
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:24,639
between lecture theater and a church in
 

6433
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,229
between lecture theater and a church in
that regard right it's the same

6434
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239
that regard right it's the same
 

6435
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,310
that regard right it's the same
fundamental layout and structure and

6436
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:28,320
fundamental layout and structure and
 

6437
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,229
fundamental layout and structure and
they're very integrally associated with

6438
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
they're very integrally associated with
 

6439
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:31,830
they're very integrally associated with
one another one really grew out of the

6440
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:31,840
one another one really grew out of the
 

6441
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,270
one another one really grew out of the
other the lecture theater grew out of

6442
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,280
other the lecture theater grew out of
 

6443
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,750
other the lecture theater grew out of
the church so it's it's perfectly

6444
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
the church so it's it's perfectly
 

6445
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,109
the church so it's it's perfectly
reasonable to be thinking about it in

6446
01:51:37,109 --> 01:51:37,119
reasonable to be thinking about it in
 

6447
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:38,390
reasonable to be thinking about it in
those terms

6448
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
those terms
 

6449
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,950
those terms
and so and then okay so after

6450
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:40,960

7040
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:46,960
sustainable and all that's been is a
 

7041
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,229

plus

7042
02:01:48,229 --> 02:01:48,239
plus
 

7043
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:49,430
plus
because

7044
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:49,440
because
 

7045
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,669
because
i don't want to travel without her and

7046
02:01:51,669 --> 02:01:51,679

board and so she has to be properly

7052
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:57,440
board and so she has to be properly
 

7053
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,189
board and so she has to be properly
selfish

cultural representatives i suppose
 

7085
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:28,790
cultural representatives i suppose
10 to 30 from each country because i

7086
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
10 to 30 from each country because i
 

7087
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,830
10 to 30 from each country because i
have a network of people who have

7088
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:30,840
have a network of people who have
 

7089
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:34,149
have a network of people who have
networks who are setting me up with key

7090
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:34,159
networks who are setting me up with key
 

7091
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:35,189
networks who are setting me up with key
decision

7092
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:35,199
decision
 

7093
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:37,589
decision
makers in each country and so then we

7094
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
makers in each country and so then we
 

7095
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:39,669
makers in each country and so then we
have like an hour and a half of that now

7096
02:02:39,669 --> 02:02:39,679
have like an hour and a half of that now
 

7097
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:41,350
have like an hour and a half of that now
sometimes that's on a day when i don't

7098
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:41,360
sometimes that's on a day when i don't
 

7099
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,030
sometimes that's on a day when i don't
have a talk if we but sometimes the

7100
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,040
have a talk if we but sometimes the
 

7101
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,709
have a talk if we but sometimes the
talks are back to back

7102
02:02:44,709 --> 02:02:44,719
talks are back to back
 

7103
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:47,589
talks are back to back
and so she also has to

7104
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:47,599
and so she also has to
 

7105
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,669
and so she also has to
manage that and to be gracious and and

7106
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
manage that and to be gracious and and
 

7107
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,189
manage that and to be gracious and and
then people are showing us exciting

7108
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:51,199
then people are showing us exciting
 

7109
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,109
then people are showing us exciting
things and tours in the cities and which

fortunately
 

7127
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:12,149
fortunately
that is almost never a problem even when

7128
02:03:12,149 --> 02:03:12,159
that is almost never a problem even when
 

7129
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:13,109
that is almost never a problem even when
i was

7130
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:13,119
i was
 

7131
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:14,950
i was
unbelievably ill

7132
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:14,960
unbelievably ill
 

7133
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,030
unbelievably ill
for about three years

7134
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:17,040
for about three years
 

7135
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:18,550
for about three years
i thought about that a lot too you know

7136
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:18,560
i thought about that a lot too you know
 

7137
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,470
i thought about that a lot too you know
that i didn't do a really good job of

7138
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:20,480
that i didn't do a really good job of
 

7139
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:23,030
that i didn't do a really good job of
explaining that while i was ill because

7140
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:23,040
explaining that while i was ill because
 

7141
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,870
explaining that while i was ill because
it appeared in some sense that the

7142
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
it appeared in some sense that the
 

7143
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,470
it appeared in some sense that the
reason i was ill was because i was

7144
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
reason i was ill was because i was
 

7145
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,709
reason i was ill was because i was
taking benzodiazepines but that isn't

7146
02:03:28,709 --> 02:03:28,719
taking benzodiazepines but that isn't
 

7147
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:29,669
taking benzodiazepines but that isn't
why

7148
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
why
 

7149
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,870
why
i was ill and then i took them and very

7150
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:32,880
i was ill and then i took them and very
 

7151
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,870
i was ill and then i took them and very
low dose and i took that for a long time

7152
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:34,880
low dose and i took that for a long time
 

7153
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:37,189
low dose and i took that for a long time
and it helped whatever was wrong with me

7154
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
and it helped whatever was wrong with me
 

7155
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,430
and it helped whatever was wrong with me
and it looks like it was an allergy or

7156
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:39,440
and it looks like it was an allergy or
 

7157
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:40,830
and it looks like it was an allergy or
maybe multiple

7158
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:40,840
maybe multiple
 

7159
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,750
maybe multiple
allergies and then

7160
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:43,760
allergies and then
 

7161
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,589
allergies and then
that stopped working and so i took a

7162
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
that stopped working and so i took a
 

7163
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,830
that stopped working and so i took a
little bit more for about a month and

7164
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:47,840
little bit more for about a month and
 

7165
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,589
little bit more for about a month and
that made it way worse and so then i cut

7166
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:49,599
that made it way worse and so then i cut
 

7167
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:52,149
that made it way worse and so then i cut
back a lot and then

7168
02:03:52,149 --> 02:03:52,159
back a lot and then
 

7169
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:54,310
back a lot and then
then things really got out of hand and

7170
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320
then things really got out of hand and
 

7171
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,470
then things really got out of hand and
so so there was a deeper thing

7172
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:56,480
so so there was a deeper thing
 

7173
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,589
so so there was a deeper thing
oh yeah

7174
02:03:57,589 --> 02:03:57,599
oh yeah
 

7175
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:00,149
oh yeah
oh yeah what can you put words to

7176
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:00,159
oh yeah what can you put words to
 

7177
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:01,750
oh yeah what can you put words to
well i had a lot of immune my my

7178
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
well i had a lot of immune my my
 

7179
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,709
well i had a lot of immune my my
daughter as everyone knows has a very

7180
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:04,719
daughter as everyone knows has a very
 

7181
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:07,430
daughter as everyone knows has a very
reactive immune system and tammy has

7182
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:07,440
reactive immune system and tammy has
 

7183
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,069
reactive immune system and tammy has
three immunological conditions each of

7184
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
three immunological conditions each of
 

7185
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,950
three immunological conditions each of
them quite serious and i had psoriasis

7186
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:12,960
them quite serious and i had psoriasis
 

7187
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,709
them quite serious and i had psoriasis
and peripheral uveitis which is an

7188
02:04:14,709 --> 02:04:14,719
and peripheral uveitis which is an
 

7189
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:17,750
and peripheral uveitis which is an
autoimmune condition and alopecia areata

7190
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:17,760
autoimmune condition and alopecia areata
 

7191
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,030
autoimmune condition and alopecia areata
and

7192
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,040
and
 

7193
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,030
and
chronic gum disease all of which

7194
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:21,040
chronic gum disease all of which
 

7195
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,109
chronic gum disease all of which
appeared to be elderly related and so

7196
02:04:23,109 --> 02:04:23,119
appeared to be elderly related and so
 

7197
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,589
appeared to be elderly related and so
michaela seems to have got all of that

7198
02:04:25,589 --> 02:04:25,599
michaela seems to have got all of that
 

7199
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:27,830
michaela seems to have got all of that
and so that and that i think was at the

7200
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:27,840
and so that and that i think was at the
 

7201
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,109
and so that and that i think was at the
bottom of because i also had this

7202
02:04:29,109 --> 02:04:29,119
bottom of because i also had this
 

7203
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:31,189
bottom of because i also had this
proclivity to depression that was part

7204
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:31,199
proclivity to depression that was part
 

7205
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:33,350
proclivity to depression that was part
of my family history but i think that

7206
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
of my family history but i think that
 

7207
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,189
of my family history but i think that
was all immunological as far as i can

7208
02:04:35,189 --> 02:04:35,199
was all immunological as far as i can
 

7209
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:36,310
was all immunological as far as i can
tell so one of the things that's

7210
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
tell so one of the things that's
 

7211
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,669
tell so one of the things that's
happened to me

7212
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:37,679
happened to me
 

7213
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,270
happened to me
i always noticed i really couldn't

7214
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:39,280
i always noticed i really couldn't
 

7215
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,310
i always noticed i really couldn't
breathe

7216
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
breathe
 

7217
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,310
breathe
like i could breathe about one-fifth as

7218
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
like i could breathe about one-fifth as
 

7219
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,830
like i could breathe about one-fifth as
much as i

7220
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:43,840
much as i
 

7221
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,390
much as i
sometimes could

7222
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:46,400
sometimes could
 

7223
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,270
sometimes could
and so i was always short of breath and

7224
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:49,280
and so i was always short of breath and
 

7225
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,950
and so i was always short of breath and
it looks like what that was perhaps was

7226
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:52,960
it looks like what that was perhaps was
 

7227
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,310
it looks like what that was perhaps was
i was always on the border of an

7228
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
i was always on the border of an
 

7229
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,229
i was always on the border of an
anaphylactic reaction

7230
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:56,239
anaphylactic reaction
 

7231
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,550
anaphylactic reaction
which is not pleasant

7232
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:58,560
which is not pleasant
 

7233
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,030
which is not pleasant
and that's hyper sympathetic activation

7234
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040
and that's hyper sympathetic activation
 

7235
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,350
and that's hyper sympathetic activation
no parasympathetic activation i couldn't

7236
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:03,360
no parasympathetic activation i couldn't
 

7237
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,709
no parasympathetic activation i couldn't
relax

7238
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
relax
 

7239
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,270
relax
at all that's an immunological response

7240
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:07,280
at all that's an immunological response
 

7241
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,910
at all that's an immunological response
allergic response yeah

7242
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:09,920
allergic response yeah
 

7243
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,870
allergic response yeah

7291
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,950
different kinds of diets but i should
say for me personally it does seem that

that's very interesting and i discovered

7298
02:06:08,069 --> 02:06:08,079
that's very interesting and i discovered
 

7299
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:08,870
that's very interesting and i discovered
that

7300
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:08,880
that
 

7301
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,109
that
a long time ago first of all how do you

7302
02:06:11,109 --> 02:06:11,119
a long time ago first of all how do you
 

7303
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:14,069
a long time ago first of all how do you
discover it uh so by

7304
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
discover it uh so by
 

7305
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:15,750
discover it uh so by
the discovery went like this i started

7306
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:15,760
the discovery went like this i started
 

7307
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,830
the discovery went like this i started
listening to ultra marathon runners

7308
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
listening to ultra marathon runners
 

7309
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:18,629
listening to ultra marathon runners
about

7310
02:06:18,629 --> 02:06:18,639
about
 

7311
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,229
about
15 years ago

7312
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:20,239
15 years ago
 

7313
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,390
15 years ago
and they started talking about

7314
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:22,400
and they started talking about
 

7315
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,149
and they started talking about
fat

7316
02:06:24,149 --> 02:06:24,159
fat
 

7317
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:27,109
fat
adapted running

7318
02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:27,119
adapted running
 

7319
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:29,109
adapted running
so i first discovered that i don't have

7320
02:06:29,109 --> 02:06:29,119
so i first discovered that i don't have
 

7321
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:32,390
so i first discovered that i don't have
to run super fast to enjoy running and

7322
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:32,400
to run super fast to enjoy running and
 

7323
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,229
to run super fast to enjoy running and
in fact i really enjoy running at a

7324
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:34,239
in fact i really enjoy running at a
 

7325
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:36,149
in fact i really enjoy running at a
slower pace

7326
02:06:36,149 --> 02:06:36,159
slower pace
 

7327
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:37,990
slower pace
so that was like step one it's like oh

7328
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:38,000
so that was like step one it's like oh
 

7329
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,750
so that was like step one it's like oh
okay if i maintain

7330
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
okay if i maintain
 

7331
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,350
okay if i maintain
something called uh

7332
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:41,360
something called uh
 

7333
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:44,390
something called uh
the math rule which is a pretty low

7334
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
the math rule which is a pretty low
 

7335
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,149
the math rule which is a pretty low
heart rate if i maintain that you can

7336
02:06:46,149 --> 02:06:46,159
heart rate if i maintain that you can
 

7337
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:47,830
heart rate if i maintain that you can
actually get pretty fast while

7338
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
actually get pretty fast while
 

7339
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,750
actually get pretty fast while
maintaining a pretty slow average speed

7340
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:49,760
maintaining a pretty slow average speed
 

7341
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,709
maintaining a pretty slow average speed
in general anyway they fuel themselves

7342
02:06:52,709 --> 02:06:52,719
in general anyway they fuel themselves
 

7343
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:53,430
in general anyway they fuel themselves
on

7344
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,440
on
 

7345
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,669
on
low carb diets

7346
02:06:55,669 --> 02:06:55,679
low carb diets
 

7347
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,189
low carb diets
so i got into that

7348
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:57,199
so i got into that
 

7349
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:59,750
so i got into that
on top of that i also they also fast

7350
02:06:59,750 --> 02:06:59,760
on top of that i also they also fast
 

7351
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:02,709
on top of that i also they also fast
often so i discovered how incredible my

7352
02:07:02,709 --> 02:07:02,719
often so i discovered how incredible my
 

7353
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:04,709
often so i discovered how incredible my
mind feels

7354
02:07:04,709 --> 02:07:04,719
mind feels
 

7355
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:06,310
mind feels
when fasted you know people call it

7356
02:07:06,310 --> 02:07:06,320
when fasted you know people call it
 

7357
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,629
when fasted you know people call it
intermittent fasting but well that's an

7358
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:08,639
intermittent fasting but well that's an
 

7359
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:11,189
intermittent fasting but well that's an
optimization of death eh because

7360
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:11,199
optimization of death eh because
 

7361
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:14,629
optimization of death eh because
you're when you fast your body

7362
02:07:14,629 --> 02:07:14,639
you're when you fast your body
 

7363
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:16,390
you're when you fast your body
logically and obviously if you think

7364
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:16,400
logically and obviously if you think
 

7365
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,950
logically and obviously if you think
about it biologically is well what does

7366
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
about it biologically is well what does
 

7367
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,589
about it biologically is well what does
your body scavenge first well

7368
02:07:21,589 --> 02:07:21,599
your body scavenge first well
 

7369
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:24,069
your body scavenge first well
damaged tissue

7370
02:07:24,069 --> 02:07:24,079
damaged tissue
 

7371
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:25,510
damaged tissue
so

7372
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,520
so
 

7373
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,390
so
the the

7374
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
the the
 

7375
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,149
the the
i know the literature on fasting to some

7376
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:28,159
i know the literature on fasting to some
 

7377
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:30,069
i know the literature on fasting to some
degree and it's it's very compelling

7378
02:07:30,069 --> 02:07:30,079
degree and it's it's very compelling
 

7379
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:32,069
degree and it's it's very compelling
literature if you if you starve dogs

7380
02:07:32,069 --> 02:07:32,079
literature if you if you starve dogs
 

7381
02:07:32,079 --> 02:07:34,870
literature if you if you starve dogs
down i think it's 20 below rats too

7382
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:34,880
down i think it's 20 below rats too
 

7383
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,310
down i think it's 20 below rats too
below their optimal body weight they

7384
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,320
below their optimal body weight they
 

7385
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,069
below their optimal body weight they
live 30 percent longer

7386
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:38,079
live 30 percent longer
 

7387
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:38,870
live 30 percent longer
yeah

7388
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:38,880
yeah
 

7389
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,790
yeah
that's a lot thirty percent like it's

7390
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:40,800
that's a lot thirty percent like it's
 

7391
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,790
that's a lot thirty percent like it's
like thirty percent yeah yeah thirty

7392
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:42,800
like thirty percent yeah yeah thirty
 

7393
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,510
like thirty percent yeah yeah thirty
percent well there there is aspect to a

7394
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:45,520
percent well there there is aspect to a
 

7395
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,109
percent well there there is aspect to a
lot of these things that make me nervous

7396
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:47,119
lot of these things that make me nervous
 

7397
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:48,790
lot of these things that make me nervous
because it's i always feel like there's

7398

because it's i always feel like there's
 

7399
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,550
because it's i always feel like there's
no free lunch that i'm gonna pay for it

7400
02:07:50,550 --> 02:07:50,560
no free lunch that i'm gonna pay for it
 

7401
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,350
no free lunch that i'm gonna pay for it
somehow but there is a focus that i am

7402
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360
somehow but there is a focus that i am
 

7403
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,830
somehow but there is a focus that i am
able to attain when i fast

wonder how much of that's associated

7416
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040

wonder how much of that's associated
with

7418
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,320
with

well imagine that

7420
02:08:12,069 --> 02:08:12,079
well imagine that
 

7421
02:08:12,079 --> 02:08:14,470
well imagine that
that signifies lack of food which not

7422
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
that signifies lack of food which not
 

7423
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,390
that signifies lack of food which not
that hard to imagine well maybe you

7424
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:16,400
that hard to imagine well maybe you
 

7425
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,069
that hard to imagine well maybe you
should be a lot more alert in that

7426
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
should be a lot more alert in that
 

7427
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:20,390
should be a lot more alert in that
situation right biologically speaking

7428
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,400
situation right biologically speaking
 

7429
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,669
situation right biologically speaking
because you're in hunting mode let's say

7430
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
because you're in hunting mode let's say
 

7431
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,750
because you're in hunting mode let's say
you know not desperate but in hunting

7432
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:25,760
you know not desperate but in hunting
 

7433
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:28,310
you know not desperate but in hunting
mode and god only knows

7434
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:28,320
mode and god only knows
 

7435
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,990
mode and god only knows
maybe human beings should be in hunting

7436
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
maybe human beings should be in hunting
 

7437
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,910
maybe human beings should be in hunting
mode all the time often but that we

7438
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:31,920
mode all the time often but that we
 

7439
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,830
mode all the time often but that we
don't know that so i wonder if it has

7440
02:08:34,830 --> 02:08:34,840
don't know that so i wonder if it has
 

7441
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,310
don't know that so i wonder if it has
a stress on the system that long term

7442
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,320
a stress on the system that long term
 

7443
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,149
a stress on the system that long term
causes the system doesn't it doesn't

7444
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
causes the system doesn't it doesn't
 

7445
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:42,550
causes the system doesn't it doesn't

and that can be
 

7857
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,470
and that can be
debilitating

7858
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:52,480
debilitating
 

7859
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:55,030

02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,760
there's a production center
 

7887
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,669
there's a production center
and an editing center

7888
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679

strokes
 

7893
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:28,390
strokes
and so

7894
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:28,400
and so
 

7895
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:30,229

will it repeat again in what way is it
 

8099
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:52,870
will it repeat again in what way is it
repeating again and how can we stop it

8100
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:52,880
repeating again and how can we stop it
 

8101
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,710
repeating again and how can we stop it
and how can we stop it and so that's the

uh
cast on us

8134
02:20:28,389 --> 02:20:28,399
cast on us
 

8135
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:30,790
cast on us
and so that was one and also the

psychology i wanted to be a psychiatrist
 

8139
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,750
psychology i wanted to be a psychiatrist
for a long time i was uh

8140
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:35,760
for a long time i was uh
 

8141
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,389
for a long time i was uh
i was fascinated by the human mind

8142
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:38,399
i was fascinated by the human mind
 

8143
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:40,389
i was fascinated by the human mind
and until i discovered artificial

8144
02:20:40,389 --> 02:20:40,399
and until i discovered artificial
 

8145
02:20:40,399 --> 02:20:41,670
and until i discovered artificial
intelligence the fact that i could

8146
02:20:41,670 --> 02:20:41,680
intelligence the fact that i could
 

8147
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:44,950
intelligence the fact that i could
program and make a robot move and

8148
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:44,960
program and make a robot move and
 

8149
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,590
program and make a robot move and
until i discovered that magic

8150
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:47,600
until i discovered that magic
 

8151
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,349
until i discovered that magic
i thought i wanted to understand the

8152
02:20:49,349 --> 02:20:49,359
i thought i wanted to understand the
 

8153
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:51,110
i thought i wanted to understand the
human mind by being psychiatrist by

8154
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:51,120
human mind by being psychiatrist by
 

8155
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,950
human mind by being psychiatrist by
talking to people by

8156
02:20:52,950 --> 02:20:52,960
talking to people by
 

8157
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:54,950
talking to people by
through to talk therapy psychotherapy

8158
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:54,960
through to talk therapy psychotherapy
 

8159
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,630
through to talk therapy psychotherapy
now you've got the best of both worlds

8160
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:56,640
now you've got the best of both worlds
 

8161
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,070
now you've got the best of both worlds
because you get to talk to people and

8162
02:20:58,070 --> 02:20:58,080
because you get to talk to people and
 

8163
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,630
because you get to talk to people and
you get build robots yeah i mean but the

8164
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:00,640
you get build robots yeah i mean but the
 

8165
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:03,510
you get build robots yeah i mean but the
dream ultimately is the robot

8166
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:03,520
dream ultimately is the robot
 

8167
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,510
dream ultimately is the robot
that i felt like by building the

8168
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:05,520
that i felt like by building the
 

8169
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:07,670
that i felt like by building the
thinking you start to try to understand

8170
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:07,680
thinking you start to try to understand
 

8171
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,309
thinking you start to try to understand
it yeah that's one way i mean we're all

8172
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:10,319
it yeah that's one way i mean we're all
 

8173
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:11,830
it yeah that's one way i mean we're all
we all have different skills and

8174
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:11,840
we all have different skills and
 

8175
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:15,510
we all have different skills and
proclivities so like my particular one

8176
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:15,520
proclivities so like my particular one
 

8177
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:19,510
proclivities so like my particular one
is uh has to do with

8178
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:19,520

 

8179
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:23,510

uh i learn by building yeah i i think

8180
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:23,520
uh i learn by building yeah i i think
 

8181
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:25,830
uh i learn by building yeah i i think
through a thing by building it and

8182
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:25,840
through a thing by building it and
 

8183
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,670
through a thing by building it and
programming is a wonderful thing because

8184
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:27,680
programming is a wonderful thing because
 

8185
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,670
programming is a wonderful thing because
it allows you to like build a little toy

8186
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:29,680
it allows you to like build a little toy
 

8187
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:31,510
it allows you to like build a little toy
example so in the same way you can do a

8188
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
example so in the same way you can do a
 

8189
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,190
example so in the same way you can do a
little thought experiment

8190
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:33,200
little thought experiment
 

8191
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:34,870
little thought experiment
uh programming allows you to create a

8192
02:21:34,870 --> 02:21:34,880
uh programming allows you to create a
 

8193
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,710
uh programming allows you to create a
thought experiment in action it can move

8194
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:36,720
thought experiment in action it can move
 

8195
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,950
thought experiment in action it can move
it can live and can right and then you

8196
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:38,960
it can live and can right and then you
 

8197
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:42,550
it can live and can right and then you
can ask questions of it so all of those

8198
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:42,560
can ask questions of it so all of those
 

8199
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:44,230
can ask questions of it so all of those
because of my interest in freud and

8200
02:21:44,230 --> 02:21:44,240
because of my interest in freud and
 

8201
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:46,950
because of my interest in freud and
young

8202
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:46,960

 

8203
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,750

you're also in different ways

8204
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:49,760
you're also in different ways
 

8205
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:51,270
you're also in different ways
have have

8206
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:51,280
have have
 

8207
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,150
have have
delved deeply into

8208
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:54,160

02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
those
 

8215
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:01,190
those
psychologists so all for all those

8216
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:01,200
psychologists so all for all those
 

8217
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:04,230
psychologists so all for all those
reasons i thought our password across

8218
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,240
reasons i thought our password across
 

8219
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:06,070
reasons i thought our password across
yeah so that well so that's quite a

8220
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:06,080
yeah so that well so that's quite a
 

8221
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,750
yeah so that well so that's quite a
frame for a discussion right you had all

8222
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:07,760
frame for a discussion right you had all
 

8223
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,750
frame for a discussion right you had all
sorts of reasons and then you think

8224
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:09,760
sorts of reasons and then you think
 

8225
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,510
sorts of reasons and then you think
well are you just letting the

8226
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
well are you just letting the
 

8227
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,590
well are you just letting the
conversation go where it will it's like

8228
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:13,600
conversation go where it will it's like
 

8229
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,349
conversation go where it will it's like
well not exactly

8230
02:22:15,349 --> 02:22:15,359
well not exactly
 

8231
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:17,670
well not exactly
you spent all this time

8232
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:17,680
you spent all this time
 

8233
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:19,190
you spent all this time
it's not like this came about by

8234
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:19,200
it's not like this came about by
 

8235
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,270
it's not like this came about by
accident this conversation you spent all

8236
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:21,280
accident this conversation you spent all
 

8237
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:24,070
accident this conversation you spent all
this time framing it and so

8238
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:24,080
this time framing it and so
 

8239
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,830
this time framing it and so
all of that provides the implicit

8240
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:25,840
all of that provides the implicit
 

8241
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,670
all of that provides the implicit
substructure for the play in the

8242
02:22:27,670 --> 02:22:27,680
substructure for the play in the
 

8243
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,830
substructure for the play in the
conversation and if you have that

8244
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:29,840
conversation and if you have that
 

8245
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:32,070
conversation and if you have that
implicit here's another way this is very

8246
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:32,080
implicit here's another way this is very
 

8247
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,150
implicit here's another way this is very
much worth knowing is

8248
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
much worth knowing is
 

8249
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:35,990
much worth knowing is
if you get the implicit structure of

8250
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:36,000
if you get the implicit structure of
 

8251
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,389
if you get the implicit structure of
perception right everything becomes a

8252
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:38,399
perception right everything becomes a
 

8253
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:40,389
perception right everything becomes a
game

8254
02:22:40,389 --> 02:22:40,399
game
 

8255
02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:41,830
game
and not only that a game you want to

8256
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:41,840
and not only that a game you want to
 

8257
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,990
and not only that a game you want to
play and maybe in the final analysis a

8258
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:44,000
play and maybe in the final analysis a
 

8259
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,950
play and maybe in the final analysis a
game you'd want to play forever

8260
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:46,960
game you'd want to play forever
 

8261
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:48,950
game you'd want to play forever
so

8262
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:48,960
so
 

8263
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,790
so
you know that's obviously a distant

8264
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:50,800
you know that's obviously a distant
 

8265
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,510
you know that's obviously a distant
beckoning ideal but

8266
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:53,520
beckoning ideal but
 

8267
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:56,309
beckoning ideal but
we known games need rules

8268
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:56,319
we known games need rules
 

8269
02:22:56,319 --> 02:22:58,150
we known games need rules
or there's no play

8270
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:58,160
or there's no play
 

8271
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:00,309
or there's no play
is there a device you can give

8272
02:23:00,309 --> 02:23:00,319
is there a device you can give
 

8273
02:23:00,319 --> 02:23:02,950
is there a device you can give
uh now that we know the frame

8274
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:02,960
uh now that we know the frame
 

8275
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:06,070
uh now that we know the frame
to give to me lex about

8276
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:06,080
to give to me lex about
 

8277
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:07,510
to give to me lex about
how to

8278
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:07,520
how to
 

8279
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:14,150
how to
do this podcast better how to

8280
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:14,160

 

8281
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,630

think

8282
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:16,640

 

8283
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:18,870

about this world how to be a good

8284
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
about this world how to be a good
 

8285
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,950
about this world how to be a good
engineer

8286
02:23:20,950 --> 02:23:20,960
engineer
 

8287
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:24,230
engineer
how to uh be a good human being

8288
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
how to uh be a good human being
 

8289
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:25,429
how to uh be a good human being
from

8290
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:25,439
from
 

8291
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:27,349
from
take your preoccupation with suffering

8292
02:23:27,349 --> 02:23:27,359
take your preoccupation with suffering
 

8293
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:29,190
take your preoccupation with suffering
seriously

8294
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,200
seriously
 

8295
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,190
seriously
it's a serious business

8296
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:33,200

 

8297
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,590

right and that's part of that to circle

8298
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:35,600
right and that's part of that to circle
 

8299
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,750
right and that's part of that to circle
back to the beginning let's say

8300
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:37,760
back to the beginning let's say
 

8301
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,590
back to the beginning let's say
that's that willingness to gaze into the

8302
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:39,600
that's that willingness to gaze into the
 

8303
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:41,190
that's that willingness to gaze into the
abyss which is obviously what you were

8304
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:41,200
abyss which is obviously what you were
 

8305
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,270
abyss which is obviously what you were
doing when you went to ukraine

8306
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:43,280
doing when you went to ukraine
 

8307
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:45,270
doing when you went to ukraine
it's like

8308
02:23:45,270 --> 02:23:45,280
it's like
 

8309
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:46,950
it's like
it's gazing into the abyss that makes

8310
02:23:46,950 --> 02:23:46,960
it's gazing into the abyss that makes
 

8311
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:48,309
it's gazing into the abyss that makes
you better

8312
02:23:48,309 --> 02:23:48,319
you better
 

8313
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:50,230
you better
the thing is and this is maybe where

8314
02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:50,240
the thing is and this is maybe where
 

8315
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:51,270
the thing is and this is maybe where
nietzsche's

8316
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:51,280
nietzsche's
 

8317
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:54,230
nietzsche's
idea is not as differentiated as it

8318
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
idea is not as differentiated as it
 

8319
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:57,590
idea is not as differentiated as it
became

8320
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600

 

8321
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,230

sometimes your gaze can be forcefully

8322
02:24:00,230 --> 02:24:00,240
sometimes your gaze can be forcefully
 

8323
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:02,630
sometimes your gaze can be forcefully
directed towards the abyss

8324
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:02,640
directed towards the abyss
 

8325
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:04,790
directed towards the abyss
and then you're traumatized

8326
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:04,800
and then you're traumatized
 

8327
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,190
and then you're traumatized
if it's involuntary and accidental it

8328
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
if it's involuntary and accidental it
 

8329
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,950
if it's involuntary and accidental it
can kill you

8330
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:08,960
can kill you
 

8331
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:12,550
can kill you
the more it's voluntary

8332
02:24:12,550 --> 02:24:12,560

 

8333
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:15,110

the more transformative it is and that's

8334
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,120
the more transformative it is and that's
 

8335
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,870
the more transformative it is and that's
part of that idea about facing death and

8336
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:16,880
part of that idea about facing death and
 

8337
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:17,990
part of that idea about facing death and
hell

8338
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
hell
 

8339
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,110
hell
it's like can you tolerate death in hell

8340
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:21,120
it's like can you tolerate death in hell
 

8341
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:22,550
it's like can you tolerate death in hell
and the answer is

8342
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:22,560
and the answer is
 

8343
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:25,190
and the answer is
this terrible answer is

8344
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200
this terrible answer is
 

8345
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,389
this terrible answer is
yes

8346
02:24:26,389 --> 02:24:26,399
yes
 

8347
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:28,230
yes
to the degree that you're willing to do

8348
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,240
to the degree that you're willing to do
 

8349
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:30,230
to the degree that you're willing to do
it

8350
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
it
 

8351
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,190
it
voluntarily and then you might ask well

8352
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:33,200
voluntarily and then you might ask well
 

8353
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,910
voluntarily and then you might ask well
why should i have to subject myself to

8354
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:35,920
why should i have to subject myself to
 

8355
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,790
why should i have to subject myself to
death in hell i'm innocent

8356
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:38,800
death in hell i'm innocent
 

8357
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:44,790
death in hell i'm innocent
and then the answer to that is

8358
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:44,800

 

8359
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,030

even the innocent must be voluntarily

8360
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:47,040
even the innocent must be voluntarily
 

8361
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:54,150
even the innocent must be voluntarily
sacrificed to the highest good

8362
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:54,160

 

8363
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:58,630

that's such an interesting distinction

8364
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:58,640

 

8365
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:01,190

voluntary suffering voluntary yeah

8366
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
voluntary suffering voluntary yeah
 

8367
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:02,950
voluntary suffering voluntary yeah
yeah well that's why the central

8368
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:02,960
yeah well that's why the central
 

8369
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,710
yeah well that's why the central
christian doctrine is

8370
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:04,720
christian doctrine is
 

8371
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:08,309
christian doctrine is
pick up your cross and follow me

8372
02:25:08,309 --> 02:25:08,319
pick up your cross and follow me
 

8373
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:09,750
pick up your cross and follow me
and i'm speaking

8374
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:09,760
and i'm speaking
 

8375
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:11,750
and i'm speaking
not in religious terms saying that i'm

8376
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:11,760
not in religious terms saying that i'm
 

8377
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,590
not in religious terms saying that i'm
just speaking as a psychologist it's

8378
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:13,600
just speaking as a psychologist it's
 

8379
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,349
just speaking as a psychologist it's
like one of the things we've learned in

8380

like one of the things we've learned in
 

8381
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:17,510
like one of the things we've learned in
the last hundred years is

8382

proportions is curative
 

8389
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:29,270
proportions is curative
so a form of

at least in part involuntary suffering
is depression

conversation then i could
 

8635
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:48,150
conversation then i could
discuss a bit with her

8636
02:29:48,150 --> 02:29:48,160
discuss a bit with her
 

8637
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:49,750
discuss a bit with her
and then as we progressed through the

8638
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:49,760
and then as we progressed through the
 

8639
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:51,590
and then as we progressed through the
years the amount of time that we spent

8640
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:51,600
years the amount of time that we spent
 

8641
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,389
years the amount of time that we spent
in discussion increased in proportion in

8642
02:29:54,389 --> 02:29:54,399
in discussion increased in proportion in
 

8643
02:29:54,399 --> 02:29:57,030
in discussion increased in proportion in
this sessions until by the time we

8644
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:57,040
this sessions until by the time we
 

8645
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:58,950
this sessions until by the time we
stopped seeing each other when my

8646
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:58,960
stopped seeing each other when my
 

8647
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:02,389
stopped seeing each other when my
clinical practice collapsed

8648
02:30:02,389 --> 02:30:02,399
clinical practice collapsed
 

8649
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:06,389
clinical practice collapsed
we were talking about 80 of the time but

8650
02:30:06,389 --> 02:30:06,399
we were talking about 80 of the time but
 

8651
02:30:06,399 --> 02:30:08,389
we were talking about 80 of the time but
she literally she'd never been attended

8652
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
she literally she'd never been attended
 

8653
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,630
she literally she'd never been attended
to properly ever and so she was an

8654
02:30:10,630 --> 02:30:10,640
to properly ever and so she was an
 

8655
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:13,429
to properly ever and so she was an
uncarved block in the taoist sense right

8656
02:30:13,429 --> 02:30:13,439
uncarved block in the taoist sense right
 

8657
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:15,270
uncarved block in the taoist sense right
she hadn't been subjected to those

8658
02:30:15,270 --> 02:30:15,280
she hadn't been subjected to those
 

8659
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,950
she hadn't been subjected to those
flaming swords that

8660
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:16,960
flaming swords that
 

8661
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:19,270
flaming swords that
separated the wheat from the chaff

8662
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:19,280
separated the wheat from the chaff
 

8663
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:20,710
separated the wheat from the chaff
and so

8664
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:20,720
and so
 

8665
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,630
and so
you can do that in therapy

8666
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
you can do that in therapy
 

8667
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:25,270
you can do that in therapy
if you're listening and you're depressed

8668
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:25,280
if you're listening and you're depressed
 

8669
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,270
if you're listening and you're depressed
i would say if you can't

8670
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
i would say if you can't
 

8671
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:28,870
i would say if you can't
find a therapist and that's getting

8672
02:30:28,870 --> 02:30:28,880
find a therapist and that's getting
 

8673
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,309
find a therapist and that's getting
harder and harder because it's actually

8674
02:30:30,309 --> 02:30:30,319
harder and harder because it's actually
 

8675
02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:32,070
harder and harder because it's actually
become illegal to be a therapist now

8676
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,080
become illegal to be a therapist now
 

8677
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:33,349
become illegal to be a therapist now
because you have to agree with your

8678
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:33,359
because you have to agree with your
 

8679
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:34,309
because you have to agree with your
clients

8680
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
clients
 

8681
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,070
clients
which is a terrible thing to do with

8682
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,080
which is a terrible thing to do with
 

8683
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,270
which is a terrible thing to do with
them

8684
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:37,280
them
 

8685
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,550
them
just like it's terrible just to

8686
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560
just like it's terrible just to
 

8687
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,550
just like it's terrible just to
arbitrarily oppose them

8688
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:40,560
arbitrarily oppose them
 

8689
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:42,230
arbitrarily oppose them
you could do the

8690
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,240
you could do the
 

8691
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:44,150
you could do the
self-authoring program online because it

8692
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:44,160
self-authoring program online because it
 

8693
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:46,389
self-authoring program online because it
helps you write an autobiography

8694
02:30:46,389 --> 02:30:46,399
helps you write an autobiography
 

8695
02:30:46,399 --> 02:30:48,150
helps you write an autobiography
and so if you have memories that are

8696
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:48,160
and so if you have memories that are
 

8697
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,910
and so if you have memories that are
more than 18 months old that bother you

8698
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:49,920
more than 18 months old that bother you
 

8699
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:51,429
more than 18 months old that bother you
when you think them up

8700
02:30:51,429 --> 02:30:51,439
when you think them up
 

8701
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:54,230

and failures do too by the way but
 

8815
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:50,070
and failures do too by the way but
aggregates exponentially increase so

8816
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:50,080
aggregates exponentially increase so

and so imagine now you want to be happy
 

9037
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,950
and so imagine now you want to be happy
when you open that drawer and you think

9038
02:36:36,950 --> 02:36:36,960
when you open that drawer and you think
 

9039
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:39,990
when you open that drawer and you think
well that's stupid it's like is it

the way you're gonna you're gonna open

9046
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:45,200
the way you're gonna you're gonna open
 

9047
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,429
the way you're gonna you're gonna open
that every morning

9048
02:36:47,429 --> 02:36:47,439

okay so that's
 

9055
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,389
okay so that's
three minutes a

9056
02:36:54,389 --> 02:36:54,399
three minutes a
 

9057
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:56,870
three minutes a
week that's 12 minutes a

9058
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:56,880
week that's 12 minutes a
 

9059
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:59,429
week that's 12 minutes a
month that's two hours a year

9060
02:36:59,429 --> 02:36:59,439
month that's two hours a year
 

9061
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:01,110
month that's two hours a year
so maybe your life is made out of you've

9062
02:37:01,110 --> 02:37:01,120
so maybe your life is made out of you've
 

9063
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:03,590
so maybe your life is made out of you've
got 16 hours a day let's figure this out

9064
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:03,600
got 16 hours a day let's figure this out
 

9065
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:06,750
got 16 hours a day let's figure this out
5 12 in an hour 12 in an hour

9066
02:37:06,750 --> 02:37:06,760
5 12 in an hour 12 in an hour
 

9067
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:11,110
5 12 in an hour 12 in an hour
144 in 12 hours yeah let's say 200. 205

9068
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,120
144 in 12 hours yeah let's say 200. 205
 

9069
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:12,790
144 in 12 hours yeah let's say 200. 205
minute chunks that's your life ladies

9070
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:12,800
minute chunks that's your life ladies
 

9071
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,630
minute chunks that's your life ladies
and gentlemen jordan peterson did just

9072
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
and gentlemen jordan peterson did just
 

9073
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,309
and gentlemen jordan peterson did just
some math how many five-minute chunks

9074
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
some math how many five-minute chunks
 

9075
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:18,150
some math how many five-minute chunks
there are in a day and i got pretty sure

9076
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,160
there are in a day and i got pretty sure
 

9077
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:19,349
there are in a day and i got pretty sure
that's pretty accurate it's

9078
02:37:19,349 --> 02:37:19,359
that's pretty accurate it's
 

9079
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:21,590
that's pretty accurate it's
approximately right so

9080
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:21,600
approximately right so
 

9081
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:23,990
approximately right so
you got 200 5-minute chunks and they

9082
02:37:23,990 --> 02:37:24,000
you got 200 5-minute chunks and they
 

9083
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,230
you got 200 5-minute chunks and they
repeat a lot of them repeat

9084
02:37:26,230 --> 02:37:26,240
repeat a lot of them repeat
 

9085
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,070
repeat a lot of them repeat
so if you get every one of those right

9086
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,080
so if you get every one of those right
 

9087
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:29,750
so if you get every one of those right
they're trivial right who cares what my

9088
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:29,760
they're trivial right who cares what my
 

9089
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,349
they're trivial right who cares what my
sock drawer looks like it's like fair

9090
02:37:31,349 --> 02:37:31,359
sock drawer looks like it's like fair
 

9091
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:33,110
sock drawer looks like it's like fair
enough man but that's your life the

9092
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120
enough man but that's your life the
 

9093
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:35,190
enough man but that's your life the
things you repeat every day

9094
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:35,200
things you repeat every day
 

9095
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:37,510
things you repeat every day
the mundane things think i could get all

9096
02:37:37,510 --> 02:37:37,520
the mundane things think i could get all
 

9097
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:39,190
the mundane things think i could get all
those mundane things right

9098
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:39,200
those mundane things right
 

9099
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,030
those mundane things right
that's the game rules it's like now all

9100
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,040
that's the game rules it's like now all
 

9101
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,270
that's the game rules it's like now all
the mundane is in place

9102
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:43,280
the mundane is in place
 

9103
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:44,790
the mundane is in place
now you can play because all the

9104
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:44,800
now you can play because all the
 

9105
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:46,630
now you can play because all the
mundane's in place and this is actually

9106
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
mundane's in place and this is actually
 

9107
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,710
mundane's in place and this is actually
true so with children

9108
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:48,720
true so with children
 

9109
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:50,870
true so with children
imagine you want your children to play

9110
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:50,880
imagine you want your children to play
 

9111
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:53,590
imagine you want your children to play
well play is very fragile neurologically

9112
02:37:53,590 --> 02:37:53,600
well play is very fragile neurologically
 

9113
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,750
well play is very fragile neurologically
any competing motivation or emotion will

9114
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:55,760
any competing motivation or emotion will
 

9115
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,190
any competing motivation or emotion will
suppress play

9116
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:57,200
suppress play
 

9117
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:00,150
suppress play
so everything has to be in order

9118
02:38:00,150 --> 02:38:00,160
so everything has to be in order
 

9119
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:01,910
so everything has to be in order
everything has to be a walled garden

9120
02:38:01,910 --> 02:38:01,920
everything has to be a walled garden
 

9121
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:03,910
everything has to be a walled garden
before the children will play

9122
02:38:03,910 --> 02:38:03,920
before the children will play
 

9123
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:05,750
before the children will play
that's a good way of thinking about it

9124
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:05,760
that's a good way of thinking about it
 

9125
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:07,110
that's a good way of thinking about it
so you put everything in order and you

9126
02:38:07,110 --> 02:38:07,120
so you put everything in order and you
 

9127
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:08,870
so you put everything in order and you
think oh my god now i'm tyrannized by

9128
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:08,880
think oh my god now i'm tyrannized by
 

9129
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,469
think oh my god now i'm tyrannized by
this order it's like no you aren't not

9130
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:10,479
this order it's like no you aren't not
 

9131
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:12,389
this order it's like no you aren't not
if it's voluntary

9132
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:12,399
if it's voluntary
 

9133
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:14,070
if it's voluntary
and then the order is the precondition

9134
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:14,080
and then the order is the precondition
 

9135
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:15,510
and then the order is the precondition
for the freedom

9136
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:15,520
for the freedom
 

9137
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:16,950
for the freedom
and so then all of a sudden you get all

9138
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:16,960
and so then all of a sudden you get all
 

9139
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,550
and so then all of a sudden you get all
these things in order it's like oh look

9140
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:18,560
these things in order it's like oh look
 

9141
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:20,389
these things in order it's like oh look
at this i've i've got some room to play

9142
02:38:20,389 --> 02:38:20,399
at this i've i've got some room to play
 

9143
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:21,510
at this i've i've got some room to play
here

9144
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:21,520
here
 

9145
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,630
here
and then

9146
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:22,640
and then
 

9147
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:25,110
and then
then maybe you're not depressed now it's

9148
02:38:25,110 --> 02:38:25,120
then maybe you're not depressed now it's
 

9149
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:27,270
then maybe you're not depressed now it's
it's often not that simple you know it's

9150
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,280
it's often not that simple you know it's
 

9151
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,429
it's often not that simple you know it's
not that simple try putting your room in

9152
02:38:29,429 --> 02:38:29,439
not that simple try putting your room in
 

9153
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:31,910
not that simple try putting your room in
order perfect order that's hard i mean

9154
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:31,920
order perfect order that's hard i mean
 

9155
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,110
order perfect order that's hard i mean
it's a really powerful way to think

9156
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:33,120
it's a really powerful way to think
 

9157
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:34,630
it's a really powerful way to think
about those five-minute chunks just get

9158
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:34,640
about those five-minute chunks just get
 

9159
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:36,630
about those five-minute chunks just get
one of them right in a day

9160
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
one of them right in a day
 

9161
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:39,270
one of them right in a day
yeah if you do that for 200 days

9162
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:39,280
yeah if you do that for 200 days
 

9163
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:41,750
yeah if you do that for 200 days
your life is in order yeah

you know i thought i did that with my
 

9167
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,550
you know i thought i did that with my
clients a lot so a lot of them would

9168
02:38:44,550 --> 02:38:44,560
clients a lot so a lot of them would

the harder you work on
 

9493
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:12,710
the harder you work on
offering other people what they need and

9494
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:12,720
offering other people what they need and
 

9495
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:13,990
offering other people what they need and
want

9496
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:14,000
want
 

9497
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,750
want
the more people will line up to play

9498
02:44:15,750 --> 02:44:15,760
the more people will line up to play
 

9499
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,790
the more people will line up to play
with you

9500
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:16,800
with you
 

9501
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:18,710
with you
so it's the wrong question it's like how

9502
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:18,720
so it's the wrong question it's like how
 

9503
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:21,269
so it's the wrong question it's like how
can i be the best partner possible

9504
02:44:21,269 --> 02:44:21,279
can i be the best partner possible
 

9505
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:22,630
can i be the best partner possible
and then you think well if i do that

9506
02:44:22,630 --> 02:44:22,640
and then you think well if i do that
 

9507
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:25,190
and then you think well if i do that
people will just take advantage of me

9508
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:25,200
people will just take advantage of me
 

9509
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:27,590
people will just take advantage of me
and that's the non-naive

9510
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:27,600
and that's the non-naive
 

9511
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,790
and that's the non-naive
objection

9512
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:28,800
objection
 

9513
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,150
objection
right because the naive person's think

9514
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:30,160
right because the naive person's think
 

9515
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,190
right because the naive person's think
well i'll be good and everyone will

9516
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,200
well i'll be good and everyone will
 

9517
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:32,790
well i'll be good and everyone will
treat me right it's like

9518
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:32,800
treat me right it's like
 

9519
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:34,950
treat me right it's like
the cynic says no i'll be good and

9520
02:44:34,950 --> 02:44:34,960
the cynic says no i'll be good and
 

9521
02:44:34,960 --> 02:44:36,630
the cynic says no i'll be good and
someone will

9522
02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:36,640
someone will
 

9523
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:38,630
someone will
take me out

9524
02:44:38,630 --> 02:44:38,640
take me out
 

9525
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:40,469
take me out
and then you think well what

9526
02:44:40,469 --> 02:44:40,479
and then you think well what
 

9527
02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:42,150
and then you think well what
do you do about that objection and the

9528
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:42,160
do you do about that objection and the
 

9529
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,750
do you do about that objection and the
answer is well

9530
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:43,760
answer is well
 

9531
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:45,590
answer is well
you factor that in

9532
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:45,600
you factor that in
 

9533
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,349
you factor that in
that's why you're supposed to be

9534
02:44:47,349 --> 02:44:47,359
that's why you're supposed to be
 

9535
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:48,630
that's why you're supposed to be
what is it

9536
02:44:48,630 --> 02:44:48,640
what is it
 

9537
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:50,469
what is it
as soft as a dove and as wise as a

9538
02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:50,479
as soft as a dove and as wise as a
 

9539
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:52,790
as soft as a dove and as wise as a
serpent it's like i know you're full of

9540
02:44:52,790 --> 02:44:52,800
serpent it's like i know you're full of
 

9541
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,150
serpent it's like i know you're full of
snakes

9542
02:44:54,150 --> 02:44:54,160
snakes
 

9543
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:55,590
snakes
i know it

9544
02:44:55,590 --> 02:44:55,600
i know it
 

9545
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:58,389
i know it
maybe i know it more than you do

9546
02:44:58,389 --> 02:44:58,399
maybe i know it more than you do
 

9547
02:44:58,399 --> 02:45:00,550
maybe i know it more than you do
but we'll play anyways

9548
02:45:00,550 --> 02:45:00,560
but we'll play anyways
 

9549
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:02,230
but we'll play anyways
and that's the risk

9550
02:45:02,230 --> 02:45:02,240
and that's the risk
 

9551
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:05,110
and that's the risk
that's right voluntarily right it's like

9552
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:05,120
that's right voluntarily right it's like
 

9553
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:06,790
that's right voluntarily right it's like
and that what's so cool about that is

9554
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:06,800
and that what's so cool about that is
 

9555
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:08,309
and that what's so cool about that is
that even though the person you're

but that's because he was a
writer of fiction nietzsche is almost

10134
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:16,240
writer of fiction nietzsche is almost
 

10135
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:18,309
writer of fiction nietzsche is almost
the character in a dusty yes he is

10136
02:55:18,309 --> 02:55:18,319
the character in a dusty yes he is
 

10137
02:55:18,319 --> 02:55:20,710
the character in a dusty yes he is
definitely that he is definitely that

10138
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:20,720
definitely that he is definitely that
 

10139
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:22,230
definitely that he is definitely that
yes

10140
02:55:22,230 --> 02:55:22,240
yes
 

10141
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:23,990
yes
and apparently nietzsche knew more about

10142
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:24,000
and apparently nietzsche knew more about
 

10143
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,590
and apparently nietzsche knew more about
dostoevsky than people had thought

10144
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:25,600
dostoevsky than people had thought
 

10145
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,110
dostoevsky than people had thought
there's been some recent scholarship on

10146
02:55:27,110 --> 02:55:27,120
there's been some recent scholarship on
 

10147
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:28,790
there's been some recent scholarship on
that grounds dostoevsky didn't know

10148
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:28,800
that grounds dostoevsky didn't know
 

10149
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:30,230
that grounds dostoevsky didn't know
anything about nietzsche as far as i

10150
02:55:30,230 --> 02:55:30,240
anything about nietzsche as far as i
 

10151
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:33,110
anything about nietzsche as far as i
know i could be wrong about that but

10152
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:33,120
know i could be wrong about that but
 

10153
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:34,790
know i could be wrong about that but
the thing that dostoevsky had over

10154
02:55:34,790 --> 02:55:34,800
the thing that dostoevsky had over
 

10155
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:36,150
the thing that dostoevsky had over
nietzsche is nietzsche had to make

10156
02:55:36,150 --> 02:55:36,160
nietzsche is nietzsche had to make
 

10157
02:55:36,160 --> 02:55:38,309
nietzsche is nietzsche had to make
things propositional in some real sense

10158
02:55:38,309 --> 02:55:38,319
things propositional in some real sense
 

10159
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:40,230
things propositional in some real sense
because he was a philosopher and

10160
02:55:40,230 --> 02:55:40,240
because he was a philosopher and
 

10161
02:55:40,240 --> 02:55:42,230
because he was a philosopher and
it's hard to propositionalize things

10162
02:55:42,230 --> 02:55:42,240
it's hard to propositionalize things
 

10163
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:44,870
it's hard to propositionalize things
that are outside your ken but you can

10164
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:44,880
that are outside your ken but you can
 

10165
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:47,670
that are outside your ken but you can
characterize them and so

10166
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:47,680
characterize them and so
 

10167
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:51,349
characterize them and so
in the brothers karamazov ivan is a more

10168
02:55:51,349 --> 02:55:51,359
in the brothers karamazov ivan is a more
 

10169
02:55:51,359 --> 02:55:54,070
in the brothers karamazov ivan is a more
developed character than eliotia

10170
02:55:54,070 --> 02:55:54,080
developed character than eliotia
 

10171
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:56,550
developed character than eliotia
in in in the explicit sense he can make

10172
02:55:56,550 --> 02:55:56,560
in in in the explicit sense he can make
 

10173
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:59,269
in in in the explicit sense he can make
better arguments but elosha

10174
02:55:59,269 --> 02:55:59,279
better arguments but elosha
 

10175
02:55:59,279 --> 02:56:01,670
better arguments but elosha
wins like michigan because he's the

10176
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:01,680
wins like michigan because he's the
 

10177
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:04,389
wins like michigan because he's the
better man and dostoevsky can show that

10178
02:56:04,389 --> 02:56:04,399
better man and dostoevsky can show that
 

10179
02:56:04,399 --> 02:56:06,710
better man and dostoevsky can show that
in the actions rather

10180
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:06,720
in the actions rather
 

10181
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:07,990
in the actions rather
he can't render it entirely

10182
02:56:07,990 --> 02:56:08,000
he can't render it entirely
 

10183
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,349
he can't render it entirely
propositional but that's probably

10184
02:56:09,349 --> 02:56:09,359
propositional but that's probably
 

10185
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:10,870
propositional but that's probably
because what's good can't be rendered

10186
02:56:10,870 --> 02:56:10,880
because what's good can't be rendered
 

10187
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:12,469
because what's good can't be rendered
entirely propositional

10188
02:56:12,469 --> 02:56:12,479
entirely propositional
 

10189
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:14,309
entirely propositional
and so dostoevsky had that edge over

10190
02:56:14,309 --> 02:56:14,319
and so dostoevsky had that edge over
 

10191
02:56:14,319 --> 02:56:16,150
and so dostoevsky had that edge over
nietzsche said well ivan is this

10192
02:56:16,150 --> 02:56:16,160
nietzsche said well ivan is this
 

10193
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:18,469
nietzsche said well ivan is this
brilliant rationalist atheist

10194
02:56:18,469 --> 02:56:18,479
brilliant rationalist atheist
 

10195
02:56:18,479 --> 02:56:21,349

02:56:21,349 --> 02:56:21,359
materialist and puts forward an argument
 

10197
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:23,269
materialist and puts forward an argument
on that front that's still unparalleled

10198
02:56:23,269 --> 02:56:23,279
on that front that's still unparalleled
 

10199
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:24,950
on that front that's still unparalleled
as far as i'm concerned

10200
02:56:24,950 --> 02:56:24,960
as far as i'm concerned
 

10201
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:27,910
as far as i'm concerned
and overwhelms eliot who cannot respond

10202
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:27,920
and overwhelms eliot who cannot respond
 

10203
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:30,790
and overwhelms eliot who cannot respond
but eliot is still the better man

10204
02:56:30,790 --> 02:56:30,800
but eliot is still the better man
 

10205
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:32,469
but eliot is still the better man
so which is very interesting you know

02:56:32,469 --> 02:56:32,479
so which is very interesting you know
 

10207

so which is very interesting you know
that what

yes
 

10239
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:06,309
yes
well it's it's you know one of the

well it's it's you know one of the

things i did learn perhaps from looking

10242
02:57:09,269 --> 02:57:09,279
things i did learn perhaps from looking
 

10243
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:12,150
things i did learn perhaps from looking
into the abyss to the degree that i have

10244
02:57:12,150 --> 02:57:12,160
into the abyss to the degree that i have
 

10245
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:13,349
into the abyss to the degree that i have
had to

10246

had to
 

10247

had to
or was willing to

10248
02:57:15,910 --> 02:57:15,920
or was willing to
 

10249
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,830
or was willing to
was that at some level you have to make

10250
02:57:17,830 --> 02:57:17,840
was that at some level you have to make
 

10251
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:20,389
was that at some level you have to make
a fundamental statement of faith

10252
02:57:20,389 --> 02:57:20,399
a fundamental statement of faith
 

10253
02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:22,710
a fundamental statement of faith
when god creates the world after each

10254
02:57:22,710 --> 02:57:22,720
when god creates the world after each
 

10255
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:23,990
when god creates the world after each
day he says

10256
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:24,000
day he says
 

10257
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,389
day he says
he saw that it was good

10258
02:57:26,389 --> 02:57:26,399
he saw that it was good
 

10259
02:57:26,399 --> 02:57:28,630
he saw that it was good
you think well is it good it's like well

10260
02:57:28,630 --> 02:57:28,640
you think well is it good it's like well
 

10261
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:30,710
you think well is it good it's like well
there's a tough question you know do you

10262
02:57:30,710 --> 02:57:30,720
there's a tough question you know do you
 

10263
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:32,630
there's a tough question you know do you
want to bring a child into a world such

10264
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:32,640
want to bring a child into a world such
 

10265
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:34,870
want to bring a child into a world such
as this which is a fundamental question

10266
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:34,880
as this which is a fundamental question
 

10267
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:37,910
as this which is a fundamental question
of whether or not it's good

10268
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:37,920

 

10269
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,510

it's an act of faith to declare that

10270
02:57:39,510 --> 02:57:39,520
it's an act of faith to declare that
 

10271
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:41,110
it's an act of faith to declare that
it's good

10272
02:57:41,110 --> 02:57:41,120
it's good
 

10273
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:44,469
it's good
because the evidence is ambivalent

10274
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:44,479
because the evidence is ambivalent
 

10275
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:47,750
because the evidence is ambivalent
and so then you think okay well

10276
02:57:47,750 --> 02:57:47,760
and so then you think okay well
 

10277
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:50,950
and so then you think okay well
am i going to act as if it's good

10278
02:57:50,950 --> 02:57:50,960
am i going to act as if it's good
 

10279
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:53,190
am i going to act as if it's good
and what would happen if i did

10280
02:57:53,190 --> 02:57:53,200
and what would happen if i did
 

10281
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,429
and what would happen if i did
and maybe the answer to that is

10282
02:57:55,429 --> 02:57:55,439
and maybe the answer to that is
 

10283
02:57:55,439 --> 02:58:03,429
and maybe the answer to that is
i think this is the answer

10284
02:58:03,429 --> 02:58:03,439

 

10285
02:58:03,439 --> 02:58:05,429

the more you act

10286
02:58:05,429 --> 02:58:05,439
the more you act
 

10287
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:08,150
the more you act
out the proposition that it's good

10288
02:58:08,150 --> 02:58:08,160
out the proposition that it's good
 

10289
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:10,950
out the proposition that it's good
the better it gets

10290
