00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
not even fundamental theories just
 

497
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,909
not even fundamental theories just
emergent phenomena and everything like

498
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
emergent phenomena and everything like
 

499
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,629
emergent phenomena and everything like
that

500
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
that
 

501
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,510
that
so to answer your actual question like

502
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
so to answer your actual question like
 

503
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,270
so to answer your actual question like
what what i like about uh

504
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
what what i like about uh
 

505
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,950
what what i like about uh
his way of going at things is this

506
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
his way of going at things is this
 

507
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,390
his way of going at things is this
constant desire to

508
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
constant desire to
 

509
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,550
constant desire to
reinvent it for himself like when he

510
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
reinvent it for himself like when he
 

511
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,990
reinvent it for himself like when he
would consume papers the way he

512
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
would consume papers the way he
 

513
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,670
would consume papers the way he
described it he would start to see what

514
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
described it he would start to see what
 

515
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,950
described it he would start to see what
problem he was trying to solve and then

516
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
problem he was trying to solve and then
 

517
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,309
problem he was trying to solve and then
just try to solve it himself to get a

518
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
just try to solve it himself to get a
 

519
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,830
just try to solve it himself to get a
sense of personal ownership

520
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
sense of personal ownership
 

521
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,430
sense of personal ownership
and then from there see what others had

522
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
and then from there see what others had
 

523
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,670
and then from there see what others had
done is that how you see problems

524
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
done is that how you see problems
 

525
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,309
done is that how you see problems
yourself like

526
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
yourself like
 

527
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,230
yourself like
that's actually an interesting point

528
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
that's actually an interesting point
 

529
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,469
that's actually an interesting point
when you first

530
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
when you first
 

531
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,710
when you first
are inspired by a certain idea that you

532
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
are inspired by a certain idea that you
 

533
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,990
are inspired by a certain idea that you
maybe want to teach or

534
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
maybe want to teach or
 

535
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,950
maybe want to teach or
visualize or just explore on your own

536
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
visualize or just explore on your own
 

537
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,390
visualize or just explore on your own
i'm sure you're captured by some

538
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
i'm sure you're captured by some
 

539
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,309
i'm sure you're captured by some
possibility and magic of it

540
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
possibility and magic of it
 

541
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,710
possibility and magic of it
do you read the work of others like do

542
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
do you read the work of others like do
 

543
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,550
do you read the work of others like do
you go through the proof see do you try

544
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
you go through the proof see do you try
 

545
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,510
you go through the proof see do you try
to rediscover

546
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
to rediscover
 

547
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,990
to rediscover
everything yourself so um i think the

548
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
everything yourself so um i think the
 

549
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,710
everything yourself so um i think the
things that i've

550
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
things that i've
 

551
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,230
things that i've
like learned best and have the deepest

552
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
like learned best and have the deepest
 

553
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,830
like learned best and have the deepest
ownership of are the ones that have some

554
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
ownership of are the ones that have some
 

555
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,029
ownership of are the ones that have some
element of rediscovery

556
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
element of rediscovery
 

557
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,550
element of rediscovery
the problem is that really slows you

558
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
the problem is that really slows you
 

559
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,550
the problem is that really slows you
down and this is for my for my part it's

560
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
down and this is for my for my part it's
 

561
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,070
down and this is for my for my part it's
actually a big fault like this is part

562
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
actually a big fault like this is part
 

563
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,029
actually a big fault like this is part
of why i'm

564
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
of why i'm
 

565
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,550
of why i'm
i'm not an active researcher i'm not

566
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
i'm not an active researcher i'm not
 

567
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,150
i'm not an active researcher i'm not
like at the depth of the field a lot of

568
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
like at the depth of the field a lot of
 

569
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,189
like at the depth of the field a lot of
other people are

570
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
other people are
 

571
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,630
other people are
the stuff that i do learn i try to learn

572
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
the stuff that i do learn i try to learn
 

573
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,630
the stuff that i do learn i try to learn
it really well um

574
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
it really well um
 

575
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,310
it really well um
but other times you do need to get

576
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
but other times you do need to get
 

577
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,750
but other times you do need to get
through it at a certain pace you do need

578
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
through it at a certain pace you do need
 

579
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,029
through it at a certain pace you do need
to get to a point of a problem you're

580
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
to get to a point of a problem you're
 

581
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,550
to get to a point of a problem you're
trying to solve so obviously you need to

582
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
trying to solve so obviously you need to
 

583
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,230
trying to solve so obviously you need to
be well equipped to read things

584
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
be well equipped to read things

uh without that reinvention component

586
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
uh without that reinvention component
 

587
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,750
uh without that reinvention component
and see how others have done it

588
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
and see how others have done it
 

589
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,110
and see how others have done it
but i think if you choose a few core

590
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
but i think if you choose a few core
 

591
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,550
but i think if you choose a few core
building blocks along the way and you

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
building blocks along the way and you
 

593
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,389
building blocks along the way and you
say i'm really going to try to

for example you're going to be trying to
 

613
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,670
for example you're going to be trying to
come up with counter examples

you're going to try to come up with um

like the rest of physics was running
away from him um but in so far he's got

i are you familiar with like the
 

715
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,430
i are you familiar with like the

dynamic i think this was um either the

718
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
dynamic i think this was um either the
 

719
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,069
dynamic i think this was um either the
ancient greeks came up with it or

720
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
ancient greeks came up with it or
 

721
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,630
ancient greeks came up with it or
it was pretended to be something drawn

722
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
it was pretended to be something drawn
 

723
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,750
it was pretended to be something drawn
from the ancient creek said i don't know

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
from the ancient creek said i don't know
 

725
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,470
from the ancient creek said i don't know
who to

who to
 

727
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,750
who to
point it to but they had probably mocked

728
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
point it to but they had probably mocked
 

729
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,389
point it to but they had probably mocked
twain it is that you've got two

730
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
twain it is that you've got two
 

731
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,910
twain it is that you've got two
types of people or especially two types

732
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
types of people or especially two types
 

733
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,670
types of people or especially two types
of researchers there's

734
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
of researchers there's
 

735
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,829
of researchers there's
the fox that knows many different things

736
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
the fox that knows many different things
 

737
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,110
the fox that knows many different things
and then the hedgehog that knows one

738
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
and then the hedgehog that knows one
 

739
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,550
and then the hedgehog that knows one
thing very deeply

740
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
thing very deeply
 

741
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,389
thing very deeply
so like von neumann would have been a

742
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
so like von neumann would have been a
 

743
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,590
so like von neumann would have been a
fox he's someone who knows many

744
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
fox he's someone who knows many
 

745
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,630
fox he's someone who knows many
different things just

746
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
different things just
 

747
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,990
different things just
very foundational a lot of different

748
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
very foundational a lot of different
 

749
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,150
very foundational a lot of different
fields einstein would have been more of

750
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
fields einstein would have been more of
 

751
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,509
fields einstein would have been more of
a hedgehog thinking really deeply about

752
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
a hedgehog thinking really deeply about
 

753
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,030
a hedgehog thinking really deeply about
one particular thing

754
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
one particular thing
 

755
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,550
one particular thing
and both are very necessary for making

756
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
and both are very necessary for making
 

757
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,069
and both are very necessary for making
progress um

758
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
progress um
 

759
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,590
progress um
so between those two i would definitely

760
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
so between those two i would definitely
 

761
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,350
so between those two i would definitely
see myself as like the fox

762
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
see myself as like the fox
 

763
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,509
see myself as like the fox
where uh i'll try to get my paws in like

764
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
where uh i'll try to get my paws in like
 

765
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,870
where uh i'll try to get my paws in like
a whole bunch of different things

766
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
a whole bunch of different things
 

767
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,550
a whole bunch of different things
and at the moment i just think i don't

768
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
and at the moment i just think i don't
 

769
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,150
and at the moment i just think i don't
know enough of anything to make like a

770
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
know enough of anything to make like a
 

771
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,829
know enough of anything to make like a
significant contribution to any of them

772
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
significant contribution to any of them
 

773
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,430
significant contribution to any of them
but i do see value in um like having a

774
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
but i do see value in um like having a
 

775
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,069
but i do see value in um like having a
decently

776
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
decently

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
things like
 

781
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,069
things like
most people who uh know computer science

782
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
most people who uh know computer science
 

783

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
fields in math even let's say you have
 

793
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,710
fields in math even let's say you have
like an analytic number theory versus an

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
like an analytic number theory versus an
 

795
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,069
like an analytic number theory versus an

algebraic number theory like these two
 

797
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:50,949
algebraic number theory like these two
things end up being

798
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
things end up being
 

799
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,389
things end up being
related to very different fields like

800
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
related to very different fields like
 

801
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,310
related to very different fields like
some of them more complex analysis some

802
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
some of them more complex analysis some
 

803
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,990
some of them more complex analysis some
of them more like algebraic geometry

and then when you just go out so far as
 

807
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,750
and then when you just go out so far as
to take those adjacent fields place one

they're as lost as you or i would be but
i think uh going around and like trying

824
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
i think uh going around and like trying
 

825
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,509
i think uh going around and like trying
to have some sense of

826
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
to have some sense of
 

827
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,509
to have some sense of
what this big picture is certainly has

828
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
what this big picture is certainly has
 

829
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,949
what this big picture is certainly has
personal value for me i don't know if i

830
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
personal value for me i don't know if i
 

831
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,310
personal value for me i don't know if i
would ever make like

832
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
would ever make like
 

833
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,550
would ever make like
new contributions in those fields but i

834
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
new contributions in those fields but i
 

835
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,910
new contributions in those fields but i
do think i could make new like

836
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
do think i could make new like
 

837
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,150
do think i could make new like
expositional contributions where there's

838
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
expositional contributions where there's
 

839
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,829
expositional contributions where there's
kind of a notion of

840
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
kind of a notion of
 

841
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,670
kind of a notion of
uh things that are known but like

842
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
uh things that are known but like
 

843
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,910
uh things that are known but like
haven't been explained very well

844
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
haven't been explained very well
 

845
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,670
haven't been explained very well
well first of all i think most people

846
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
well first of all i think most people
 

847
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,030
well first of all i think most people
would agree your videos

848
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
would agree your videos
 

849
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,670
would agree your videos
your teaching the way you see the world

850
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
your teaching the way you see the world
 

851
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,230
your teaching the way you see the world
is fundamentally often new

852
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
is fundamentally often new
 

853
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,829
is fundamentally often new
like you're creating something new and

854
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
like you're creating something new and
 

855
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,750
like you're creating something new and
it almost feels like research even just

856
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
it almost feels like research even just
 

857
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,829
it almost feels like research even just
like the visualizations

858
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
like the visualizations
 

859
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,829
like the visualizations
uh the multi-dimensional visualization

860
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
uh the multi-dimensional visualization
 

861
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,269
uh the multi-dimensional visualization
we'll talk about i mean you're revealing

862
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
we'll talk about i mean you're revealing
 

863
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,269
we'll talk about i mean you're revealing
something very interesting

864
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
something very interesting
 

865
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,550
something very interesting
that uh yeah just feels like research

866
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
that uh yeah just feels like research
 

867
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,670
that uh yeah just feels like research
feels like science

868
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
feels like science
 

869
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,389
feels like science
feels like the cutting edge of the very

870
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
feels like the cutting edge of the very
 

871
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,590
feels like the cutting edge of the very
thing

872
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
thing
 

873
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,509
thing
of which like new ideas and new

874
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
of which like new ideas and new
 

875
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,030
of which like new ideas and new
discoveries are made of

876
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
discoveries are made of
 

877
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,389
discoveries are made of
i do think you're being a little bit

878
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
i do think you're being a little bit
 

879
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,629
i do think you're being a little bit
more generous than is necessarily

880
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
more generous than is necessarily
 

881
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,310
more generous than is necessarily
and i promise that's not even false

882
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
and i promise that's not even false
 

883
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,550
and i promise that's not even false
humility because i sometimes think when

884
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
humility because i sometimes think when
 

885
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,150
humility because i sometimes think when
i research a video i'll learn like 10

886
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
i research a video i'll learn like 10
 

887
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,509
i research a video i'll learn like 10
times as much as i need for the video

888
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
times as much as i need for the video
 

889
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,949
times as much as i need for the video
itself and it ends up feeling

890
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
itself and it ends up feeling
 

891
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,269
itself and it ends up feeling
kind of elementary um so i have a sense

892
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
kind of elementary um so i have a sense
 

893
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,470
kind of elementary um so i have a sense
of just how far away

894
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
of just how far away
 

895
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,629
of just how far away
like the stuff that i cover is from the

896
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
like the stuff that i cover is from the
 

897
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,389
like the stuff that i cover is from the
actual depth

898
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
actual depth
 

899
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,590
actual depth
i think that's natural but i think that

900
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
i think that's natural but i think that
 

901
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,230
i think that's natural but i think that
could also be a mathematics thing

902
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
could also be a mathematics thing
 

903
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,670
could also be a mathematics thing
i feel like in the machine learning

904
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
i feel like in the machine learning
 

905
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,069
i feel like in the machine learning
world you like two weeks in you feel

906
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
world you like two weeks in you feel
 

907
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,870
world you like two weeks in you feel
like you've

908
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
like you've
 

909
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,069
like you've
basically mastered in mathematics it's

910
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
basically mastered in mathematics it's
 

911
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,470
basically mastered in mathematics it's
like

912
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
like
 

913
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,389
like
well everything is either trivial or

914
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
well everything is either trivial or
 

915
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,389
well everything is either trivial or
impossible and it's like a shockingly

916
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
impossible and it's like a shockingly
 

917
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,910
impossible and it's like a shockingly
thin line between the two

918
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
thin line between the two
 

919
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,189
thin line between the two
where you can find something that's

920
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
where you can find something that's
 

921
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,629
where you can find something that's
totally impenetrable and then after you

922
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
totally impenetrable and then after you
 

923
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,990
totally impenetrable and then after you
get a feel for it's like oh yeah that

924
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
get a feel for it's like oh yeah that
 

925
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,550
get a feel for it's like oh yeah that
whole

926
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
whole
 

927
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,110
whole
that whole subject is actually trivial

928
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
that whole subject is actually trivial
 

929
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,990
that whole subject is actually trivial
in some way

930
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
in some way
 

931
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,310
in some way
so maybe that's what goes on every

932
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
so maybe that's what goes on every
 

933
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,829
so maybe that's what goes on every
researcher is just on the other end of

934
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
researcher is just on the other end of
 

935
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,189
researcher is just on the other end of
that hump and it feels like it's so far

936
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
that hump and it feels like it's so far
 

937
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,389
that hump and it feels like it's so far
away but one step

938
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
away but one step
 

939
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,150
away but one step
actually gets them there what do you

940
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
actually gets them there what do you
 

941
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,750
actually gets them there what do you
think about

942
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
think about
 

943
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,990
think about
sort of feynman's teaching style or

944
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
sort of feynman's teaching style or
 

945
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,150
sort of feynman's teaching style or
another perspective is

946
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
another perspective is
 

947
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,430
another perspective is
of use of uh visualization

948
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
of use of uh visualization
 

949
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,350
of use of uh visualization
well his teaching style is interesting

950
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
well his teaching style is interesting
 

951
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,870
well his teaching style is interesting
because people have described like the

952
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
because people have described like the
 

953
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,550
because people have described like the
feynman effect where while you're

954
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
feynman effect where while you're
 

955
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,430
feynman effect where while you're
watching

956
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
watching
 

957
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,790
watching
his lectures or while he's reading his

958
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
his lectures or while he's reading his
 

959
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,550
his lectures or while he's reading his
lectures everything makes such perfect

960
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
lectures everything makes such perfect
 

961
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,269
lectures everything makes such perfect
sense

962
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
sense
 

963
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,470
sense
so as an entertainment session it's

964
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
so as an entertainment session it's
 

965
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,110
so as an entertainment session it's
wonderful

966
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
wonderful
 

967
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,350
wonderful
because it gives you this this

968
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
because it gives you this this
 

969
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,110
because it gives you this this
intellectual satisfaction

970
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
intellectual satisfaction
 

971
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,389
intellectual satisfaction
that you don't get from anywhere else

972
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
that you don't get from anywhere else
 

973
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,150
that you don't get from anywhere else
that you like finally understand it

974
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
that you like finally understand it
 

975
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,550
that you like finally understand it
but the feynman effect is that you can't

976
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
but the feynman effect is that you can't
 

977
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,910
but the feynman effect is that you can't
really recall what it is that gave you

978
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
really recall what it is that gave you
 

979
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,870
really recall what it is that gave you
that insight

980
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
that insight
 

981
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,110
that insight
you know even a week later and this is

982
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
you know even a week later and this is
 

983
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,790
you know even a week later and this is
um this is true of a lot of books in a

984
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
um this is true of a lot of books in a
 

985
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,990
um this is true of a lot of books in a
lot of lectures where

986
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
lot of lectures where
 

987
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,350
lot of lectures where
the retention is never quite what we

988
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
the retention is never quite what we
 

989
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,189
the retention is never quite what we
hope it is um

990
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
hope it is um
 

991
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,550
hope it is um
so there is a risk

992
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
so there is a risk
 

993
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,350
so there is a risk
that uh the stuff that i do also fits

994
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
that uh the stuff that i do also fits
 

995
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,310
that uh the stuff that i do also fits
that same bill

996
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
that same bill
 

997
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,750
that same bill
where at best it's giving this kind of

998
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
where at best it's giving this kind of
 

999
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,750
where at best it's giving this kind of
intellectual candy on giving a glimpse

1000
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
intellectual candy on giving a glimpse
 

1001

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
of feeling like you understand something
 

1003
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,829
of feeling like you understand something
but unless you do something active like

1004
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
but unless you do something active like
 

1005
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,350
but unless you do something active like

reinventing it yourself like doing

we'll talk about it a little bit i think

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
we'll talk about it a little bit i think
 

1043
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,269
we'll talk about it a little bit i think
well you've done some

1044
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
well you've done some
 

1045
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,749
well you've done some
interactive stuff i mean even in your

the awesome thing that feynman couldn't

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
the awesome thing that feynman couldn't
 

1051
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,710
the awesome thing that feynman couldn't
do at the time is

1052
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
do at the time is
 

1053
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,990
do at the time is
you could since it's programmed you can

1054
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
you could since it's programmed you can
 

1055
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,389
you could since it's programmed you can
like

1056
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
like
 

1057
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,949
like
tinker like play with stuff you could

1058
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
tinker like play with stuff you could
 

1059
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,550
tinker like play with stuff you could
take this value and change it

1060
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
take this value and change it
 

1061
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,949
take this value and change it
you can like here let's take the value

1062
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
you can like here let's take the value
 

1063
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,389
you can like here let's take the value
of this variable and change it

1064
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
of this variable and change it
 

1065
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,389
of this variable and change it
to build up an intuition to move along a

1066
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
to build up an intuition to move along a
 

1067
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,749
to build up an intuition to move along a
surface or to

1068
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
surface or to
 

1069
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,310
surface or to
to change the shape of something i think

1070
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
to change the shape of something i think
 

1071
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,910
to change the shape of something i think
that's almost

1072
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
that's almost
 

1073
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,949
that's almost
an equivalent of you doing it yourself

1074
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
an equivalent of you doing it yourself
 

1075
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,230
an equivalent of you doing it yourself
it's not quite there but

1076
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
it's not quite there but
 

1077
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,350
it's not quite there but
you as a viewer um yeah do you think

1078
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
you as a viewer um yeah do you think
 

1079
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,550
you as a viewer um yeah do you think
there's some value in that

1080
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
there's some value in that
 

1081
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,350
there's some value in that
interactive element yeah well so what's

1082
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
interactive element yeah well so what's
 

1083
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,069
interactive element yeah well so what's
interesting is

1084
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
interesting is
 

1085
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,430
interesting is
you're saying that and the videos are

1086
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
you're saying that and the videos are
 

1087
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,710
you're saying that and the videos are
non-interactive in the sense that

1088
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
non-interactive in the sense that
 

1089
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,310
non-interactive in the sense that
there's a play button and a pause button

1090
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
there's a play button and a pause button
 

1091
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,150
there's a play button and a pause button
um and you could ask like hey while

1092
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
um and you could ask like hey while
 

1093
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,350
um and you could ask like hey while
you're programming these things why

1094
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
you're programming these things why
 

1095
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,389
you're programming these things why
don't you program it into an

1096
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
don't you program it into an
 

1097
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,230
don't you program it into an
interactable version that you know

1098
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
interactable version that you know
 

1099
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,509
interactable version that you know
make it a jupyter notebook that people

1100
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
make it a jupyter notebook that people
 

1101
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,430
make it a jupyter notebook that people
can play with which i should do and that

1102
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
can play with which i should do and that
 

1103
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,710
can play with which i should do and that
like would be better

1104
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
like would be better
 

1105
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,910
like would be better
i think the thing about interactives

1106
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
i think the thing about interactives
 

1107
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,030
i think the thing about interactives
though is most people consuming them

1108
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
though is most people consuming them
 

1109
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,550
though is most people consuming them
just sort of consume what the author had

1110
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
just sort of consume what the author had
 

1111
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,150
just sort of consume what the author had
in mind uh

1112
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
in mind uh
 

1113
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,550
in mind uh
and that's kind of what they want like i

1114
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
and that's kind of what they want like i
 

1115
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,670
and that's kind of what they want like i
have a ton of friends who make

1116
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
have a ton of friends who make
 

1117
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,110
have a ton of friends who make
interactive explanations

1118
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
interactive explanations
 

1119
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,269
interactive explanations
and when you look into the analytics of

1120
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
and when you look into the analytics of
 

1121
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,150
and when you look into the analytics of
how people

1122
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
how people
 

1123
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,749
how people
use them there's a small sliver that

1124
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
use them there's a small sliver that
 

1125
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,509
use them there's a small sliver that
genuinely use it as a playground to have

1126
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
genuinely use it as a playground to have
 

1127
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,150
genuinely use it as a playground to have
experiments

1128
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
experiments
 

1129
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,509
experiments
and maybe that small sliver is actually

1130
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
and maybe that small sliver is actually
 

1131
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,790
and maybe that small sliver is actually
who you're targeting and the rest don't

1132
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
who you're targeting and the rest don't
 

1133
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,749
who you're targeting and the rest don't
matter

1134
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
matter
 

1135
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,269
matter
but most people consume it just as a

1136
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
but most people consume it just as a
 

1137
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,590
but most people consume it just as a
piece of um like well-constructed

1138
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
piece of um like well-constructed
 

1139
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,389
piece of um like well-constructed
literature

1140
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
literature
 

1141
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,069
literature
that maybe you tweak with the example a

1142
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
that maybe you tweak with the example a
 

1143
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,749
that maybe you tweak with the example a
little bit to see what it's getting at

1144
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
little bit to see what it's getting at
 

1145
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,670
little bit to see what it's getting at
but in that way i do think like a video

1146
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
but in that way i do think like a video
 

1147
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,829
but in that way i do think like a video
can get most of the benefits of the

1148
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,550
can get most of the benefits of the
interactive

1150
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
interactive
 

1151
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,269
interactive
like the interactive um app as long as

1152
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
like the interactive um app as long as
 

1153
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,629
like the interactive um app as long as
you make the interactive for yourself

1154
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
you make the interactive for yourself
 

1155
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,990
you make the interactive for yourself
and you decide what the best narrative

1156
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
and you decide what the best narrative
 

1157
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,550
and you decide what the best narrative
to spin

1158
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
to spin
 

1159
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,669
to spin
is as a more concrete example like my

1160
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
is as a more concrete example like my
 

1161
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,470
is as a more concrete example like my
process with

1162
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
process with
 

1163
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,630
process with
i made this video about um sir models

1164
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
i made this video about um sir models
 

1165
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,669
i made this video about um sir models
for epidemics

1166
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
for epidemics
 

1167
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,669
for epidemics
and it's like this agent-based bottling

1168
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
and it's like this agent-based bottling
 

1169
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,949
and it's like this agent-based bottling
thing where you

1170
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
thing where you
 

1171
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,470
thing where you
tweak some things about how the epidemic

1172
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
tweak some things about how the epidemic
 

1173
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,669
tweak some things about how the epidemic
spreads and you want to see how that

1174
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
spreads and you want to see how that
 

1175
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,150
spreads and you want to see how that
affects

1176
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
affects
 

1177
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,750
affects
its evolution um my my uh format for

1178
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
its evolution um my my uh format for
 

1179
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,949
its evolution um my my uh format for
making that was very different than

1180
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
making that was very different than
 

1181
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,150
making that was very different than
others where rather than scripting it

1182
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
others where rather than scripting it
 

1183
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,029
others where rather than scripting it
ahead of time

1184
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
ahead of time
 

1185
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,110
ahead of time
i just made the playground and then i

1186
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
i just made the playground and then i
 

1187
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,309
i just made the playground and then i
played a bunch

1188
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
played a bunch
 

1189
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,990
played a bunch
uh and then i saw what stories there

1190
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
uh and then i saw what stories there
 

1191
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,510
uh and then i saw what stories there
were to tell within that

1192
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
were to tell within that
 

1193
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,669
were to tell within that
um yeah that's cool so your video had

1194
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
um yeah that's cool so your video had
 

1195
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,830
um yeah that's cool so your video had
that kind of structure it had uh

1196
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
that kind of structure it had uh
 

1197
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,150
that kind of structure it had uh
like five or six stories or whatever it

1198
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
like five or six stories or whatever it
 

1199
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,950
like five or six stories or whatever it
was

1200
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
was
 

1201
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,590
was
and like it was basically okay here's a

1202
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
and like it was basically okay here's a
 

1203
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,750
and like it was basically okay here's a
simulation here's a model

1204
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
simulation here's a model
 

1205
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,390
simulation here's a model
what can we discover with this model and

1206
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
what can we discover with this model and
 

1207
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,990
what can we discover with this model and
here's five things i found after

1208
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
here's five things i found after
 

1209
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,310
here's five things i found after
playing with it well because here the

1210
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
playing with it well because here the
 

1211
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,029
playing with it well because here the
thing is

1212
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
thing is
 

1213
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,710
thing is
a way that you could do that project is

1214
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
a way that you could do that project is
 

1215
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,390
a way that you could do that project is
you make the model and then you put it

1216
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
you make the model and then you put it
 

1217
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,590
you make the model and then you put it
out and you say here's a thing for the

1218
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
out and you say here's a thing for the
 

1219
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,110
out and you say here's a thing for the
world to play with like come to my

1220
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
world to play with like come to my
 

1221
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,470
world to play with like come to my
website where you interact with this

1222
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
website where you interact with this
 

1223
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,110
website where you interact with this
thing

1224
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
thing
 

1225
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,630
thing
um and and people did like sort of

1226
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
um and and people did like sort of
 

1227
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,110
um and and people did like sort of
remake it in a javascript way so that

1228
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
remake it in a javascript way so that
 

1229
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,710
remake it in a javascript way so that
you can go to that website and you can

1230
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
you can go to that website and you can
 

1231
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,470
you can go to that website and you can
test your own hypotheses

1232
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
test your own hypotheses
 

1233
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,150
test your own hypotheses
but i think a meaningful part of the

1234
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
but i think a meaningful part of the
 

1235
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,310
but i think a meaningful part of the
value to add is not just the technology

1236
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
value to add is not just the technology
 

1237
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,549
value to add is not just the technology
but to give the story around it as well

1238
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
but to give the story around it as well
 

1239
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,110
but to give the story around it as well
and like that's kind of my job it's not

1240
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
and like that's kind of my job it's not
 

1241
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,990
and like that's kind of my job it's not
just to like make

1242
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
just to like make
 

1243
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,990
just to like make
the uh the visuals that someone will

1244
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
the uh the visuals that someone will
 

1245
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,190
the uh the visuals that someone will
look at it's to

1246
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
look at it's to
 

1247
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,390
look at it's to
be the one to decide what's the

1248
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
be the one to decide what's the
 

1249
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,150
be the one to decide what's the
interesting thing to walk through here

1250
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
interesting thing to walk through here
 

1251
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,950
interesting thing to walk through here
um

1252
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
um
 

1253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,070
um
and even though there's lots of other

1254
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
and even though there's lots of other
 

1255
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,990
and even though there's lots of other
interesting paths that one could take

1256
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
interesting paths that one could take
 

1257
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,350
interesting paths that one could take
that can be kind of daunting when you're

1258
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
that can be kind of daunting when you're
 

1259
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,630
that can be kind of daunting when you're
just sitting there in a sandbox and

1260
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
just sitting there in a sandbox and
 

1261
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,909
just sitting there in a sandbox and
you're given this tool with like five

1262
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
you're given this tool with like five
 

1263
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,870
you're given this tool with like five
different sliders

1264
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
different sliders
 

1265
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,990
different sliders
and you're told to like play and

1266
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
and you're told to like play and
 

1267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,990
and you're told to like play and
discover things it's like

1268
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
discover things it's like
 

1269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,510
discover things it's like
where do you do what do you start what

1270
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
where do you do what do you start what
 

1271
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,029
where do you do what do you start what
are my hypotheses what should i be

1272
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
are my hypotheses what should i be
 

1273
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,430
are my hypotheses what should i be
asking

1274
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
asking
 

1275
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,350
asking
like a little bit of guidance in that

1276
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
like a little bit of guidance in that
 

1277
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,190
like a little bit of guidance in that
direction can be what actually sparks

1278
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
direction can be what actually sparks
 

1279
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,590
direction can be what actually sparks
curiosity to make someone want to

1280
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
curiosity to make someone want to
 

1281
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,830
curiosity to make someone want to
imagine more about it a few videos i've

1282
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
imagine more about it a few videos i've
 

1283
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,950
imagine more about it a few videos i've
seen you do

1284
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
seen you do
 

1285
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,789
seen you do
i don't know how often you do it but

1286
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
i don't know how often you do it but
 

1287
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,510
i don't know how often you do it but
there's almost a tangential like pause

1288
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
there's almost a tangential like pause
 

1289
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,470
there's almost a tangential like pause
where you here's a cool thing you say

1290
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
where you here's a cool thing you say
 

1291
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,990
where you here's a cool thing you say
like here's a cool thing

1292
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
like here's a cool thing
 

1293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,830
like here's a cool thing
but it's outside the scope of this video

1294
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
but it's outside the scope of this video
 

1295
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,990
but it's outside the scope of this video
essentially but i'll leave it to you as

1296
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
essentially but i'll leave it to you as
 

1297
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,110
essentially but i'll leave it to you as
homework

1298
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
homework
 

1299
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,190
homework
essentially to like figure out it's a

1300
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
essentially to like figure out it's a
 

1301
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,630
essentially to like figure out it's a
cool thing to explore

1302
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
cool thing to explore
 

1303
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,909
cool thing to explore
i wish i could say that wasn't a

1304
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
i wish i could say that wasn't a
 

1305
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,750
i wish i could say that wasn't a
function of laziness

1306
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
function of laziness
 

1307
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,029
function of laziness
right and that's like you've worked so

1308
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
right and that's like you've worked so
 

1309
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,430
right and that's like you've worked so
hard on uh making the 20 minutes already

1310
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
hard on uh making the 20 minutes already
 

1311
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,870
hard on uh making the 20 minutes already
that to extend it out even further it

1312
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
that to extend it out even further it
 

1313
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,909
that to extend it out even further it
would take more time

1314
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
would take more time
 

1315
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,549
would take more time
and one of your cooler videos the

1316
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
and one of your cooler videos the
 

1317
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,590
and one of your cooler videos the
homomorphic

1318
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
homomorphic
 

1319
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,990
homomorphic
like from the mobius strip to the

1320
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
like from the mobius strip to the
 

1321
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,350
like from the mobius strip to the
described rectangle yeah

1322
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
described rectangle yeah
 

1323
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,710
described rectangle yeah
that's the super and you're like yeah

1324
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
that's the super and you're like yeah
 

1325
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,750
that's the super and you're like yeah
you can't uh you can't transform the

1326
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
you can't uh you can't transform the
 

1327
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,870
you can't uh you can't transform the
mobius strip into uh

1328
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
mobius strip into uh
 

1329
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,549
mobius strip into uh
into a surface without it intersecting

1330
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
into a surface without it intersecting
 

1331
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,510
into a surface without it intersecting
itself

1332
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
itself
 

1333
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,830
itself
but i'll leave it to you to to see why

1334
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
but i'll leave it to you to to see why
 

1335
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,590
but i'll leave it to you to to see why
that is

1336
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
that is
 

1337
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,029
that is
i hope that's not exactly how i phrase

1338
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
i hope that's not exactly how i phrase
 

1339
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,190
i hope that's not exactly how i phrase
it because i think what my hope would be

1340
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
it because i think what my hope would be
 

1341
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,990
it because i think what my hope would be
is that

1342
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
is that
 

1343
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,510
is that
i leave it to you to think about why you

1344
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
i leave it to you to think about why you
 

1345
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,029
i leave it to you to think about why you
would expect that to be true

1346
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
would expect that to be true
 

1347
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,909
would expect that to be true
and then to want to know what aspects of

1348
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
and then to want to know what aspects of
 

1349
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,430
and then to want to know what aspects of
a mobius strip do you want to formalize

1350
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
a mobius strip do you want to formalize
 

1351
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,950
a mobius strip do you want to formalize
such that you can prove that intuition

1352
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
such that you can prove that intuition
 

1353
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
such that you can prove that intuition
that you have

1354
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
that you have
 

1355
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,110
that you have
because at some point now you're

1356
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
because at some point now you're
 

1357
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,110
because at some point now you're
starting to invent

1358
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
starting to invent
 

1359
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,070
starting to invent
algebraic topology if uh you have these

1360
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
algebraic topology if uh you have these
 

1361
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,190
algebraic topology if uh you have these
vague instincts like

1362
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
vague instincts like
 

1363
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,710
vague instincts like
i want to get this mobius strip i want

1364
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
i want to get this mobius strip i want
 

1365
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,630
i want to get this mobius strip i want
to fit it

1366
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
to fit it
 

1367
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,590
to fit it
such that it's all above the plane but

1368
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
such that it's all above the plane but
 

1369
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,630
such that it's all above the plane but
its boundary

1370
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
its boundary
 

1371
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,470
its boundary
sits exactly on the plane i don't think

1372
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
sits exactly on the plane i don't think
 

1373
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,070
sits exactly on the plane i don't think
i can do that without crossing itself

1374
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
i can do that without crossing itself
 

1375
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,510
i can do that without crossing itself
but that feels really vague how do i

1376
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
but that feels really vague how do i
 

1377
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,950
but that feels really vague how do i
formalize it and as you're starting to

1378
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
formalize it and as you're starting to
 

1379
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,990
formalize it and as you're starting to
formalize that

1380
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
formalize that
 

1381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,310
formalize that
that's what's going to get you to try to

1382
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
that's what's going to get you to try to
 

1383
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,510
that's what's going to get you to try to
come up with a definition for what it

1384
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
come up with a definition for what it
 

1385
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,590
come up with a definition for what it
means to be orientable or not orientable

1386
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
means to be orientable or not orientable
 

1387
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,110
means to be orientable or not orientable
and like once you have that motivation a

1388
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
and like once you have that motivation a
 

1389
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,710
and like once you have that motivation a
lot of the otherwise arbitrary things

1390
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
lot of the otherwise arbitrary things
 

1391
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,830
lot of the otherwise arbitrary things
that are sitting at the very beginning

1392
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
that are sitting at the very beginning
 

1393
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,870
that are sitting at the very beginning
of a topology

1394
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
of a topology
 

1395
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,630
of a topology
textbook start to make a little more

1396
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
textbook start to make a little more
 

1397
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,710
textbook start to make a little more
sense yeah and i mean that that whole

1398
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
sense yeah and i mean that that whole
 

1399
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,270
sense yeah and i mean that that whole
video

1400
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
video
 

1401
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,430
video
beautifully was a motivation for

1402
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
beautifully was a motivation for
 

1403
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,710
beautifully was a motivation for
topology is cool

1404
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
topology is cool
 

1405
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,310
topology is cool
that was my well my hope with that is i

1406
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
that was my well my hope with that is i
 

1407
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,310
that was my well my hope with that is i
feel like topology is um i don't want to

1408
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
feel like topology is um i don't want to
 

1409
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,830
feel like topology is um i don't want to
say it's taught wrong but i do think

1410
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
say it's taught wrong but i do think
 

1411
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,750
say it's taught wrong but i do think
sometimes it's popularized in the wrong

1412
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
sometimes it's popularized in the wrong
 

1413
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,470
sometimes it's popularized in the wrong
way

1414
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
way
 

1415
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,549
way
where uh you know you'll hear these

1416
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
where uh you know you'll hear these
 

1417
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,230
where uh you know you'll hear these
things of people saying oh topologists

1418
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
things of people saying oh topologists
 

1419
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,750
things of people saying oh topologists
they're very interested in surfaces that

1420
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
they're very interested in surfaces that
 

1421
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,430
they're very interested in surfaces that
you can bend and stretch but you can't

1422
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
you can bend and stretch but you can't
 

1423
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,149
you can bend and stretch but you can't
cut

1424
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
cut
 

1425
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,310
cut
or glue are they why

1426
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
or glue are they why
 

1427
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,750
or glue are they why
yeah there's all sorts of things you can

1428
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
yeah there's all sorts of things you can
 

1429
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,029
yeah there's all sorts of things you can
be interested in with random like

1430
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
be interested in with random like
 

1431
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,070
be interested in with random like
imaginative

1432
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
imaginative
 

1433
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,909
imaginative
manipulations of things is that really

1434
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
manipulations of things is that really
 

1435
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,830
manipulations of things is that really
what like mathematicians are into

1436
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
what like mathematicians are into
 

1437
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,870
what like mathematicians are into
and the short answer is not not really

1438
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
and the short answer is not not really
 

1439
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,350
and the short answer is not not really
that's

1440
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
that's
 

1441
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,669
that's
uh it's not as if someone was sitting

1442
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
uh it's not as if someone was sitting
 

1443
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,549
uh it's not as if someone was sitting
there thinking like

1444
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
there thinking like
 

1445
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,310
there thinking like
i wonder what the properties of clay are

1446
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
i wonder what the properties of clay are
 

1447
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,310
i wonder what the properties of clay are
if i had some arbitrary rules about what

1448
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
if i had some arbitrary rules about what
 

1449
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,070
if i had some arbitrary rules about what
when i can't cut it and when i can't

1450
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
when i can't cut it and when i can't
 

1451
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,510
when i can't cut it and when i can't
glue it instead it's

1452
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
glue it instead it's
 

1453
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,870
glue it instead it's
there's a ton of pieces of math that

1454
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
there's a ton of pieces of math that
 

1455
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,909
there's a ton of pieces of math that
can actually be equivalent to

1456
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
can actually be equivalent to
 

1457
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,350
can actually be equivalent to
like these very general structures

1458
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
like these very general structures
 

1459
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,029
like these very general structures
that's like geometry except you don't

1460
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
that's like geometry except you don't
 

1461
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,470
that's like geometry except you don't
have exact distances you just want to

1462
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
have exact distances you just want to
 

1463
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,149
have exact distances you just want to
maintain a notion of closeness

1464
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
maintain a notion of closeness
 

1465
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,510
maintain a notion of closeness
and once you get it to those general

1466
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
and once you get it to those general
 

1467
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,230
and once you get it to those general

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
because you kind of have these two
 

1487
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,789

you're talking about
 

1497
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,909
you're talking about
um the axiom systems with open sets

1498
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
um the axiom systems with open sets
 

1499
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,750
um the axiom systems with open sets
and an open set is not the opposite of

1500

and an open set is not the opposite of
 

1501
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,669
and an open set is not the opposite of
closed set so sorry about that everyone

1502
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
closed set so sorry about that everyone
 

1503
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,510

we have a notion of clopin sets

1504
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520

1505
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,270
we have a notion of clopin sets
for ones that are both at the same time

for ones that are both at the same time
 

1507
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,789

yeah um and

1508
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
yeah um and
 

1509
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,110
yeah um and
just it's not it's not an intuitive

1510
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
just it's not it's not an intuitive
 

1511

00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
about coffee mugs and
 

1525
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,549
about coffee mugs and
mobius strips and such and it takes a

1526
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
mobius strips and such and it takes a
 

1527
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,789
mobius strips and such and it takes a
really long time to actually see

1528
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
really long time to actually see
 

1529
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,470

that like c topology in the way that

1530
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
that like c topology in the way that
 

1531
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,149
that like c topology in the way that
mathematicians see topology

1532
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
mathematicians see topology
 

1533
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,590
mathematicians see topology
but i don't think it needs to take that

1534
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
but i don't think it needs to take that
 

1535
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,510
but i don't think it needs to take that
time i think there's um

1536
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
time i think there's um
 

1537
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,710

this is making me feel like i need to

this is making me feel like i need to
 

1539
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,990
this is making me feel like i need to
make more videos on the topic because i

1540
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
make more videos on the topic because i
 

1541
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,950
make more videos on the topic because i

you do but you know i've also seen it in

beautiful
 

1551
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,789

and i know topology has been used uh

1552
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
and i know topology has been used uh
 

1553
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,750
and i know topology has been used uh
elegantly

elegantly
 

1555
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,669
elegantly
to prove things in game theory yeah you

1556
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
to prove things in game theory yeah you
 

1557
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,590
to prove things in game theory yeah you
have like facts that seem very strange

1558
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
have like facts that seem very strange
 

1559
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,549
have like facts that seem very strange
like i could tell you you

1560
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
like i could tell you you
 

1561
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,270
like i could tell you you
stir your coffee and um after you stir

1562
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
stir your coffee and um after you stir
 

1563
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,549
stir your coffee and um after you stir
it and like let's say all the molecules

1564
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
it and like let's say all the molecules
 

1565
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,909
it and like let's say all the molecules
settle to like not moving again

1566
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
settle to like not moving again
 

1567

one of the molecules will be basically
 

1569
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,909

00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
in the same position it was before um
 

1571
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,110
in the same position it was before um
you have all sorts of

1572
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
you have all sorts of
 

1573
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,950
you have all sorts of
fixed point theorems like this right

1574
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
fixed point theorems like this right
 

1575
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,549

right um
 

1581
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,909
right um
so you can imagine popularizing it by

1582
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
so you can imagine popularizing it by
 

1583
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,430
so you can imagine popularizing it by
describing the coffee fact but then

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
describing the coffee fact but then
 

1585
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,710
describing the coffee fact but then
you're left to wonder like who cares

1586
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
you're left to wonder like who cares
 

1587
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,390
you're left to wonder like who cares
about if a molecule of coffee like stays

1588
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
about if a molecule of coffee like stays
 

1589
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,510

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
it's the only one i have which is this
 

1629
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,190
it's the only one i have which is this
the snuggle is real

1630
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
the snuggle is real
 

1631
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,630
the snuggle is real
by the way for anyone watching i do

1632
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
by the way for anyone watching i do
 

1633
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,230
by the way for anyone watching i do
condone the message of that mug the

1634
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
condone the message of that mug the
 

1635
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,710
condone the message of that mug the
struggle

1636
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
struggle
 

1637
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,350
struggle
the snuggle is real okay so you

1638
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
the snuggle is real okay so you
 

1639
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,230
the snuggle is real okay so you
mentioned

1640
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
mentioned
 

1641
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,549
mentioned
the sir model i think

1642
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
the sir model i think
 

1643
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,630
the sir model i think
there are certain ideas there of growth

1644
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
there are certain ideas there of growth
 

1645
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,990
there are certain ideas there of growth
of exponential

1646
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
of exponential
 

1647
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,350
of exponential
growth what maybe

1648
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
growth what maybe
 

1649
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,269
growth what maybe
have you learned about um

1650
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
have you learned about um
 

1651
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,350
have you learned about um
pandemics from from making that video

1652
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
pandemics from from making that video
 

1653
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,950
pandemics from from making that video
because it was kind of exploratory you

1654
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
because it was kind of exploratory you
 

1655
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,789
because it was kind of exploratory you
were kind of building up an intuition

1656
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
were kind of building up an intuition
 

1657
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,190
were kind of building up an intuition
and it's again people should watch the

1658
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
and it's again people should watch the
 

1659
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,190
and it's again people should watch the
video it's kind of an abstract view it's

1660
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
video it's kind of an abstract view it's
 

1661
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,390
video it's kind of an abstract view it's
not

1662
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
not

those those people they go

1668
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
those those people they go
 

1669
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,669
those those people they go
really far in terms of modeling like how

1670
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
really far in terms of modeling like how
 

1671
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:31,990
really far in terms of modeling like how
people

1672

people
 

1673
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,350
people
move about i don't know if you've seen

1674
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
move about i don't know if you've seen
 

1675
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,870
move about i don't know if you've seen
it but like they're it's really their

1676
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
it but like they're it's really their
 

1677
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,630
it but like they're it's really their
mobility patterns like

1678
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
mobility patterns like
 

1679
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,870
mobility patterns like
how like they try like how many people

1680
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
how like they try like how many people
 

1681
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,990
how like they try like how many people
you encounter

1682
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
you encounter
 

1683
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,070
you encounter
in certain situations when you go to a

1684
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
in certain situations when you go to a
 

1685
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,510
in certain situations when you go to a
school when you go to a mall

1686
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,520
school when you go to a mall
 

1687
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,430
school when you go to a mall
they like model every aspect of that for

1688
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
they like model every aspect of that for
 

1689
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,590
they like model every aspect of that for
a particular city like they have maps

1690
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
a particular city like they have maps
 

1691
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,549
a particular city like they have maps
of actual city streets they model it

1692
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
of actual city streets they model it
 

1693
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,549
of actual city streets they model it
really well and natural patterns of the

1694
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
really well and natural patterns of the
 

1695
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,590
really well and natural patterns of the
people have

1696
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
people have
 

1697
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,269
people have
it's crazy so you don't do any of that

1698
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
it's crazy so you don't do any of that
 

1699
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,789
it's crazy so you don't do any of that
you're just doing an abstract model to

1700
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
you're just doing an abstract model to
 

1701
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,149
you're just doing an abstract model to
explore different ideas

1702
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
explore different ideas
 

1703
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,190
explore different ideas
of simple

1704
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200

 

1705
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,110

i'm an epidemiologist like we have a ton

1706
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
i'm an epidemiologist like we have a ton
 

1707
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,789
i'm an epidemiologist like we have a ton
of armchair epidemiologists

1708
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
of armchair epidemiologists
 

1709
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,149
of armchair epidemiologists
and the spirit of that was more like uh

1710
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
and the spirit of that was more like uh
 

1711
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,390
and the spirit of that was more like uh
can we through a little bit of play uh

1712
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
can we through a little bit of play uh
 

1713
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,710
can we through a little bit of play uh
draw like reasonable-ish conclusions

1714
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
draw like reasonable-ish conclusions
 

1715
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,190
draw like reasonable-ish conclusions
um and also just like uh get ourselves

1716
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
um and also just like uh get ourselves
 

1717
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,710
um and also just like uh get ourselves
in a position where we can

1718
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
in a position where we can
 

1719
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,269
in a position where we can
judge the validity of a model like i

1720
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
judge the validity of a model like i
 

1721
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,230
judge the validity of a model like i
think people should look at that and

1722
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
think people should look at that and
 

1723
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,269
think people should look at that and
they should criticize it they should

1724
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
they should criticize it they should
 

1725
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,390
they should criticize it they should
point to all the ways that it's wrong

1726
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
point to all the ways that it's wrong
 

1727
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,310
point to all the ways that it's wrong
because it's definitely naive

1728
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
because it's definitely naive
 

1729
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,549
because it's definitely naive
right in the way that it's set up um but

1730
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
right in the way that it's set up um but
 

1731
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,750
right in the way that it's set up um but
to say like what

1732
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
to say like what
 

1733
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,430
to say like what
what lessons from that hold like

1734
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
what lessons from that hold like
 

1735
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,029
what lessons from that hold like
thinking about the are not value and

1736
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
thinking about the are not value and
 

1737
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,310
thinking about the are not value and
what that represents and

1738
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
what that represents and
 

1739
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,310
what that represents and
what it can imply or not so are not is

1740
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
what it can imply or not so are not is
 

1741
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,470
what it can imply or not so are not is
if you are infectious and you're in a

1742
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,480
if you are infectious and you're in a
 

1743
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,669
if you are infectious and you're in a
population which is

1744
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
population which is
 

1745
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,909
population which is
um completely susceptible what's the

1746
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
um completely susceptible what's the
 

1747
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,110
um completely susceptible what's the
average number of people that you're

1748
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
average number of people that you're
 

1749
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,149
average number of people that you're
going to infect

1750
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
going to infect
 

1751
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,510
going to infect
during your infectiousness so certainly

1752
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
during your infectiousness so certainly
 

1753
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,549
during your infectiousness so certainly
during the beginning of

1754
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
during the beginning of
 

1755
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,870
during the beginning of
an epidemic this basically gives you

1756
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
an epidemic this basically gives you
 

1757
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,230
an epidemic this basically gives you
kind of the

1758
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
kind of the
 

1759
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,590
kind of the
exponential growth rate like if every

1760
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
exponential growth rate like if every
 

1761
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,029
exponential growth rate like if every
person infects two others you've got

1762
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
person infects two others you've got
 

1763
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,710
person infects two others you've got
that one two four eight

1764
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
that one two four eight
 

1765
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,350
that one two four eight
exponential growth pattern um as it goes

1766
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
exponential growth pattern um as it goes
 

1767
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,470
exponential growth pattern um as it goes
on and

1768
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
on and
 

1769
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,430
on and
let's say it's something um uh endemic

1770
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
let's say it's something um uh endemic
 

1771
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,029
let's say it's something um uh endemic
where you've got like a ton of people

1772
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
where you've got like a ton of people
 

1773
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,310
where you've got like a ton of people
who have had it

1774
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
who have had it
 

1775
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,990
who have had it
and are recovered then uh you would the

1776
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
and are recovered then uh you would the
 

1777
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,870
and are recovered then uh you would the
r naught value

1778
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
r naught value
 

1779
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,230
r naught value
doesn't tell you that as directly

1780
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
doesn't tell you that as directly
 

1781
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,909
doesn't tell you that as directly
because a lot of the people you interact

1782
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:13,919
because a lot of the people you interact
 

1783
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,029
because a lot of the people you interact
with aren't susceptible

1784
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
with aren't susceptible
 

1785
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,510
with aren't susceptible
but in the early phases it does um and

1786
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
but in the early phases it does um and
 

1787
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,350
but in the early phases it does um and
this is like the fundamental constant

1788
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
this is like the fundamental constant
 

1789
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,190
this is like the fundamental constant
that it seems like epidemiologists look

1790
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
that it seems like epidemiologists look
 

1791
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,830
that it seems like epidemiologists look
at and

1792
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
at and
 

1793
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,029
at and
you know the whole goal is to get that

1794
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
you know the whole goal is to get that
 

1795
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,950
you know the whole goal is to get that
down if you can get it below one then

1796
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
down if you can get it below one then
 

1797
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,310
down if you can get it below one then
it's no longer epidemic

1798
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320
it's no longer epidemic
 

1799
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,789
it's no longer epidemic
if it's equal to one then it's endemic

1800
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
if it's equal to one then it's endemic
 

1801
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,789
if it's equal to one then it's endemic
and it's above one then you're epidemic

1802
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
and it's above one then you're epidemic
 

1803
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,510
and it's above one then you're epidemic
so uh like just teaching what that value

1804
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
so uh like just teaching what that value
 

1805
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,510
so uh like just teaching what that value
is and giving some intuitions on

1806
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
is and giving some intuitions on
 

1807
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,269
is and giving some intuitions on
how do certain changes in behavior

1808
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:37,279
how do certain changes in behavior
 

1809
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,029
how do certain changes in behavior
change that value and then what does

1810
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
change that value and then what does
 

1811
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,870
change that value and then what does
that imply for exponential growth

1812
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
that imply for exponential growth
 

1813
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,510
that imply for exponential growth
i think those are um general enough

1814
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
i think those are um general enough
 

1815
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,789
i think those are um general enough
lessons and they're

1816
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
lessons and they're
 

1817
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,750
lessons and they're
like resilient to all of the chaoses of

1818
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
like resilient to all of the chaoses of
 

1819
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,710
like resilient to all of the chaoses of
the world

1820
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
the world
 

1821
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,669
the world
um that it's still like valid to take

1822
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
um that it's still like valid to take
 

1823
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,950
um that it's still like valid to take
from the video i mean one of the

1824
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
from the video i mean one of the
 

1825
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,430
from the video i mean one of the
interesting

1826
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
interesting
 

1827
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,950
interesting
aspects of that is just exponential

1828
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
aspects of that is just exponential
 

1829
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,870
aspects of that is just exponential
growth and we think about

1830
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
growth and we think about
 

1831
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,950
growth and we think about
growth is that one of the first times

1832
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
growth is that one of the first times
 

1833
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,190
growth is that one of the first times
you've done a video on

1834
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
you've done a video on
 

1835
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,470
you've done a video on
on uh no of course not the whole uh

1836
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
on uh no of course not the whole uh
 

1837
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,830
on uh no of course not the whole uh
oilers identity okay so sure i've done a

1838
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
oilers identity okay so sure i've done a
 

1839
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,269
oilers identity okay so sure i've done a
lot of videos about exponential growth

1840
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
lot of videos about exponential growth
 

1841
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,549
lot of videos about exponential growth
in the circular direction

1842
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
in the circular direction
 

1843
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,190
in the circular direction
uh only minimal in the normal direction

1844
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
uh only minimal in the normal direction
 

1845
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,669
uh only minimal in the normal direction
i mean

1846
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
i mean
 

1847
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,070
i mean
another way to ask like do you think

1848
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
another way to ask like do you think
 

1849
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,669
another way to ask like do you think
we're able to reason intuitively about

1850
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
we're able to reason intuitively about
 

1851
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,710
we're able to reason intuitively about
exponential growth

1852
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
exponential growth
 

1853
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,470
exponential growth
it's it's funny i think it's um i think

1854
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
it's it's funny i think it's um i think
 

1855
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,789
it's it's funny i think it's um i think
it's extremely intuitive to humans

1856
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
it's extremely intuitive to humans
 

1857
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,310
it's extremely intuitive to humans
and then we train it out of ourselves

1858
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
and then we train it out of ourselves
 

1859
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,070
and then we train it out of ourselves
such that it's then really not intuitive

1860
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
such that it's then really not intuitive
 

1861
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,430
such that it's then really not intuitive
and then i think it can become intuitive

1862
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
and then i think it can become intuitive
 

1863
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,510
and then i think it can become intuitive
again when you study a technical field

1864
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
again when you study a technical field
 

1865
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,549
again when you study a technical field
uh so what i mean by that is um

1866
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
uh so what i mean by that is um
 

1867
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,669
uh so what i mean by that is um
have you ever heard of these studies

1868
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
have you ever heard of these studies
 

1869
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,149
have you ever heard of these studies
where in a uh like anthropological

1870
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
where in a uh like anthropological
 

1871
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,669
where in a uh like anthropological
setting where you're studying a

1872
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
setting where you're studying a
 

1873
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,149
setting where you're studying a
group that has been disassociated from a

1874
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
group that has been disassociated from a
 

1875
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,029
group that has been disassociated from a
lot of like modern society and you ask

1876
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
lot of like modern society and you ask
 

1877
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,590
lot of like modern society and you ask
what number is between one and nine and

1878
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
what number is between one and nine and
 

1879
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,310
what number is between one and nine and
maybe you would ask

1880
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
maybe you would ask
 

1881
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,669
maybe you would ask
you you've got like one rock and you've

1882
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
you you've got like one rock and you've
 

1883
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,269
you you've got like one rock and you've
got nine rocks you're like what pile is

1884
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
got nine rocks you're like what pile is
 

1885
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,870
got nine rocks you're like what pile is
halfway in between these

1886
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
halfway in between these
 

1887
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,669
halfway in between these
and our instinct is usually to say five

1888
00:27:59,669 --> 00:27:59,679
and our instinct is usually to say five
 

1889
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,789
and our instinct is usually to say five
that's the number that sits right

1890
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
that's the number that sits right
 

1891
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,149
that's the number that sits right
between one and nine

1892
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
between one and nine
 

1893
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,269
between one and nine
but sometimes when uh numeracy and uh

1894
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
but sometimes when uh numeracy and uh
 

1895
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,110
but sometimes when uh numeracy and uh
the kind of just basic arithmetic that

1896
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
the kind of just basic arithmetic that
 

1897
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,630
the kind of just basic arithmetic that
we have isn't in a society

1898
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640
we have isn't in a society
 

1899
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,190
we have isn't in a society
the natural instinct is three because

1900
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
the natural instinct is three because
 

1901
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,909
the natural instinct is three because
it's

1902
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
it's
 

1903
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,750
it's
uh in between in an exponential sense

1904
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
uh in between in an exponential sense
 

1905
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,590
uh in between in an exponential sense
and a geometric sense that

1906
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
and a geometric sense that
 

1907
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,870
and a geometric sense that
one is three times bigger and then the

1908
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880
one is three times bigger and then the
 

1909
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,630
one is three times bigger and then the
next one is three times bigger than that

1910
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
next one is three times bigger than that
 

1911
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,549
next one is three times bigger than that
so it's like what's you know if you have

1912
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
so it's like what's you know if you have
 

1913
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,909
so it's like what's you know if you have
one friend versus a hundred friends

1914
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
one friend versus a hundred friends
 

1915
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,669
one friend versus a hundred friends
what's in between that yeah ten friends

1916
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
what's in between that yeah ten friends
 

1917
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,470
what's in between that yeah ten friends
seems like the

1918
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
seems like the
 

1919
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,990
seems like the
social status in between those two

1920
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
social status in between those two
 

1921
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,990
social status in between those two
states so that's like deeply intuitive

1922
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
states so that's like deeply intuitive
 

1923
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,990
states so that's like deeply intuitive
to us to think logarithmically like that

1924
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
to us to think logarithmically like that
 

1925
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,029
to us to think logarithmically like that
um and for some reason we kind of train

1926
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
um and for some reason we kind of train
 

1927
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,389
um and for some reason we kind of train
it out of ourselves to start thinking

1928
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
it out of ourselves to start thinking
 

1929
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,110
it out of ourselves to start thinking
linearly

1930
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
linearly
 

1931
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,789
linearly
about things so in the sense yeah the

1932
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
about things so in the sense yeah the
 

1933
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,149
about things so in the sense yeah the
early early basic math

1934
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
early early basic math
 

1935
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,310
early early basic math
is uh yeah it forces us to take a step

1936
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
is uh yeah it forces us to take a step
 

1937
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,590
is uh yeah it forces us to take a step
back

1938
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
back
 

1939
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,990
back
it's it's the same criticism if there's

1940
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
it's it's the same criticism if there's
 

1941
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,510
it's it's the same criticism if there's
any of science

1942
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
any of science
 

1943
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,950
any of science
is the lessons of science

1944
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
is the lessons of science
 

1945
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,230
is the lessons of science
make us like see the world in a slightly

1946
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
make us like see the world in a slightly
 

1947
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,430
make us like see the world in a slightly
narrow sense

1948
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
narrow sense
 

1949
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,750
narrow sense
to where we we have an over-exaggerated

1950
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:57,760
to where we we have an over-exaggerated
 

1951
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,990
to where we we have an over-exaggerated
confidence that we understand everything

1952
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
confidence that we understand everything
 

1953
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,230
confidence that we understand everything
as opposed to just understanding a small

1954
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
as opposed to just understanding a small
 

1955
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,269
as opposed to just understanding a small
slice of it

1956
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
slice of it
 

1957
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,269
slice of it
but i think that probably only really

1958
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
but i think that probably only really
 

1959
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,710
but i think that probably only really
goes for small numbers because the real

1960
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
goes for small numbers because the real
 

1961
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,230
goes for small numbers because the real
counterintuitive thing about exponential

1962
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
counterintuitive thing about exponential
 

1963
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,510
counterintuitive thing about exponential
growth is like as the numbers start to

1964
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
growth is like as the numbers start to
 

1965
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,149
growth is like as the numbers start to
get big

1966
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:10,159
get big
 

1967
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,789
get big
so i bet if you took that same setup and

1968
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
so i bet if you took that same setup and
 

1969
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,310
so i bet if you took that same setup and
you asked them oh if i keep tripling

1970
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
you asked them oh if i keep tripling
 

1971
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,789
you asked them oh if i keep tripling
the size of this rock pile you know um

1972
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
the size of this rock pile you know um
 

1973
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,310
the size of this rock pile you know um
seven times how big will it be

1974
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
seven times how big will it be
 

1975
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,990
seven times how big will it be
i bet it would be surprisingly big even

1976
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
i bet it would be surprisingly big even
 

1977
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,590
i bet it would be surprisingly big even
to like an

1978
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
to like an
 

1979
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,909
to like an
a society without numeracy and that's

1980
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
a society without numeracy and that's
 

1981
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,950
a society without numeracy and that's
the side of it that

1982
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
the side of it that
 

1983
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,630
the side of it that
um i think is pretty counter-intuitive

1984
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
um i think is pretty counter-intuitive
 

1985
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,070
um i think is pretty counter-intuitive
to us uh

1986
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
to us uh
 

1987
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,830
to us uh
but that you can basically train into

1988
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
but that you can basically train into
 

1989
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,149
but that you can basically train into
people like i think computer scientists

1990
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
people like i think computer scientists
 

1991
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,190
people like i think computer scientists
and physicists

1992
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
and physicists
 

1993
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,230
and physicists
when they're looking at the early

1994
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
when they're looking at the early
 

1995
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,470
when they're looking at the early
numbers of um like

1996
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
numbers of um like
 

1997
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,710
numbers of um like
kovid were they were the ones thinking

1998
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:38,720
kovid were they were the ones thinking
 

1999
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,549
kovid were they were the ones thinking
like oh god this is following an exact

2000
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
like oh god this is following an exact
 

2001
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,510
like oh god this is following an exact
exponential curve

2002
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
exponential curve
 

2003
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,230
exponential curve
yeah um and i heard that from a number

2004
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
yeah um and i heard that from a number
 

2005
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,789
yeah um and i heard that from a number
of people

2006
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
of people
 

2007
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,269
of people
uh so it's and almost all of them are

2008
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
uh so it's and almost all of them are
 

2009
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,950
uh so it's and almost all of them are
like techies in some capacity

2010
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
like techies in some capacity
 

2011
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,230
like techies in some capacity
probably just because i like live in the

2012
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
probably just because i like live in the
 

2013
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,310
probably just because i like live in the
bay area but but for sure

2014
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
bay area but but for sure
 

2015
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,029
bay area but but for sure
they're cognizant of this kind of this

2016
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
they're cognizant of this kind of this
 

2017
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,310
they're cognizant of this kind of this
kind of growth is present in a lot of

00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
kind of growth is present in a lot of
 

2019
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,630
kind of growth is present in a lot of
natural systems and a lot of

2020
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640

there's a lot of ways to visualize this

2026
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
there's a lot of ways to visualize this
 

2027
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:04,950
there's a lot of ways to visualize this
obviously but

ray kurzweil i think was the one that

2030
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
ray kurzweil i think was the one that
 

2031
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,149
ray kurzweil i think was the one that
had this like chess board

2032
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
had this like chess board
 

2033
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,549
had this like chess board
where um every every square in the

2034
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
where um every every square in the
 

2035
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,470
where um every every square in the
chessboard you double the number of

2036
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
chessboard you double the number of
 

2037
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,389
chessboard you double the number of
stones or something in that chessboard

2038
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
stones or something in that chessboard
 

2039
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,310
stones or something in that chessboard
i've heard this is like an old proverb

2040
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
i've heard this is like an old proverb
 

2041
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,789
i've heard this is like an old proverb
where you know someone the king offered

2042
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
where you know someone the king offered
 

2043
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,029
where you know someone the king offered
him a gift and he said uh the only gift

2044
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
him a gift and he said uh the only gift

single grain of rice
 

2049
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,269

right so the first chessboard and then

2050
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:27,279
right so the first chessboard and then
 

2051
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,590
right so the first chessboard and then
two grains of rice for the next square

two grains of rice for the next square
 

2053
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,470
two grains of rice for the next square
then

2054
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
then
 

2055
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,830
then
twice that for the next square and just

2056
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
twice that for the next square and just
 

2057
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,590
twice that for the next square and just
continue on that's my only modest ask

00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
and after 50 days it actually is going
 

2107
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,230
and after 50 days it actually is going
to cover the entire lake

2108
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,240
to cover the entire lake
 

2109
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,389
to cover the entire lake
okay so after how many days does it

2110
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
okay so after how many days does it
 

2111
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,190
okay so after how many days does it
cover half the lake

2112
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
cover half the lake
 

2113
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,430
cover half the lake
49. so you you have a good instinct for

2114
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
49. so you you have a good instinct for
 

2115
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,110
49. so you you have a good instinct for
exponential growth right

2116
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
exponential growth right
 

2117
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,029
exponential growth right
so i think a lot of uh like the

2118
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
so i think a lot of uh like the
 

2119
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,630
so i think a lot of uh like the
knee-jerk reaction is sometimes to think

2120
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
knee-jerk reaction is sometimes to think
 

2121
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,509
knee-jerk reaction is sometimes to think
that it's like

2122
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
that it's like
 

2123
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,350
that it's like
half the amount of time or to at least

2124
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
half the amount of time or to at least
 

2125
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,630
half the amount of time or to at least
be like surprised

2126
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
be like surprised
 

2127
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,350
be like surprised
that like after 49 days you've only

2128
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
that like after 49 days you've only
 

2129
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,470
that like after 49 days you've only
covered half of it

2130
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
covered half of it
 

2131
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,549
covered half of it
um yeah i mean that's the reason you

2132
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:44,559
um yeah i mean that's the reason you
 

2133
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,310
um yeah i mean that's the reason you
heard a pause from me

2134
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
heard a pause from me
 

2135
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,310
heard a pause from me
i literally thought that can't be right

2136
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
i literally thought that can't be right
 

2137
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,590
i literally thought that can't be right
right yeah exactly exactly

2138
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
right yeah exactly exactly
 

2139
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,269
right yeah exactly exactly
so even when you know the fact and you

2140
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
so even when you know the fact and you
 

2141
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,950
so even when you know the fact and you
do the division it's like

2142
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
do the division it's like
 

2143
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,950
do the division it's like
wow so you've gone like that whole time

2144
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
wow so you've gone like that whole time
 

2145
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,870
wow so you've gone like that whole time
and then day 49 it's only covering half

2146
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
and then day 49 it's only covering half
 

2147
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,070
and then day 49 it's only covering half
and then after that it gets the whole

2148
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
and then after that it gets the whole
 

2149
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,710
and then after that it gets the whole
thing

2150
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
thing
 

2151
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,909
thing
but i think you can make that even more

2152
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
but i think you can make that even more
 

2153
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,509
but i think you can make that even more
visceral if rather than going one day

2154
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
visceral if rather than going one day
 

2155
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,269
visceral if rather than going one day
before you say how long until

2156
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
before you say how long until
 

2157
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,509
before you say how long until
um it's covered one percent of the lake

2158
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
um it's covered one percent of the lake
 

2159
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,630
um it's covered one percent of the lake
right and it's

2160
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
right and it's
 

2161
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,870
right and it's
uh so what would that be um how many

2162
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
uh so what would that be um how many
 

2163
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,310
uh so what would that be um how many
times you have to double to get over

2164
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320
times you have to double to get over
 

2165
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,990
times you have to double to get over
a hundred like seven six and a half

2166
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
a hundred like seven six and a half
 

2167
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,430
a hundred like seven six and a half
times something like that

2168
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
times something like that
 

2169
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,070
times something like that
right so at that point you're looking at

2170
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
right so at that point you're looking at
 

2171
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,630
right so at that point you're looking at
43

2172
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
43
 

2173
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,470
43
44 days into it you're not even at one

2174
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
44 days into it you're not even at one
 

2175
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,669
44 days into it you're not even at one
percent of the lake

2176
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
percent of the lake
 

2177
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,750
percent of the lake
so you've you've experienced you know 44

2178
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
so you've you've experienced you know 44
 

2179
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,190
so you've you've experienced you know 44
out of 50 days and you're like ah that

2180
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200
out of 50 days and you're like ah that
 

2181
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,630
out of 50 days and you're like ah that
lilly bad it's just one percent of the

2182
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
lilly bad it's just one percent of the
 

2183
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,350
lilly bad it's just one percent of the
lake

2184
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
lake
 

2185
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,870
lake
but then next thing you know it's the

2186
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
but then next thing you know it's the
 

2187
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,549
but then next thing you know it's the
entire lake

2188
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
entire lake
 

2189
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,230
entire lake
are you wearing a spacex sure so let me

2190
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
are you wearing a spacex sure so let me
 

2191
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,669
are you wearing a spacex sure so let me
ask you sure

2192
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
ask you sure
 

2193
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,750
ask you sure
let me ask you one one person uh who

2194
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
let me ask you one one person uh who
 

2195
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,870
let me ask you one one person uh who
talks about

2196
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
talks about
 

2197
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,549
talks about
exponential you know just

2198
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
exponential you know just
 

2199
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,029
exponential you know just
the miracle of the exponential function

2200
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
the miracle of the exponential function
 

2201
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,549
the miracle of the exponential function
in general is elon musk

2202
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
in general is elon musk
 

2203
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,190
in general is elon musk
so he kind of advocates

2204
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
so he kind of advocates
 

2205
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,950
so he kind of advocates
the idea of exponential thinking you

2206
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:48,960
the idea of exponential thinking you
 

2207
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,029
the idea of exponential thinking you
know realizing that

2208
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
know realizing that
 

2209
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,430
know realizing that
technological development can at least

2210
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
technological development can at least
 

2211
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,950
technological development can at least
in the short term

2212
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
in the short term
 

2213
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,830
in the short term
follow exponential improvement which

2214
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
follow exponential improvement which
 

2215
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,789
follow exponential improvement which
breaks apart our

2216
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
breaks apart our
 

2217
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,269
breaks apart our
intuition our ability to reason about

2218
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
intuition our ability to reason about
 

2219
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,950
intuition our ability to reason about
what isn't isn't impossible

2220
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
what isn't isn't impossible
 

2221
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,590
what isn't isn't impossible
so he's a big one it's a good leadership

2222
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
so he's a big one it's a good leadership
 

2223
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,590
so he's a big one it's a good leadership
kind of style of saying like

2224
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
kind of style of saying like
 

2225
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,269
kind of style of saying like
look the thing that everyone thinks is

2226
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
look the thing that everyone thinks is
 

2227
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,350
look the thing that everyone thinks is
impossible is actually possible

2228
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
impossible is actually possible
 

2229
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,630
impossible is actually possible
because exponentials but

2230
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
because exponentials but
 

2231
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,350
because exponentials but
what what's your sense about um about

2232
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
what what's your sense about um about
 

2233
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,669
what what's your sense about um about
that kind of way to see the world

2234
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
that kind of way to see the world
 

2235
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,389
that kind of way to see the world
well so i think it's um it can be very

2236
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
well so i think it's um it can be very
 

2237
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,110
well so i think it's um it can be very
inspiring

2238
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
inspiring
 

2239
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,430
inspiring
to note when something like moore's law

2240
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
to note when something like moore's law
 

2241
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,110
to note when something like moore's law
is another great example where you have

2242
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
is another great example where you have
 

2243
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,470
is another great example where you have
this exponential pattern that holds

2244
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
this exponential pattern that holds
 

2245
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,590
this exponential pattern that holds
shockingly well

2246
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
shockingly well
 

2247
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,870
shockingly well
um and it enables um just better lives

2248
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
um and it enables um just better lives
 

2249
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,389
um and it enables um just better lives
to be led i think the people who took

2250
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
to be led i think the people who took
 

2251
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,830
to be led i think the people who took
moore's law seriously

2252
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
moore's law seriously
 

2253
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,990
moore's law seriously
in the 60s we're seeing that wow it's

2254
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
in the 60s we're seeing that wow it's
 

2255
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,269
in the 60s we're seeing that wow it's
not going to be too long before like

2256
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
not going to be too long before like
 

2257
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,789
not going to be too long before like
these giant computers that are either

2258
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
these giant computers that are either
 

2259
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,470
these giant computers that are either
batch processing or time shared

2260
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
batch processing or time shared
 

2261
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,830
batch processing or time shared
you could actually have one small enough

2262
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
you could actually have one small enough
 

2263
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,590
you could actually have one small enough
to put on your desk on top of your desk

2264
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600
to put on your desk on top of your desk
 

2265
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,549
to put on your desk on top of your desk
and you could do things

2266
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
and you could do things
 

2267
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,830
and you could do things
and if they took it seriously like you

2268
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
and if they took it seriously like you
 

2269
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,430
and if they took it seriously like you
have people predicting smartphones like

2270
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
have people predicting smartphones like
 

2271
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,190
have people predicting smartphones like
a long time ago

2272
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
a long time ago
 

2273
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,430
a long time ago
and it's only out of like kind of this i

2274
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
and it's only out of like kind of this i
 

2275
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,029
and it's only out of like kind of this i
don't want to say faith in exponentials

2276
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
don't want to say faith in exponentials
 

2277
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,669
don't want to say faith in exponentials
but

2278
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
but
 

2279
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,870
but
an understanding that that's what's

2280
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880
an understanding that that's what's
 

2281
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,710
an understanding that that's what's
happening what's more interesting i

2282
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
happening what's more interesting i
 

2283
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,990
happening what's more interesting i
think is to

2284
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
think is to
 

2285
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,630
think is to
really understand why exponential growth

2286
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
really understand why exponential growth
 

2287
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,350
really understand why exponential growth
happens

2288
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
happens
 

2289
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,950
happens
and that the mechanism behind it is when

2290
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
and that the mechanism behind it is when
 

2291
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,110
and that the mechanism behind it is when
the rate of change is proportional to

2292
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
the rate of change is proportional to
 

2293
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,710
the rate of change is proportional to
the thing in and of itself

2294
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
the thing in and of itself
 

2295
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,550
the thing in and of itself
so the reason the technology would grow

2296
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:10,560
so the reason the technology would grow
 

2297
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,950
so the reason the technology would grow
exponentially is only going to be if

2298
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
exponentially is only going to be if
 

2299
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,950
exponentially is only going to be if
the rate of progress is proportional to

2300
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
the rate of progress is proportional to
 

2301
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,230
the rate of progress is proportional to
the amount that you have

2302
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
the amount that you have
 

2303
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,230
the amount that you have
so that the software you write enables

2304
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
so that the software you write enables
 

2305
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,790
so that the software you write enables
you to write more software

2306
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:20,800
you to write more software
 

2307
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,149
you to write more software
and i think we see this with the

2308
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:22,159
and i think we see this with the
 

2309
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,470
and i think we see this with the
internet like the advent of the internet

2310
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
internet like the advent of the internet
 

2311
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,829
internet like the advent of the internet
makes it faster to learn things which

2312
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
makes it faster to learn things which
 

2313
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,389
makes it faster to learn things which
makes it

2314
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
makes it
 

2315
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,990
makes it
faster to uh create new things

2316
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
faster to uh create new things
 

2317
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,270
faster to uh create new things
i think this is uh oftentimes why like

2318
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
i think this is uh oftentimes why like
 

2319
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,430
i think this is uh oftentimes why like
investment will grow exponentially that

2320
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
investment will grow exponentially that
 

2321
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,550
investment will grow exponentially that
the more resources

2322
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,560
the more resources
 

2323
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,069
the more resources
a company has if it knows how to use

2324
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
a company has if it knows how to use
 

2325
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,750
a company has if it knows how to use
them well the more

2326
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:39,760
them well the more
 

2327
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,990
them well the more
uh the more it can actually grow so i

2328
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
uh the more it can actually grow so i
 

2329
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,589
uh the more it can actually grow so i
mean you know you reference elon musk i

2330
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
mean you know you reference elon musk i
 

2331
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,310
mean you know you reference elon musk i
think

2332
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
think
 

2333
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,990
think
he seems to really be into vertically

2334
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
he seems to really be into vertically
 

2335
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,750
he seems to really be into vertically
integrating his companies i think a big

2336
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
integrating his companies i think a big
 

2337
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,710
integrating his companies i think a big
part of that is because you have the

2338
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
part of that is because you have the
 

2339
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,069
part of that is because you have the
sense what you want is to make sure that

2340
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
sense what you want is to make sure that
 

2341
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,510
sense what you want is to make sure that
the things that you develop

2342
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
the things that you develop
 

2343
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,270
the things that you develop
you have ownership of and they enable

2344
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
you have ownership of and they enable
 

2345
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,030
you have ownership of and they enable
further development of the adjacent

2346
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
further development of the adjacent
 

2347
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,270
further development of the adjacent
parts right so it's not just this you

2348
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
parts right so it's not just this you
 

2349
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,790
parts right so it's not just this you
you see a curve and you're

2350
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
you see a curve and you're
 

2351
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,710
you see a curve and you're
blindly drawing a line through it what's

2352
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:00,720
blindly drawing a line through it what's
 

2353
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,310
blindly drawing a line through it what's
much more interesting is to ask when do

2354
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
much more interesting is to ask when do
 

2355
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,190
much more interesting is to ask when do
you have this

2356
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
you have this
 

2357
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,910
you have this
proportional growth property because

2358
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:05,920
proportional growth property because
 

2359
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,190
proportional growth property because
then you can also recognize when it

2360
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
then you can also recognize when it
 

2361
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,990
then you can also recognize when it
breaks down

2362
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
breaks down
 

2363
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,829
breaks down
like in an epidemic as you approach

2364
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
like in an epidemic as you approach
 

2365
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,230
like in an epidemic as you approach
saturation that would break down

2366
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
saturation that would break down
 

2367
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,470
saturation that would break down
as you do anything that skews what that

2368
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
as you do anything that skews what that
 

2369
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,390
as you do anything that skews what that
proportionality constant is

2370
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
proportionality constant is
 

2371
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,390
proportionality constant is
you can make it maybe not break down as

2372
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
you can make it maybe not break down as
 

2373
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,430
you can make it maybe not break down as
being an exponential but it can

2374
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
being an exponential but it can
 

2375
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,790
being an exponential but it can
seriously slow what that exponential

2376
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
seriously slow what that exponential
 

2377
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,829
seriously slow what that exponential
rate is

2378
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
rate is
 

2379
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,109
rate is
so the opposite of a pandemic

2380
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
so the opposite of a pandemic
 

2381
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,310
so the opposite of a pandemic
is you want in terms of ideas you want

2382
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
is you want in terms of ideas you want
 

2383
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,790
is you want in terms of ideas you want
to minimize barriers that uh

2384
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
to minimize barriers that uh
 

2385
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,310
to minimize barriers that uh
prevent the spread you want to maximize

2386
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
prevent the spread you want to maximize
 

2387
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,150
prevent the spread you want to maximize
the spread of impact so like you wanted

2388
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,160
the spread of impact so like you wanted
 

2389
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,790
the spread of impact so like you wanted
to

2390
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
to
 

2391
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,790
to
to grow when you're doing technological

2392
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800
to grow when you're doing technological
 

2393
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,069
to grow when you're doing technological
development is

2394
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
development is
 

2395
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,950
development is
so that you do hold up that rate holds

2396
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
so that you do hold up that rate holds
 

2397
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,829
so that you do hold up that rate holds
up

2398
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
up
 

2399
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,950
up
and that's all that's almost like a

2400
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
and that's all that's almost like a
 

2401
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,870
and that's all that's almost like a
like an operational challenge of like

2402
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880
like an operational challenge of like
 

2403
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,470
like an operational challenge of like
how you run a company how you run a

2404
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
how you run a company how you run a
 

2405
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,670
how you run a company how you run a
group of people

2406
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
group of people
 

2407
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,390
group of people
is that any one invention has a ripple

2408
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
is that any one invention has a ripple
 

2409
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,150
is that any one invention has a ripple
that's unstopped

2410
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,160
that's unstopped
 

2411
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,790
that's unstopped
and that ripple effect then has its own

2412
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
and that ripple effect then has its own
 

2413
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,069
and that ripple effect then has its own
ripple effects and so on and that

2414
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
ripple effects and so on and that
 

2415
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,870
ripple effects and so on and that

yeah like moore's law is fascinating and

2418
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
yeah like moore's law is fascinating and
 

2419
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,990
yeah like moore's law is fascinating and
the

2420
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
the
 

2421
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,230
the
like on a psychological level on a human

2422
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
like on a psychological level on a human
 

2423
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,270
like on a psychological level on a human
level because

2424
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
level because
 

2425
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,670
level because
it's not exponential it's it's just a

2426
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680
it's not exponential it's it's just a

it's there's something about it like
 

2471
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,470
it's there's something about it like
saying that

saying that
 

2473
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,750

it's a law so like it's uh it's
 

2477
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,550
it's a law so like it's uh it's
certainly an achievable thing

that like the genius
 

2501
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,230
that like the genius
i mean you couldn't argue that community

2502
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,240
i mean you couldn't argue that community
 

2503
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,829
i mean you couldn't argue that community
matters but it's certain like

2504
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
matters but it's certain like
 

2505
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,750
matters but it's certain like
i've been in groups of engineers where

2506
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:27,760
i've been in groups of engineers where
 

2507
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,950
i've been in groups of engineers where
like one person

2508
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
like one person
 

2509
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,069
like one person
is clearly like doing an incredible

2510
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:32,079
is clearly like doing an incredible
 

2511
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,109
is clearly like doing an incredible
amount of work

2512
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
amount of work
 

2513
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,430
amount of work
and just is the genius and it's

2514
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
and just is the genius and it's
 

2515
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,910
and just is the genius and it's
fascinating to see

2516
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
fascinating to see
 

2517
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,750

basically it's kind of the steve jobs

2518
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
basically it's kind of the steve jobs
 

2519
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,270
basically it's kind of the steve jobs
idea is maybe the whole point

2520
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,280
idea is maybe the whole point
 

2521
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,470
idea is maybe the whole point
is uh to create an atmosphere

2522
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
is uh to create an atmosphere
 

2523
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,109
is uh to create an atmosphere
where the genius can discover themselves

2524
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
where the genius can discover themselves
 

2525
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,670
where the genius can discover themselves
like

2526
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
like
 

2527
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,589
like
like have the opportunity to do the best

2528
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
like have the opportunity to do the best
 

2529
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,190
like have the opportunity to do the best
work of their life

2530
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,200
work of their life
 

2531
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,069
work of their life
and yeah and that the exponential is

2532
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
and yeah and that the exponential is
 

2533
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,750
and yeah and that the exponential is
just milking that

2534
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:57,760
just milking that
 

2535
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,990
just milking that
it's like rippling the idea that it's

2536
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,000
it's like rippling the idea that it's
 

2537
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,950
it's like rippling the idea that it's
possible

possible
 

2539
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,950

and that idea that it's possible finds
 

2541

right runners to run it
 

2549
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,069
right runners to run it
and then expose the number of people who

2550
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:10,079
and then expose the number of people who
 

2551
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,310
and then expose the number of people who
can run faster than four minutes

00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
it's kind of interesting to i don't know
 

2555
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,950
it's kind of interesting to i don't know
basically the positive way to see that

2556
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
basically the positive way to see that
 

2557
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,990
basically the positive way to see that
is most of us

2558
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
is most of us
 

2559
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,790
is most of us
are way more intelligent have way more

i guess that's kind of depressing but i
 

2565
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,990
i guess that's kind of depressing but i
mean like the ceiling for most of us is

2566
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
mean like the ceiling for most of us is
 

2567
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,390
mean like the ceiling for most of us is
much higher than we ever realized

2568
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
much higher than we ever realized
 

2569
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,710
much higher than we ever realized
that is true a a good book to read if

a concrete manifesto about deliberate
practice and such but

2590
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:47,839
practice and such but
 

2591
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,670
practice and such but
the one sensation you come out with is

2592
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
the one sensation you come out with is
 

2593
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,670
the one sensation you come out with is
wow no matter how good people are at

2594
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
wow no matter how good people are at
 

2595
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,470
wow no matter how good people are at
something

2596
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
something
 

2597
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,310
something
they can get better and like way better

2598
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
they can get better and like way better
 

2599
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,670
they can get better and like way better
than we think they could

2600
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
than we think they could
 

2601
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,109
than we think they could
i don't know if that's actually related

2602
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
i don't know if that's actually related
 

2603
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,710
i don't know if that's actually related
to exponential growth

2604
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
to exponential growth
 

2605
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,230
to exponential growth
but i do think it's a true phenomenon

2606
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
but i do think it's a true phenomenon
 

2607
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,550
but i do think it's a true phenomenon
that's interesting yeah i mean

2608
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
that's interesting yeah i mean
 

2609
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,790
that's interesting yeah i mean
there's certainly no law of exponential

2610
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
there's certainly no law of exponential
 

2611
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,910
there's certainly no law of exponential
growth in human

2612
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:05,920
growth in human
 

2613
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,750

innovation well i don't know

2614
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
innovation well i don't know
 

2615
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,510
innovation well i don't know
well kind of there is like there's i

2616
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
well kind of there is like there's i
 

2617
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,870
well kind of there is like there's i
think it's really interesting to see

2618
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
think it's really interesting to see
 

2619
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,710
think it's really interesting to see
when innovations in one field allow for

2620
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
when innovations in one field allow for
 

2621
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,910
when innovations in one field allow for
innovations in another

2622
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:15,920
innovations in another
 

2623
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,069
innovations in another
like the advent of computing seems like

2624
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
like the advent of computing seems like
 

2625
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,670
like the advent of computing seems like
a prerequisite for the advent of chaos

2626
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
a prerequisite for the advent of chaos
 

2627
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,230
a prerequisite for the advent of chaos
theory

2628
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
theory
 

2629
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,069
theory
you have this truth about physics and

2630
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
you have this truth about physics and
 

2631
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,349
you have this truth about physics and
the world that

2632
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
the world that
 

2633
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,430
the world that
in theory could be known you could find

2634
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
in theory could be known you could find
 

2635
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,150
in theory could be known you could find
lorenz's equations without computers

2636
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160
lorenz's equations without computers
 

2637
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,069
lorenz's equations without computers
but in practice it was just never going

2638
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
but in practice it was just never going
 

2639
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,670
but in practice it was just never going
to be analyzed that way

2640
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
to be analyzed that way
 

2641
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,190
to be analyzed that way
unless you were doing like a bunch of

2642
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
unless you were doing like a bunch of
 

2643
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,630
unless you were doing like a bunch of
simulations and that you could

2644
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:34,640
simulations and that you could
 

2645
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,310
simulations and that you could
computationally see these models

2646
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
computationally see these models
 

2647
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,430
computationally see these models
so it's like physics allowed for

2648
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
so it's like physics allowed for
 

2649
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,870
so it's like physics allowed for
computers computers allowed for better

2650
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
computers computers allowed for better
 

2651
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,670
computers computers allowed for better
physics

2652
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
physics
 

2653
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,270
physics
and you know wash rinse and repeat that

2654
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
and you know wash rinse and repeat that
 

2655
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,589
and you know wash rinse and repeat that
self-proportionality that's exponential

2656
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
self-proportionality that's exponential
 

2657
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,630
self-proportionality that's exponential
so i think

2658
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:46,640
so i think
 

2659
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,710
so i think
i wouldn't i don't think it's too far to

2660
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
i wouldn't i don't think it's too far to
 

2661
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,430
i wouldn't i don't think it's too far to
say that that's a law of some kind

2662
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440
say that that's a law of some kind
 

2663
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,670
say that that's a law of some kind
yeah a fundamental law of the universe

2664
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
yeah a fundamental law of the universe
 

2665
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,950
yeah a fundamental law of the universe
is that

2666
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
is that
 

2667
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,030
is that
these descendants of apes will

2668
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,040
these descendants of apes will
 

2669
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,870
these descendants of apes will
exponentially improve their technology

2670
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
exponentially improve their technology
 

2671
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,470
exponentially improve their technology
and one day take be taken over by the

uh so i mean since you're wearing a

2682
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
uh so i mean since you're wearing a
 

2683
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,349
uh so i mean since you're wearing a
space actually let me let me ask uh so

2684
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
space actually let me let me ask uh so
 

2685
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,589
space actually let me let me ask uh so
i didn't realize that i apologize

2686
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
i didn't realize that i apologize
 

2687
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,349
i didn't realize that i apologize
yeah so crew dragon the first

2688
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
yeah so crew dragon the first
 

2689
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,430
yeah so crew dragon the first
uh crude mission out into space

2690
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
uh crude mission out into space
 

2691
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,349
uh crude mission out into space
since the the space shuttle

2692
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
since the the space shuttle
 

2693
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,550
since the the space shuttle
and just by first

2694
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,560
and just by first
 

2695
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,349
and just by first
time ever by a commercial company i mean

2696
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
time ever by a commercial company i mean
 

2697
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,950
time ever by a commercial company i mean
it's an incredible accomplishment i

2698
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
it's an incredible accomplishment i
 

2699
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,589
it's an incredible accomplishment i
think

2700
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
think
 

2701
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,950
think
but it's also just an incredible

2702
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:40,960
but it's also just an incredible
 

2703
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,750
but it's also just an incredible
it inspires imagination amongst people

2704
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
it inspires imagination amongst people
 

2705
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,349
it inspires imagination amongst people
that this is the first step

2706
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
that this is the first step
 

2707
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,109
that this is the first step
in a long like vibrant journey of humans

2708
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
in a long like vibrant journey of humans
 

2709
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:49,910
in a long like vibrant journey of humans
into space

2710

into space
 

2711
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,069
into space
oh yeah so what do you what are your how

2712
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
oh yeah so what do you what are your how
 

2713
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,430
oh yeah so what do you what are your how
do you feel is this

2714
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
do you feel is this
 

2715
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,270
do you feel is this
you know is this exciting to you yeah it

2716
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
you know is this exciting to you yeah it
 

2717
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,190
you know is this exciting to you yeah it
is i think it's great the idea of seeing

2718
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,200
is i think it's great the idea of seeing
 

2719
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,750
is i think it's great the idea of seeing
it

2720
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:57,760
it
 

2721
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,270

basically done by smaller entities
 

2723
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,030
basically done by smaller entities
instead of by governments i mean it's a

but that you can have um uh something

2736
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
but that you can have um uh something
 

2737
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,630
but that you can have um uh something
closer to a single company doing it

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
closer to a single company doing it
 

2739
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,589
closer to a single company doing it
we're not there yet

2740
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:15,599
we're not there yet
 

2741
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,790
we're not there yet
because it's not like they're

because it's not like they're
 

2743
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,230
because it's not like they're

shooting people up into space um
 

2747
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,069
shooting people up into space um
it's just a sign that we're able to do

it's just a sign that we're able to do

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,510
it's just a sign that we're able to do
more powerful things with smaller groups

2750
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
more powerful things with smaller groups
 

2751
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,390
more powerful things with smaller groups
of people

2752
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
of people
 

2753
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,109
of people
uh i find that inspiring innovate

2754
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
uh i find that inspiring innovate
 

2755
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,390
uh i find that inspiring innovate
quickly

2756
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
quickly
 

2757
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,069
quickly
i hope we see people land on mars in my

2758
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
i hope we see people land on mars in my
 

2759
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,230
i hope we see people land on mars in my
lifetime do you think we will

2760
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
lifetime do you think we will
 

2761
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
lifetime do you think we will
i think so i mean i think there's a ton

2762
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
i think so i mean i think there's a ton
 

2763
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,150
i think so i mean i think there's a ton
of challenges there right like radiation

2764
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
of challenges there right like radiation
 

2765
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,870
of challenges there right like radiation
being kind of

2766
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
being kind of
 

2767
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,069
being kind of
the biggest one and i think there's a

2768
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
the biggest one and i think there's a
 

2769
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,910
the biggest one and i think there's a
ton of people who uh

2770
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
ton of people who uh
 

2771
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,470
ton of people who uh
look at that and say why why would you

2772
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
look at that and say why why would you
 

2773
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,510
look at that and say why why would you
want to do that

2774
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
want to do that
 

2775
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,270
want to do that
let's let the robots do the science for

2776
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
let's let the robots do the science for
 

2777
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,710
let's let the robots do the science for
us but i think there's

2778
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:46,720
us but i think there's
 

2779
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,309
us but i think there's
enough people who are like genuinely

2780
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
enough people who are like genuinely
 

2781
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,150
enough people who are like genuinely
inspired about broadening like the

2782
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
inspired about broadening like the
 

2783
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,349
inspired about broadening like the
worlds that we've touched

2784
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
worlds that we've touched
 

2785
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,910
worlds that we've touched
um or people who think about things like

2786
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
um or people who think about things like
 

2787
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,670
um or people who think about things like
backing up the light of consciousness

2788
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
backing up the light of consciousness
 

2789
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,109
backing up the light of consciousness
with like super long-term visions of

2790
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
with like super long-term visions of
 

2791
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,109
with like super long-term visions of
terraforming like as long as

2792
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
terraforming like as long as
 

2793
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,990
terraforming like as long as
there's backing up the light of

2794
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
there's backing up the light of
 

2795
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,990
there's backing up the light of
consciousness yeah yeah the thought that

2796
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
consciousness yeah yeah the thought that
 

2797
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,390
consciousness yeah yeah the thought that
uh

2798
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
uh
 

2799
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,950
uh
you know if we if earth goes to hell we

2800
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:04,960
you know if we if earth goes to hell we
 

2801
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,390
you know if we if earth goes to hell we
gotta have a backup somewhere

2802
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
gotta have a backup somewhere
 

2803
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,870
gotta have a backup somewhere
um a lot of people see that as pretty

2804
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
um a lot of people see that as pretty
 

2805
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,990
um a lot of people see that as pretty
out there and it's like not in the short

2806
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
out there and it's like not in the short
 

2807
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,190
out there and it's like not in the short
term future but

2808
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
term future but
 

2809
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,710
term future but
i think that's an inspiring thought i

2810
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
i think that's an inspiring thought i
 

2811
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,230
i think that's an inspiring thought i
think that's a reason to like get up in

2812
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
think that's a reason to like get up in
 

2813
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,950
think that's a reason to like get up in
the morning and

2814
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:14,960
the morning and
 

2815
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,950
the morning and
i feel like most employees at spacex

2816
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:16,960
i feel like most employees at spacex
 

2817
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,470
i feel like most employees at spacex
feel that way too

2818
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
feel that way too
 

2819
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,109
feel that way too
do you think we'll colonize mars one day

2820
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
do you think we'll colonize mars one day
 

2821
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,589
do you think we'll colonize mars one day
no idea like either agi kills us first

2822
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
no idea like either agi kills us first
 

2823
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,589
no idea like either agi kills us first
or if we're like allowed i don't know if

2824
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:25,599
or if we're like allowed i don't know if
 

2825
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,870
or if we're like allowed i don't know if
it'll take loud

2826
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:26,880
it'll take loud
 

2827
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,710
it'll take loud
well like honestly it takes it would

2828
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
well like honestly it takes it would
 

2829
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,069
well like honestly it takes it would
take such a long time

2830
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:30,079
take such a long time
 

2831
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,750
take such a long time
like okay you might have a small colony

2832
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
like okay you might have a small colony
 

2833
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,750
like okay you might have a small colony
right um something like what you see

2834
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
right um something like what you see
 

2835
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,870
right um something like what you see
in um the martian but not like people

2836
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
in um the martian but not like people
 

2837
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,349
in um the martian but not like people
living

2838
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
living
 

2839
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,150
living
comfortably there um but if you want to

2840
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,160
comfortably there um but if you want to
 

2841
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,270
comfortably there um but if you want to
talk about actual

2842
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
talk about actual
 

2843
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,550
talk about actual
like second earth kind of

2844
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:44,560
like second earth kind of
 

2845
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,870
like second earth kind of
stuff that that's just like way far out

2846
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
stuff that that's just like way far out
 

2847
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,430
stuff that that's just like way far out
there and the future moves so fast that

2848
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
there and the future moves so fast that
 

2849
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,950
there and the future moves so fast that
it's hard to predict like we might just

2850
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960
it's hard to predict like we might just
 

2851
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,710
it's hard to predict like we might just
kill ourselves before that even becomes

2852
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
kill ourselves before that even becomes
 

2853
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,829
kill ourselves before that even becomes
viable

2854
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
viable
 

2855
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,670
viable
i yeah i mean there's there's a lot of

2856
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
i yeah i mean there's there's a lot of
 

2857
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,030
i yeah i mean there's there's a lot of
possibilities where it could be

2858
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,040
possibilities where it could be
 

2859
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,470
possibilities where it could be
just it doesn't have to be on a planet

2860
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
just it doesn't have to be on a planet
 

2861
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,150
just it doesn't have to be on a planet
we could be floating out in space

2862
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
we could be floating out in space
 

2863
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,430
we could be floating out in space
have uh have a have a space faring

2864
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
have uh have a have a space faring
 

2865
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,870
have uh have a have a space faring
backup solution that doesn't have uh

2866
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
backup solution that doesn't have uh
 

2867
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,309
backup solution that doesn't have uh
that doesn't have to deal with the

2868
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
that doesn't have to deal with the
 

2869
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,829
that doesn't have to deal with the
constraints at a planet but i mean a

2870
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
constraints at a planet but i mean a
 

2871
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,430
constraints at a planet but i mean a
planet provides a lot of possibilities

2872
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
planet provides a lot of possibilities
 

2873
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,710
planet provides a lot of possibilities
and resources but also

2874
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:12,720
and resources but also
 

2875
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,990
and resources but also
some constraints yeah i mean

2876
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
some constraints yeah i mean
 

2877
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,230
some constraints yeah i mean
for me for some reason it's a deeply

2878
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
for me for some reason it's a deeply
 

2879
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,630
for me for some reason it's a deeply
exciting possibility oh yeah

2880
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
exciting possibility oh yeah
 

2881
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,150
exciting possibility oh yeah
all of the people who are like skeptical

2882
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
all of the people who are like skeptical
 

2883
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,230
all of the people who are like skeptical
about it or like why why do we care

2884
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,240
about it or like why why do we care
 

2885
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,270
about it or like why why do we care
about going to mars

2886
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
about going to mars
 

2887
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,790
about going to mars
it's like what makes you care about

2888
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
it's like what makes you care about
 

2889
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,470
it's like what makes you care about
anything that's not inspiring

2890
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:28,480
anything that's not inspiring
 

2891
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,309
anything that's not inspiring
it's hard actually it's hard to hear

2892
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
it's hard actually it's hard to hear
 

2893
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,150
it's hard actually it's hard to hear
that because

2894
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
that because
 

2895
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,230
that because
exactly as you put it on a philosophical

2896
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
exactly as you put it on a philosophical
 

2897
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,910
exactly as you put it on a philosophical
level it's hard to

2898
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
level it's hard to
 

2899
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,470
level it's hard to
say why do anything i don't know it's

2900
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
say why do anything i don't know it's
 

2901
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,309
say why do anything i don't know it's
it's like the people say like

2902
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:42,319

 

2903
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,750

you know i've been doing like an insane

2904
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
you know i've been doing like an insane
 

2905
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,550
you know i've been doing like an insane
challenge last 30 something days

2906
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
challenge last 30 something days
 

2907
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,910

demands innovation you can't move the

2970
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
demands innovation you can't move the
 

2971
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,030
demands innovation you can't move the
goal post to make that easier

2972
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040
goal post to make that easier
 

2973
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,390
goal post to make that easier
almost certainly the innovations

2974
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,400
almost certainly the innovations
 

2975
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,750
almost certainly the innovations
required for things like that will be

2976
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
required for things like that will be
 

2977
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,910
required for things like that will be
relevant in a bunch of other domains too

relevant in a bunch of other domains too
 

2979
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,750
relevant in a bunch of other domains too
um so like the idea of doing something

2980
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
um so like the idea of doing something
 

2981
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,270
um so like the idea of doing something
merely because it's hard

as long as you can't move the goal posts

2986
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:01,599
as long as you can't move the goal posts
 

2987

there's probably going to be these

2988
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
there's probably going to be these
 

2989
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,270
there's probably going to be these
secondary benefits that

2990

secondary benefits that
 

2991
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,510
secondary benefits that
like we should all strive for yeah i

2992
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
like we should all strive for yeah i
 

2993

if there was a deadline
then the amount of things we would come

3004
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:20,720
then the amount of things we would come
 

3005
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,829
then the amount of things we would come
up with

3006

it was probably intended for a very
 

3055
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,230
it was probably intended for a very
narrow small group of people

3056
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
narrow small group of people
 

3057
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,990
narrow small group of people
well so i mean it was there was like

3058
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
well so i mean it was there was like
 

3059
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,349
well so i mean it was there was like
this small community of people who are

3060
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
this small community of people who are
 

3061
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,550
this small community of people who are
really interested in time sharing

3062
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
really interested in time sharing
 

3063
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,630

computing and like interactive computing

3064
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
computing and like interactive computing
 

3065
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,750
computing and like interactive computing
in contrast with uh batch processing

3066
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
in contrast with uh batch processing
 

3067
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,270
in contrast with uh batch processing
and then the idea that as you set up

3068
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
and then the idea that as you set up
 

3069
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,430
and then the idea that as you set up
like a time sharing center

3070
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
like a time sharing center
 

3071
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,030
like a time sharing center
uh basically meaning you have multiple

3072
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,040
uh basically meaning you have multiple
 

3073
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,470
uh basically meaning you have multiple
people like logged in and using that

3074
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
people like logged in and using that
 

3075
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,230
people like logged in and using that
like central computer um

3076
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
like central computer um
 

3077
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,910
like central computer um
why not make it accessible to others

3078
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
why not make it accessible to others
 

3079
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,270
why not make it accessible to others
yeah and this was kind of what i had

3080
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:31,280
yeah and this was kind of what i had
 

3081
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,790
yeah and this was kind of what i had
always thought like oh is this like

3082
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
always thought like oh is this like
 

3083
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,470
always thought like oh is this like
fringe group that was interested in this

3084
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
fringe group that was interested in this
 

3085
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,990
fringe group that was interested in this
new kind of computing and they all like

3086
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
new kind of computing and they all like
 

3087
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,589
new kind of computing and they all like
got themselves together

3088
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
got themselves together
 

3089
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,750
got themselves together
but the thing is like darpa wouldn't act

3090
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
but the thing is like darpa wouldn't act
 

3091
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,030
but the thing is like darpa wouldn't act
you wouldn't have the us government

3092
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
you wouldn't have the us government
 

3093
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,790
you wouldn't have the us government
funding that just for the funds of it

3094
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
funding that just for the funds of it
 

3095
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,190
funding that just for the funds of it
right in some sense that's what arpa was

3096
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
right in some sense that's what arpa was
 

3097
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,150
right in some sense that's what arpa was
all about was

3098
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,160
all about was
 

3099
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,630
all about was
uh like just really advanced research

3100
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
uh like just really advanced research
 

3101
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,150
uh like just really advanced research
for the sake of having advanced research

3102
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
for the sake of having advanced research
 

3103
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,270
for the sake of having advanced research
and it doesn't have to

3104
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
and it doesn't have to
 

3105
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,630
and it doesn't have to
pay out with utility soon but the core

3106
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
pay out with utility soon but the core
 

3107
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,309
pay out with utility soon but the core
parts of its development were happening

3108
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
parts of its development were happening
 

3109
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,910
parts of its development were happening
like in the middle of the vietnam war

3110
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
like in the middle of the vietnam war
 

3111
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,069
like in the middle of the vietnam war
when there was budgetary constraints all

3112
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
when there was budgetary constraints all
 

3113
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,270
when there was budgetary constraints all
over the place

3114
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,280
over the place
 

3115
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,870
over the place
uh i only learned this recently actually

3116
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
uh i only learned this recently actually
 

3117
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,950
uh i only learned this recently actually
like if you look at the documents

3118
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
like if you look at the documents
 

3119
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,550
like if you look at the documents
basically justifying the um budget for

3120
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:08,560
basically justifying the um budget for
 

3121
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,950
basically justifying the um budget for
the arpanet as they were developing it

3122
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,960
the arpanet as they were developing it
 

3123
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,829
the arpanet as they were developing it
and not just

3124
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
and not just
 

3125
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,190
and not just
keeping it where it was but actively

3126
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
keeping it where it was but actively
 

3127
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,630
keeping it where it was but actively
growing it while all sorts of other

3128
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
growing it while all sorts of other
 

3129
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,910
growing it while all sorts of other
departments were having their funding

3130
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
departments were having their funding
 

3131
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,950
departments were having their funding
cut

3132
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
cut
 

3133
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,670
cut
because of the war a big part of it was

3134
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:19,680
because of the war a big part of it was
 

3135
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,349
because of the war a big part of it was
national defense in terms of having like

3136
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
national defense in terms of having like
 

3137
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,670
national defense in terms of having like
a more robust communication system

3138
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
a more robust communication system
 

3139
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,270
a more robust communication system
like the idea of packet switching versus

3140
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
like the idea of packet switching versus
 

3141
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,030
like the idea of packet switching versus
circuit switching you could kind of make

3142
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
circuit switching you could kind of make
 

3143
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,990
circuit switching you could kind of make
this case that

3144
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
this case that
 

3145
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,910
this case that
in some calamitous circumstance where

3146
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
in some calamitous circumstance where
 

3147
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,829
in some calamitous circumstance where
you know a central location gets nuked

3148
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
you know a central location gets nuked
 

3149
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,829
you know a central location gets nuked
uh this is a this is a much more

3150
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
uh this is a this is a much more
 

3151
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,030
uh this is a this is a much more
resilient way to still have your

3152
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
resilient way to still have your
 

3153
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,390
resilient way to still have your
communication lines

3154
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
communication lines
 

3155
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,670
communication lines
that like traditional um telephone lines

3156
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:39,680
that like traditional um telephone lines
 

3157
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,309
that like traditional um telephone lines
weren't as resilient to which i just

3158
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
weren't as resilient to which i just
 

3159
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,430
weren't as resilient to which i just
found very interesting

3160
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
found very interesting
 

3161
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,230
found very interesting
that that um even something that we see

3162
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,240
that that um even something that we see
 

3163
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,829
that that um even something that we see
is so happy-go-lucky is just a bunch of

3164
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:47,839
is so happy-go-lucky is just a bunch of
 

3165

is so happy-go-lucky is just a bunch of
computer nerds trying to get like

3166
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
computer nerds trying to get like
 

3167
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,950
computer nerds trying to get like
interactive computing out there

3168
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:50,960
interactive computing out there
 

3169
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,829
interactive computing out there
the actual like thing that made it uh

3170
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
the actual like thing that made it uh
 

3171
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,670
the actual like thing that made it uh
funded and thing that made it advance

3172
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
funded and thing that made it advance
 

3173
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,069
funded and thing that made it advance
uh when it did was because of this

3174
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,079
uh when it did was because of this
 

3175
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,750
uh when it did was because of this
direct national security

3176
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
direct national security
 

3177
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,430
direct national security
question and concern i don't know if

that talks about like science and the
 

3189
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,670
that talks about like science and the
context of the military like basically

3190
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:11,680
context of the military like basically
 

3191
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,309
context of the military like basically
saying

3192

saying
 

3193

in the 20th century
 

3197
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,470
in the 20th century
was like because of the military i mean

3198
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:18,480
was like because of the military i mean
 

3199
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,589
was like because of the military i mean
he paints a positive

3200
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
he paints a positive
 

3201
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,150
he paints a positive
it's not like a critical it's not you

3202
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
it's not like a critical it's not you
 

3203
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,430
it's not like a critical it's not you
know a lot of people say like military

3204

know a lot of people say like military
 

3205
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,510
know a lot of people say like military
industrial complex and so on

3206

like you said
 

3213
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,470
like you said
deadlines and like hard things you can't

3214
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
deadlines and like hard things you can't
 

3215
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,309
deadlines and like hard things you can't
move like almost

3216
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
move like almost
 

3217
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,710
move like almost
you know almost like scaring yourself

3218
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
you know almost like scaring yourself
 

3219
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,470
you know almost like scaring yourself
into being productive

3220
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,480
into being productive
 

3221
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,790
into being productive
it is that i mean manhattan project is a

3222
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
it is that i mean manhattan project is a
 

3223
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,910
it is that i mean manhattan project is a
perfect example probably the

3224
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:41,920
perfect example probably the
 

3225
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,069
perfect example probably the
quintessential example that one

3226
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079
quintessential example that one
 

3227
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,069
quintessential example that one
uh is a little bit more macabre than

3228
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079

out with that sense of worry in that

everyone there was saying like we've got
 

3247
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,230

i again like the circumstances macabre

i again like the circumstances macabre

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,190
i again like the circumstances macabre

that i think is like really helpful for

that i think is like really helpful for
 

3293
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,910
that i think is like really helpful for
the theory as well as for the

uh so i think that stuff can be

uh so i think that stuff can be

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,870
uh so i think that stuff can be

and bell labs was like famously a lot of

3326
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,040
and bell labs was like famously a lot of

change in some way that uh i i look at
a bell labs type situation and i'm like

3346

a bell labs type situation and i'm like
 

3347

animation library the thing i have to do
 

3643
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,230
animation library the thing i have to do
is like

3644
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
is like
 

3645
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,230
is like
a little i'm not a software engineer but

3646
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:30,240
a little i'm not a software engineer but
 

3647
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,510
a little i'm not a software engineer but
something in the direction of software

3648
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,520
something in the direction of software
 

3649
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,309
something in the direction of software
engineering

3650
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
engineering
 

3651
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,990
engineering
some days it's like a variant of

3652
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
some days it's like a variant of
 

3653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,829
some days it's like a variant of
research it's like learn this topic well

3654
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
research it's like learn this topic well
 

3655
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,430
research it's like learn this topic well
and try to learn it differently

3656
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
and try to learn it differently
 

3657
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,910
and try to learn it differently
so those is like four very different

3658
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
so those is like four very different
 

3659
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,270
so those is like four very different
modes of what it

3660
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
modes of what it
 

3661
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,630
modes of what it
some days is like get through the email

3662
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
some days is like get through the email
 

3663
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,549
some days is like get through the email
backlog of people i've been

3664
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
backlog of people i've been
 

3665
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,870
backlog of people i've been
the tasks i've been putting off um it

3666
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:46,880
the tasks i've been putting off um it
 

3667
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,870
the tasks i've been putting off um it
goes research scripting

3668
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
goes research scripting
 

3669
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,390
goes research scripting
like the idea starts with the research

3670
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:50,400
like the idea starts with the research
 

3671
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,990
like the idea starts with the research
and then there's scripting

3672
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
and then there's scripting
 

3673
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,349
and then there's scripting
and then there's programming and then

3674
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,359
and then there's programming and then
 

3675
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,589
and then there's programming and then
there's the uh

3676
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
there's the uh
 

3677
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,750
there's the uh
show time and the research side by the

3678
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
show time and the research side by the
 

3679
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,950
show time and the research side by the
way like what's

3680
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
way like what's
 

3681
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,630
way like what's
i think a problematic way to do it is to

3682
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
i think a problematic way to do it is to
 

3683
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,069
i think a problematic way to do it is to
say i'm starting this project

3684
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
say i'm starting this project
 

3685
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,589
say i'm starting this project
and therefore i'm starting the research

3686
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:03,599
and therefore i'm starting the research
 

3687
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,710
and therefore i'm starting the research
instead it should be that you're like

3688
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720
instead it should be that you're like
 

3689
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,950
instead it should be that you're like
ambiently learning a ton of things

3690
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
ambiently learning a ton of things
 

3691
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,030
ambiently learning a ton of things
just in the background and then once you

3692
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,040
just in the background and then once you
 

3693
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,309
just in the background and then once you
feel like you have the understanding for

3694
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:10,319
feel like you have the understanding for
 

3695
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,670
feel like you have the understanding for
one you put it on the list of things

3696
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
one you put it on the list of things
 

3697
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,069
one you put it on the list of things
that

3698
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
that
 

3699
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,030
that
there can be a video for otherwise

3700
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
there can be a video for otherwise
 

3701
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,309
there can be a video for otherwise
either you're gonna end up roadblocked

3702
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:16,319
either you're gonna end up roadblocked
 

3703
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,069
either you're gonna end up roadblocked
forever or you're just not gonna

3704
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
forever or you're just not gonna
 

3705
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,030
forever or you're just not gonna
like have a good way of talking about it

um like one component of it is as soon
 

4783
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,030
um like one component of it is as soon
as you hook things up with a

and then you can like have keyboard

4792
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:08,719
and then you can like have keyboard
 

4793
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,149
and then you can like have keyboard
shortcuts to transition between those

4794

it took a little bit of practice and i
 

4809
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:20,790
it took a little bit of practice and i
would mess it up

4810
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:20,800
would mess it up
 

4811
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,470
would mess it up
now and then but i think i had it

4812

now and then but i think i had it
 

4813
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,070
now and then but i think i had it
decently smooth such that

01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,550
you know i'm talking to the camera and
then we're doing something on the paper

4818
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
then we're doing something on the paper
 

4819
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,830
then we're doing something on the paper
then we're doing like a

4820
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
then we're doing like a
 

4821
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,830
then we're doing like a
um playing with a desmos graph or

4822
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
um playing with a desmos graph or
 

4823
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,189
um playing with a desmos graph or
something and

4824
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
something and
 

4825
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,550
something and
something that i think in the past would

4826
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,560
something that i think in the past would
 

4827
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,910
something that i think in the past would
have required a production team you can

4828
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920
have required a production team you can
 

4829
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,149
have required a production team you can
actually do as a solo operation

4830
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:36,159
actually do as a solo operation
 

4831
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,990
actually do as a solo operation
and in particular as a teacher and i

4832
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:38,000
and in particular as a teacher and i
 

4833
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,669
and in particular as a teacher and i
think it's worth it to try to do that

4834
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
think it's worth it to try to do that
 

4835
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:40,630
think it's worth it to try to do that
because

4836
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640
because
 

4837
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,870
because
uh two reasons one you might get more

4838
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
uh two reasons one you might get more
 

4839
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,390
uh two reasons one you might get more
engagement from the students

4840
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:44,400
engagement from the students
 

4841
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,669
engagement from the students
but the biggest reason i think one of

4842
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
but the biggest reason i think one of
 

4843
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,189
but the biggest reason i think one of
the like best things that can come out

4844
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:47,199
the like best things that can come out
 

4845
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,110
the like best things that can come out
of this pandemic education-wise

4846
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
of this pandemic education-wise
 

4847
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,630
of this pandemic education-wise
is if we turn a bunch of teachers into

4848
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
is if we turn a bunch of teachers into
 

4849
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,390
is if we turn a bunch of teachers into
content creators and if we take

4850
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,400
content creators and if we take
 

4851
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,910
content creators and if we take
lessons that are usually done in these

4852
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:53,920
lessons that are usually done in these
 

4853
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,510
lessons that are usually done in these
one-off settings and like

4854
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
one-off settings and like
 

4855
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,630
one-off settings and like
start to get in the habit of sometimes

4856
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
start to get in the habit of sometimes
 

4857
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,990
start to get in the habit of sometimes
i'll use the phrase commoditizing

01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
i'll use the phrase commoditizing

it just seems inefficient to me that

01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
it just seems inefficient to me that
 

4867
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,750
it just seems inefficient to me that
that lesson is taught

world like year to year you've got a
 

4875
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,950
world like year to year you've got a
given algebra 1 lesson that's just

what should happen is that there's the

4884
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
what should happen is that there's the
 

4885
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,470
what should happen is that there's the
small handful of explanations online

4886
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
small handful of explanations online
 

4887
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,910
small handful of explanations online
that exist so that when someone needs

4888
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:27,920
that exist so that when someone needs
 

4889
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,510
that exist so that when someone needs
that explanation they can go to it

4890
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
that explanation they can go to it
 

4891
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,110
that explanation they can go to it
that the time in classroom is spent on

4892
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
that the time in classroom is spent on
 

4893
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,070
that the time in classroom is spent on
all of the parts of teaching and

4894
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
all of the parts of teaching and
 

4895
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,910
all of the parts of teaching and
education that aren't explanation which

4896
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920
education that aren't explanation which
 

4897
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,110
education that aren't explanation which
is most of it

4898
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
is most of it
 

4899
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,189
is most of it
right um and the way to get there is to

4900
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
right um and the way to get there is to
 

4901
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,390
right um and the way to get there is to
basically have more

4902
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:38,400
basically have more
 

4903
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,310
basically have more
people who are already explaining

4904
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
people who are already explaining
 

4905
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,229
people who are already explaining
publish their explanations and have it

4906
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:42,239
publish their explanations and have it
 

4907
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,750
publish their explanations and have it
in a publicized forum

4908
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
in a publicized forum
 

4909
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,910
in a publicized forum
so if during a pandemic you can have

4910
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
so if during a pandemic you can have
 

4911
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,510
so if during a pandemic you can have
people

4912
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
people
 

4913
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,110
people
automatically creating online content

4914
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
automatically creating online content
 

4915
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,550
automatically creating online content
because it has to be online

4916
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
because it has to be online
 

4917
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,870
because it has to be online
but getting in a habit of doing it in a

4918
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:52,880
but getting in a habit of doing it in a
 

4919
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,870
but getting in a habit of doing it in a
in a way that doesn't just feel like

4920
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:54,880
in a way that doesn't just feel like
 

4921
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,709
in a way that doesn't just feel like
a zoom call that happened to be recorded

4922
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
a zoom call that happened to be recorded
 

4923
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,110
a zoom call that happened to be recorded
but it actually feels like a

4924
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,120
but it actually feels like a
 

4925
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,950
but it actually feels like a
a piece that was always going to be

4926
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:00,960
a piece that was always going to be
 

4927
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,550
a piece that was always going to be
publicized to more people than just your

4928
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
publicized to more people than just your
 

4929
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,430
publicized to more people than just your
students

4930
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
students
 

4931
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,669
students
that can be really powerful and there's

4932
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
that can be really powerful and there's
 

4933
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,790
that can be really powerful and there's
an improvement process there like

4934
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:08,800
an improvement process there like
 

4935
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,950
an improvement process there like
so being self-critical and growing like

4936
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
so being self-critical and growing like
 

4937
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,149
so being self-critical and growing like
you know

4938
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
you know
 

4939
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,390
you know
like i guess youtubers go through this

4940
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
like i guess youtubers go through this
 

4941
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,070
like i guess youtubers go through this
process of like

4942
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:16,080
process of like
 

4943
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,270
process of like
putting out some content and like nobody

4944
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
putting out some content and like nobody
 

4945
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,189
putting out some content and like nobody
caring about it and then trying to

4946
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
caring about it and then trying to
 

4947
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,950
caring about it and then trying to
figure out like

4948
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:22,960
figure out like
 

4949
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,870
figure out like
basically improving figure out like why

4950
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
basically improving figure out like why
 

4951
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,630
basically improving figure out like why
did nobody care

4952
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
did nobody care
 

4953
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,110
did nobody care
uh uh what can i you know and they come

4954
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
uh uh what can i you know and they come
 

4955
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,790
uh uh what can i you know and they come
up with all kinds of answers which may

4956
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:30,800
up with all kinds of answers which may
 

4957
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,149
up with all kinds of answers which may
or may not be correct

4958
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:32,159
or may not be correct
 

4959
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,910
or may not be correct
but doesn't matter because the answer

4960
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:33,920
but doesn't matter because the answer
 

4961
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,350
but doesn't matter because the answer
leads to improvement

4962
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:35,360
leads to improvement
 

4963
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,270
leads to improvement
so you're being constantly self-critical

4964
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
so you're being constantly self-critical
 

4965
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,870
so you're being constantly self-critical
or self-analytical it should be

4966
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
or self-analytical it should be
 

4967
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,430
or self-analytical it should be
better to say so you think of like how

4968
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
better to say so you think of like how
 

4969
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,870
better to say so you think of like how
can i make the audio better

4970
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
can i make the audio better
 

4971
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,149
can i make the audio better
like all the basic things maybe one one

4972
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:46,159
like all the basic things maybe one one
 

4973
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:46,870
like all the basic things maybe one one
question to ask

4974
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
question to ask
 

4975
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,910
question to ask
because uh well by way of uh russ

4976

a big fan of yours uh he watched our

4984
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
a big fan of yours uh he watched our
 

4985
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,070
a big fan of yours uh he watched our
first conversation i just

4986
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
first conversation i just
 

4987
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,189
first conversation i just
interviewed him a couple weeks ago

4988
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
interviewed him a couple weeks ago
 

4989
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,350
interviewed him a couple weeks ago
he uh he teaches this course in

4990
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
he uh he teaches this course in
 

4991
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,030
he uh he teaches this course in
under-actuated robotics

4992
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
under-actuated robotics
 

4993
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,189
under-actuated robotics
which is um like robotic systems when

4994
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
which is um like robotic systems when
 

4995
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,430
which is um like robotic systems when
you can't control everything like

4996
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,440
you can't control everything like
 

4997
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,669
you can't control everything like
when you're like we as humans when we

4998
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
when you're like we as humans when we
 

4999
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:14,550
when you're like we as humans when we
walk we're

5000
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:14,560
walk we're
 

5001
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,950
walk we're
always falling forward which means like

5002
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
always falling forward which means like
 

5003
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,709
always falling forward which means like
it's gravity you can't control it you

5004
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
it's gravity you can't control it you
 

5005
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,229
it's gravity you can't control it you
just hope you can catch yourself but

5006
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:20,239
just hope you can catch yourself but
 

5007
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,669
just hope you can catch yourself but
that's not all guaranteed

5008
01:16:21,669 --> 01:16:21,679
that's not all guaranteed
 

5009
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,430
that's not all guaranteed
it depends on the surface so like that's

5010
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,440
it depends on the surface so like that's
 

5011
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,030
it depends on the surface so like that's
under-actuated you can't control

5012
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
under-actuated you can't control
 

5013
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,430
under-actuated you can't control
everything

5014
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
everything
 

5015
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,189
everything
all the the number of actuators uh

5016
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
all the the number of actuators uh
 

5017
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,630
all the the number of actuators uh
the degrees of freedoms you have is not

5018
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:30,640
the degrees of freedoms you have is not
 

5019
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,470
the degrees of freedoms you have is not
enough to fully control the system

5020
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
enough to fully control the system
 

5021
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,310
enough to fully control the system
so i don't know it's a really i think

5022
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
so i don't know it's a really i think
 

5023

that we're in that i also but
 

5077
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,830
that we're in that i also but
you basically just i have like a black

curtain whatever that you know makes it
 

5081
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:34,950
curtain whatever that you know makes it
really easy to set up a filming

5082
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:34,960
really easy to set up a filming
 

5083
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,149
really easy to set up a filming
situation with

5084
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
situation with
 

5085
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,350
situation with
cameras that we have here these

5086
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
cameras that we have here these
 

5087
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,189

microphones he was asking

5088
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
microphones he was asking
 

5089
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,470
microphones he was asking
you know what kind of equipment do you

5090
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,480
you know what kind of equipment do you
 

5091
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,310
you know what kind of equipment do you
recommend i guess like your

5092
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:42,320
recommend i guess like your
 

5093
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,390
recommend i guess like your
blog post is a good one i said i don't

5094
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
blog post is a good one i said i don't
 

5095
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,510
blog post is a good one i said i don't
recommend

5096
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:45,520
recommend
 

5097
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,590
recommend
this is excessive and actually really

5098
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
this is excessive and actually really
 

5099
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,790
this is excessive and actually really
hard to work with

5100
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
hard to work with
 

5101
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,470
hard to work with
so i i wonder i mean

5102
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
so i i wonder i mean
 

5103
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,750
so i i wonder i mean
is there something you would recommend

5104
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:53,760
is there something you would recommend
 

5105
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,910
is there something you would recommend
in terms of equipment like is

5106
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
in terms of equipment like is
 

5107
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,830
in terms of equipment like is
is it direct do you think like lapel

5108
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
is it direct do you think like lapel
 

5109
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,510
is it direct do you think like lapel
mics like usb

5110
01:17:59,510 --> 01:17:59,520
mics like usb
 

5111
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,669
mics like usb
mics what do you for my narration i use

5112
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
mics what do you for my narration i use
 

5113
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,510
mics what do you for my narration i use
a usb mic for the streams that used a

5114
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:03,520
a usb mic for the streams that used a
 

5115
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,390
a usb mic for the streams that used a
lapel mic

5116
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
lapel mic
 

5117
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,750
lapel mic
uh the narration it's a blue yeti um i'm

5118
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
uh the narration it's a blue yeti um i'm
 

5119
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,950
uh the narration it's a blue yeti um i'm
forgetting actually the name of the

5120
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:08,960
forgetting actually the name of the
 

5121
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,310
forgetting actually the name of the
lapel mic but it was

5122
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
lapel mic but it was
 

5123
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,070
lapel mic but it was
probably like a road of some kind um

5124
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
probably like a road of some kind um
 

5125
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,590
probably like a road of some kind um
but is it hard to figure out how to make

5126
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
but is it hard to figure out how to make
 

5127
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,350
but is it hard to figure out how to make
the audio sound good

5128
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:17,360
the audio sound good
 

5129
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,350
the audio sound good
oh i mean listen to all the early videos

5130

oh i mean listen to all the early videos
 

5131
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,550
oh i mean listen to all the early videos
on my channel and clearly

5132
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560
on my channel and clearly
 

5133
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,030
on my channel and clearly
like i'm terrible at this for for some

5134
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,040
like i'm terrible at this for for some
 

5135
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,990
like i'm terrible at this for for some
reason um

5136
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
reason um
 

5137
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,750

was mounted overhead
 

5165
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,910
was mounted overhead
over a piece of paper you could also use

01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
uh each of them like has a compressor
 

5185
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,110
uh each of them like has a compressor
object

5186
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
object
 

5187
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,510
object
that makes it such that the camera

5188
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
that makes it such that the camera
 

5189
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,189
that makes it such that the camera
output goes into the computer

5190
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
output goes into the computer
 

5191
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,950
output goes into the computer
usb but like gets compressed before it

5192
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
usb but like gets compressed before it
 

5193
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,910
usb but like gets compressed before it
does that the the live aspect of it

5194
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
does that the the live aspect of it
 

5195
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,830
does that the the live aspect of it
do you do you regret doing it live

5196
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
do you do you regret doing it live
 

5197
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,790
do you do you regret doing it live
not at all um i think i do think the

5198
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
not at all um i think i do think the
 

5199
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,830
not at all um i think i do think the
content might be like

5200
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
content might be like
 

5201
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,310
content might be like
much less sharp and tight than if it

5202
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,320
much less sharp and tight than if it
 

5203
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:26,950
much less sharp and tight than if it
were um

5204
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
were um
 

5205
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,550
were um
something even that i just recorded like

5206
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
something even that i just recorded like
 

5207
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,070
something even that i just recorded like
that and then edited later

5208
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080
that and then edited later
 

5209
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,470
that and then edited later
but i do like something that i do to be

5210
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
but i do like something that i do to be
 

5211
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,910
but i do like something that i do to be
out there to show like hey this is what

5212
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:33,920
out there to show like hey this is what
 

5213
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,189
out there to show like hey this is what
it's like raw this is what it's like

5214
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
it's like raw this is what it's like
 

5215
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,630
it's like raw this is what it's like
when i make mistakes

5216
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
when i make mistakes
 

5217
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,910
when i make mistakes
this is like the pace of thinking um i

5218
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:39,920
this is like the pace of thinking um i
 

5219
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,350
this is like the pace of thinking um i
like the live interaction of it i think

5220
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
like the live interaction of it i think
 

5221
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,590
like the live interaction of it i think
that made it better

5222
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
that made it better
 

5223
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,030
that made it better
i probably would do it on a different

5224
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
i probably would do it on a different
 

5225
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,709
i probably would do it on a different
channel i think if i did

5226
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
channel i think if i did
 

5227
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:47,910
channel i think if i did
series like that in the future just

5228
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
series like that in the future just
 

5229
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,430
series like that in the future just
because it's it's a different style it's

5230
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
because it's it's a different style it's
 

5231
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,430
because it's it's a different style it's
probably a different target audience and

5232
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
probably a different target audience and
 

5233
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,350
probably a different target audience and
kind of keep clean what three blue and

that will be one of those handfuls
 

5275
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,669
that will be one of those handfuls

anything even
 

5513
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,030
anything even
anywhere near that but then you have

5514
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
anywhere near that but then you have
 

5515
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,870

robotics is under actualized current
that's true so even if it's things that

5548
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:42,800
that's true so even if it's things that
 

5549
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,550
that's true so even if it's things that
you might think are niche

5550

i bet you'll be surprised by how many
people um

5554
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
people um
 

5555
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,270
people um
actually engage with it really deeply

5556
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,280
actually engage with it really deeply
 

5557
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,430

i think there's a there's a little bit

5564
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:56,800
i think there's a there's a little bit
 

5565
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,990
i think there's a there's a little bit
of a skill gap

5566
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:58,000
of a skill gap
 

5567
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,910
of a skill gap
but i think that could be overcome

5568
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
but i think that could be overcome
 

5569
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,030
but i think that could be overcome

when we start the first step i made was
 

5575
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,430
when we start the first step i made was
terrible in a number of respects like

but the thing i've noticed especially
 

5589
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,149
but the thing i've noticed especially
like with world experts

5590
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
like with world experts
 

5591
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,470

a good honest explanation of it that's
why there's uh

5664
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:28,719
why there's uh
 

5665
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,070
why there's uh
a lot of value in a channel like

5666
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,080
a lot of value in a channel like
 

5667
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,750
a lot of value in a channel like
numberphile where they basically trap

5668
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
numberphile where they basically trap
 

5669
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,669
numberphile where they basically trap
a really smart person and force them to

5670
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
a really smart person and force them to
 

5671
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,070
a really smart person and force them to

explain stuff on a broad sheet of paper
so but of course that's not scalable as

so but of course that's not scalable as
 

5675
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,590
so but of course that's not scalable as
a single channel

5676
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:41,600
a single channel
 

5677
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,430
a single channel

5679
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,709
if they if there's anything beautiful
that they could be done as

5680
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:44,719
that they could be done as
 

5681
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,110
that they could be done as
people take it in their own hands uh

5682

01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,790
50 years they're watching something else
which seems pretty likely

5936
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
which seems pretty likely
 

5937
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,110
which seems pretty likely
like it would be shocking if youtube

5938
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,120
like it would be shocking if youtube
 

5939
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,110
like it would be shocking if youtube
remained as popular as it is now

5940
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:05,120
remained as popular as it is now
 

5941
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,430
remained as popular as it is now
indefinitely into the future that's true

5942
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
indefinitely into the future that's true
 

5943
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,390
indefinitely into the future that's true
so uh

5944
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:08,400
so uh
 

5945
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,550
so uh
it won't be forever it makes me sad

5946
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:10,560
it won't be forever it makes me sad
 

5947
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,669
it won't be forever it makes me sad
still but

5948
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
still but
 

5949
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,070
still but
because it's such a nice it's like just

5950
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
because it's such a nice it's like just
 

5951
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:14,790
because it's such a nice it's like just
like you said

5952
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
like you said
 

5953
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,270
like you said
of the canonical videos sorry i don't

5954
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
of the canonical videos sorry i don't
 

5955
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,149
of the canonical videos sorry i don't
interrupt you know

5956
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:18,159
interrupt you know
 

5957
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,390
interrupt you know
you should get juan bennett on the uh on

5958
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,400
you should get juan bennett on the uh on
 

5959
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,669
you should get juan bennett on the uh on
the thing and then talk to him about

5960
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
the thing and then talk to him about
 

5961
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:22,390
the thing and then talk to him about
permanence

5962
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:22,400
permanence
 

5963
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,270
permanence
i think you would have a good

5964
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
i think you would have a good
 

5965
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,590
i think you would have a good
conversation who's that so he's the one

5966
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
conversation who's that so he's the one
 

5967
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,430
conversation who's that so he's the one
that founded this thing called ipfs that

5968
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:27,440
that founded this thing called ipfs that
 

5969
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:27,910
that founded this thing called ipfs that
i'm

5970
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
i'm
 

5971
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,229
i'm
talking about and if you have him talk

5972
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:30,239
talking about and if you have him talk
 

5973
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,830
talking about and if you have him talk
about basically what you're describing

5974
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:31,840
about basically what you're describing
 

5975
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,669
about basically what you're describing
like oh it's sad that this isn't forever

5976
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
like oh it's sad that this isn't forever
 

5977
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,350
like oh it's sad that this isn't forever
then you'll get some articulate

5978
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
then you'll get some articulate
 

5979
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,709
then you'll get some articulate
quantification around it

5980
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
quantification around it
 

5981
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:37,910
quantification around it
yeah that's like been pretty well

5982
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:37,920
yeah that's like been pretty well
 

5983
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,550
yeah that's like been pretty well
thought through uh but yeah i do see

5984
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
thought through uh but yeah i do see
 

5985
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,030
thought through uh but yeah i do see
youtube

5986
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,040
youtube
 

5987
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,669
youtube
just like you said as a as a place like

5988
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:43,679
just like you said as a as a place like
 

5989
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,510
just like you said as a as a place like
what your channel creates which is like

5990
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,520
what your channel creates which is like
 

5991
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,229
what your channel creates which is like
a set of canonical videos on a topic now

5992
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
a set of canonical videos on a topic now
 

5993
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,790
a set of canonical videos on a topic now
others could create

5994
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:50,800
others could create
 

5995
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,629
others could create
videos on that topic as well but as a

5996
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:52,639
videos on that topic as well but as a
 

5997
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,550
videos on that topic as well but as a
collection it creates

5998
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:54,560
collection it creates
 

5999
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,590
collection it creates
a nice set of places to go if you're

6000
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
a nice set of places to go if you're
 

6001
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,189
a nice set of places to go if you're
curious about a particular topic

6002
01:31:59,189 --> 01:31:59,199
curious about a particular topic
 

6003
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,750
curious about a particular topic
and it seems like coronavirus is a nice

6004
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
and it seems like coronavirus is a nice
 

6005
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,270
and it seems like coronavirus is a nice
opportunity to

6006
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,280
opportunity to
 

6007
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,470
opportunity to
put that knowledge out there in the

6008
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
put that knowledge out there in the
 

6009
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,430
put that knowledge out there in the
world at

6010
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:07,440
world at
 

6011
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,870
world at
mit and beyond i have to talk to you a

6012
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
mit and beyond i have to talk to you a
 

6013
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,070
mit and beyond i have to talk to you a
little bit about machine learning

6014
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,080
little bit about machine learning
 

6015
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,310
little bit about machine learning
deep learning and so on again we talked

6016
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,320
deep learning and so on again we talked
 

6017
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,149
deep learning and so on again we talked
about last time

6018
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
about last time
 

6019
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,830
about last time
you have a set of beautiful videos on

6020
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:17,840
you have a set of beautiful videos on
 

6021
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,070
you have a set of beautiful videos on
your networks

6022
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
your networks
 

6023
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:25,030
your networks
uh let me ask you first what is the

6024
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
uh let me ask you first what is the
 

6025
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,750
uh let me ask you first what is the
most beautiful aspect of neural networks

6026
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:27,760
most beautiful aspect of neural networks
 

6027
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,950
most beautiful aspect of neural networks
and machine learning to you like

6028
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:30,960
and machine learning to you like
 

6029
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,510
and machine learning to you like
for making those videos from watching

6030
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:33,520
for making those videos from watching
 

6031
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,189
for making those videos from watching
how the field is evolving

6032
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199
how the field is evolving
 

6033
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:39,030
how the field is evolving
is there something mathematically

6034
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
is there something mathematically
 

6035
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,030
is there something mathematically
or an applied sense just beautiful to

6036
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
or an applied sense just beautiful to
 

6037
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,350
or an applied sense just beautiful to
you about them

6038
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
you about them
 

6039
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,950
you about them
well i think what i would go to is the

6040
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:44,960
well i think what i would go to is the
 

6041
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,790
well i think what i would go to is the
layered structure and how

6042
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
layered structure and how
 

6043
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,470
layered structure and how
um you can have what feel like

6044
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:48,480
um you can have what feel like
 

6045
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,310
um you can have what feel like
qualitatively distinct things happening

6046
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
qualitatively distinct things happening
 

6047
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,390
qualitatively distinct things happening
going from one layer to another

6048
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
going from one layer to another
 

6049
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,390
going from one layer to another
but that are um following the same

6050
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
but that are um following the same
 

6051
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,910
but that are um following the same
mathematical rule because you look at it

6052
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:55,920
mathematical rule because you look at it
 

6053
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,189
mathematical rule because you look at it
as a piece of math it's like

6054
01:32:57,189 --> 01:32:57,199
as a piece of math it's like
 

6055
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,870
as a piece of math it's like
you got a non-linearity and then you've

6056
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
you got a non-linearity and then you've
 

6057
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,629
you got a non-linearity and then you've
got a matrix multiplication that's

6058
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
got a matrix multiplication that's
 

6059
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,229
got a matrix multiplication that's
what's happening on all the layers

6060
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:02,239
what's happening on all the layers
 

6061
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,790
what's happening on all the layers
um but especially if you look at like

6062
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:04,800
um but especially if you look at like
 

6063
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,310
um but especially if you look at like
some of the visualizations that

6064
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:06,320
some of the visualizations that
 

6065
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,990
some of the visualizations that
like chris ola has done with respect to

6066
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
like chris ola has done with respect to
 

6067
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,350
like chris ola has done with respect to
like convolutional nets that have been

6068
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,360
like convolutional nets that have been
 

6069
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,030
like convolutional nets that have been
trained on imagenet trying to say what

6070
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
trained on imagenet trying to say what
 

6071
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,110
trained on imagenet trying to say what
does this neuron do what do this

6072
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,120
does this neuron do what do this
 

6073
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,510
does this neuron do what do this
does this family of neurons do what you

6074
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
does this family of neurons do what you
 

6075
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,950
does this family of neurons do what you
can see is that

6076
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:18,960
can see is that
 

6077
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,350
can see is that
the ones closer to the input side are

6078
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
the ones closer to the input side are
 

6079
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,110
the ones closer to the input side are
picking up on very low level ideas like

6080
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:23,120
picking up on very low level ideas like
 

6081
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,990
picking up on very low level ideas like
the texture

6082
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
the texture
 

6083
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,590
the texture
right and then as you get further back

6084
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,600
right and then as you get further back
 

6085
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,189
right and then as you get further back
you have higher level ideas like what is

6086
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:27,199
you have higher level ideas like what is
 

6087
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:27,590
you have higher level ideas like what is
the

6088
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
the
 

6089
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,510
the
where the eyes in this picture and then

6090
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:29,520
where the eyes in this picture and then
 

6091
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,870
where the eyes in this picture and then
how do the eyes form like

6092
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:30,880
how do the eyes form like
 

6093
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,629
how do the eyes form like
an animal is this animal a cat or a dog

6094
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
an animal is this animal a cat or a dog
 

6095
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,950
an animal is this animal a cat or a dog
or a deer you have this

6096
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:34,960
or a deer you have this
 

6097
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,550
or a deer you have this
series of qualitatively different things

6098
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
series of qualitatively different things
 

6099
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,750
series of qualitatively different things
happening even though it's the same

6100
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:37,760
happening even though it's the same
 

6101
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,510
happening even though it's the same
piece of math on each one

6102
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:39,520
piece of math on each one
 

6103
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,110
piece of math on each one
so that's a pretty beautiful idea that

6104
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
so that's a pretty beautiful idea that
 

6105
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,270
so that's a pretty beautiful idea that
you can have like a generalizable

6106
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
you can have like a generalizable
 

6107
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,470
you can have like a generalizable
object that runs through the layers of

6108
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
object that runs through the layers of
 

6109
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,510
object that runs through the layers of
abstraction

6110
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,520
abstraction
 

6111
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,350
abstraction
which in some sense constitute

6112
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360
which in some sense constitute
 

6113
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,270
which in some sense constitute
intelligence as having

6114
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,280
intelligence as having
 

6115
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,350
intelligence as having
um those many different layers of an

6116
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
um those many different layers of an
 

6117
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,030
um those many different layers of an
understanding to something yeah form

6118
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
understanding to something yeah form
 

6119
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,390
understanding to something yeah form
abstractions in a

6120
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
abstractions in a
 

6121
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,950
abstractions in a
automated way exactly it's automated

6122
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:58,960
automated way exactly it's automated
 

6123
01:33:58,960 --> 01:33:59,669
automated way exactly it's automated
abstracting

6124
01:33:59,669 --> 01:33:59,679
abstracting
 

6125
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:01,510
abstracting
which i mean that just feels very

6126
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
which i mean that just feels very
 

6127
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,790
which i mean that just feels very
powerful

6128
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,800
powerful
 

6129
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,950
powerful
and the idea that it can be so simply

6130
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:04,960
and the idea that it can be so simply
 

6131
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,709
and the idea that it can be so simply
mathematically represented i mean a ton

6132
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:06,719
mathematically represented i mean a ton
 

6133
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:06,950
mathematically represented i mean a ton
of

6134
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
of
 

6135
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,550
of
like modern email research seems a

6136
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,560
like modern email research seems a
 

6137
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,229
like modern email research seems a
little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc

6138
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:10,239
little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc
 

6139
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:10,629
little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc
things

6140
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
things
 

6141
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:11,990
things
then you decide which one worked and

6142
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:12,000
then you decide which one worked and
 

6143
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,830
then you decide which one worked and
then you retrospectively come up with

6144
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:13,840
then you retrospectively come up with
 

6145
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,270
then you retrospectively come up with
the mathematical reason that it always

6146
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:15,280
the mathematical reason that it always
 

6147
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,149
the mathematical reason that it always
had to work

6148
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
had to work
 

6149
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,229
had to work
um but you know who cares how you came

6150
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:18,239
um but you know who cares how you came
 

6151
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,510
um but you know who cares how you came
to it when you have like that elegant

6152
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
to it when you have like that elegant
 

6153
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,390
to it when you have like that elegant
piece of math

6154
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400
piece of math
 

6155
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,430
piece of math
uh it's hard not to just smile seeing it

6156
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:23,440
uh it's hard not to just smile seeing it
 

6157
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,590
uh it's hard not to just smile seeing it
work in action well and when you talked

6158
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,600
work in action well and when you talked
 

6159
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,870
work in action well and when you talked
about topology before

6160
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:26,880
about topology before
 

6161
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,470
about topology before
one of the really interesting things is

6162
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
one of the really interesting things is
 

6163
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,229
one of the really interesting things is
it's beginning to be investigated under

6164
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
it's beginning to be investigated under
 

6165
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,669
it's beginning to be investigated under
kind of the field of like science and

6166
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:33,679
kind of the field of like science and
 

6167
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:36,149
kind of the field of like science and
deep learning which is like

6168
01:34:36,149 --> 01:34:36,159
deep learning which is like
 

6169
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:39,270
deep learning which is like
the craziness of the surface

6170
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,280
the craziness of the surface
 

6171
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,709
the craziness of the surface
that uh is trying to be optimized uh

6172
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:42,719
that uh is trying to be optimized uh
 

6173
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:45,189
that uh is trying to be optimized uh
in neural networks i mean the the amount

6174
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
in neural networks i mean the the amount
 

6175
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,390
in neural networks i mean the the amount
of local

6176

of local
 

6177
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,189
of local
minima local optima there is in these

6178
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
minima local optima there is in these
 

6179
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,149

surfaces
 

6181
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,270
surfaces
and somehow a dumb gradient descent

6182
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:53,280
and somehow a dumb gradient descent
 

6183
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,870
and somehow a dumb gradient descent
algorithm is able to find really good

6184
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
algorithm is able to find really good
 

6185
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,709
algorithm is able to find really good
solutions that's like

6186
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
solutions that's like
 

6187
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,830
solutions that's like
that's really surprising well so on the

6188
01:34:59,830 --> 01:34:59,840
that's really surprising well so on the
 

6189
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,390
that's really surprising well so on the
one hand it is but also it's like not

6190
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
one hand it is but also it's like not
 

6191
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,310
one hand it is but also it's like not
it's not terribly surprising that you

6192
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:04,320
it's not terribly surprising that you
 

6193
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,310
it's not terribly surprising that you
have these interesting points that exist

6194
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
have these interesting points that exist
 

6195
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,750
have these interesting points that exist
when you make your space so high

6196
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:07,760
when you make your space so high
 

6197
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,070
when you make your space so high
dimensional like gpt3 what did it have

6198
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:10,080
dimensional like gpt3 what did it have
 

6199
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,470
dimensional like gpt3 what did it have
175 billion parameters

6200
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
175 billion parameters
 

6201
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:16,149
175 billion parameters
so it it doesn't feel as

6202
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
so it it doesn't feel as
 

6203
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,590
so it it doesn't feel as
mesmerizing to think about oh there's

6204
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,600
mesmerizing to think about oh there's
 

6205
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,270
mesmerizing to think about oh there's
some surface of

6206
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
some surface of
 

6207
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,790
some surface of
intelligent behavior in this crazy

6208
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:20,800
intelligent behavior in this crazy
 

6209
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,070
intelligent behavior in this crazy
high-dimensional space it's like there's

6210
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080
high-dimensional space it's like there's
 

6211
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,830
high-dimensional space it's like there's
so many parameters that of course

6212
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
so many parameters that of course
 

6213
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,590
so many parameters that of course
but what's more interesting is like how

6214
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,600
but what's more interesting is like how
 

6215
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,550
but what's more interesting is like how
how is it that you're able to

6216
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
how is it that you're able to
 

6217
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,669
how is it that you're able to
efficiently get there

6218
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
efficiently get there
 

6219
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:28,870
efficiently get there
which is maybe what you're describing

6220
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:28,880
which is maybe what you're describing
 

6221
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,629
which is maybe what you're describing
that something as dumb as gradient

6222
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
that something as dumb as gradient
 

6223
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:31,350
that something as dumb as gradient
descent

6224
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:31,360
descent
 

6225
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,709
descent
does it but like the re the reason the

6226
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
does it but like the re the reason the
 

6227
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,229
does it but like the re the reason the
gradient descent works well

6228
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
gradient descent works well
 

6229
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,830
gradient descent works well
with neural networks and not just you

6230
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840
with neural networks and not just you
 

6231
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,870
with neural networks and not just you
know choose however you want to

6232
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
know choose however you want to
 

6233
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,310
know choose however you want to
parameterize the space and then like

6234
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
parameterize the space and then like
 

6235
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,669
parameterize the space and then like
apply gradient descent to it

6236
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:41,679
apply gradient descent to it
 

6237
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,350
apply gradient descent to it
is that that layered structure lets you

6238
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,360
is that that layered structure lets you
 

6239
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,950
is that that layered structure lets you
decompose the derivative in a way that

6240
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
decompose the derivative in a way that
 

6241
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,950
decompose the derivative in a way that
makes it computationally feasible

6242
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
makes it computationally feasible
 

6243
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,149
makes it computationally feasible
um yeah it's just that that there's so

6244
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
um yeah it's just that that there's so
 

6245
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,510
um yeah it's just that that there's so
many good solutions

6246
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
many good solutions
 

6247
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,709
many good solutions
probably infinitely infinitely many

6248
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
probably infinitely infinitely many
 

6249
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,709
probably infinitely infinitely many
good solutions not best solutions but

6250
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:56,719
good solutions not best solutions but
 

6251
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:58,470
good solutions not best solutions but
good solutions

6252
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
good solutions
 

6253
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,709
good solutions
that's that's what's interesting it's

6254
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:00,719
that's that's what's interesting it's
 

6255
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,070
that's that's what's interesting it's
similar to uh

6256
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,080
similar to uh
 

6257
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,350
similar to uh
stephen wolfram has this idea of like

6258
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360
stephen wolfram has this idea of like
 

6259
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,590
stephen wolfram has this idea of like
the if you just look at all space of

6260
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:07,600
the if you just look at all space of
 

6261
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,870
the if you just look at all space of
computations

6262
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
computations
 

6263
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,590
computations
of all space of basically algorithms

6264
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,600
of all space of basically algorithms
 

6265
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,350
of all space of basically algorithms
that you'd be surprised how many of them

6266
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:13,360
that you'd be surprised how many of them
 

6267
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,510
that you'd be surprised how many of them
are actually intelligent

6268
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
are actually intelligent
 

6269
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,270
are actually intelligent
like if you just randomly pick from the

6270
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:17,280
like if you just randomly pick from the
 

6271
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,790
like if you just randomly pick from the
bucket

6272
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:18,800
bucket
 

6273
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,030
bucket
that's surprising we tend to think like

6274
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:21,040
that's surprising we tend to think like
 

6275
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,830
that's surprising we tend to think like
a tiny tiny minority of them would be

6276
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:23,840
a tiny tiny minority of them would be
 

6277
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,510
a tiny tiny minority of them would be
intelligent but his sense is like

6278
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
intelligent but his sense is like
 

6279
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,550
intelligent but his sense is like
it seems weirdly easy to find

6280
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:30,560
it seems weirdly easy to find
 

6281
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,830
it seems weirdly easy to find
computations that do something

6282
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
computations that do something
 

6283
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,669
computations that do something
interesting well okay so

6284
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:33,679
interesting well okay so
 

6285
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,950
interesting well okay so
that from like a common gore kolmogorov

6286
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:36,960

6289
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,750

01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,910
almost everything will be interesting
what's fascinating is to find the stuff

01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:41,920
what's fascinating is to find the stuff
 

6293
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,229
what's fascinating is to find the stuff
that's

01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
that's
 

6295
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,910
that's
describable with low information but

6296
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:43,920
describable with low information but
 

6297
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,590
describable with low information but
still does interesting things

6298
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:45,600
still does interesting things
 

6299
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,669

uh like one fun example of this you know

6300
01:36:47,669 --> 01:36:47,679
uh like one fun example of this you know

01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:55,440
that basically says if you know i want
 

6309
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,790
that basically says if you know i want

uh maybe uh some of them are gonna get

6312
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
uh maybe uh some of them are gonna get
 

6313
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,870
uh maybe uh some of them are gonna get
flipped uh there's some noise along the

01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:04,000
i can come up with some way of coding it
 

6319
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,750
i can come up with some way of coding it
that's resilient to that noise

6320
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:05,760
that's resilient to that noise
 

6321
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,149
that's resilient to that noise
that's very good um and then he

6322
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
that's very good um and then he
 

6323
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,590
that's very good um and then he
quantitatively describes how very good

6324
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:09,600
quantitatively describes how very good
 

6325
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,070
quantitatively describes how very good
is

6326
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
is
 

6327
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,830
is
what's funny about how he proves the

6328
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:11,840
what's funny about how he proves the
 

6329
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,709
what's funny about how he proves the
existence of good error correction codes

6330
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
existence of good error correction codes
 

6331
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,229
existence of good error correction codes
is rather than saying like here's how to

6332
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,239
is rather than saying like here's how to
 

6333
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,629
is rather than saying like here's how to
construct it or even like a sensible

6334
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:18,639
construct it or even like a sensible
 

6335
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,470
construct it or even like a sensible
non-constructive proof the nature of his

6337
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,550
non-constructive proof the nature of his
non-constructive proof is to say

6338
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
non-constructive proof is to say
 

6339
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,189
non-constructive proof is to say
um if we chose a random encoding it

6340
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:25,199
um if we chose a random encoding it
 

6341
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:25,910
um if we chose a random encoding it
would be

6342
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:25,920
would be
 

6343
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,310
would be
almost at the limit which is weird

6344
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
almost at the limit which is weird
 

6345
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,189
almost at the limit which is weird
because then it took

6346
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:29,199
because then it took
 

6347
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,950
because then it took
decades for people to actually find any

6348
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:30,960
decades for people to actually find any
 

6349
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,790
decades for people to actually find any
that were anywhere close to the limit

6350
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
that were anywhere close to the limit
 

6351
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,470
that were anywhere close to the limit
and what his proof was saying is choose

6352
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:34,480
and what his proof was saying is choose
 

6353
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,550
and what his proof was saying is choose
a random one and it's like

6354
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:36,560
a random one and it's like
 

6355
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,990
a random one and it's like
the best kind of encoding you'll ever

the best kind of encoding you'll ever
 

6357
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,709
the best kind of encoding you'll ever
find but what's

6358
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
find but what's
 

6359
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,950
find but what's
what that tells us is that sometimes

6360
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
what that tells us is that sometimes
 

6361
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,310
what that tells us is that sometimes
when you choose a random element from

6362
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:44,320
when you choose a random element from
 

6363
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,149
when you choose a random element from
this ungodly huge set

6364
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:46,159
this ungodly huge set
 

6365
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,590
this ungodly huge set
that's a very different task from

6366
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:47,600
that's a very different task from
 

6367
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,109
that's a very different task from
finding an efficient way to actively

6368
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:49,119
finding an efficient way to actively
 

6369
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:49,750
finding an efficient way to actively
describe it

6370
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:49,760
describe it
 

6371
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,109
describe it
because in that case the random element

6372
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
because in that case the random element
 

6373
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,470
because in that case the random element
to actually implement it as a bit of

6374
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
to actually implement it as a bit of
 

6375
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,990
to actually implement it as a bit of
code you would just have this huge

6376
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
code you would just have this huge
 

6377
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,790
code you would just have this huge
table of like um telling you how to

6378
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
table of like um telling you how to
 

6379
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,229
table of like um telling you how to
encode one thing into another that's

6380
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
encode one thing into another that's
 

6381
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,310
encode one thing into another that's
totally computationally infeasible

6382
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
totally computationally infeasible
 

6383
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,109
totally computationally infeasible
so on the side of like how many possible

6384
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:03,119
so on the side of like how many possible
 

6385
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:04,310
so on the side of like how many possible
programs are interesting

6386
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:04,320
programs are interesting
 

6387
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,390
programs are interesting
in some way it's like yeah all tons of

6388
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:06,400
in some way it's like yeah all tons of
 

6389
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,669
in some way it's like yeah all tons of
them but the much

6390
01:38:07,669 --> 01:38:07,679
them but the much
 

6391
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,310
them but the much
much more delicate question is when you

6392
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320
much more delicate question is when you
 

6393
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,910
much more delicate question is when you
can have a low information description

6394
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:11,920
can have a low information description
 

6395
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,270
can have a low information description
of something that still becomes

6396
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
of something that still becomes
 

6397
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,590
of something that still becomes
interesting and thereby that kind of

6398
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
interesting and thereby that kind of
 

6399
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,870
interesting and thereby that kind of
gives you a blueprint for how to

6400
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:16,880
gives you a blueprint for how to
 

6401
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,390
gives you a blueprint for how to
engineer that kind of thing

6402
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,400
engineer that kind of thing
 

6403
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,550
engineer that kind of thing
right yeah chaos theory is another good

6404
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
right yeah chaos theory is another good
 

6405
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,750
right yeah chaos theory is another good
instance there where it's like

6406
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:21,760
instance there where it's like
 

6407
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,030
instance there where it's like
yeah a ton of things are hard to

6408
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,040
yeah a ton of things are hard to
 

6409
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,629
yeah a ton of things are hard to
describe but how do you have ones that

6410
01:38:24,629 --> 01:38:24,639
describe but how do you have ones that
 

6411
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,910
describe but how do you have ones that
have a simple set of

6412
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
have a simple set of
 

6413
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,390
have a simple set of
governing equations that remain like

6414
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
governing equations that remain like
 

6415
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,470
governing equations that remain like
arbitrarily hard to describe

6416
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
arbitrarily hard to describe
 

6417
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,229
arbitrarily hard to describe
well let me ask you uh you mentioned

6418
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
well let me ask you uh you mentioned
 

6419
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,109
well let me ask you uh you mentioned
gpt3 it's interesting to ask

6420
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:35,119
gpt3 it's interesting to ask
 

6421
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,830
gpt3 it's interesting to ask
uh what are your thoughts about the

6422
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
uh what are your thoughts about the
 

6423
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,870
uh what are your thoughts about the
recently

6424
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
recently
 

6425
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,550
recently
released openai gbt3 model that i

6426
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:42,560
released openai gbt3 model that i
 

6427
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,629
released openai gbt3 model that i
believe is already trying to learn

6428
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:44,639
believe is already trying to learn
 

6429

how to communicate like grant sanderson

6430
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
how to communicate like grant sanderson
 

6431
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,070
how to communicate like grant sanderson
you know i think

6432
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:48,080
you know i think
 

6433
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,669
you know i think
i got an email a day or two ago about

6434
01:38:49,669 --> 01:38:49,679
i got an email a day or two ago about
 

6435
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,270
i got an email a day or two ago about
someone who wanted to um

6436
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
someone who wanted to um
 

6437
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,149
someone who wanted to um
try to use gpd3 with manum where you

6438
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:54,159
try to use gpd3 with manum where you
 

6439
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:55,030
try to use gpd3 with manum where you
would like give it

6440
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
would like give it
 

6441
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,270
would like give it
a high-level description of something

6442
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,280
a high-level description of something
 

6443
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,790
a high-level description of something
and then it'll like automatically create

6444
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
and then it'll like automatically create
 

6445
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,470
and then it'll like automatically create
the mathematical animation

6446
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,480
the mathematical animation
 

6447
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,030
the mathematical animation
like trying to put me out of a job here

6448
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040

 

6449
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,950

i mean it probably won't put you out of

6450
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:06,960
i mean it probably won't put you out of
 

6451
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,070
i mean it probably won't put you out of
a job but it'll create something

6452
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,080
a job but it'll create something
 

6453
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,750
a job but it'll create something
visually beautiful for sure

6454
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,760
visually beautiful for sure
 

6455
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,510
visually beautiful for sure
i would be surprised if that worked as

6456
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:11,520
i would be surprised if that worked as
 

6457
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,030
i would be surprised if that worked as
stated but maybe there's like

6458
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:13,040
stated but maybe there's like
 

6459
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,990
stated but maybe there's like
variants of it like that you can get to

6460
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,000
variants of it like that you can get to
 

6461
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,390
variants of it like that you can get to
um

6462
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
um
 

6463
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,910
um
i mean like a lot of those demos it's

6464
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
i mean like a lot of those demos it's
 

6465
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,990
i mean like a lot of those demos it's
interesting i think

6466
01:39:19,990 --> 01:39:20,000
interesting i think
 

6467
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,669
interesting i think
uh there's a lot of failed experiments

6468
01:39:23,669 --> 01:39:23,679
uh there's a lot of failed experiments
 

6469
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,350
uh there's a lot of failed experiments
like depending on how you prime the

6470
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,360
like depending on how you prime the
 

6471
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,070
like depending on how you prime the
thing

6472
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
thing
 

6473
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,750
thing
you're going to have a lot of failed i'm

6474
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
you're going to have a lot of failed i'm
 

6475
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,990
you're going to have a lot of failed i'm
certainly with code no program synthesis

6476
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
certainly with code no program synthesis
 

6477
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,189
certainly with code no program synthesis
most of it won't even run but eventually

6478
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:33,199
most of it won't even run but eventually
 

6479
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:33,990
most of it won't even run but eventually
i think if you

6480
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,000
i think if you
 

6481
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,870
i think if you
if you're if you pick the right examples

6482
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:36,880
if you're if you pick the right examples
 

6483
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,070
if you're if you pick the right examples
you'll be able to generate something

6484
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:38,080
you'll be able to generate something
 

6485
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,550
you'll be able to generate something
cool

6486
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:38,560
cool
 

6487
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,390
cool
and i think even that's good enough even

6488
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,400
and i think even that's good enough even
 

6489
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,830
and i think even that's good enough even
though if if it's if

6490
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:41,840
though if if it's if
 

6491
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,750
though if if it's if
you're being very selective it's still

6492
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
you're being very selective it's still
 

6493
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,149
you're being very selective it's still
cool that something can be generated

6494
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,159
cool that something can be generated
 

6495
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,790
cool that something can be generated
yeah that that's huge value um i mean

6496
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800
yeah that that's huge value um i mean
 

6497
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,470
yeah that that's huge value um i mean
think of the writing process sometimes a

6498
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,480
think of the writing process sometimes a
 

6499
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,669
think of the writing process sometimes a
big part of it is just getting a bunch

6500
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:51,679
big part of it is just getting a bunch
 

6501
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:53,030
big part of it is just getting a bunch
of stuff on the page and then you can

6502
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
of stuff on the page and then you can
 

6503
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,709
of stuff on the page and then you can
decide what to whittle down to

6504
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:54,719
decide what to whittle down to
 

6505
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,709
decide what to whittle down to
so if it can be used in like a

6506
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:56,719
so if it can be used in like a
 

6507
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,310
so if it can be used in like a
man-machine symbiosis where

6508
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
man-machine symbiosis where
 

6509
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,629
man-machine symbiosis where
it's just giving you a spew of potential

6510
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
it's just giving you a spew of potential
 

6511
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,790
it's just giving you a spew of potential
ideas that then you can refine down

6512
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:02,800
ideas that then you can refine down
 

6513
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,030
ideas that then you can refine down
um like it's serving as the generator

6514
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
um like it's serving as the generator
 

6515
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,030
um like it's serving as the generator
and then the human serves as the refiner

6516
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:07,040
and then the human serves as the refiner
 

6517
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,709
and then the human serves as the refiner
that seems like a pretty powerful

6518
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:08,719
that seems like a pretty powerful
 

6519
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,070
that seems like a pretty powerful
dynamic

6520
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
dynamic
 

6521
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,669
dynamic
yeah have you uh have you gotten a

6522
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:11,679
yeah have you uh have you gotten a
 

6523
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,350
yeah have you uh have you gotten a
chance to see any of the demos like on

6524
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,360
chance to see any of the demos like on
 

6525

called a cappella science he was

6534
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:22,159
called a cappella science he was
 

6535
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,990

like tweeting a bunch about playing with

6536
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
like tweeting a bunch about playing with
 

6537
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,669
like tweeting a bunch about playing with
it um and

6538
01:40:25,669 --> 01:40:25,679
it um and
 

6539
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,229
it um and
so he so gpt3 was trained on um the

6540
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:28,239
so he so gpt3 was trained on um the
 

6541
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:29,430
so he so gpt3 was trained on um the
internet from

6542
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
internet from
 

6543
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,910
internet from
before kovid so so in a sense it doesn't

6544
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:31,920
before kovid so so in a sense it doesn't
 

6545
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,430
before kovid so so in a sense it doesn't
know about the coronavirus

6546
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,440
know about the coronavirus
 

6547
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,950
know about the coronavirus
so what he seeded it with was just a

6548
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
so what he seeded it with was just a
 

6549
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,189
so what he seeded it with was just a

which of course it would because it's
 

6579
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,750
which of course it would because it's
trained on like the internet

6580
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:01,760
trained on like the internet
 

6581
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,109
trained on like the internet
zombie stories but what you see

6582
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:03,119
zombie stories but what you see
 

6583
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,870
zombie stories but what you see
unfolding is a description of

6584
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:04,880
unfolding is a description of
 

6585
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,070
unfolding is a description of
covet 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse

6586
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,080
covet 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse
 

6587
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,910
covet 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse
and like the early aspects of it are

6588
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:09,920
and like the early aspects of it are
 

6589
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,109
and like the early aspects of it are
kind of shockingly

6590
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
kind of shockingly
 

6591
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:12,870
kind of shockingly
in line with what's reasonable and then

6592
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:12,880
in line with what's reasonable and then
 

6593
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,709
in line with what's reasonable and then
it gets out of hand so quickly

6594
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:14,719
it gets out of hand so quickly
 

6595
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,870
it gets out of hand so quickly
and the other flip side of that is uh i

6596
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
and the other flip side of that is uh i
 

6597
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,390
and the other flip side of that is uh i
wouldn't be surprised

6598
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
wouldn't be surprised
 

6599
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,149
wouldn't be surprised
if it's on to something at some point

6600
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:20,159
if it's on to something at some point
 

6601
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,790
if it's on to something at some point
here when you know 2020

6602
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:22,800
here when you know 2020
 

6603
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,030
here when you know 2020
has been full of surprises who knows

6604
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
has been full of surprises who knows
 

6605
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:25,830
has been full of surprises who knows
like we might

6606
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:25,840
like we might
 

6607
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,310
like we might
i'll be in like this crazy militarized

6608
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
i'll be in like this crazy militarized
 

6609
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:28,950
i'll be in like this crazy militarized
zone

6610
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:28,960
zone
 

6611
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,350

as it predicts just a couple months off

6612
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:31,360
as it predicts just a couple months off
 

6613
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,390
as it predicts just a couple months off
yeah i think is

6614
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:32,400
yeah i think is
 

6615
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,709
yeah i think is
this definitely an interesting tool of

6616
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:34,719
this definitely an interesting tool of
 

6617
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:35,990
this definitely an interesting tool of
storytelling

6618
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
storytelling
 

6619
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,750
storytelling
it has struggled with mathematics which

6620
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
it has struggled with mathematics which
 

6621
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,550
it has struggled with mathematics which
is interesting or in just even numbers

6622
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
is interesting or in just even numbers
 

6623
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,709
is interesting or in just even numbers
it's able to it's not able to generate

6624
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
it's able to it's not able to generate
 

6625
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,070
it's able to it's not able to generate
like

6626
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:44,080
like
 

6627
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,390
like
patterns you know like you give it um

6628
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,400
patterns you know like you give it um
 

6629
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,109
patterns you know like you give it um
in like five digit numbers and it's not

6630
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
in like five digit numbers and it's not
 

6631
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,629
in like five digit numbers and it's not
able to figure out the sequence

6632
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
able to figure out the sequence
 

6633
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,390
able to figure out the sequence
you know or like uh i didn't look in

6634
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
you know or like uh i didn't look in
 

6635
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,669
you know or like uh i didn't look in
too much but i'm talking about like

6636
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:57,679
too much but i'm talking about like
 

6637
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,590
too much but i'm talking about like
sequences like the fibonacci

6638
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
sequences like the fibonacci
 

6639
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,990
sequences like the fibonacci
numbers and to see how far it can go

6640
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,000
numbers and to see how far it can go
 

6641
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,430
numbers and to see how far it can go
because obviously it's leveraging stuff

6642
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:03,440
because obviously it's leveraging stuff
 

6643
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,229
because obviously it's leveraging stuff
from the internet

6644
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:04,239
from the internet
 

6645
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,070
from the internet
and it starts to lose it but it is also

6646
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,080
and it starts to lose it but it is also
 

6647
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,830
and it starts to lose it but it is also
cool that i've seen it

6648
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:07,840
cool that i've seen it
 

6649
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,430
cool that i've seen it
able to generate some interesting

6650
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
able to generate some interesting
 

6651
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,430
able to generate some interesting
patterns um that are mathematically

6652
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440
patterns um that are mathematically
 

6653
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,390
patterns um that are mathematically
correct

6654
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:12,400
correct
 

6655
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,350
correct
yeah i i honestly haven't dug into like

6656
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
yeah i i honestly haven't dug into like
 

6657
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,109
yeah i i honestly haven't dug into like
what's going on within it

6658
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:17,119
what's going on within it
 

6659
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,470
what's going on within it
uh in a way that i can speak

6660
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:18,480
uh in a way that i can speak
 

6661
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,470
uh in a way that i can speak
intelligently to

6662
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:20,480
intelligently to
 

6663
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,390
intelligently to
i guess it doesn't surprise me that it's

6664
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,400
i guess it doesn't surprise me that it's
 

6665
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,189
i guess it doesn't surprise me that it's
bad at numerical patterns because

6666
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
bad at numerical patterns because
 

6667
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,550
bad at numerical patterns because
i mean maybe i should be more impressed

6668
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,560
i mean maybe i should be more impressed
 

6669
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,189
i mean maybe i should be more impressed
with it but like that requires having

6670
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:29,199
with it but like that requires having
 

6671
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,229
with it but like that requires having
um a weird combination of intuitive

6672
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
um a weird combination of intuitive
 

6673
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:35,350
um a weird combination of intuitive
and uh and formulaic worldview

6674
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
and uh and formulaic worldview
 

6675
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,550
and uh and formulaic worldview
so you're not just going off of

6676
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
so you're not just going off of
 

6677
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,229
so you're not just going off of
intuition when you see fibonacci numbers

6678
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:38,239
intuition when you see fibonacci numbers
 

6679
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:39,510
intuition when you see fibonacci numbers
you're not saying like intuitively what

6680
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:39,520
you're not saying like intuitively what
 

6681
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,109
you're not saying like intuitively what
do i think will follow the 13.

6682
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
do i think will follow the 13.
 

6683
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,950
do i think will follow the 13.
like i've seen patterns a lot where like

6684
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
like i've seen patterns a lot where like
 

6685
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,030
like i've seen patterns a lot where like
13s are followed by 21s

6686
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
13s are followed by 21s
 

6687
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,870
13s are followed by 21s
instead it's the like the way you're

6688
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:46,880
instead it's the like the way you're
 

6689
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,629
instead it's the like the way you're
starting to see a shape of things

6690
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:48,639
starting to see a shape of things
 

6691
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,950
starting to see a shape of things
is by knowing what hypotheses to test

6692
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:50,960
is by knowing what hypotheses to test
 

6693
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,669
is by knowing what hypotheses to test
where you're

6694
01:42:51,669 --> 01:42:51,679
where you're
 

6695
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,270
where you're
saying oh maybe it's generated based on

6696
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,280
saying oh maybe it's generated based on
 

6697
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,550
saying oh maybe it's generated based on
the previous terms or maybe it's

6698
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
the previous terms or maybe it's
 

6699
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,990
the previous terms or maybe it's
generated based on like multiplying by

6700
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
generated based on like multiplying by
 

6701
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,750
generated based on like multiplying by
a constant or whatever it is you like

6702
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:57,760
a constant or whatever it is you like
 

6703
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,430
a constant or whatever it is you like
have a bunch of different hypotheses

6704
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
have a bunch of different hypotheses
 

6705
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,629
have a bunch of different hypotheses
and your intuitions are around those

6706
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
and your intuitions are around those
 

6707
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,070
and your intuitions are around those
hypotheses but you still need to

6708
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
hypotheses but you still need to
 

6709
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:02,870
hypotheses but you still need to
actively

6710
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
actively
 

6711
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,950
actively
test it um and it seems like gpt3 is

6712
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:06,960
test it um and it seems like gpt3 is
 

6713
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,870
test it um and it seems like gpt3 is
extremely good at um

6714
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
extremely good at um
 

6715
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,070
extremely good at um
like that sort of pattern matching

6716
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,080
like that sort of pattern matching
 

6717
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,070
like that sort of pattern matching
recognition that usually is very hard

6718
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,080
recognition that usually is very hard
 

6719
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,109

01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
that um is what humans get good at
 

6723
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,870

it's to get that level of intuition but
 

6735
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,790
it's to get that level of intuition but
to actually concretize it into a piece

of math you do need to

6738
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:29,679
of math you do need to
 

6739
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,350
of math you do need to
like test your hypotheses and if not

6740
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:31,360
like test your hypotheses and if not
 

6741
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,709
like test your hypotheses and if not
prove it um

6742
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:32,719
prove it um
 

6743
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,390
prove it um
like have an actual explanation for

6744
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:34,400
like have an actual explanation for
 

6745
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,629
like have an actual explanation for
what's going on not just a

6746
01:43:36,629 --> 01:43:36,639
what's going on not just a
 

6747
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,470
what's going on not just a
a pattern that you've seen yeah and but

6748
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:38,480
a pattern that you've seen yeah and but
 

6749
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,310
a pattern that you've seen yeah and but
then the flip side to play devil's

6750
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:40,320
then the flip side to play devil's
 

6751
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,109
then the flip side to play devil's
advocate

6752
01:43:41,109 --> 01:43:41,119
advocate
 

6753
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,910
advocate
that's a very kind of probably correct

6754
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:43,920
that's a very kind of probably correct
 

6755
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,350
that's a very kind of probably correct
intuitive understanding of

6756
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
intuitive understanding of
 

6757
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,430
intuitive understanding of
just like we said a few a few layers

6758
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:47,440
just like we said a few a few layers
 

6759
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,109
just like we said a few a few layers
creating abstractions

6760
01:43:49,109 --> 01:43:49,119
creating abstractions
 

6761
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:52,950
creating abstractions
but it's been able to form

6762
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
but it's been able to form
 

6763
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,550
but it's been able to form
something that looks like a

6764
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:56,560
something that looks like a
 

6765
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,030
something that looks like a
a compression of the data that it's seen

6766
01:43:59,030 --> 01:43:59,040
a compression of the data that it's seen
 

6767
01:43:59,040 --> 01:43:59,750
a compression of the data that it's seen
that looks

6768
01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,760
that looks
 

6769
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,430
that looks
awfully a lot like it understands what

6770
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
awfully a lot like it understands what
 

6771
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,870
awfully a lot like it understands what
the heck is talking about

6772
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:02,880
the heck is talking about
 

6773
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,030
the heck is talking about
well i think a lot of understanding is

6774
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
well i think a lot of understanding is
 

6775
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,229
well i think a lot of understanding is
like i don't mean to

6776
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
like i don't mean to
 

6777
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,070
like i don't mean to
uh denigrate pattern recognition pattern

6778
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,080
uh denigrate pattern recognition pattern
 

6779
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,990
uh denigrate pattern recognition pattern
recognition is most of understanding and

6780
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,000
recognition is most of understanding and
 

6781
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,149
recognition is most of understanding and
it's super important and it's super hard

6782
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
it's super important and it's super hard
 

6783
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,470
it's super important and it's super hard
um and so like when it's demonstrating

6784
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,480
um and so like when it's demonstrating
 

6785
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,510
um and so like when it's demonstrating
this kind of real understanding

6786
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:15,520
this kind of real understanding
 

6787
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,470
this kind of real understanding
compressing down

6788
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
compressing down
 

6789
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,550
compressing down
some data like that that might be

6790
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:18,560
some data like that that might be
 

6791
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,550
some data like that that might be
pattern recognition at its finest

6792
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:20,560
pattern recognition at its finest
 

6793
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,950
pattern recognition at its finest
my only point would be that like what

6794
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:22,960
my only point would be that like what
 

6795
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,709
my only point would be that like what
differentiates math

6796
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:24,719
differentiates math
 

6797
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,430
differentiates math
i think to a large extent is that um the

6798
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:27,440
i think to a large extent is that um the
 

6799
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,510
i think to a large extent is that um the
pattern recognition isn't sufficient

6800
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,520
pattern recognition isn't sufficient
 

6801
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,709
pattern recognition isn't sufficient
and that the kind of patterns that

6802
01:44:30,709 --> 01:44:30,719
and that the kind of patterns that
 

6803
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,709
and that the kind of patterns that
you're recognizing are

6804
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:32,719
you're recognizing are
 

6805
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,950
you're recognizing are
not like the end goals but instead

6806
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:34,960
not like the end goals but instead
 

6807
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,790
not like the end goals but instead
they're they are the little bits and

6808
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
they're they are the little bits and
 

6809
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,950
they're they are the little bits and
paths that get you to the end goal

6810
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960
paths that get you to the end goal
 

6811
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,629
paths that get you to the end goal
so that's only true for mathematics in

6812
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
so that's only true for mathematics in
 

6813
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,189
so that's only true for mathematics in
general it's an interesting question if

6814
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
general it's an interesting question if
 

6815
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,990
general it's an interesting question if
that might for certain kinds of series

6816
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
that might for certain kinds of series
 

6817
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,030
that might for certain kinds of series
of numbers

6818
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
of numbers
 

6819
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,830
of numbers
it might not be true like you might

6820
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:49,840
it might not be true like you might
 

6821
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,830
it might not be true like you might
because that's a basic

6822
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
because that's a basic
 

6823
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,510
because that's a basic
you know like taylor's like certain

6824
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,520
you know like taylor's like certain
 

6825
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,390
you know like taylor's like certain
kinds of series it feels like

6826
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,400
kinds of series it feels like
 

6827
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,590
kinds of series it feels like
compressing the internet uh

6828
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
compressing the internet uh
 

6829
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,910
compressing the internet uh
is is enough to figure out because those

6830
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
is is enough to figure out because those
 

6831
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,070
is is enough to figure out because those
patterns in some form appear

6832
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,080
patterns in some form appear
 

6833
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,310
patterns in some form appear
in the text somewhere well i mean

6834
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:06,320
in the text somewhere well i mean
 

6835
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,830
in the text somewhere well i mean
there's there's all sorts of wonderful

6836
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:07,840
there's there's all sorts of wonderful
 

6837
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,830
there's there's all sorts of wonderful
examples of false patterns in math where

6838
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840
examples of false patterns in math where
 

6839
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,430
examples of false patterns in math where
um one of the earliest videos i put on

6840
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:11,440
um one of the earliest videos i put on
 

6841
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,109
um one of the earliest videos i put on
the channel was talking about

6842
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119
the channel was talking about
 

6843
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,629
the channel was talking about
you're kind of dividing a circle up

6844
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
you're kind of dividing a circle up
 

6845
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,310
you're kind of dividing a circle up
using these chords and you see this

6846
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:16,320
using these chords and you see this
 

6847
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,550
using these chords and you see this
pattern of one two four eight sixteen i

6848
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
pattern of one two four eight sixteen i
 

6849
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,430
pattern of one two four eight sixteen i
was like okay

6850
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:19,440
was like okay
 

6851
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,030
was like okay
pretty easy to see what that pattern is

6852
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
pretty easy to see what that pattern is
 

6853
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,550
pretty easy to see what that pattern is
it's powers of two you've seen it a

6854
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
it's powers of two you've seen it a
 

6855
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:23,669
it's powers of two you've seen it a
million times

6856
01:45:23,669 --> 01:45:23,679
million times
 

6857
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:25,990
million times
um but it's not powers of two the next

6858
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:26,000
um but it's not powers of two the next
 

6859
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,510
um but it's not powers of two the next
term is thirty one

6860
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:27,520
term is thirty one
 

6861
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,109
term is thirty one
and so it's like almost a power of two

6862
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
and so it's like almost a power of two
 

6863
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,550
and so it's like almost a power of two
but it's a little bit shy

6864
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:30,560
but it's a little bit shy
 

6865
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,910
but it's a little bit shy
and there's there's actually a very good

6866
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
and there's there's actually a very good
 

6867
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,149
and there's there's actually a very good
explanation for what's going on um

6868
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:34,159
explanation for what's going on um
 

6869
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,310
explanation for what's going on um
but i think it's a good test of whether

6870
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
but i think it's a good test of whether
 

6871
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,669
but i think it's a good test of whether
you're thinking

6872
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
you're thinking
 

6873
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,950
you're thinking
clearly about mechanistic explanations

6874
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:40,960
clearly about mechanistic explanations
 

6875
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,590
clearly about mechanistic explanations
of things

6876
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,600
of things
 

6877
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,109
of things
how quickly you jump to thinking it must

6878
01:45:43,109 --> 01:45:43,119
how quickly you jump to thinking it must
 

6879
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:44,870
how quickly you jump to thinking it must
be powers of two because the problem

6880
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:44,880
be powers of two because the problem
 

6881
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,790
be powers of two because the problem
itself there's really no

6882
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:46,800
itself there's really no
 

6883
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,350
itself there's really no
no good way to i mean there can't be a

6884
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,360
no good way to i mean there can't be a
 

6885
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,950
no good way to i mean there can't be a
good way to think about it as

6886
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:50,960
good way to think about it as
 

6887
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,709
good way to think about it as
like doubling a set because ultimately

6888
01:45:52,709 --> 01:45:52,719
like doubling a set because ultimately
 

6889
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,390
like doubling a set because ultimately
it doesn't but even before it starts to

6890
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:54,400
it doesn't but even before it starts to
 

6891
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,830
it doesn't but even before it starts to
it's not something that

6892
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:55,840
it's not something that
 

6893
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,270
it's not something that
screams out as being a doubling

6894
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
screams out as being a doubling
 

6895
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,070
screams out as being a doubling
phenomenon so at best if it did turn out

6896
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:00,080
phenomenon so at best if it did turn out
 

6897
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,430
phenomenon so at best if it did turn out
to be powers of two it would have only

6898
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:01,440
to be powers of two it would have only
 

6899
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,709
to be powers of two it would have only
been so very subtly

6900
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:02,719
been so very subtly
 

6901
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,629
been so very subtly
and i think the difference between like

6902
01:46:04,629 --> 01:46:04,639
and i think the difference between like
 

6903
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:05,750
and i think the difference between like
you know a math student making the

6904
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:05,760
you know a math student making the
 

6905
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,030
you know a math student making the
mistake and a mathematician who's

6906
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:07,040
mistake and a mathematician who's
 

6907
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:07,510
mistake and a mathematician who's
experienced

6908
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:07,520
experienced
 

6909
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,830
experienced
seeing that kind of pattern is that they

6910
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:09,840
seeing that kind of pattern is that they
 

6911
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:10,950
seeing that kind of pattern is that they
they'll have a sense from what the

6912
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:10,960
they'll have a sense from what the
 

6913
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,390
they'll have a sense from what the
problem itself is

6914
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,400
problem itself is
 

6915
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,830
problem itself is
whether the pattern that they're

6916
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
whether the pattern that they're
 

6917
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,149
whether the pattern that they're
observing is reasonable and how to test

6918
01:46:16,149 --> 01:46:16,159
observing is reasonable and how to test
 

6919
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:16,709
observing is reasonable and how to test
it

6920
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
it
 

6921
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:20,070
it
and like uh i would just be very

6922
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:20,080
and like uh i would just be very
 

6923
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,510
and like uh i would just be very
impressed if there was any algorithm

6924
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:21,520
impressed if there was any algorithm
 

6925
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:21,990
impressed if there was any algorithm
that

6926
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:22,000
that
 

6927
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,189
that
um was actively accomplishing that goal

6928
01:46:25,189 --> 01:46:25,199
um was actively accomplishing that goal
 

6929
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,830
um was actively accomplishing that goal
yeah like a learning based algorithm

6930
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:27,840
yeah like a learning based algorithm
 

6931
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,350
yeah like a learning based algorithm
yeah like a little scientist i guess

6932
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,360
yeah like a little scientist i guess
 

6933
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,229
yeah like a little scientist i guess
yeah basically

6934
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:30,239
yeah basically
 

6935
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:33,510
yeah basically
yeah it's a it's a fascinating thought

6936
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:33,520
yeah it's a it's a fascinating thought
 

6937
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,030
yeah it's a it's a fascinating thought
because gpg three

6938
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,040
because gpg three
 

6939
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,310
because gpg three
these language models are already

6940
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:36,320
these language models are already
 

6941
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,910
these language models are already
accomplishing way more than i've

6942
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:37,920
accomplishing way more than i've
 

6943
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,109
accomplishing way more than i've
expected so

6944
01:46:39,109 --> 01:46:39,119
expected so
 

6945
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:41,990
expected so
i'm learning not to doubt but i bet

6946
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:42,000
i'm learning not to doubt but i bet
 

6947
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,870
i'm learning not to doubt but i bet
we'll get there

6948
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:42,880
we'll get there
 

6949
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,030
we'll get there
yeah i'm not saying i'd be impressed but

6950
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,040
yeah i'm not saying i'd be impressed but
 

6951
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,629
yeah i'm not saying i'd be impressed but
like surprised like i'll be impressed

6952
01:46:46,629 --> 01:46:46,639
like surprised like i'll be impressed
 

6953
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:47,030
like surprised like i'll be impressed
but i

6954
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:47,040
but i
 

6955
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,229
but i
i think we'll get there on um algorithms

6956
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,239
i think we'll get there on um algorithms
 

6957
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,470
i think we'll get there on um algorithms
doing math like that

6958
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,480
doing math like that
 

6959
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:56,229
doing math like that
so one of the amazing things you've done

6960
01:46:56,229 --> 01:46:56,239
so one of the amazing things you've done
 

6961
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:57,030
so one of the amazing things you've done
for the world

6962
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,040
for the world
 

6963
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,470
for the world

this python library now it's quickly

6970
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:08,560
this python library now it's quickly
 

6971
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,350
this python library now it's quickly
evolving

evolving
 

6973
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,790
evolving
because i think you're inventing new

6974
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
because i think you're inventing new
 

6975
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,790
because i think you're inventing new
things every time you make a video

6976
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:12,800
things every time you make a video
 

6977
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,390
things every time you make a video
in fact i wanted um i've been working on

6978
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:16,400
in fact i wanted um i've been working on
 

6979
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,910
in fact i wanted um i've been working on
playing around with something i wanted

6980
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:17,920
playing around with something i wanted
 

6981
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,990
playing around with something i wanted
to do like an ode three blue one brown

6982
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,000
to do like an ode three blue one brown
 

6983
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,070
to do like an ode three blue one brown
like i love playing hendrix

6984
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
like i love playing hendrix
 

6985
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,310
like i love playing hendrix
i want to do like a cover you know of a

6986
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
i want to do like a cover you know of a
 

6987
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,070
i want to do like a cover you know of a
concept i wanted to visualize and

6988
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,080
concept i wanted to visualize and
 

6989
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,149
concept i wanted to visualize and
and use madam and i saw that you had

6990
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:28,159
and use madam and i saw that you had
 

6991
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:29,750
and use madam and i saw that you had
like a little piece of code on like

6992
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:29,760
like a little piece of code on like
 

6993
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,109
like a little piece of code on like
mobius strip

6994
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:31,119
mobius strip
 

6995
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,669
mobius strip
and i tried to do some cool things with

6996
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
and i tried to do some cool things with
 

6997
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,950
and i tried to do some cool things with
spinning a mobius strip like continue

6998
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:36,960
spinning a mobius strip like continue
 

6999
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,229
spinning a mobius strip like continue
um twisting it i guess is the term

7000
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:40,239
um twisting it i guess is the term
 

7001
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:43,750
um twisting it i guess is the term
uh and it was easier to uh

7002
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:43,760
uh and it was easier to uh
 

7003
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,270
uh and it was easier to uh
it was tough so i haven't figured out

7004
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,280
it was tough so i haven't figured out
 

7005
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,189
it was tough so i haven't figured out
yet well so i guess the question i want

7006
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
yet well so i guess the question i want
 

7007
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:47,990
yet well so i guess the question i want
to ask

7008
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,000
to ask
 

7009
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,709
to ask
is so many people love it uh that you've

7010
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:50,719
is so many people love it uh that you've
 

7011
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:52,790
is so many people love it uh that you've
put that out there they want to uh do

7012
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
put that out there they want to uh do
 

7013
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,149
put that out there they want to uh do
the same things they do with hendrix

7014
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
the same things they do with hendrix
 

7015
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,109
the same things they do with hendrix
they want to cover it they want to

7016
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:55,119
they want to cover it they want to
 

7017
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:56,709
they want to cover it they want to
explain an idea using the tool

7018
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
explain an idea using the tool

they try to i'm very sorry they try to

7022
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
they try to i'm very sorry they try to

they try to go by uh about it
 

7027
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:10,310
they try to go by uh about it
well so and what kind of choices should

7028
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:10,320
well so and what kind of choices should
 

7029
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,109
well so and what kind of choices should
they choose

7030
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:11,119
they choose
 

7031
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,590
they choose
to be most effective oh that i can

7032
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
to be most effective oh that i can
 

7033
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,470
to be most effective oh that i can
answer so

7034
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
answer so
 

7035
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,229
answer so
i always feel guilty if this comes up

7036
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:16,239
i always feel guilty if this comes up
 

7037
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,149
i always feel guilty if this comes up
because um i think of it like the

7038
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
because um i think of it like the
 

7039
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,270
because um i think of it like the
scrappy tool

7040
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:19,280
scrappy tool
 

7041
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,790
scrappy tool
that's like a math teacher who put

7042
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:20,800
that's like a math teacher who put
 

7043
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,709
that's like a math teacher who put
together some code people asked what it

7044
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:22,719
together some code people asked what it
 

7045
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,310
together some code people asked what it
was so they made it open source

7046
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:24,320
was so they made it open source
 

7047
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,149
was so they made it open source
and they kept scrapping it together and

7048
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,159
and they kept scrapping it together and
 

7049
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:27,590
and they kept scrapping it together and
there's a lot like a lot of things about

7050
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:27,600
there's a lot like a lot of things about
 

7051
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,270
there's a lot like a lot of things about
it that make it harder to work with than

7052
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
it that make it harder to work with than
 

7053
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,229
it that make it harder to work with than
it needs to be

7054
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:30,239
it needs to be
 

7055
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:31,590
it needs to be

i i've put some work this year trying to

7060
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:36,400
i i've put some work this year trying to
 

7061
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,750
i i've put some work this year trying to
like make it

7062
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:37,760
like make it
 

7063
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,790
like make it
better and more flexible um that is

7064
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:40,800
better and more flexible um that is
 

7065
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,750
better and more flexible um that is
still just kind of like

7066
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
still just kind of like
 

7067
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,870
still just kind of like
a work in process um one thing i would

7068
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:44,880
a work in process um one thing i would
 

7069
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,510
a work in process um one thing i would
love to

7070

love to
 

7071
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,430
love to
do is just get my act together about

7072
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:47,440
do is just get my act together about
 

7073
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,870
do is just get my act together about
properly integrating with what like the

7074
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:48,880
properly integrating with what like the
 

7075
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,310

community wants to work with
 

7077
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,430
community wants to work with
and like what stuff i work on and making

7078
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:53,440
and like what stuff i work on and making
 

7079
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:53,750
and like what stuff i work on and making
that

7080
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:53,760
that
 

7081
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,030
that
um not like deviate uh and just like

7082
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:57,040
um not like deviate uh and just like
 

7083
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,390
um not like deviate uh and just like
actually fostering that community in a

way that i've

7086
01:48:58,950 --> 01:48:58,960
way that i've
 

7087
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,950
way that i've
i've been like shamefully neglectful of

i've been like shamefully neglectful of
 

7089
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,030
i've been like shamefully neglectful of
so i'm just always guilty if it comes up

7090
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
so i'm just always guilty if it comes up
 

7091
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,109
so i'm just always guilty if it comes up
so let's put that guilt aside just okay

7092
01:49:05,109 --> 01:49:05,119
so let's put that guilt aside just okay
 

7093

01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:47,910
um things like that you should probably
just use keynote

7208

just use keynote
 

7209
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,189
just use keynote
right um you'll be a lot simpler so

7210
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
right um you'll be a lot simpler so
 

7211

down that which should be programmatic
into manum and that which doesn't need

7216
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:56,320
into manum and that which doesn't need
 

7217
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:56,950
into manum and that which doesn't need
to be

7218
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:56,960
to be
 

7219
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,350
to be
into like other domains again do as i

7220
01:50:59,350 --> 01:50:59,360
into like other domains again do as i
 

7221
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,310
into like other domains again do as i
say not as i

7222
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
say not as i
 

7223
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,790
say not as i
do i mean python is an integral part of

7224
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:02,800
do i mean python is an integral part of
 

7225
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,430
do i mean python is an integral part of
it

7226
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:03,440
it
 

7227
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,990
it
and just for the fun of it let me ask uh

7228
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,000
and just for the fun of it let me ask uh
 

7229
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,790
and just for the fun of it let me ask uh
what uh

7230
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:06,800
what uh
 

7231
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,030
what uh
what's your most and least favorite

7232
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:09,040
what's your most and least favorite
 

7233
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,790
what's your most and least favorite
aspects of python

7234
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:10,800
aspects of python
 

7235
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,589
aspects of python
oh most and least i mean i love that

7236
01:51:13,589 --> 01:51:13,599
oh most and least i mean i love that
 

7237
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:15,030
oh most and least i mean i love that
it's like

7238
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
it's like
 

7239
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,350
it's like
object-oriented and functional i guess

7240
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
object-oriented and functional i guess
 

7241
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,790
object-oriented and functional i guess
that you can kind of like

7242
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
that you can kind of like
 

7243
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,229
that you can kind of like
get both of those um uh benefits

7244
01:51:22,229 --> 01:51:22,239
get both of those um uh benefits
 

7245
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,310
get both of those um uh benefits
for how you structure things so if you

7246
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:24,320
for how you structure things so if you
 

7247
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,589
for how you structure things so if you
just want to quickly whip something

7248
01:51:25,589 --> 01:51:25,599
just want to quickly whip something
 

7249
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:27,430
just want to quickly whip something
together the functional aspects are nice

7250
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:27,440
together the functional aspects are nice
 

7251
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,750
together the functional aspects are nice
it's your primary language like for

7252
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
it's your primary language like for
 

7253
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,270
it's your primary language like for
programmatically generating stuff yeah

7254
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:31,280
programmatically generating stuff yeah
 

7255
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:31,669
programmatically generating stuff yeah
it's home

7256
01:51:31,669 --> 01:51:31,679
it's home
 

7257
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:34,629
it's home
for me by calling home yeah sometimes

7258
01:51:34,629 --> 01:51:34,639
for me by calling home yeah sometimes
 

7259
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,070
for me by calling home yeah sometimes
you travel but it's home got it it's

7260
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,080
you travel but it's home got it it's
 

7261
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:36,629
you travel but it's home got it it's
home

7262
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
home
 

7263
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,470
home
uh i mean the biggest disadvantage is

7264
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:38,480
uh i mean the biggest disadvantage is
 

7265
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,830
uh i mean the biggest disadvantage is
that it's slow so when you're doing

7266
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
that it's slow so when you're doing
 

7267
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,589
that it's slow so when you're doing
computationally intensive things

7268
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:41,599
computationally intensive things
 

7269
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:42,870
computationally intensive things
either you have to like think about it

7270
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
either you have to like think about it
 

7271
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,149
either you have to like think about it
more than you should how to make it

7272
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:44,159
more than you should how to make it
 

7273
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:44,870
more than you should how to make it
efficient

7274
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:44,880
efficient
 

7275
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,669
efficient
or that just like takes long do you run

7276
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:47,679
or that just like takes long do you run
 

7277
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,669
or that just like takes long do you run
into that at all like with your work

7278
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679
into that at all like with your work
 

7279
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,310
into that at all like with your work
well so uh certainly old man is like way

7280
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
well so uh certainly old man is like way
 

7281
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,310
well so uh certainly old man is like way
slower than it needs to be because of

7282
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,320
slower than it needs to be because of
 

7283
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,510
slower than it needs to be because of
uh how it renders things on the back end

7284
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:57,520
uh how it renders things on the back end
 

7285
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,550
uh how it renders things on the back end
is like kind of absurd

7286
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:58,560
is like kind of absurd
 

7287
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,709
is like kind of absurd
i've rewritten things such that it's all

7288
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
i've rewritten things such that it's all
 

7289
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,310
i've rewritten things such that it's all
done with like shaders in such a way

7290
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:02,320
done with like shaders in such a way
 

7291
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,910
done with like shaders in such a way
that it should be just like live and

7292
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
that it should be just like live and
 

7293
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:04,629
that it should be just like live and
actually like

7294
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
actually like
 

7295
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,709
actually like
interactive while you're um coding it if

7296
01:52:06,709 --> 01:52:06,719
interactive while you're um coding it if
 

7297
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,229
interactive while you're um coding it if
you want to to you know you have like a

7298
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
you want to to you know you have like a
 

7299
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,550
you want to to you know you have like a
3d scene you can move around you can

7300
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:10,560
3d scene you can move around you can
 

7301
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,950
3d scene you can move around you can
have um elements respond to where your

7302
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:12,960
have um elements respond to where your
 

7303
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,990
have um elements respond to where your
mouse is or things

7304
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:14,000
mouse is or things
 

7305
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,229
mouse is or things
that's not something that user of a

7306
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
that's not something that user of a
 

7307
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:17,510
that's not something that user of a
video is going to get to experience

7308
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,520
video is going to get to experience
 

7309
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,629
video is going to get to experience
because there's just a play button and a

7310
01:52:18,629 --> 01:52:18,639
because there's just a play button and a
 

7311
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:20,070
because there's just a play button and a
pause button but while you're developing

7312
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:20,080
pause button but while you're developing
 

7313
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,270
pause button but while you're developing
that can be nice

7314
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
that can be nice
 

7315
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,350
that can be nice
um so it's gotten better in speed in

7316
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
um so it's gotten better in speed in
 

7317
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,030
um so it's gotten better in speed in
that sense but that's basically because

7318
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
that sense but that's basically because
 

7319
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,310
that sense but that's basically because
the hard work is being done in the

7320
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,320
the hard work is being done in the
 

7321
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,310
the hard work is being done in the
language that's not python but

7322
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
language that's not python but
 

7323
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,669
language that's not python but
glsl right um but yeah

7324
01:52:31,669 --> 01:52:31,679
glsl right um but yeah
 

7325
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,830
glsl right um but yeah
there are some times when it's like a um

7326
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
there are some times when it's like a um
 

7327
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,270
there are some times when it's like a um
there's just a lot of data that goes

7328
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:35,280
there's just a lot of data that goes
 

7329
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,030
there's just a lot of data that goes
into the object that i want to animate

7330
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,040
into the object that i want to animate
 

7331
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,390
into the object that i want to animate
that then it just like python is slow

7332
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,400
that then it just like python is slow
 

7333
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,790
that then it just like python is slow
well let me ask quickly ask what do you

7334
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
well let me ask quickly ask what do you
 

7335
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,470
well let me ask quickly ask what do you
think about the walrus operator if

7336
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,480
think about the walrus operator if
 

7337
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:45,830
think about the walrus operator if
you're familiar with it at all

7338
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:45,840
you're familiar with it at all
 

7339
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,270
you're familiar with it at all
the reason it's interesting there's a

7340
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:47,280
the reason it's interesting there's a
 

7341
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,589
the reason it's interesting there's a
new operator in python 3.8

7342
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
new operator in python 3.8
 

7343
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,350
new operator in python 3.8
i find it psychologically interesting

7344
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
i find it psychologically interesting
 

7345
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,350
i find it psychologically interesting
because it the toxicity over it led

7346
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
because it the toxicity over it led
 

7347
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,629
because it the toxicity over it led
guido to resign

7348
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
guido to resign
 

7349
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,629
guido to resign
to step down from this actually true or

7350
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
to step down from this actually true or
 

7351
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:57,589
to step down from this actually true or
was it like there's a bunch of

7352
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:57,599
was it like there's a bunch of
 

7353
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,669
was it like there's a bunch of
surrounding things that also

7354
01:52:59,669 --> 01:52:59,679
surrounding things that also
 

7355
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,910
surrounding things that also
was it actually the walrus operator that

7356
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
was it actually the walrus operator that
 

7357
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:02,709
was it actually the walrus operator that
well

7358
01:53:02,709 --> 01:53:02,719
well
 

7359
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:04,629
well
it was it was a text it was an

7360
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:04,639
it was it was a text it was an
 

7361
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:06,229
it was it was a text it was an
accumulation of toxicity

7362
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:06,239
accumulation of toxicity
 

7363
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:08,470
accumulation of toxicity
but that was the the most that was the

7364
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:08,480
but that was the the most that was the
 

7365
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,750
but that was the the most that was the
most toxic one

7366
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:09,760
most toxic one
 

7367
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,149
most toxic one
like the discussion that's the most

7368
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:12,159
like the discussion that's the most
 

7369
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:14,149
like the discussion that's the most
number of python core developers that

7370
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
number of python core developers that
 

7371
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,550
number of python core developers that
were opposed to guido's decision

7372
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:16,560
were opposed to guido's decision
 

7373
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,790

to war over each other
 

7535
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,270
to war over each other
i've seen this with design people are

7536
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:43,280
i've seen this with design people are
 

7537
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,709
i've seen this with design people are
very touchy on color

7538
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:44,719
very touchy on color
 

7539
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:47,510
very touchy on color
color choices at the end of the day just

7540
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:47,520
color choices at the end of the day just
 

7541
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,030
color choices at the end of the day just
make a decision

7542
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:49,040
make a decision
 

7543
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,270
make a decision
and go with it i think that that's what

7544
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:51,280
and go with it i think that that's what
 

7545
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,950
and go with it i think that that's what
the walrus

7546
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:52,960
the walrus
 

7547
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,629
the walrus
operator represents to me is it

7548
01:55:54,629 --> 01:55:54,639
operator represents to me is it
 

7549
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,470
operator represents to me is it
represents the fighter pilot instinct of

7550
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:56,480
represents the fighter pilot instinct of
 

7551
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:56,790
represents the fighter pilot instinct of
like

7552
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:56,800
like
 

7553
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,229
like
quick action is more important than uh

7554
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,239
quick action is more important than uh
 

7555
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:02,310
quick action is more important than uh
than just like caring everybody out and

7556
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:02,320
than just like caring everybody out and
 

7557
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,589
than just like caring everybody out and
really thinking through it because

7558
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599
really thinking through it because
 

7559
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,030
really thinking through it because
that's going to lead to

7560
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
that's going to lead to
 

7561
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,070
that's going to lead to
paralysis yeah like if that's the actual

7562
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:08,080
paralysis yeah like if that's the actual
 

7563
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,350
paralysis yeah like if that's the actual
case that you know

7564
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
case that you know
 

7565
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,790
case that you know
it's something we're consciously hearing

7566
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
it's something we're consciously hearing
 

7567
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,790
it's something we're consciously hearing
people's uh disagreement

7568
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
people's uh disagreement
 

7569
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,709
people's uh disagreement
disagreeing with that disagreement and

7570
01:56:14,709 --> 01:56:14,719
disagreeing with that disagreement and
 

7571
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,149
disagreeing with that disagreement and
um saying he wants to move forward

7572
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
um saying he wants to move forward
 

7573
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,669
um saying he wants to move forward
anyway

7574
01:56:17,669 --> 01:56:17,679
anyway
 

7575
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:20,950
anyway
that's an admirable aspect of leadership

7576
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
that's an admirable aspect of leadership
 

7577
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,350
that's an admirable aspect of leadership
so we don't have much time but i want to

7578
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
so we don't have much time but i want to
 

7579
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,070
so we don't have much time but i want to
ask just

7580
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
ask just
 

7581
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,750
ask just
because it's uh some beautiful

7582

working for
 

7595
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,589
working for
probably decades but he put out this

7596
01:56:39,589 --> 01:56:39,599
probably decades but he put out this
 

7597
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:40,550
probably decades but he put out this
idea of

about quantum mechanics which you
 

7631
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:10,629
about quantum mechanics which you
touched on in a bunch of your videos a

7632

touched on in a bunch of your videos a
 

7633
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:11,350
touched on in a bunch of your videos a
little bit

7634

little bit
 

7635
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,350
little bit
quaternions like just the mathematics

7636
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:13,360
quaternions like just the mathematics
 

7637
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,270

well i think um as far as like

7644
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,080
well i think um as far as like
 

7645
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,070
well i think um as far as like
popularized science is concerned

01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:11,280
the theory of everything so basically
 

7771
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:14,229
the theory of everything so basically
we should really try to find the beauty

7772
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
we should really try to find the beauty
 

7773
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:16,470
we should really try to find the beauty
and mathematics of physics by looking at

7774
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:16,480
and mathematics of physics by looking at
 

7775
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,709
and mathematics of physics by looking at
concepts that are like within reach yeah

concepts that are like within reach yeah
 

7777
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,629

i think that's super important i mean

7778
01:59:20,629 --> 01:59:20,639
i think that's super important i mean
 

7779
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:23,750
i think that's super important i mean
so you see this in math too with um

7780
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:23,760
so you see this in math too with um
 

7781
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,589
so you see this in math too with um
the big unsolved problems so like the

yet no but if i did do you know what i

7792
01:59:33,189 --> 01:59:33,199
yet no but if i did do you know what i
 

7793
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:34,950
yet no but if i did do you know what i
would do i would talk about

would do i would talk about
 

7795
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,350

01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,629
okay is that still accessible though yes
actually

01:59:42,629 --> 01:59:42,639
actually
 

7803
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,109
actually
barely um mathologer might be able to do

7804
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
barely um mathologer might be able to do
 

7805
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,470
barely um mathologer might be able to do
like a great job on this he does a good

accessible and making it
 

7811
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,830
accessible and making it
but the the core ideas of proving it for

7812
01:59:51,830 --> 01:59:51,840
but the the core ideas of proving it for
 

7813
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,669
but the the core ideas of proving it for
n equals three are hard

7814
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:53,679
n equals three are hard
 

7815
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,510
n equals three are hard
but they do get you real ideas about

7816
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:55,520
but they do get you real ideas about
 

7817
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,270
but they do get you real ideas about
algebraic number theory um

7818
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:57,280
algebraic number theory um
 

7819
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,709
algebraic number theory um
it involves looking at a number field

7820
01:59:58,709 --> 01:59:58,719
it involves looking at a number field
 

7821
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:00,629
it involves looking at a number field
that's uh it lives in the complex plane

7822
02:00:00,629 --> 02:00:00,639
that's uh it lives in the complex plane
 

7823
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:02,310
that's uh it lives in the complex plane
it looks like a hexagonal lattice

7824
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:02,320
it looks like a hexagonal lattice
 

7825
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,669
it looks like a hexagonal lattice
and you start asking questions about

7826
02:00:03,669 --> 02:00:03,679
and you start asking questions about
 

7827
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,430
and you start asking questions about
factoring numbers in this hexagonal

7828
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:05,440
factoring numbers in this hexagonal
 

7829
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,310
factoring numbers in this hexagonal
lattice

7830
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:06,320
lattice
 

7831
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:07,430
lattice
so it takes a while but i've talked

7832
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
so it takes a while but i've talked
 

7833
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,709
so it takes a while but i've talked
about this sort of like lattice

7834
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:08,719
about this sort of like lattice
 

7835
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:10,070
about this sort of like lattice
arithmetic

7836
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080

7837
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,189
arithmetic
in other contexts and you can get to a

7838
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:13,199
in other contexts and you can get to a
 

7839
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,669
in other contexts and you can get to a
okay understanding of that and the

7840
02:00:15,669 --> 02:00:15,679
okay understanding of that and the
 

7841
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:17,030
okay understanding of that and the
things that make fairmont's last theme

7842
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
things that make fairmont's last theme
 

7843
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,470
things that make fairmont's last theme
hard are actually quite deep

7844
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:18,480
hard are actually quite deep
 

7845
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:21,030
hard are actually quite deep
um and so the cases that we can solve it

7846
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,040
um and so the cases that we can solve it
 

7847
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,310
um and so the cases that we can solve it
for it's like you can get these broad

7848
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:22,320
for it's like you can get these broad

and so any other attempt to describe it
 

7863
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,589
and so any other attempt to describe it
would just end up being like shallow and

7864
02:00:37,589 --> 02:00:37,599
would just end up being like shallow and
 

7865
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:39,030
would just end up being like shallow and

02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:29,750
to like certainly you shouldn't be
trying to answer that unless you

trying to answer that unless you
 

7987
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,270
trying to answer that unless you
actually understand quantum field theory

which the analog of the roman hypothesis
 

8021
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:58,950
which the analog of the roman hypothesis
has been solved in like more

8022
02:02:58,950 --> 02:02:58,960
has been solved in like more
 

8023
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:01,109
has been solved in like more
uh discrete feeling finite settings that

8024
02:03:01,109 --> 02:03:01,119
uh discrete feeling finite settings that
 

8025
02:03:01,119 --> 02:03:02,310
uh discrete feeling finite settings that
are more well-behaved

8026
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:02,320
are more well-behaved
 

8027
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,310
are more well-behaved
i'm not describing that because it just

8028
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:04,320
i'm not describing that because it just
 

8029
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,669
i'm not describing that because it just
takes a ton to get there

8030
02:03:05,669 --> 02:03:05,679
takes a ton to get there
 

8031
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:07,990
takes a ton to get there
and instead i think it'll be like

8032
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:08,000
and instead i think it'll be like
 

8033
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,270
and instead i think it'll be like
productive to have an actual

8034
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:09,280
productive to have an actual
 

8035
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,629
productive to have an actual
understanding of something

8036
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
understanding of something
 

8037
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:12,950
understanding of something
that can you can pack into 20 minutes i

8038
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
that can you can pack into 20 minutes i
 

8039
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,550
that can you can pack into 20 minutes i
think that's beautifully put

8040
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,560
think that's beautifully put
 

8041
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,910
think that's beautifully put
ultimately that's where like the most

8042
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:15,920
ultimately that's where like the most
 

8043
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:17,270
ultimately that's where like the most
satisfying thing is when you really

8044
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
satisfying thing is when you really
 

8045
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,950
satisfying thing is when you really
understand

8046
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
understand
 

8047
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:21,589
understand
um yeah really understand build a habit

8048
02:03:21,589 --> 02:03:21,599
um yeah really understand build a habit
 

8049
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:23,589
um yeah really understand build a habit
of feeling what it's like to actually

8050
02:03:23,589 --> 02:03:23,599
of feeling what it's like to actually
 

8051
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:27,109
of feeling what it's like to actually
come to resolution yeah yeah as opposed

8052
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:27,119
come to resolution yeah yeah as opposed
 

8053
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:27,669
come to resolution yeah yeah as opposed
to

8054
02:03:27,669 --> 02:03:27,679
to
 

8055
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:29,910
to
which it can also be enjoyable but just

8056
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:29,920
which it can also be enjoyable but just
 

8057
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,870
which it can also be enjoyable but just
being

8058
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:30,880
being
 

8059
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,149
being
in awe of the fact that you don't

8060
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:32,159
in awe of the fact that you don't
 

8061
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:34,310

02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:34,320
understand anything yeah that's not like
 

8063
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,350
understand anything yeah that's not like
i don't know maybe people get

8064
02:03:35,350 --> 02:03:35,360
i don't know maybe people get
 

8065
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:38,149
i don't know maybe people get
entertainment out of that but

8066
02:03:38,149 --> 02:03:38,159
entertainment out of that but
 

8067
02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:40,390
entertainment out of that but
it's not as fulfilling as understanding

8068
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:40,400
it's not as fulfilling as understanding
 

8069
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:41,990
it's not as fulfilling as understanding
you won't grow

8070
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,000
you won't grow
 

8071
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,189
you won't grow
yeah and but also just the fulfilling it

8072
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:45,199
yeah and but also just the fulfilling it
 

8073
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,709
yeah and but also just the fulfilling it
really does feel good when you

8074
02:03:46,709 --> 02:03:46,719
really does feel good when you
 

8075
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:48,310
really does feel good when you
first don't understand something and

8076
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:48,320
first don't understand something and
 

8077
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:51,270
first don't understand something and
then you do that's a beautiful feeling

8078
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:51,280
then you do that's a beautiful feeling
 

8079

got awkward and weird about
uh a fear of mortality which you made

8084
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:58,560
uh a fear of mortality which you made

you think is
 

8091
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,030
you think is
uh the meaning of our life of meaning of

8092
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,040
uh the meaning of our life of meaning of
 

8093
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,910
uh the meaning of our life of meaning of
life

8094
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:07,920

i think like meaning i don't understand
the question

8106
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:18,480
the question
 

8107
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,750
the question
i think meaning is something that's

8108
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:19,760
i think meaning is something that's
 

8109
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,270
i think meaning is something that's
ascribed to stuff that's created with

8110
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:21,280
ascribed to stuff that's created with
 

8111
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:22,310
ascribed to stuff that's created with
purpose

8112
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,320
purpose
 

8113
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,550
purpose
there's a meaning to uh like this water

8114
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
there's a meaning to uh like this water
 

8115
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,310
there's a meaning to uh like this water
bottle label in that someone created it

8116
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:26,320
bottle label in that someone created it
 

8117
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,750
bottle label in that someone created it
with the purpose of conveying meaning

8118
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:27,760
with the purpose of conveying meaning
 

8119
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,189
with the purpose of conveying meaning
and there was like one consciousness

8120
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:29,199
and there was like one consciousness
 

8121
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:30,550
and there was like one consciousness
that wanted to get its ideas into

8122
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:30,560
that wanted to get its ideas into
 

8123
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,589
that wanted to get its ideas into
another consciousness um

8124
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
another consciousness um
 

8125
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,350
another consciousness um
most things don't have that property

8126
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:35,360
most things don't have that property
 

8127
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,870
most things don't have that property
it's a little bit like if i asked you

8128
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:36,880
it's a little bit like if i asked you
 

8129
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,390
it's a little bit like if i asked you
um like what is the height

8130
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:40,400
um like what is the height
 

8131
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,069
um like what is the height
all right so it's all relative yeah

8132
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:42,079
all right so it's all relative yeah
 

8133
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:44,069
all right so it's all relative yeah
you'd be like the height of what

8134
02:04:44,069 --> 02:04:44,079
you'd be like the height of what
 

8135
02:04:44,079 --> 02:04:45,990
you'd be like the height of what
you can't ask what is the height without

8136
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
you can't ask what is the height without
 

8137
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,189
you can't ask what is the height without
an object you can't ask what is the

8138
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:47,199
an object you can't ask what is the
 

8139
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:47,910
an object you can't ask what is the
meaning of life

8140
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:47,920
meaning of life
 

8141
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,550
meaning of life
without like an intentful consciousness

8142
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:50,560
without like an intentful consciousness
 

8143
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,109
without like an intentful consciousness
putting it

8144
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
putting it
 

8145
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:53,270
putting it
like i guess i'm revealing i'm not very

8146
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,280
like i guess i'm revealing i'm not very
 

8147
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,310
like i guess i'm revealing i'm not very
religious

8148
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
religious
 

8149
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,390
religious
but you know the mathematics of

8150
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:56,400
but you know the mathematics of
 

8151
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,550
but you know the mathematics of
everything seems kind of beautiful

8152
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:58,560
everything seems kind of beautiful
 

8153
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,189
everything seems kind of beautiful
it seems like it seems like there's some

8154
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:01,199
it seems like it seems like there's some
 

8155
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,589
it seems like it seems like there's some
kind of structure

8156
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
kind of structure
 

8157
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:05,510
kind of structure
relative to which i mean you could

8158
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
relative to which i mean you could
 

8159
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,109
relative to which i mean you could
calculate the height

8160
02:05:07,109 --> 02:05:07,119
calculate the height
 

8161
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:08,709
calculate the height
well so but what i'm saying is i don't

8162
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:08,719
well so but what i'm saying is i don't
 

8163
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:09,910
well so but what i'm saying is i don't
understand the question what is the

8164
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:09,920
understand the question what is the
 

8165
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,910
understand the question what is the
meaning of life in that i think

8166
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:11,920
meaning of life in that i think
 

8167
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,270
meaning of life in that i think
people might be asking something very

8168
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:13,280
people might be asking something very
 

8169
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,470
people might be asking something very
real i don't understand what they're

asking are they asking like
 

8173

asking are they asking like
why does life exist like how did it come

8174
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
why does life exist like how did it come
 

8175
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,109
why does life exist like how did it come
about what are the natural laws

8176
02:05:19,109 --> 02:05:19,119
about what are the natural laws
 

8177
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:21,189

think is the meaning of
in that sense bringing others joy

8204

in that sense bringing others joy
 

8205

in that sense bringing others joy
essentially like

with others somehow
 

8211
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:53,750
with others somehow
and the same and the vice versa i think

8212
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:53,760
and the same and the vice versa i think
 

8213
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,709
and the same and the vice versa i think
that that is what

8214
02:05:54,709 --> 02:05:54,719
that that is what
 

8215
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:56,950
