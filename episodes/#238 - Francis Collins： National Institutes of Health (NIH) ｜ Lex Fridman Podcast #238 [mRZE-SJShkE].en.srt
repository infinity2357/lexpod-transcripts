00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,150
so gotta be careful not to say oh gain
of function is bad

334
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
of function is bad
 

335
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,830
of function is bad
most of what we do

336
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
most of what we do
 

337
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,550
most of what we do
in science that's good involves quite a

338
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
in science that's good involves quite a
 

339
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,990
in science that's good involves quite a
bit of the hat

340
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
bit of the hat
 

341
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,510
bit of the hat
and we are all living with gains of

342
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
and we are all living with gains of
 

343
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,790
and we are all living with gains of
function every day i have a gain of

344
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
function every day i have a gain of
 

345
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,390
function every day i have a gain of
function because i'm wearing these

346
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
function because i'm wearing these
 

347
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,469
function because i'm wearing these
eyeglasses otherwise i would not be

348
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
eyeglasses otherwise i would not be
 

349
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,790
eyeglasses otherwise i would not be
seeing you as clearly i'm happy for that

350
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
seeing you as clearly i'm happy for that
 

351
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,710
seeing you as clearly i'm happy for that
gain of function

352
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
gain of function
 

353
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,430
gain of function
so

354
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
so
 

355
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,029
so
that's where a lot of confusion has

356
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
that's where a lot of confusion has
 

357
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,350
that's where a lot of confusion has
happened the kind of gain of function

358
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
happened the kind of gain of function
 

359
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,629
happened the kind of gain of function
which is now subject to very rigorous

00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
which is now subject to very rigorous

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,350
which is now subject to very rigorous

and very carefully defined oversight
 

363
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,950

this very stringent oversight worked out
 

383
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,430
this very stringent oversight worked out
over three years

most of the time

most of the time
 

399
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,550
most of the time
it's not worth the risk only three times

400
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
it's not worth the risk only three times
 

401
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,029
it's not worth the risk only three times
uh in the last three or four years uh

have experiments been given permission

have experiments been given permission
 

405
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,710
have experiments been given permission
to go forward they were all an influenza

406
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
to go forward they were all an influenza
 

407
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,110
to go forward they were all an influenza
so i will argue that if you're worried

408
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
so i will argue that if you're worried
 

409
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,510
so i will argue that if you're worried
about the next pandemic

410
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
about the next pandemic
 

411
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,749
about the next pandemic
the more you know about the coming enemy

412
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
the more you know about the coming enemy
 

413
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,909
the more you know about the coming enemy
the better chance you have to recognize

414
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
the better chance you have to recognize
 

415
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,830
the better chance you have to recognize
when trouble is starting

416
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
when trouble is starting
 

417
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,390
when trouble is starting
and so if you can do it safely

418
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
and so if you can do it safely
 

419
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,390
and so if you can do it safely

would be a good thing to be able to know

426
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
would be a good thing to be able to know
 

427
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,710
would be a good thing to be able to know
about but you have to be able to do it

about but you have to be able to do it
 

429
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,110
about but you have to be able to do it
safely because we all know

433
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,589
lab accidents can happen and i mean look
at sars where there have been lab

we don't want to take that chance unless

we don't want to take that chance unless

we don't want to take that chance unless
there's a compelling scientific reason

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,629
areas of science so like you mentioned
gain of function is a term there's very

664
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
gain of function is a term there's very
 

665
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,190
gain of function is a term there's very
specific scientific meaning but it also

666
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
specific scientific meaning but it also
 

667
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,150
specific scientific meaning but it also
has a more general term and it's very

668
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
has a more general term and it's very
 

669
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,230
has a more general term and it's very
possible to argue that the

670
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
possible to argue that the
 

671
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,470
possible to argue that the
not to argue not the way politicians

672
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
not to argue not the way politicians
 

673
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,069
not to argue not the way politicians
argue but just as human beings and

674
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
argue but just as human beings and
 

675
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,629
argue but just as human beings and
scientists that there was a gain of

676
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
scientists that there was a gain of
 

677
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,710
scientists that there was a gain of
function achieved

678
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
function achieved
 

679
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,829
function achieved
at the wuhan institute of

680
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
at the wuhan institute of
 

681
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,590
at the wuhan institute of
biology but it didn't cross a threshold

682
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
biology but it didn't cross a threshold
 

683
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,230
biology but it didn't cross a threshold
i mean there's a it's it's uh it but it

684
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
i mean there's a it's it's uh it but it
 

685
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,550
i mean there's a it's it's uh it but it
could have too so here's the thing when

686
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
could have too so here's the thing when
 

687
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,190
could have too so here's the thing when
you do these kinds of experiments

688
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
you do these kinds of experiments
 

689
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,310
you do these kinds of experiments
unexpected results may be achieved and

690
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
unexpected results may be achieved and
 

691
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,629
unexpected results may be achieved and
that's the gray area of science you're

692
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
that's the gray area of science you're
 

693
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,230
that's the gray area of science you're
you're taking risks with such

694
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
you're taking risks with such
 

695
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,389
you're taking risks with such
experiments

696
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
experiments
 

697
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,790
experiments
and i am very uncomfortable that we

698
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
and i am very uncomfortable that we
 

699
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,310
and i am very uncomfortable that we
can't

700
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
can't
 

701
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,310
can't
discuss the uncertainty in the gray area

702
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
discuss the uncertainty in the gray area
 

703
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,430
discuss the uncertainty in the gray area
of this

704
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
of this
 

705
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,670
of this
oh i'm comfortable discussing the gray

706
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
oh i'm comfortable discussing the gray
 

707
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,750
oh i'm comfortable discussing the gray
area what i'm uncomfortable with is

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
area what i'm uncomfortable with is

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,269
people deciding to define for themselves
what that threshold is based on sort of

712
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
what that threshold is based on sort of
 

713
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,509
what that threshold is based on sort of
some political argument the threshold

714
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
some political argument the threshold
 

715
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,629
some political argument the threshold
was very explicitly laid out

716
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
was very explicitly laid out
 

717
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,629
was very explicitly laid out
everybody agreed to that

718
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
everybody agreed to that
 

719
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,470
everybody agreed to that
in the basis of this three years of

720
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
in the basis of this three years of
 

721
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,790
in the basis of this three years of
deliberation so that's what it is if

722
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
deliberation so that's what it is if
 

723
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,110
deliberation so that's what it is if
that threshold needs to be reconsidered

724
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
that threshold needs to be reconsidered
 

725
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,990
that threshold needs to be reconsidered
let's reconsider it but let's not try to

726
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
let's reconsider it but let's not try to
 

727
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,590
let's reconsider it but let's not try to
take an experiment that's already been

728
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
take an experiment that's already been
 

729
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,069
take an experiment that's already been
done and decide that the threshold isn't

730
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
done and decide that the threshold isn't
 

731
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,389
done and decide that the threshold isn't
what it was because that that really is

732
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
what it was because that that really is
 

733
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,710
what it was because that that really is
doing a disservice to the whole process

734
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
doing a disservice to the whole process
 

735
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,629
doing a disservice to the whole process
i wish there was a discussion even in

00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
i wish there was a discussion even in

talking about specific senators but just
 

743
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,670
talking about specific senators but just
that particular case i'm saying stuff

that particular case i'm saying stuff
 

745
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,350
that particular case i'm saying stuff
here i wish there's an opportunity to

but maybe we need to reconsider the

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,829
but maybe we need to reconsider the

there was three studies that passed that

there's pros and cons
you're taking risks here to prevent

there well we're not but

there well we're not but
a lot of people argue that that's the

a lot of people argue that that's the

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,829
a lot of people argue that that's the
reason we've nuclear weapons is the

reason we've nuclear weapons is the

and yet they also have the risk of

and yet they also have the risk of
starting world wars and this is what we

starting world wars and this is what we
 

813
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,110
starting world wars and this is what we
have to be honest about

let's look at the experience over those
 

869
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,110
let's look at the experience over those
three years and say is the threshold too

870
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
three years and say is the threshold too
 

871
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,110

easy too hard

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
easy too hard
 

873
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,629
easy too hard
do we need to reconsider it let's look

874
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
do we need to reconsider it let's look
 

875
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,030
do we need to reconsider it let's look
at the experience kovit came along the

876
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
at the experience kovit came along the
 

877
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,870
at the experience kovit came along the
members of the board said please we're

878
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
members of the board said please we're
 

879
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,470
members of the board said please we're
all infectious disease experts we don't

880
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
all infectious disease experts we don't
 

881
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,629
all infectious disease experts we don't
have time for this right now but i think

882
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
have time for this right now but i think
 

883
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,189
have time for this right now but i think
the time is right to do this i'm totally

884
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
the time is right to do this i'm totally
 

885
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,550
the time is right to do this i'm totally
supportive of that and that should be

886
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
supportive of that and that should be
 

887
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,629
supportive of that and that should be
just as public a discussion as you can

888
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
just as public a discussion as you can
 

889
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,470
just as public a discussion as you can
imagine about what are the benefits and

890
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
imagine about what are the benefits and
 

891
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,710
imagine about what are the benefits and
the risk and if somebody decided

892
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
the risk and if somebody decided
 

893
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,790
the risk and if somebody decided
ultimately this came together and said

894
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
ultimately this came together and said
 

895
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,069
ultimately this came together and said
we just shouldn't be doing these

896
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
we just shouldn't be doing these
 

897
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,910
we just shouldn't be doing these
experiments under any circumstances if

898
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
experiments under any circumstances if
 

899
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,590
experiments under any circumstances if
that was the conclusion well that would

900
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
that was the conclusion well that would
 

901
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,590
that was the conclusion well that would
be the conclusion but it hasn't been so

902
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
be the conclusion but it hasn't been so
 

903
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,949
be the conclusion but it hasn't been so
far

904
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
far

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,030
far
if we can briefly look out into the next

if we can briefly look out into the next

i apologize for the existential

i apologize for the existential

i apologize for the existential
questions

questions
 

913
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,030
questions
but

914
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
but
 

915
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,350
but
it seems obvious to me

916
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
it seems obvious to me
 

917
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,230
it seems obvious to me
that as gain of function type of

that as gain of function type of

it will become greater and greater risk

924
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
it will become greater and greater risk
 

925
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,069
it will become greater and greater risk
so if it doesn't no longer need to be

so if it doesn't no longer need to be

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
and don't kill you sorry we're too much
 

993
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,350
and don't kill you sorry we're too much
alike for that to work

incredible accomplishment of science
and so i

1492
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
and so i
 

1493
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,510

the evidence
 

1573
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,510
the evidence
uh it's a summary of the evidence we

1574
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
uh it's a summary of the evidence we
 

1575
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,549
uh it's a summary of the evidence we
have for the effectiveness of masks it

00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
have for the effectiveness of masks it
 

1577

how catastrophic this virus is in the

how catastrophic this virus is in the
early days

1602
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
early days
 

1603
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,350
early days
and

1604
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
and
 

1605
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,669
and
knowing that each word you say may

knowing that each word you say may
 

1607
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,990

it's a philosophical it's an ethical
it's a practical question

1616
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
it's a practical question
 

1617
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,909
it's a practical question
there was a discussion about masks a

1618
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
there was a discussion about masks a
 

1619
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,190
there was a discussion about masks a
century ago

1620
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
century ago
 

1621
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,350
century ago
and that too led to panic

1622

1623
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,870

mind in your mind in the mind of anthony
 

1629
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,710
mind in your mind in the mind of anthony
fauci in those early days knowing that

1630
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
fauci in those early days knowing that
 

1631
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,029
fauci in those early days knowing that
there's limited supply masks

1632
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
there's limited supply masks
 

1633
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,870
there's limited supply masks
like what do you say

1634
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,350
like what do you say
do you fully convey the uncertainty of

do you fully convey the uncertainty of
 

1637
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,750
do you fully convey the uncertainty of

the situation of the

or do you say that masks don't work

1642
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
or do you say that masks don't work
 

1643
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,590
or do you say that masks don't work
that's a complicated calculation

that's a complicated calculation
 

1645
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,389
that's a complicated calculation
how do you make that calculation

1646

how do you make that calculation
 

1647
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,269
how do you make that calculation
it is a complicated calculation

it is a complicated calculation

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,350
it is a complicated calculation
as a scientist your

as a scientist your
temptation would be

temptation would be
 

1653
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,909
temptation would be
to give a full brain dump of all the

down to a recommendation that is the

year trying to figure out how to do a

better job of listening

better job of listening
 

1727
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,750
better job of listening
because i think we have all

because i think we have all
 

1729
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,549
because i think we have all
got the risk of assuming we know the

got the risk of assuming we know the
 

1731
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,190
got the risk of assuming we know the
basis for somebody's hesitancy

1732
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
basis for somebody's hesitancy
 

1733
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,430
basis for somebody's hesitancy
and that often

00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
and that often

doesn't turn out to be what you thought

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,630
doesn't turn out to be what you thought

i think a big concern is just this sense

1742
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
i think a big concern is just this sense
 

1743
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,590
i think a big concern is just this sense
of uncertainty about whether this was

1744
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
of uncertainty about whether this was
 

1745
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,549
of uncertainty about whether this was
done too fast and that corners were cut

1746
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
done too fast and that corners were cut
 

1747
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,430
done too fast and that corners were cut
and

1748
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
and
 

1749
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,389
and
there are good answers to that

1750
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
there are good answers to that
 

1751
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,029
there are good answers to that
along with that a sense that maybe this

1752
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
along with that a sense that maybe this
 

1753
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,590
along with that a sense that maybe this
vaccine will have long-term effects that

1754
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
vaccine will have long-term effects that
 

1755
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,230
vaccine will have long-term effects that
we won't know about for years to come

1756
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
we won't know about for years to come
 

1757
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,630
we won't know about for years to come
and one can say that hasn't been seen

1758
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
and one can say that hasn't been seen
 

1759
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,310
and one can say that hasn't been seen
with other vaccines and there's no

1760
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
with other vaccines and there's no
 

1761
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,830
with other vaccines and there's no
particular reason to think this one's

1762
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:37,840
particular reason to think this one's
 

1763
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,669
particular reason to think this one's
going to be different than the dozens of

1764
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
going to be different than the dozens of
 

1765
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,430
going to be different than the dozens of
others that we have experience with but

1766
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
others that we have experience with but
 

1767
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,750
others that we have experience with but
you can't absolutely say no there's no

1768
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
you can't absolutely say no there's no
 

1769
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,909
you can't absolutely say no there's no
chance of that

1770
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
chance of that
 

1771
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,590
chance of that
so it does

1772
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
so it does
 

1773
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,470
so it does
come down to listening and then trying

1774
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
come down to listening and then trying
 

1775
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,909
come down to listening and then trying
in a

1776
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
in a

you're talking to because that isn't
 

1783
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,789
you're talking to because that isn't
going to help

00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
going to help
 

1785
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,710
going to help
to really address what the substance is

to really address what the substance is
 

1787

who are fearful about this because of

joe are not limited to his taking
 

2083

2097
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,550
by kaiser or at least a hundred thousand
of those were unnecessary deaths of

the reason that it got particular
 

2117
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,910
the reason that it got particular
attention is because of the way in which

2118
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
attention is because of the way in which

that was not good judgment

uh there's a recent review that looks at

2136
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
uh there's a recent review that looks at
 

2137
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,870
uh there's a recent review that looks at
all of the studies of ivormectin and

2138
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
all of the studies of ivormectin and
 

2139
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,030
all of the studies of ivormectin and
basically concludes that it probably

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
basically concludes that it probably
 

2141
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,470
basically concludes that it probably
doesn't work

2142
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
doesn't work

if you look at the data

00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
if you look at the data
 

2223
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,670
if you look at the data
it's obvious that the benefits outweigh

it's obvious that the benefits outweigh

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,030
it's obvious that the benefits outweigh

the risks
 

2227
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,710
the risks
and what joe says

2228
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
and what joe says
 

2229
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,550
and what joe says
is yes but let's

is yes but let's

is yes but let's
still openly talk about risks and he

2232
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
still openly talk about risks and he
 

2233
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,069
still openly talk about risks and he
often brings up anecdotal evidence of

often brings up anecdotal evidence of
 

2235
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,670
often brings up anecdotal evidence of
people who've had

people who've had
 

2237
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,550
people who've had
uh highly negative effects from

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:16,560
uh highly negative effects from

evidence
 

2245
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,349
evidence
and so you could infer a lot of stuff

2246
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
and so you could infer a lot of stuff
 

2247
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,270
and so you could infer a lot of stuff
from the way he expresses it but he also

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,630
from the way he expresses it but he also
communicates a lot of interesting

in our own country here in the u.s it
 

2609
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,910
in our own country here in the u.s it
would be getting those 64 million

2610
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
would be getting those 64 million
 

2611
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,990
would be getting those 64 million
reluctant people to actually go ahead

uh get those of us who are due for
boosters boosted because that's going to

boosters boosted because that's going to
 

2631
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,589
boosters boosted because that's going to
reduce our likelihood of having

2632

reduce our likelihood of having
 

2633
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,870
reduce our likelihood of having
breakthrough infections and keep

2634

uh convince people that until we're
 

2639
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,630
uh convince people that until we're
really done with this and we're not now

2640
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:28,640
really done with this and we're not now

down the number of new infections
 

2647
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,710

most part not even gotten started with
 

2657
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,390
most part not even gotten started with
access to vaccines and we have to figure

00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
access to vaccines and we have to figure
 

2659
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,950
access to vaccines and we have to figure
out a way to speed that up

2660
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
out a way to speed that up
 

2661
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,190
out a way to speed that up
because otherwise that's where the next

that testing
 

2679
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,990
that testing
rapid at home testing from the very

00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,000
rapid at home testing from the very
 

2681
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,230
rapid at home testing from the very
beginning wasn't a big big part of the

2682
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
beginning wasn't a big big part of the
 

2683
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,950
beginning wasn't a big big part of the
solution it seems first of all nobody's

2684
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
solution it seems first of all nobody's
 

2685
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,270
solution it seems first of all nobody's
against it that's one huge plus for

00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
against it that's one huge plus for
 

2687
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,150
against it that's one huge plus for
testing that it's everybody supports

second of all like that's what america

2690
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
second of all like that's what america
 

2691
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,349

information it's such a powerful
 

2709
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,910

i think emphasized like the scaling of
 

2715
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,549
i think emphasized like the scaling of
testing manufacturers so but i just feel

2716
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
testing manufacturers so but i just feel
 

2717
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,390
testing manufacturers so but i just feel
like it's an obvious solution get a test

2718
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
like it's an obvious solution get a test
 

2719
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,349
like it's an obvious solution get a test
that

2720

that
 

2721
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,270

tell whether you've cut back the amount
of infection in the community

2768

of infection in the community
 

2769
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,430

yeah you i'm so with you we got off to

2770
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
yeah you i'm so with you we got off to
 

2771
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,470
yeah you i'm so with you we got off to
such a bad start with testing

2772
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
such a bad start with testing
 

2773
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,069
such a bad start with testing
and of course all the testing was being

2774
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
and of course all the testing was being
 

2775
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,150
and of course all the testing was being
done for the first several months in big

2776
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
done for the first several months in big

where you had to send the sample off and

2780
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
where you had to send the sample off and
 

2781
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,430
where you had to send the sample off and
put it through the mail somehow and get

2782
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
put it through the mail somehow and get
 

2783
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,030
put it through the mail somehow and get
the result back sometimes five days

2784
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
the result back sometimes five days
 

2785
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,549
the result back sometimes five days
later after you've already infected a

dozen people it was just a completely
 

2789
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,710
dozen people it was just a completely
wrong model but it's what we had and

2790
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
wrong model but it's what we had and
 

2791
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,790
wrong model but it's what we had and
everybody was like oh we got to stick

2792
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:08,800
everybody was like oh we got to stick
 

2793
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,030

probably there's going to be false

2800
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
probably there's going to be false
 

2801
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,790
probably there's going to be false
positives and false negatives okay sure

2802
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:18,800
positives and false negatives okay sure
 

2803
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,349

no test is perfect but

2804
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
no test is perfect but
 

2805
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,510

yeah
 

2941

yeah
uh but that brings up a

uh but that brings up a
 

2943
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,990
uh but that brings up a
bigger philosophical question what that

2944

bigger philosophical question what that
 

2945

bigger philosophical question what that
it

00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
there's such a gray area between what is
 

2963
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,549
there's such a gray area between what is
and what isn't ethical

2964

and what isn't ethical
 

2965

well tough issues um certainly animal

2966

well tough issues um certainly animal

research is a tough issue

2968
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:19,760
research is a tough issue
 

2969
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,829
research is a tough issue
i was going to bring up it's a good

2970
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
i was going to bring up it's a good
 

2971
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,589
i was going to bring up it's a good
example of that tough issue is in 2015

00:54:25,589 --> 00:54:25,599
example of that tough issue is in 2015
 

2973

you announced that nih would no longer

involving chimpanzees
 

2979
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,790
involving chimpanzees
so that's like one example of

2980
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
so that's like one example of
 

2981
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,630
so that's like one example of
looking in the mirror

2982
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
looking in the mirror
 

2983
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,030

2985
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,190
thinking deeply about what isn't isn't
ethical and there was a conclusion that

2991
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,870
chimps is not ethical
that was the conclusion that was based

2992
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
that was the conclusion that was based
 

2993
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,710
that was the conclusion that was based
on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of

2994
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of
 

2995

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,829
the issue i mean the question
that i wanted them to look at was are we

or is it time to say that these closest

00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:11,920
or is it time to say that these closest
 

3015
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,829

relatives of ours
 

3017
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,589
relatives of ours
should not be subjected to that any

3018
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
should not be subjected to that any
 

3019
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,510
should not be subjected to that any
further and ought to be retired to a

3020
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:17,520
further and ought to be retired to a
 

3021
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,950
further and ought to be retired to a

3023
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,549

and that was the conclusion that there

and that was the conclusion that there
 

3025
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,990
and that was the conclusion that there
was really no

3026
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,000
was really no
 

3027
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,789
was really no
kind of medical experimentation that

3028
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:24,799
kind of medical experimentation that
 

3029
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,109
kind of medical experimentation that
needed to be done on chimps in order to

3030
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
needed to be done on chimps in order to
 

3031
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,510
needed to be done on chimps in order to
proceed so why are we still doing this

3032
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
proceed so why are we still doing this
 

3033
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,829
proceed so why are we still doing this
many of these were chimpanzees that were

00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
many of these were chimpanzees that were
 

3035
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,670
many of these were chimpanzees that were
purchased because we thought they would

00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
hosts for hiv aids and they sort of
 

3043
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,589

weren't

3044

weren't
 

3045
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,589
weren't
and they were kept around in these

3046
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
and they were kept around in these
 

3047
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,910
and they were kept around in these

up with other things to do but they

3050
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
up with other things to do but they
 

3051
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,390
up with other things to do but they
weren't compelling scientifically so i

3052
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
weren't compelling scientifically so i
 

3053
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,549
weren't compelling scientifically so i
think that was the right decision i took

3054
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
think that was the right decision i took
 

3055
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,390
think that was the right decision i took
a lot of flack from some of the

00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
a lot of flack from some of the
 

3057
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,910
a lot of flack from some of the
scientific community said well you're

3058
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
scientific community said well you're
 

3059
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,549
scientific community said well you're
caving in to the animal rights people

3060

caving in to the animal rights people
 

3061

caving in to the animal rights people
and now that you've said no more

00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,160
and now that you've said no more
 

3063

i think to say all animal research
 

3161
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,190
i think to say all animal research
should be taken off the table

3162
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,200
should be taken off the table
 

3163

the brain initiative is one of those
the brain initiative right now i think

3384
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
the brain initiative right now i think
 

3385
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,870
the brain initiative right now i think
there's about 600 investigators working

on this
uh last week the whole issue of nature

uh last week the whole issue of nature
 

3391
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,030
uh last week the whole issue of nature
magazine was about the output of the

01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,040
magazine was about the output of the
 

3393
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,030
magazine was about the output of the

a cell census of what those cells in the
 

3397
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,230
a cell census of what those cells in the
brain are doing which has just never

3398
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
brain are doing which has just never
 

3399
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,750

been imaginable
 

3401
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,670
been imaginable
and interestingly most uh more than half

3402
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:57,680
and interestingly most uh more than half
 

3403
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,190
and interestingly most uh more than half
of the investigators in the brain

3404
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
of the investigators in the brain
 

3405

01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:05,839
sense i love that maybe partly because
 

3411
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,630
sense i love that maybe partly because
my phd is in quantum mechanics so i

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,950
my phd is in quantum mechanics so i
think it's really a good idea to bring

3414
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:10,960
think it's really a good idea to bring
 

3415
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,029
think it's really a good idea to bring
disciplines together and see what

3416
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:13,039
disciplines together and see what
 

3417
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:13,990
disciplines together and see what
happens

3418
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,000
happens
 

3419
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,309
happens
that's an exciting thing and i

3420
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:16,319
that's an exciting thing and i
 

3421
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,829
that's an exciting thing and i
will not

3422
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
will not
 

3423
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,589
will not
ever forget having the chance to

3424
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:19,599
ever forget having the chance to
 

3425
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,910
ever forget having the chance to
announce that program

3426
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:21,920
announce that program
 

3427
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,910
announce that program
in the east room of that white house

3428

uh barack obama about science he seems

3444
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
uh barack obama about science he seems
 

3445
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,670

01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
and it was like it made me think is
 

3455
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,870
and it was like it made me think is
somebody like whispering in his ear or

3479
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,390
hopeful about
the depth of understanding that a human

3480
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
the depth of understanding that a human
 

3481
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,630
the depth of understanding that a human
being a political office can attain that

question not that he knew what the
 

3533
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,670
question not that he knew what the
answer was going to be but he knew what

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,829
so we all agreed about what the
endpoints had to be and

3734
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839
endpoints had to be and
 

3735
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,750
endpoints had to be and
you wondered why are there 30 000

3736
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:41,760
you wondered why are there 30 000
 

3737
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,349
you wondered why are there 30 000
participants in each of these trials

participants in each of these trials
 

3739
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,510

start before the studies are complete
 

3803
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,030
start before the studies are complete
you start making the vaccines

you start making the vaccines
 

3805
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,950
you start making the vaccines
just in case the if the studies prove to

3806
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:56,960
just in case the if the studies prove to
 

3807
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,430
just in case the if the studies prove to
be positive then you can start deploying

3808
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
be positive then you can start deploying
 

3809
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,510
be positive then you can start deploying
them just like so many

sources of hope in this very
 

3823

hardship experience of the economy and
 

3835
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,550
hardship experience of the economy and
all those kinds of things but to me this

all those kinds of things but to me this
 

3837
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,070
all those kinds of things but to me this
dance

was of vaccine development was done just

3840
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
was of vaccine development was done just
 

3841
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,030
was of vaccine development was done just
beautifully and it gives me hope

3842
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,040
beautifully and it gives me hope
 

3843
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,590
beautifully and it gives me hope
it does me as well and it was in many

it does me as well and it was in many
 

3845
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,309
it does me as well and it was in many
ways the finest hour that science has

3846

so you're incredibly good as the leader

3858
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:53,600
so you're incredibly good as the leader
 

3859
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,070

heck of a lot of fun
why uh why step down from this role

3864
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
why uh why step down from this role
 

3865
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,550
why uh why step down from this role
after so much fun

3866

more than one uh president after being
 

3873
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,870
more than one uh president after being
appointed by one you're sort of done and

the idea of being carried over

3876
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
the idea of being carried over
 

3877
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,630
the idea of being carried over
for a second presidency with trump and

3878
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
for a second presidency with trump and
 

3879
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,470
for a second presidency with trump and
now a third one with biden is unheard of

3880
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
now a third one with biden is unheard of
 

3881
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,390
now a third one with biden is unheard of
i just think lex that scientific

3882
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
i just think lex that scientific

i just think lex that scientific
organizations benefit from new vision

3884

organizations benefit from new vision
 

3885
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,390
organizations benefit from new vision
and 12 years is a really long time to

3886
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
and 12 years is a really long time to
 

3887
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,310
and 12 years is a really long time to
have the same leader

3888
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,320
have the same leader
 

3889
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,070
have the same leader
and if i wasn't going to stick it out

3890
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:30,080
and if i wasn't going to stick it out
 

3891
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,110
and if i wasn't going to stick it out
for the entire biden four-year term

3892
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
for the entire biden four-year term
 

3893
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,669
for the entire biden four-year term

the senate to confirm them which is a
 

3905
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,910
the senate to confirm them which is a
unpredictable process right now and you

unpredictable process right now and you
 

3907
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,910
unpredictable process right now and you
don't want to try to do that in

3908
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
don't want to try to do that in
 

3909
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,149
don't want to try to do that in
the second half of somebody's term as

the second half of somebody's term as
 

3911
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,910
the second half of somebody's term as
president this has got to happen now so

president this has got to happen now so
 

3913
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,149
president this has got to happen now so
i kind of decided back at the end of may

i kind of decided back at the end of may
 

3915

i kind of decided back at the end of may
that this should be my final year

that this should be my final year
 

3917
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,470
that this should be my final year
and i'm okay with that i do have some

3931
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,430
anyway working 100 hours a week it's
just that's what it takes to juggle all

just that's what it takes to juggle all
 

3933
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,709
just that's what it takes to juggle all
of this

of this
 

3935
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,790
of this
and um that keeps me from having a lot

and um that keeps me from having a lot
 

3937

and i wouldn't mind because i don't

3940
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
and i wouldn't mind because i don't
 

3941

having some time
 

3945
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,910
having some time
to really think about what the next

to really think about what the next
chapter should be and i have none of

do i have another calling is there
something else i could contribute that's

3954
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
something else i could contribute that's
 

3955
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,709
something else i could contribute that's
different than this

3956
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
different than this
 

3957
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,630
different than this
i'd like to find that out

3958
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640

 

3959
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,870

i think the right answer is you're just

3960
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880
i think the right answer is you're just
 

3961
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,790
i think the right answer is you're just
uh stepping down to focus on your music

but that that might not be a good plan
 

3969
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,310
but that that might not be a good plan
for anything very sustainable uh but i i

map the the human code which is the
human genome project and you have said

4000
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,280
human genome project and you have said
 

4001
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,110
human genome project and you have said
that it is humbling for me and awe

able to
 

4019
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,510
able to
map this instruction book look into our

it's so fundamental
 

4029
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,910
it's so fundamental
and yet for all of human history we're

4030

and then we crossed the bridge
into the territory of the known

into the territory of the known
 

4041

into the territory of the known
and we had that in front of us still

01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:17,920
and we had that in front of us still
 

4043
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,229
and we had that in front of us still
written in the language that we had to

learn how to read and we're in the
 

4047
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,750
learn how to read and we're in the
process of doing that and will be for

4048
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
process of doing that and will be for
 

4049
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,470
process of doing that and will be for
decades to come but we owned it we had

and there's nothing better uh for trying
to figure out where you are with your

4378
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
to figure out where you are with your
 

4379
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,189
to figure out where you are with your
own

4380
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
own
 

4381
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,270

and uh doing so over a glass of scotch

4392
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,320
and uh doing so over a glass of scotch
 

4393
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,669
and uh doing so over a glass of scotch
or two or three

4394
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:31,679
or two or three
 

4395
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,790
or two or three
uh

4396
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,800
uh
 

4397
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,110
uh
yeah we got off to a rough start uh

4398
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
yeah we got off to a rough start uh
 

4399
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,910
yeah we got off to a rough start uh
where in an interaction we had at a

4400
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
where in an interaction we had at a
 

4401
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,070
where in an interaction we had at a
rather uh highbrow dinner

4402
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
rather uh highbrow dinner
 

4403
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,430
rather uh highbrow dinner
uh he was

4404
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:41,440
uh he was
 

4405
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,830
uh he was
really deeply insulting of a question i

4406
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
really deeply insulting of a question i
 

4407
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,030
really deeply insulting of a question i
was asking

4408

4411
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,870
but you know i was like okay
that's fine let's let's figure out how

4412
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
that's fine let's let's figure out how
 

4413
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,189
that's fine let's let's figure out how
we could have a more civil conversation

4414
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:51,199
we could have a more civil conversation

4425
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,790
it often was
was really

4426
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
was really
 

4427
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,229
was really
inspiring and innovating energizing

4428
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
inspiring and innovating energizing
 

4429

things could get along and that's what i
 

4543
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,110
things could get along and that's what i

01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,120
tried to put forward and then i started
 

4545
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,830
tried to put forward and then i started

4550
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
to become nih director which has just
 

4551
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,189
to become nih director which has just
flourished maybe because i stepped away

4552
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:19,199
flourished maybe because i stepped away
 

4553
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,229

4556
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,040
but
 

4557
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,910
but
it now has millions of people who come

4558
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
it now has millions of people who come
 

4559

4563
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,510
meetings and i think a lot of people
have really come to a sense that this is

4564
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
have really come to a sense that this is
 

4565
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,669
have really come to a sense that this is
okay i can love science and i can love

4566
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
okay i can love science and i can love
 

4567
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,310
okay i can love science and i can love
god and that's not a bad thing

4568
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320
god and that's not a bad thing

in that space
 

4573
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,110
