00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,589
but also when you say basic you mean
basic programming programming language

170
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
basic programming programming language
 

171
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,589
basic programming programming language
okay basic programming you're you're

172
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
okay basic programming you're you're
 

173
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,229
okay basic programming you're you're
writing basic programming language

174
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
writing basic programming language
 

175
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,110
writing basic programming language
on paper on paper and you're calling it

176
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
on paper on paper and you're calling it
 

177
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,470
on paper on paper and you're calling it
programming though it's called

178
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
programming though it's called
 

179
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,229
programming though it's called
programming yeah you're programming this

180
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
programming yeah you're programming this
 

181
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,309
programming yeah you're programming this
computer and you know in a remote

182
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
computer and you know in a remote
 

183
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,470
computer and you know in a remote
location and it came back so it was

184
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
location and it came back so it was
 

185
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,869
location and it came back so it was
truly cloud computing in a way so it was

186
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
truly cloud computing in a way so it was
 

187
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,270
truly cloud computing in a way so it was
really terminal based computing uh and

188
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
really terminal based computing uh and
 

189
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,910
really terminal based computing uh and
the input and the program are separate

190
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
the input and the program are separate
 

191
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,830
the input and the program are separate
so the input to the program or they

192
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
so the input to the program or they
 

193
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,350
so the input to the program or they
could go together like um or is there no

194
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
could go together like um or is there no
 

195
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,190
could go together like um or is there no
input to the program it just runs and it

196
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
input to the program it just runs and it
 

197
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,589
input to the program it just runs and it
gives you output yeah you it goes in and

198
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
gives you output yeah you it goes in and
 

199
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,670
gives you output yeah you it goes in and
says it says ready and then you can say

200
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
says it says ready and then you can say
 

201
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,070
says it says ready and then you can say
run yeah and then it would run but to

202
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
run yeah and then it would run but to
 

203
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,990
run yeah and then it would run but to
program it it you didn't type it because

204
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
program it it you didn't type it because
 

205
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,830
program it it you didn't type it because
it was a printer terminal you would make

206
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
it was a printer terminal you would make
 

207
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,509
it was a printer terminal you would make
the stack of cards and that would get it

208
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
the stack of cards and that would get it
 

209
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,070
the stack of cards and that would get it
into the the computer's memory okay so

210
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
into the the computer's memory okay so
 

211
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,830
into the the computer's memory okay so
where was the magic

212
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
where was the magic
 

213
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,070
where was the magic
the magic was that you could

214
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
the magic was that you could
 

215
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,830
the magic was that you could
create you had a language and you could

216
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
create you had a language and you could
 

217
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,589
create you had a language and you could
create what you wanted to create right

218
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
create what you wanted to create right
 

219
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,830
create what you wanted to create right
you could create a world or or what have

220
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
you could create a world or or what have
 

221
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,830
you could create a world or or what have
you and have this interaction and you

222
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
you and have this interaction and you
 

223
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,630
you and have this interaction and you
could

224
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
could
 

225
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,149
could
compute things you could you know do

226
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
compute things you could you know do
 

227
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,990
compute things you could you know do
numbers you could i was playing oregon

228
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000

so you're less like you can play video

234
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
so you're less like you can play video
 

235

meaning the lowest level code next to

280
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
meaning the lowest level code next to
 

281
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,150
meaning the lowest level code next to
binary yeah which is uh fascinating and

282
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
binary yeah which is uh fascinating and
 

283
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,110
binary yeah which is uh fascinating and
that's the

284
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
that's the
 

285
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,430
that's the
you had to notice the magic

286
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
you had to notice the magic
 

287
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,670
you had to notice the magic
at that low level at that time you

288
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
at that low level at that time you
 

289
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,350
at that low level at that time you
didn't have all the graphics you didn't

290
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
didn't have all the graphics you didn't
 

291
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,710
didn't have all the graphics you didn't
have all the

292
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
have all the
 

293
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,150
have all the
like apis and all the sample codes no

294
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
like apis and all the sample codes no
 

295
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,310
like apis and all the sample codes no
stack overflow no internet none of that

296
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
stack overflow no internet none of that
 

297
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,230
stack overflow no internet none of that
you just had you had to know registers

298
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
you just had you had to know registers
 

299
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,310
you just had you had to know registers
you know had to know the op codes and

300
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
you know had to know the op codes and
 

301
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,830
you know had to know the op codes and
you had to imagine the world in your

302
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
you had to imagine the world in your
 

303
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,590
you had to imagine the world in your
brain of the memory structures and

304
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
brain of the memory structures and
 

305
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,110
brain of the memory structures and
everything else there's no visualization

306
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
everything else there's no visualization
 

307
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,510
everything else there's no visualization
you visualized it all yourself right and

308
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
you visualized it all yourself right and
 

309
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,350
you visualized it all yourself right and
so that was magic but then the next part

310
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
so that was magic but then the next part
 

311
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,350
so that was magic but then the next part
of the magic of where i got hooked even

312
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
of the magic of where i got hooked even
 

313
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,510
of the magic of where i got hooked even
further was like i'm doing these little

314
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
further was like i'm doing these little
 

315
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,550
further was like i'm doing these little
things

316
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
things
 

317
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,870
things
and then electronic arts came out for

318
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
and then electronic arts came out for
 

319
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,790
and then electronic arts came out for
the apple ii so i got an apple ii and

320
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
the apple ii so i got an apple ii and
 

321
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,469
the apple ii so i got an apple ii and
electronic arts came out and i was

322
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
electronic arts came out and i was
 

323
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,150
electronic arts came out and i was
programming and doing basic and making

324
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
programming and doing basic and making
 

325
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,590
programming and doing basic and making
my own games

326
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
my own games
 

327
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,110
my own games
but then there were two games that

328
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
but then there were two games that
 

329
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,990
but then there were two games that
really blew my mind one was pinball

330
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
really blew my mind one was pinball
 

331
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,110
really blew my mind one was pinball
construction set and the other one was

332
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
construction set and the other one was
 

333
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,270
construction set and the other one was
music construction set and these were

334
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
music construction set and these were
 

335
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,510
music construction set and these were
both places where i could create pinball

336
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
both places where i could create pinball
 

337
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,070
both places where i could create pinball
games and i could create musical scores

338
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
games and i could create musical scores
 

339
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,909
games and i could create musical scores
because i loved music and i could then

340
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
because i loved music and i could then
 

341
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,189
because i loved music and i could then
play them right and so when you had that

342
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
play them right and so when you had that
 

343
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,270
play them right and so when you had that
you were like oh there's something very

344
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
you were like oh there's something very
 

345
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,230
you were like oh there's something very
different

346
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
different
 

347
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,150
different
so i could create myself

348
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
so i could create myself
 

349
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,150
so i could create myself
but then there was others that create

350
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
but then there was others that create
 

351
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,309
but then there was others that create
tools so you could create at a visual

352
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
tools so you could create at a visual
 

353
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,309
tools so you could create at a visual
level and then you would read the back

354
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
level and then you would read the back
 

355
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,909
level and then you would read the back
stories because electronics arts back in

356
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
stories because electronics arts back in
 

357
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,469
stories because electronics arts back in
the day it was one programmer who would

358
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
the day it was one programmer who would
 

359
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,070
the day it was one programmer who would
program those things you know each of

360
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
program those things you know each of
 

361
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,430
program those things you know each of
those things and you could read their

362
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
those things and you could read their
 

363
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,830
those things and you could read their
backstories it was literally like like a

364
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
backstories it was literally like like a
 

365
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,510
backstories it was literally like like a
musician or someone else like you could

366
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
musician or someone else like you could
 

367
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,350
musician or someone else like you could
read rick rubin's like here's a thing

368
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
read rick rubin's like here's a thing
 

369
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,110
read rick rubin's like here's a thing
they tell you all that stuff and there

370
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
they tell you all that stuff and there
 

371
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,790
they tell you all that stuff and there
was one guy

372
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
was one guy
 

373
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,950
was one guy
who wrote music construction set he

374
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
who wrote music construction set he
 

375
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,189
who wrote music construction set he
wrote it all in assembly and he was 16

376
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
wrote it all in assembly and he was 16
 

377
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,029
wrote it all in assembly and he was 16
years old wow

378
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
years old wow
 

379
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,510
years old wow
and i went and i was probably 12 or 13

380
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
and i went and i was probably 12 or 13
 

381
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,790
and i went and i was probably 12 or 13
at the time

382
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
at the time
 

383
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,590
at the time
and i went oh my

384
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
and i went oh my
 

385
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,270
and i went oh my
if he was able to do this and had

386
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
if he was able to do this and had
 

387
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,390
if he was able to do this and had
published right and this amazing tool

388
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
published right and this amazing tool
 

389
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,710
published right and this amazing tool
was created i'm like what can i do and

390
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
was created i'm like what can i do and
 

391
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,710
was created i'm like what can i do and
so then it it it just kept building off

392
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
so then it it it just kept building off
 

393
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,029
so then it it it just kept building off
of that but really it was those seminal

394
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
of that but really it was those seminal
 

395
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,710
of that but really it was those seminal
things first the introduction and then

396
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
things first the introduction and then
 

397
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,550
things first the introduction and then
the you know the power through

398
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
the you know the power through
 

399
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,309
the you know the power through
programming and turning these things

400
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
programming and turning these things
 

401
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,710
programming and turning these things
into what you wanted to turn it into and

402
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
into what you wanted to turn it into and
 

403
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,309
into what you wanted to turn it into and
you didn't have to be

404
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
you didn't have to be
 

405
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,350
you didn't have to be
40 50 years old and have you know phds

406
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
40 50 years old and have you know phds
 

407
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,110
40 50 years old and have you know phds
and then i was like okay

408
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
and then i was like okay
 

409
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,510
and then i was like okay
this is really cool i wish we did that

410
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
this is really cool i wish we did that
 

411
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,670
this is really cool i wish we did that
with programmers where we treated them

412
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
with programmers where we treated them
 

413
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,510
with programmers where we treated them
like artists we would know the backstory

414
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
like artists we would know the backstory
 

415
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,629
like artists we would know the backstory
these days today or not just programmers

416
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
these days today or not just programmers
 

417
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,670
these days today or not just programmers
engineers engineers designers yeah like

418
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
engineers engineers designers yeah like
 

419
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,670
engineers engineers designers yeah like
all the things about a product that i

420
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
all the things about a product that i
 

421
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,309
all the things about a product that i
think we love are the little details and

422
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
think we love are the little details and
 

423
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,870
think we love are the little details and
there's probably a human being behind

424
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
there's probably a human being behind
 

425
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,710
there's probably a human being behind
each of those details

426
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
each of those details
 

427
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,270
each of those details
that had their little inkling of genius

428
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
that had their little inkling of genius
 

429
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,950
that had their little inkling of genius
that they put in and i wish we knew

430
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
that they put in and i wish we knew
 

431
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,950
that they put in and i wish we knew
those stories that's always sad to me

432
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
those stories that's always sad to me
 

433
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,950
those stories that's always sad to me
when i because i obviously i love

434
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
when i because i obviously i love
 

435
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,710
when i because i obviously i love
engineering and i interact with

436
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
engineering and i interact with
 

437
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,350
engineering and i interact with
companies and they you know autonomous

438
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
companies and they you know autonomous
 

439
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,710
companies and they you know autonomous
vehicles something i'm really interested

440
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
vehicles something i'm really interested
 

441
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,070
vehicles something i'm really interested
about and i see

442
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
about and i see
 

443
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,830
about and i see
that companies generally and will

444
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
that companies generally and will
 

445
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,670
that companies generally and will
probably talk about this but they they

446
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
probably talk about this but they they
 

447
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,350
probably talk about this but they they
seem to want to hide their engineers

448
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
seem to want to hide their engineers
 

449
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,629
seem to want to hide their engineers
like engineers hold the secrets

450
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
like engineers hold the secrets
 

451
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,350
like engineers hold the secrets
like the great secret we did not speak

452
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
like the great secret we did not speak
 

453
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,950
like the great secret we did not speak
of the greatest great

454
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
of the greatest great
 

455
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,830
of the greatest great
but then the result of that is you don't

456
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
but then the result of that is you don't
 

457
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,230
but then the result of that is you don't
you don't get to hear their stories

458
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
you don't get to hear their stories
 

459
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,950
you don't get to hear their stories
the

460
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
the
 

461
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,950
the
the passion that is there behind the

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
the passion that is there behind the
 

463
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,070
the passion that is there behind the
engineers

464
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
engineers
 

465
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,950
engineers
like and also the genius the little

466
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
like and also the genius the little
 

467
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,309
like and also the genius the little
there's a difference between the stuff

468
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
there's a difference between the stuff
 

469
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,710
there's a difference between the stuff
that's patented like the kernel of the

470
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
that's patented like the kernel of the
 

471
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,270
that's patented like the kernel of the
idea right and and the beautiful sort of

idea right and and the beautiful sort of
 

473
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,110
idea right and and the beautiful sort of
side effects of the idea and i wish

474
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
side effects of the idea and i wish
 

475
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,710
side effects of the idea and i wish
companies revealed the beautiful side

476
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
companies revealed the beautiful side
 

477
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,710
companies revealed the beautiful side
effects a little bit more

478
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
effects a little bit more
 

479
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,589
effects a little bit more
but yeah so sorry for the distraction so

480

but yeah so sorry for the distraction so
what uh you mentioned apple ii what was

482
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
what uh you mentioned apple ii what was
 

483
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,550
what uh you mentioned apple ii what was
the first computer you fell in love with

484
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
the first computer you fell in love with
 

485
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,589
the first computer you fell in love with
like the

486
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
like the
 

487
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,430
like the
the product the thing before you that

488
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
the product the thing before you that
 

489
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,430
the product the thing before you that
was a personal computer

490
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
was a personal computer
 

491
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,029
was a personal computer
it was the apple ii

492
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039

loaded software that you got from

608
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
loaded software that you got from
 

609
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,150

and this was kind of like mp3s and stuff
 

619
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,389
and this was kind of like mp3s and stuff
we were sharing software right so you

we were sharing software right so you
 

621
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,829

you would you you would go in pirate

624
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
you would you you would go in pirate
 

625
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,110
you would you you would go in pirate
that was what called pirate all this

626
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
that was what called pirate all this
 

627
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,790
that was what called pirate all this
software you'd never use it all but it

628
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
software you'd never use it all but it
 

629
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,389
software you'd never use it all but it
was just that fun thing of like i'm

630
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
was just that fun thing of like i'm
 

631
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,910
was just that fun thing of like i'm
gonna get all this other stuff and then

632
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
gonna get all this other stuff and then
 

633
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,990
gonna get all this other stuff and then
tear it apart and do disassembly on it

634
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
tear it apart and do disassembly on it
 

635
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,150
tear it apart and do disassembly on it
and see behind the scenes so you really

636
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
and see behind the scenes so you really
 

637
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,470
and see behind the scenes so you really
had a sense that this was your world and

638
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
had a sense that this was your world and
 

639
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,030
had a sense that this was your world and
you owned it right and you could like

640
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
you owned it right and you could like
 

641
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,550
you owned it right and you could like
literally go into every register we

642
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
literally go into every register we
 

643
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,750
literally go into every register we
didn't have all those security layers

644
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
didn't have all those security layers
 

645
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,750
didn't have all those security layers
like we do not like you could really

646
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
like we do not like you could really
 

647
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,509
like we do not like you could really
touch bits and you could poke bits and

648
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
touch bits and you could poke bits and
 

649
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,590
touch bits and you could poke bits and
you can make this light turn on and you

650
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
you can make this light turn on and you
 

651
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,750
you can make this light turn on and you
know and the geek assignment just lit up

652
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
know and the geek assignment just lit up
 

653
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,509
know and the geek assignment just lit up
now you can there's

654
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
now you can there's
 

655
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,590
now you can there's
it's so abstract you know people don't

656
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
it's so abstract you know people don't
 

657
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,430
it's so abstract you know people don't
even understand like usually you know

658
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
even understand like usually you know
 

659
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,630
even understand like usually you know
some programs don't even understand

660
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
some programs don't even understand
 

661
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,389
some programs don't even understand
memory they just think it's unlimited

662
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
memory they just think it's unlimited
 

663
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,590
memory they just think it's unlimited
right yeah and security it's like now

664
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
right yeah and security it's like now
 

665
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,590
right yeah and security it's like now
there's all this security you should

666
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
there's all this security you should
 

667
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,430
there's all this security you should
have but it's like the adults all showed

668
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
have but it's like the adults all showed
 

669
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,230
have but it's like the adults all showed
up to

670
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
up to
 

671
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,150
up to
to the party and now you can't have all

672
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
to the party and now you can't have all
 

673
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,030
to the party and now you can't have all
the fun right it's like no no you know

674
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
the fun right it's like no no you know
 

675
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,949
the fun right it's like no no you know
this was the thing where if you if if

676
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
this was the thing where if you if if
 

677
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,790
this was the thing where if you if if
the power went out yeah you lost your

678
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
the power went out yeah you lost your
 

679
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,069
the power went out yeah you lost your
whole program you might have worked a

680
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
whole program you might have worked a
 

681
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,750
whole program you might have worked a
whole day on it and if you didn't press

682
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
whole day on it and if you didn't press
 

683
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,150
whole day on it and if you didn't press
save at every other line and you were

684
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
save at every other line and you were
 

685
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,550
save at every other line and you were
saved save save and it would like grow

686
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
saved save save and it would like grow
 

687
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,069
saved save save and it would like grow
the word the disk drive or the tape

688
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
the word the disk drive or the tape
 

689
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,990
the word the disk drive or the tape
drive

690
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
drive
 

691
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,110
drive
like

692
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
like
 

693
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,509
like
every single step was contemplated

694
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
every single step was contemplated
 

695
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,509
every single step was contemplated
because if you didn't you lost maybe a

696
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
because if you didn't you lost maybe a
 

697
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,110
because if you didn't you lost maybe a
ton of work

698
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
ton of work
 

699
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,470
ton of work
so a lot of the magic was in the

700
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
so a lot of the magic was in the
 

701
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,310
so a lot of the magic was in the
software the fact that you could have

702
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
software the fact that you could have
 

703
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,750
software the fact that you could have
software the fact that you could share

704
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
software the fact that you could share
 

705
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,870
software the fact that you could share
software

706
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
software
 

707
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,670
software
the

708
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
the
 

709
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,829
the
in the community around the software it

710
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
in the community around the software it
 

711
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,590
in the community around the software it
wasn't necessarily the hardware well

712
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
wasn't necessarily the hardware well
 

713
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,590
wasn't necessarily the hardware well
that was the first step the second step

714
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
that was the first step the second step
 

715
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,509
that was the first step the second step
around the hardware was i got things

716
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
around the hardware was i got things
 

717
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,670
around the hardware was i got things
like the mockingboard which the

718
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
like the mockingboard which the
 

719
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,269
like the mockingboard which the
mockingboard paired with the music

720
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
mockingboard paired with the music
 

721
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,790
mockingboard paired with the music
instruction set you could now generate

722
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
instruction set you could now generate
 

723
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,790
instruction set you could now generate
all kinds of tones and notes and it was

724
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
all kinds of tones and notes and it was
 

725
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,269
all kinds of tones and notes and it was
a synthesizer in the apple ii so you

726
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
a synthesizer in the apple ii so you
 

727
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,509
a synthesizer in the apple ii so you
would plug in this card and go oh my god

728
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
would plug in this card and go oh my god
 

729
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,350
would plug in this card and go oh my god
look at this and it would you know you

730
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
look at this and it would you know you
 

731
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,430
look at this and it would you know you
could start generating cool sounds

732
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
could start generating cool sounds
 

733
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,829
could start generating cool sounds
you're like like it was a moog you know

734
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
you're like like it was a moog you know
 

735
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,230
you're like like it was a moog you know
like a moog in a way early moog

736
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
like a moog in a way early moog
 

737
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,190
like a moog in a way early moog
what year are we talking about this is

738
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,200
what year are we talking about this is
 

739
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,350
what year are we talking about this is
82 i think

740
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,360
82 i think
 

741
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,949
82 i think
81.82 and i bet you can make all the

742
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
81.82 and i bet you can make all the
 

743
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,269
81.82 and i bet you can make all the
kind of synthetic sounds that are very

744
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
kind of synthetic sounds that are very
 

745
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,190
kind of synthetic sounds that are very
cool in the 80s yeah yeah eight bit you

746
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
cool in the 80s yeah yeah eight bit you
 

747
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,470
cool in the 80s yeah yeah eight bit you
know chip tunes right

748
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480

 

749
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,389

and then um and then you know when you

750
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
and then um and then you know when you
 

751
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,470
and then um and then you know when you
wanted to add a joystick you had to pull

752
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
wanted to add a joystick you had to pull
 

753
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,389
wanted to add a joystick you had to pull
a chip out and you had to like plug in a

754
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
a chip out and you had to like plug in a
 

755
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,710
a chip out and you had to like plug in a
dip socket to put in a joystick and and

756
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
dip socket to put in a joystick and and
 

757
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,310
dip socket to put in a joystick and and
then i was like oh and then i had to get

758
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
then i was like oh and then i had to get
 

759
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,990
then i was like oh and then i had to get
more memory how do we do that and i

760
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
more memory how do we do that and i
 

761
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,470
more memory how do we do that and i
wanted to speed up products so so then

762
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
wanted to speed up products so so then
 

763
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,350
wanted to speed up products so so then
that turned into a company actually

764
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
that turned into a company actually
 

765
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,710
that turned into a company actually
from that but it was in a hardware

766
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
from that but it was in a hardware
 

767
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,590
from that but it was in a hardware
software at that um but it was all about

768
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
software at that um but it was all about
 

769
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,110
software at that um but it was all about
you know modifying this thing in every

770
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
you know modifying this thing in every
 

771
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,949
you know modifying this thing in every
way first was software and then you

772
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
way first was software and then you
 

773
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,389
way first was software and then you
started gaining confidence and then i

774
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
started gaining confidence and then i
 

775
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,750
started gaining confidence and then i
got a little bit more money and stuff

776
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
got a little bit more money and stuff
 

777
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,269
got a little bit more money and stuff
and then you could get into the hardware

778
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
and then you could get into the hardware
 

779
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,829
and then you could get into the hardware
and you know wire things and then the

780
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
and you know wire things and then the
 

781
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,790
and you know wire things and then the
apple ii came with all the schematics

782
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
apple ii came with all the schematics
 

783
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,110
apple ii came with all the schematics
right so in the back

784
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
right so in the back
 

785
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,110
right so in the back
in the early apple twos you could open

786
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
in the early apple twos you could open
 

787
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,110
in the early apple twos you could open
up and all the schematics were there

788
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
up and all the schematics were there
 

789
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,629
up and all the schematics were there
you purchased the apple ii and the

790
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
you purchased the apple ii and the
 

791
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,310
you purchased the apple ii and the
schematics come with it yeah it came

792
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
schematics come with it yeah it came
 

793
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,430
schematics come with it yeah it came
with it

794
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
with it
 

795
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,590
with it
that's an interesting choice that's an

796
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
that's an interesting choice that's an
 

797
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,910
that's an interesting choice that's an
interesting choice from from a company

798
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
interesting choice from from a company
 

799
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,150
interesting choice from from a company
perspective right so it's like a real

800
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
perspective right so it's like a real
 

801
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,910
perspective right so it's like a real
maker kind of thing right

802
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
maker kind of thing right
 

803
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,269
maker kind of thing right
i wonder what they

804
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
i wonder what they
 

805
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,030
i wonder what they
so that was intentional like this is

806
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
so that was intentional like this is
 

807
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,030
so that was intentional like this is
absolutely intentional this is the work

808
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
absolutely intentional this is the work
 

809
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
absolutely intentional this is the work
this is for the cutting edge folks too

810
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
this is for the cutting edge folks too
 

811
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,790
this is for the cutting edge folks too
or especially if it was only the cutting

812
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
or especially if it was only the cutting
 

813
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,509
or especially if it was only the cutting
edge it was geeks for geeks yeah so we

814
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
edge it was geeks for geeks yeah so we
 

815
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,030
edge it was geeks for geeks yeah so we
were like oh how did they make it and

816
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
were like oh how did they make it and
 

817
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,629
were like oh how did they make it and
then we got to learn through that apple

818
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
then we got to learn through that apple
 

819
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,550
then we got to learn through that apple
one did the same thing right it just

820
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
one did the same thing right it just
 

821
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,350
one did the same thing right it just
apple ii became more packaged up and had

822
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
apple ii became more packaged up and had
 

823
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,430
apple ii became more packaged up and had
you know a little bit better software

824
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
you know a little bit better software
 

825
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,670
you know a little bit better software
right came with basic and then you know

826
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
right came with basic and then you know
 

827
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,550
right came with basic and then you know
so so it was really it was it was what

828
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
so so it was really it was it was what
 

829
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,150
so so it was really it was it was what
we might think of as a raspberry pi

830
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
we might think of as a raspberry pi
 

831
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,230
we might think of as a raspberry pi
today or something like that but not

832
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
today or something like that but not
 

833
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,629
today or something like that but not
with so much software it was literally

834
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
with so much software it was literally
 

835
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,910
with so much software it was literally
and all the chips were out there so you

836
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
and all the chips were out there so you
 

837
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,910
and all the chips were out there so you
could inspect the buses and the right

838
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
could inspect the buses and the right
 

839
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,230
could inspect the buses and the right
because everything was just broken out

840
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
because everything was just broken out
 

841
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,150
because everything was just broken out
so i guess

842
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
so i guess
 

843
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,310
so i guess
that's the idea behind

844
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
that's the idea behind
 

845
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,550
that's the idea behind
stable big projects in open source like

846
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
stable big projects in open source like
 

847
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,670
stable big projects in open source like
on github

that you have the schematics there

850
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
that you have the schematics there
 

851
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,629
that you have the schematics there
and it's it's kind of a product but i

852
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
and it's it's kind of a product but i
 

853
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,550
and it's it's kind of a product but i
wonder why more companies don't do that

854
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
wonder why more companies don't do that
 

855
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,310
wonder why more companies don't do that
kind of thing like we're going to

856
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
kind of thing like we're going to
 

857
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
kind of thing like we're going to
release this

877
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,790
full self driving it's kind of like that
it's like selecting a group of people

878
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
it's like selecting a group of people
 

879
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,509
it's like selecting a group of people
but that has to do more with you

880
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
but that has to do more with you
 

881
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,990
but that has to do more with you
how safe of a driver you are versus how

00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
much of a tank carrier you are because
 

885
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,990

you don't get to tinker i wonder is that

886
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
you don't get to tinker i wonder is that
 

887
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,389
you don't get to tinker i wonder is that
is that a crazy idea to to do for really

888
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
is that a crazy idea to to do for really
 

889
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,230
is that a crazy idea to to do for really
cutting-edge technologies especially

890
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
cutting-edge technologies especially
 

891
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,910
cutting-edge technologies especially
you're interested in

892
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
you're interested in
 

893
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,230
you're interested in
like hardware stuff is that is that

894
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
like hardware stuff is that is that
 

895
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,069
like hardware stuff is that is that
crazy why don't more companies do that

896
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
crazy why don't more companies do that
 

897
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,990
crazy why don't more companies do that
kind of thing you think

898
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
kind of thing you think
 

899
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,949
kind of thing you think
i i think back then it was about a

900
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
i i think back then it was about a
 

901
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,790
i i think back then it was about a
community and serving that community of

902
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
community and serving that community of
 

903
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,790
community and serving that community of
builders and now this is about people

904
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
builders and now this is about people
 

905
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,110
builders and now this is about people
who want to take get the experience and

906
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
who want to take get the experience and
 

907
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,710
who want to take get the experience and
want it really simple and easy and

908
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
want it really simple and easy and
 

909
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,350
want it really simple and easy and
they're like and so it is there's the

910
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
they're like and so it is there's the
 

911
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,030
they're like and so it is there's the
the audience or they believe the

912
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
the audience or they believe the
 

913
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,110
the audience or they believe the
audience is small who would value those

914
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
audience is small who would value those
 

915
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,310
audience is small who would value those
other things that we're just talking

916
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
other things that we're just talking
 

917
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,069
other things that we're just talking
about but if we look at things like

918
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
about but if we look at things like
 

919
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,670
about but if we look at things like
raspberry pi and all of these other

920
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
raspberry pi and all of these other
 

921
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,590
raspberry pi and all of these other
little boards right

922
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
little boards right
 

923
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,150
little boards right
there's a whole world more than any that

924
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
there's a whole world more than any that
 

925
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,470
there's a whole world more than any that
i've seen like it's amazing what you can

926
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
i've seen like it's amazing what you can
 

927
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,430
i've seen like it's amazing what you can
do now with these little kits um and and

928
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
do now with these little kits um and and
 

929
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,749
do now with these little kits um and and
and the software that's created and and

930
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
and the software that's created and and
 

931
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,430
and the software that's created and and
and so there's a whole nother i think

932
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
and so there's a whole nother i think
 

933
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,430
and so there's a whole nother i think
another batch of makers and builders

934
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
another batch of makers and builders
 

935
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,110
another batch of makers and builders
that are coming up through the ranks and

936
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
that are coming up through the ranks and
 

937
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,790
that are coming up through the ranks and
if you we look at youtube channels and

938
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
if you we look at youtube channels and
 

939
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,230
if you we look at youtube channels and
stuff right they take these little

940
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
stuff right they take these little
 

941
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,670
stuff right they take these little
boards they hack them then they print

942
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
boards they hack them then they print
 

943
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,550
boards they hack them then they print
out

944
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
out
 

945
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,550
out
you know parts on their 3d printer

946
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
you know parts on their 3d printer
 

947
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,710
you know parts on their 3d printer
assemble them and they create robots and

948
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
assemble them and they create robots and
 

949
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,350
assemble them and they create robots and
what have you so i think it's happening

950
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
what have you so i think it's happening
 

951
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,069
what have you so i think it's happening
um it's just not as you know as it's

952
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
um it's just not as you know as it's
 

953
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,310
um it's just not as you know as it's
just not as i guess

954
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
just not as i guess
 

955
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,389
just not as i guess
raw as it used to be

956
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
raw as it used to be
 

957
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,629
raw as it used to be
um but it's there and it's really

958
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
um but it's there and it's really
 

959
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,069
um but it's there and it's really
expanding around the world and that's

960
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
expanding around the world and that's
 

961
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,150
expanding around the world and that's
really nice to see because you know it's

962
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
really nice to see because you know it's
 

963
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,389
really nice to see because you know it's
a whole new generation uh who can who

964
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
a whole new generation uh who can who
 

965
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,069
a whole new generation uh who can who
are empowered i think there's a

966
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
are empowered i think there's a
 

967
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,749
are empowered i think there's a
semi-dormant

968
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
semi-dormant
 

969
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,430
semi-dormant
genius amongst millions so like

970
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440

raspberry pi is revealing that a little

972
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
raspberry pi is revealing that a little
 

973
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,949
raspberry pi is revealing that a little
bit it's probably

974
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
bit it's probably
 

975
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,030
bit it's probably
i wouldn't be surprised if it's several

976
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
i wouldn't be surprised if it's several
 

977
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,269
i wouldn't be surprised if it's several
million raspberry pies that have been

978
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
million raspberry pies that have been
 

979
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,430
million raspberry pies that have been
sold i think it should

980
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
sold i think it should
 

981
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,910
sold i think it should
and it's kind of this quiet

982
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
and it's kind of this quiet
 

983
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,350
and it's kind of this quiet
storm

984
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
storm
 

985
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,670
storm
of genius brewing of engineers we don't

986
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
of genius brewing of engineers we don't
 

987
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,949
of genius brewing of engineers we don't
get to hear it because they're not

988
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
get to hear it because they're not
 

989
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,949
get to hear it because they're not
organized i mean we get to hear their

990
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
organized i mean we get to hear their
 

991
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,550
organized i mean we get to hear their
inklings here and there like i said

992
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
inklings here and there like i said
 

993
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,710
inklings here and there like i said
youtube there's little communities that

994
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
youtube there's little communities that
 

995
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,230
youtube there's little communities that
are local and so on but if they were

996
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
are local and so on but if they were
 

997

if a leader would emerge no okay so when
 

1003
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,310
if a leader would emerge no okay so when
did you first start to dream about

1004
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
did you first start to dream about
 

1005
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,389
did you first start to dream about
building your own things

1006
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
building your own things
 

1007

designing your own systems
 

1011
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,150
designing your own systems
and software and hardware well in high

1012
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
and software and hardware well in high

school
 

1015
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,150
school
there was a company that

1016
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
there was a company that
 

1017
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,029
there was a company that
um

1018
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
um
 

1019
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,710
um
a friend of mine founded and i was the

1020
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
a friend of mine founded and i was the
 

1021
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,150
a friend of mine founded and i was the
second employee was called quality

1022
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
second employee was called quality
 

1023
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,590
second employee was called quality
computers

1024
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
computers
 

1025
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,350
computers
and it was a male

1026
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
and it was a male
 

1027
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,510
and it was a male
mail order mail order because there's no

1028
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
mail order mail order because there's no
 

1029
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,949
mail order mail order because there's no
e-commerce then there was no internet

1030
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
e-commerce then there was no internet
 

1031
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,630
e-commerce then there was no internet
again yeah you either mailed in your

1032
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
again yeah you either mailed in your
 

1033
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,309
again yeah you either mailed in your
little coupon and you said this is what

1034
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
little coupon and you said this is what
 

1035
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,309
little coupon and you said this is what
i wanted to order or you wrote in to get

1036
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
i wanted to order or you wrote in to get
 

1037
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,630
i wanted to order or you wrote in to get
a catalog and deliver to you you know

1038
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
a catalog and deliver to you you know
 

1039
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,710
a catalog and deliver to you you know
turn around time and this stuff was like

1040
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
turn around time and this stuff was like
 

1041
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,070
turn around time and this stuff was like
from the time you wanted the time you

1042
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
from the time you wanted the time you
 

1043
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,909
from the time you wanted the time you
bought it was maybe eight to twelve

1044
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
bought it was maybe eight to twelve
 

1045
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,750
bought it was maybe eight to twelve
weeks that was just the normal way of

1046
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
weeks that was just the normal way of
 

1047
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,270
weeks that was just the normal way of
getting things

1048
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
getting things
 

1049
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,430
getting things
so quality computers was a mail order

1050
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440

 

1051
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,470

for apple ii and it was software

1052
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
for apple ii and it was software
 

1053
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,630
for apple ii and it was software
and and all kinds of accessories so

1054
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
and and all kinds of accessories so
 

1055
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,390
and and all kinds of accessories so
hardware accessories so hardware plug-in

1056
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
hardware accessories so hardware plug-in
 

1057
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,549
hardware accessories so hardware plug-in
cards joysticks all this stuff

1058
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
cards joysticks all this stuff
 

1059
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,029
cards joysticks all this stuff
and what um we noticed was um there were

1060
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
and what um we noticed was um there were
 

1061
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,510
and what um we noticed was um there were
accelerator cutters or memory cards

1062
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
accelerator cutters or memory cards
 

1063
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,549
accelerator cutters or memory cards
and to be able to use those cards

1064
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
and to be able to use those cards
 

1065
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,549
and to be able to use those cards
you had to actually go and change the

1066
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
you had to actually go and change the
 

1067
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,950
you had to actually go and change the
software you used to access this new

1068
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
software you used to access this new
 

1069
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,870
software you used to access this new
memory so you literally have to go and

1070
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
memory so you literally have to go and
 

1071
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,310
memory so you literally have to go and
you took the program that you had let's

1072
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
you took the program that you had let's
 

1073
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,909
you took the program that you had let's
say was appleworks which was like an

1074
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
say was appleworks which was like an
 

1075
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,669
say was appleworks which was like an
early microsoft office or something like

1076
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
early microsoft office or something like
 

1077
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,630
early microsoft office or something like
that

1078
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
that
 

1079
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,750
that
and you had to literally change the code

1080
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
and you had to literally change the code
 

1081
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,830
and you had to literally change the code
and you would install all these patches

1082
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
and you would install all these patches
 

1083
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,230
and you would install all these patches
to then take advantage of the hardware

1084
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
to then take advantage of the hardware
 

1085
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,549
to then take advantage of the hardware
so what we started creating was software

1086
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
so what we started creating was software
 

1087
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,870
so what we started creating was software
on top of it to do the automatic

1088
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
on top of it to do the automatic
 

1089
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,590
on top of it to do the automatic
installation of all of these patches

1090
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
installation of all of these patches
 

1091
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,510
installation of all of these patches
so we made it much easier to take new

1092
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
so we made it much easier to take new
 

1093
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,549
so we made it much easier to take new
hardware and then and and the existing

1094
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
hardware and then and and the existing
 

1095
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,230
hardware and then and and the existing
software you have and expand it into

1096
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
software you have and expand it into
 

1097
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,390
software you have and expand it into
this new world so it was creating tools

1098
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
this new world so it was creating tools
 

1099
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,150
this new world so it was creating tools
and that really great customer support

1100
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
and that really great customer support
 

1101
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,150
and that really great customer support
and we we started getting a lot of

1102
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
and we we started getting a lot of
 

1103
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,070
and we we started getting a lot of
orders because we had the software make

1104
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
orders because we had the software make
 

1105
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,990
orders because we had the software make
it easier to install to give them the

1106
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
it easier to install to give them the
 

1107
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,350
it easier to install to give them the
superpower

1108
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
superpower
 

1109
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,830
superpower
and at the same time um

1110
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
and at the same time um
 

1111
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,669
and at the same time um
uh you know they they would be able to

1112
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
uh you know they they would be able to
 

1113
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,430
uh you know they they would be able to
change their software and and have a new

1114
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
change their software and and have a new
 

1115
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,430
change their software and and have a new
world that wasn't existing from the

1116
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
world that wasn't existing from the
 

1117
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,430
world that wasn't existing from the
companies that were creating the initial

1118
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
companies that were creating the initial
 

1119
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,549
companies that were creating the initial
products

1120
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
products
 

1121
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,230
products
and so it was more of that and then that

1122
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
and so it was more of that and then that
 

1123
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,830
and so it was more of that and then that
happened with uh

1124
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
happened with uh
 

1125
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,909
happened with uh
hard drives so i wrote a hard drive

1126
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
hard drives so i wrote a hard drive
 

1127
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,430
hard drives so i wrote a hard drive
optimizer for the apple ii to like read

1128
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
optimizer for the apple ii to like read
 

1129
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,270
optimizer for the apple ii to like read
because you could get really fragmented

1130
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
because you could get really fragmented
 

1131
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,950
because you could get really fragmented
so i wrote that piece of software and we

1132
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
so i wrote that piece of software and we
 

1133
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,390
so i wrote that piece of software and we
sold that through the company along with

1134
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
sold that through the company along with
 

1135
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,990
sold that through the company along with
the hard drives that we sold from third

1136
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
the hard drives that we sold from third
 

1137
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,590
the hard drives that we sold from third
parties so

1138
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
parties so
 

1139
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,110
parties so
that all happened in 12th grade uh

1140
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
that all happened in 12th grade uh
 

1141
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,830
that all happened in 12th grade uh
freshman year of college

1142
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
freshman year of college
 

1143
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,310
freshman year of college
you're a hard drive optimizer in 12th

1144
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
you're a hard drive optimizer in 12th
 

1145
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,270
you're a hard drive optimizer in 12th
grade

1146
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
grade
 

1147
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,990
grade
you know yeah between 12th and freshman

1148
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
you know yeah between 12th and freshman
 

1149
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,990
you know yeah between 12th and freshman
year what programming language do you

1150
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
year what programming language do you
 

1151
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,150
year what programming language do you
remember is it assemblies it was there

1152
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
remember is it assemblies it was there
 

1153
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,909
remember is it assemblies it was there
were certain inner loops were assembly

1154
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
were certain inner loops were assembly
 

1155
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,909
were certain inner loops were assembly
and other loops actually there were

1156
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
and other loops actually there were
 

1157
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,750
and other loops actually there were
really early pascal no c um um see

1158
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
really early pascal no c um um see
 

1159
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,390
really early pascal no c um um see
see uh compilers what was the motivation

1160
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
see uh compilers what was the motivation
 

1161
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,150
see uh compilers what was the motivation
behind these is it

1162
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
behind these is it
 

1163
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,990
behind these is it
to make people's lives easier is it to

1164
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
to make people's lives easier is it to
 

1165
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,750
to make people's lives easier is it to
create a thing experience that is

1166
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
create a thing experience that is
 

1167
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,590
create a thing experience that is
simpler and simpler and simpler

1168
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
simpler and simpler and simpler
 

1169
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,669
simpler and simpler and simpler
thereby more accessible to large your

1170
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
thereby more accessible to large your
 

1171
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,430
thereby more accessible to large your
number of people like what or did you

1172
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
number of people like what or did you
 

1173
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,430
number of people like what or did you
just like like to tinker no no it was

1174
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
just like like to tinker no no it was
 

1175
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,430
just like like to tinker no no it was
two things really because one we wanted

1176
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
two things really because one we wanted
 

1177
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,510
two things really because one we wanted
to sell more hardware and software right

1178
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
to sell more hardware and software right
 

1179
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,190
to sell more hardware and software right
so it was like oh make it easier for the

1180
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
so it was like oh make it easier for the
 

1181
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,870
so it was like oh make it easier for the
user and then the other thing was

1182
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
user and then the other thing was
 

1183
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,470
user and then the other thing was
because i was also manning the customer

1184
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
because i was also manning the customer

so we'll jump around a little bit but

1234
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
so we'll jump around a little bit but
 

1235

what were the ideas that gave birth to
 

1239
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,830
what were the ideas that gave birth to
the ipod if we jump

1240
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
the ipod if we jump
 

1241
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,310
the ipod if we jump
forward uh and how far back do those

1242
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
forward uh and how far back do those
 

1243
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,789
forward uh and how far back do those
ideas stretch

1244
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
ideas stretch
 

1245
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,390
ideas stretch
you know if you look at the history of

1246
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
you know if you look at the history of
 

1247
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,190
you know if you look at the history of
technology

1248
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200

 

1249
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,549

there's

1250
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
there's
 

1251
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,430
there's
i mean not just the product but the idea

1252
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
i mean not just the product but the idea
 

1253
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,830
i mean not just the product but the idea
is is truly revolutionary

1254
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
is is truly revolutionary
 

1255
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,510
is is truly revolutionary
maybe

1256
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
maybe
 

1257
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,029
maybe
its time has come

1258
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
its time has come
 

1259
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,990
its time has come
but just if you look at the arc

1260
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
but just if you look at the arc
 

1261
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,510
but just if you look at the arc
of history

1262
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
of history
 

1263
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,750

humanity right and to be able to put
 

1269
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,510
humanity right and to be able to put
that in your

1270
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
that in your
 

1271
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,750
that in your
pocket make it truly portable is

1272
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
pocket make it truly portable is
 

1273
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,630
pocket make it truly portable is
fascinating in in a way

1274
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
fascinating in in a way
 

1275
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,669
fascinating in in a way
that's truly portable so it's digital

1276
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
that's truly portable so it's digital
 

1277
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,830
that's truly portable so it's digital
as opposed to sort of uh like a walkman

1278
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
as opposed to sort of uh like a walkman
 

1279
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,710
as opposed to sort of uh like a walkman
or something like that so

1280
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
or something like that so
 

1281
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,390
or something like that so

sometimes you can't measure those things

1580
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
sometimes you can't measure those things
 

1581
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,870

maybe until many many decades later

1582
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
maybe until many many decades later
 

1583
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
maybe until many many decades later
anyway sorry so that was that was the

1584
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
anyway sorry so that was that was the
 

1585
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,350
anyway sorry so that was that was the
nino that was so that was there and then

1586
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
nino that was so that was there and then
 

1587
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,230
nino that was so that was there and then
there was audible you put books why not

1588
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
there was audible you put books why not
 

1589
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,630
there was audible you put books why not
put music music and i'm carrying around

1590
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
put music music and i'm carrying around
 

1591
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,710
put music music and i'm carrying around
the music for the dj gigs and you're

1592
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
the music for the dj gigs and you're
 

1593
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,549
the music for the dj gigs and you're
like wait a second uh two and two

1594
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
like wait a second uh two and two
 

1595
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,310
like wait a second uh two and two
together right like get let's get rid of

1596
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
together right like get let's get rid of
 

1597
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,950
together right like get let's get rid of
this and so and then mp3 show up

1598
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
this and so and then mp3 show up
 

1599
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,870
this and so and then mp3 show up
the the actual like encoder performance

1600
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
the the actual like encoder performance
 

1601
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,470
the the actual like encoder performance
the format mp3 showed up around

1602
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:27,480
the format mp3 showed up around
 

1603
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,029
the format mp3 showed up around
97.98

1604
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
97.98
 

1605
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,470
97.98
so mp3 is

1606
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
so mp3 is
 

1607
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,230
so mp3 is
is compressed so you can

1608
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
is compressed so you can
 

1609
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,029
is compressed so you can
have uh like the storage is reduced

1610
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
have uh like the storage is reduced
 

1611
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,789
have uh like the storage is reduced
significantly right so you could go from

1612
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
significantly right so you could go from
 

1613
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,430
significantly right so you could go from

four to eight megabytes something like
 

1623
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,470
four to eight megabytes something like
that for the audio now you know that's a

1624
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
that for the audio now you know that's a
 

1625
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,830
that for the audio now you know that's a
reduced quality but you could get it

1626
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
reduced quality but you could get it
 

1627
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,350
reduced quality but you could get it
down there and you're like oh

1628
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360
down there and you're like oh
 

1629
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,990
down there and you're like oh
okay and now if we have enough flash or

1630
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
okay and now if we have enough flash or
 

1631
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,190
okay and now if we have enough flash or
dram we can put 10 15 what have you all

1632
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
dram we can put 10 15 what have you all
 

1633
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,430
dram we can put 10 15 what have you all
in in that same memory and it starts to

1634
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
in in that same memory and it starts to
 

1635
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,830
in in that same memory and it starts to
replicate a cd and then ultimately if

1636
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
replicate a cd and then ultimately if
 

1637
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,669
replicate a cd and then ultimately if
you put it on a hard drive you could

1638
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
you put it on a hard drive you could
 

1639
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,590
you put it on a hard drive you could
start to put you know thousands of songs

1640
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
start to put you know thousands of songs
 

1641
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,110
start to put you know thousands of songs
yeah that's that's also another

1642
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
yeah that's that's also another
 

1643
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,710
yeah that's that's also another
brilliant invention like people don't

1644
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
brilliant invention like people don't
 

1645
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,110
brilliant invention like people don't
realize i think i think people would be

1646
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
realize i think i think people would be
 

1647
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,830
realize i think i think people would be
surprised how big in terms of storage

1648
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
surprised how big in terms of storage
 

1649
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,590
surprised how big in terms of storage
raw audio is

1650
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
raw audio is
 

1651
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,830
raw audio is
and the fact that you can compress it

1652
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
and the fact that you can compress it
 

1653
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,110
and the fact that you can compress it
like

1654
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
like
 

1655
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,549
like
uh

1656
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
uh
 

1657
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,990
uh
i don't know what the compression is but

1658
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
i don't know what the compression is but
 

1659
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,750
i don't know what the compression is but
it's like 10x it's very significant

1660
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
it's like 10x it's very significant
 

1661
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,630
it's like 10x it's very significant
compression and still it sounds almost

1662
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
compression and still it sounds almost
 

1663
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,110
compression and still it sounds almost
lossless much of the chagrin of neil

1664
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
lossless much of the chagrin of neil
 

1665
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,669
lossless much of the chagrin of neil
young who yeah who does not like that

1666
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
young who yeah who does not like that
 

1667
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,510
young who yeah who does not like that
but even even neil young

1668
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
but even even neil young
 

1669
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,830
but even even neil young
even the stuff he talks about is still

1670
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
even the stuff he talks about is still
 

1671
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,710
even the stuff he talks about is still
tiny files relative to the raw right so

1672
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
tiny files relative to the raw right so
 

1673
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,789
tiny files relative to the raw right so
he he wants us to increase it just a

1674
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
he he wants us to increase it just a
 

1675
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,029
he he wants us to increase it just a
little bit more a little bit more but

1676
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
little bit more a little bit more but
 

1677
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,190
little bit more a little bit more but
it's still that's an invention that's a

1678
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,200
it's still that's an invention that's a
 

1679
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,590
it's still that's an invention that's a
thing that unlocks your ability to carry

1680
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
thing that unlocks your ability to carry
 

1681
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,510
thing that unlocks your ability to carry
around a device like nino and listen to

1682
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
around a device like nino and listen to
 

1683
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,590
around a device like nino and listen to
music because without that there's no

1684
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
music because without that there's no
 

1685
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,350
music because without that there's no
way you can carry on a gigantic hard

1686
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
way you can carry on a gigantic hard
 

1687
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,230

drive
 

1689
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,750
drive
right exactly and so so then that so it

1690
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
right exactly and so so then that so it
 

1691
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,430
right exactly and so so then that so it
was mp3s the nino and my you know my my

1692
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
was mp3s the nino and my you know my my
 

1693
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,029
was mp3s the nino and my you know my my
hatred of carrying around all this heavy

1694
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
hatred of carrying around all this heavy
 

1695
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,470
hatred of carrying around all this heavy
stuff that then spawned you know um

1696
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
stuff that then spawned you know um
 

1697
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,350
stuff that then spawned you know um
fused and then ultimately you know

1698

became a lot of that the ideas and

1700
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
became a lot of that the ideas and
 

1701
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,590
became a lot of that the ideas and
things of that nature were

1702
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
things of that nature were
 

1703
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,909

uh you know after i was asked to be a

1762
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
uh you know after i was asked to be a
 

1763
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,310
uh you know after i was asked to be a
consultant to put this thing together

1764
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
consultant to put this thing together
 

1765
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,070

00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
options there was three options
 

1797
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,269
options there was three options
and as i was was i told given very good

1798

advice give to the the two options you

1800
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
advice give to the the two options you
 

1801
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,190
advice give to the the two options you
really do not like but their options and

1802
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
really do not like but their options and
 

1803
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,710
really do not like but their options and
give the best option last because steve

1804
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
give the best option last because steve
 

1805
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,310
give the best option last because steve
will shut you know shoot all those down

1806
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
will shut you know shoot all those down
 

1807
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,269
will shut you know shoot all those down
and give the

1808
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
and give the
 

1809
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,870
and give the
the best option last and then you could

it physical right if you can make the
 

1933
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,070
it physical right if you can make the
intangible tangible like and so i can

1934
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
intangible tangible like and so i can
 

1935
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,750
intangible tangible like and so i can
say look we can make this and i could i

1936
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
say look we can make this and i could i
 

1937

say look we can make this and i could i
brought this whole bag of goods and it

1938
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
brought this whole bag of goods and it
 

1939
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,190
brought this whole bag of goods and it
was like

1940
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
was like
 

1941
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,430
was like
right like here's this here's this this

1942

right like here's this here's this this
 

1943
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,110
right like here's this here's this this
is why double a's won't work and because

1944
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
is why double a's won't work and because
 

1945
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,630
is why double a's won't work and because
it makes it too fat and everything so

1946
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:28,640
it makes it too fat and everything so
 

1947
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,630
it makes it too fat and everything so
just educate everybody through here's

playing in the physical space well i
 

1955
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,350
playing in the physical space well i
would go back and forth so

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
would go back and forth so
 

1957
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,350
would go back and forth so
truth be told because there weren't a

on the mac i was using a pc with vizio

1962
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
on the mac i was using a pc with vizio
 

1963
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,190
on the mac i was using a pc with vizio
and some 3d tools and i was doing 3d

1964
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
and some 3d tools and i was doing 3d
 

1965
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,669
and some 3d tools and i was doing 3d
design at the same time i was taking all

1966
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
design at the same time i was taking all
 

1967
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,509
design at the same time i was taking all
these physical parts and going okay what

1968
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
these physical parts and going okay what
 

1969
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,750
these physical parts and going okay what
feels right because you have to go from

1970
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
feels right because you have to go from
 

1971
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,990
feels right because you have to go from
you know the details and then the rough

1972
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,000
you know the details and then the rough
 

1973
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,190
you know the details and then the rough
and you go back and forth and you

1974
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
and you go back and forth and you
 

1975
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,750
and you go back and forth and you
iterate right and so it was just a lot

1976
00:33:59,750 --> 00:33:59,760
iterate right and so it was just a lot
 

1977
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,430
iterate right and so it was just a lot
of fun and then i ultimately ended up

1978
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
of fun and then i ultimately ended up
 

1979
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,750
of fun and then i ultimately ended up
with a styrofoam model and printouts

1980
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
with a styrofoam model and printouts
 

1981
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,549
with a styrofoam model and printouts
that came from vizio that i glued

1982
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559
that came from vizio that i glued
 

1983
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,149
that came from vizio that i glued
together and put my grandfather's

1984
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
together and put my grandfather's
 

1985
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,510
together and put my grandfather's
fishing weights in because i also

1986
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520
fishing weights in because i also
 

1987
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,270
fishing weights in because i also
modeled the weights

1988
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
modeled the weights
 

1989
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,349
modeled the weights
right so i i said oh this is this many

1990
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:13,359
right so i i said oh this is this many
 

1991
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,589
right so i i said oh this is this many
ounces this is this many ounces in grams

1992
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
ounces this is this many ounces in grams
 

1993
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,430
ounces this is this many ounces in grams
and then i went and got all that and

1994
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
and then i went and got all that and
 

1995
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,109
and then i went and got all that and
made the weighted these styrofoam models

1996
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
made the weighted these styrofoam models
 

1997
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,109
made the weighted these styrofoam models
to then match that so when you picked it

1998
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
to then match that so when you picked it
 

1999
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,030
to then match that so when you picked it
up it felt more or less form factor

2000
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
up it felt more or less form factor
 

2001
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,950
up it felt more or less form factor
right and it also you felt

2002
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
right and it also you felt
 

2003
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,629
right and it also you felt
how much you know was it going to be

2004
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
how much you know was it going to be
 

2005
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,629
how much you know was it going to be
dense enough is it going to feel solid

2006
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
dense enough is it going to feel solid
 

2007
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,829
dense enough is it going to feel solid
and rigid in your hand

2008
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:32,839
and rigid in your hand
 

2009
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,829
and rigid in your hand
right why does need to feel rigid

2010
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
right why does need to feel rigid
 

2011
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,669
right why does need to feel rigid
because it has to feel substantial it

2012
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
because it has to feel substantial it
 

2013
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,589
because it has to feel substantial it
has to feel like i have like a like a

2014
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
has to feel like i have like a like a
 

2015
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,069
has to feel like i have like a like a
bar of gold in my hand right you know

2016
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
bar of gold in my hand right you know
 

2017
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,990
bar of gold in my hand right you know
maybe you know this when you open and

2018
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
maybe you know this when you open and
 

2019
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,310
maybe you know this when you open and
close a car door you know that thunk and

2020
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
close a car door you know that thunk and
 

2021
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,389
close a car door you know that thunk and
you go bam and you go that feels solid

2022
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
you go bam and you go that feels solid
 

2023
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,829
you go bam and you go that feels solid
that feels real and then you get this

2024
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
that feels real and then you get this
 

2025
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,389
that feels real and then you get this
tinny car that's like ding and you're

2026
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
tinny car that's like ding and you're
 

2027
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,790
tinny car that's like ding and you're
like does this feel safe does this feel

2028
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
like does this feel safe does this feel
 

2029
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,109
like does this feel safe does this feel
like a value and so you when you have a

2030
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:57,119
like a value and so you when you have a
 

2031
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,030
like a value and so you when you have a
device like that and you you want to

2032
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
device like that and you you want to
 

2033
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,470
device like that and you you want to
make sure that there's not too much air

2034
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
make sure that there's not too much air
 

2035
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,510
make sure that there's not too much air
in it that

2036
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
in it that
 

2037
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,990
in it that
you've distributed the density of the

2038
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
you've distributed the density of the
 

2039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,470
you've distributed the density of the
masses in the right way so it feels like

2040
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
masses in the right way so it feels like
 

2041
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,390
masses in the right way so it feels like
it's the right thing so you have to

2042
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
it's the right thing so you have to
 

2043
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,510
it's the right thing so you have to
model battery life costs

2044
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
model battery life costs
 

2045
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,030
model battery life costs
uh you know

2046
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
uh you know
 

2047
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,870
uh you know
mass

2048
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
mass
 

2049
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,310
mass
sizes of different things and then you

2050
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
sizes of different things and then you
 

2051
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,990
sizes of different things and then you
have to also think about what the ui is

2052
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
have to also think about what the ui is
 

2053
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,670
have to also think about what the ui is
going to look like right so you have all

2054
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
going to look like right so you have all
 

2055
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,510
going to look like right so you have all
of these constraints your work variables

2056
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
of these constraints your work variables
 

2057
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,349
of these constraints your work variables
you're working with and you have to kind

2058
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
you're working with and you have to kind
 

2059
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,270
you're working with and you have to kind
of you know you can't get the perfect of

2060
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
of you know you can't get the perfect of
 

2061
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,069
of you know you can't get the perfect of
everything what's the best you know

2062
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
everything what's the best you know
 

2063
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,150
everything what's the best you know
local maximum of all of these components

2064
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
local maximum of all of these components
 

2065
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,829
local maximum of all of these components
that come together to provide an

trade-offs what about buttons

2070
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
trade-offs what about buttons
 

2071
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,109
trade-offs what about buttons
buttons well there was also the buttons

2072
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
buttons well there was also the buttons
 

2073
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,950
buttons well there was also the buttons
too right oh by the way a lot of these

2074
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
too right oh by the way a lot of these
 

2075
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,950
too right oh by the way a lot of these
battles fought inside your mind or is it

overwhelmed by the doubt of that because
 

2147
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,390
overwhelmed by the doubt of that because
so many things have to work plus the

you kind of get a rule of thumb and you

2168
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
you kind of get a rule of thumb and you
 

2169
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,190
you kind of get a rule of thumb and you
know what to focus on at the beginning

2170
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
know what to focus on at the beginning
 

2171
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,349
know what to focus on at the beginning
and what not to worry about over time

2172
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
and what not to worry about over time
 

2173
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,710
and what not to worry about over time
like when i was early in my career i

2174
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
like when i was early in my career i
 

2175
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,829
like when i was early in my career i
worried about everything on the

2176
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
worried about everything on the
 

2177
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,670
worried about everything on the
engineering details so much so that you

2178
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:17,680
engineering details so much so that you
 

2179
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,910
engineering details so much so that you
know i would be a nervous wreck sooner

2180
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:19,920
know i would be a nervous wreck sooner
 

2181
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,589
know i would be a nervous wreck sooner
or later you learn how to filter out and

2182
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
or later you learn how to filter out and
 

2183
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,990
or later you learn how to filter out and
figure out what to prioritize and so 10

2184
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
figure out what to prioritize and so 10
 

2185
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,230
figure out what to prioritize and so 10
years later you know i was able to much

2186
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,240
years later you know i was able to much
 

2187
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,310
years later you know i was able to much
do a much better job of filtering out

2188
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
do a much better job of filtering out
 

2189
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,550
do a much better job of filtering out
the things of like we'll get to that in

2190
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
the things of like we'll get to that in
 

2191
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,230
the things of like we'll get to that in
you know in weeks to come but right now

2192
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
you know in weeks to come but right now
 

2193
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,270
you know in weeks to come but right now
we got to like solve you know the very

2194
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
we got to like solve you know the very
 

2195
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,670
we got to like solve you know the very
important things which is is could this

2196
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
important things which is is could this
 

2197
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,430
important things which is is could this
actually be something real and that you

2198
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
actually be something real and that you
 

2199
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,510
actually be something real and that you
could deliver you know enough battery

2200
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
could deliver you know enough battery
 

2201
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,109
could deliver you know enough battery
life right enough of an interface um of

2202
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
life right enough of an interface um of
 

2203
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,470
life right enough of an interface um of
the right cost

2204
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
the right cost
 

2205
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,630
the right cost
right in the right right uh right price

2206
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640
right in the right right uh right price
 

2207
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,470
right in the right right uh right price
point so you already you were sitting on

2208
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
point so you already you were sitting on
 

2209
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,710
point so you already you were sitting on
on a track record of successes and

2210
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
on a track record of successes and
 

2211
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,430
on a track record of successes and
failures in your own mind where you had

2212
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
failures in your own mind where you had
 

2213
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,230
failures in your own mind where you had
sort of already a confidence a calm a

2214
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,240
sort of already a confidence a calm a
 

2215
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,349
sort of already a confidence a calm a
calmness

2216
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
calmness
 

2217
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,109

uh but still
 

2219
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,870
uh but still
was there a doubt that you can get this

2220
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:02,880
was there a doubt that you can get this
 

2221
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,470
was there a doubt that you can get this
done always

2222
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
done always
 

2223
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,630
done always
always how hard is it to achieve a sort

2224
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
always how hard is it to achieve a sort
 

2225
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,310
always how hard is it to achieve a sort
of a confidence

2226
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
of a confidence
 

2227
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,829
of a confidence
to a level where you could present it to

2228
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
to a level where you could present it to
 

2229
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,589
to a level where you could present it to
steve and actually believe that this is

2230
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
steve and actually believe that this is
 

2231
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,270

3017
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,230
us why people need it and so they create
a story around this product

3018
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
a story around this product
 

3019
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,910
a story around this product

00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
starts telling a story and it turns out
 

3027
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,750
starts telling a story and it turns out
to be a fictional story usually they say

3028
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
to be a fictional story usually they say
 

3029
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,069
to be a fictional story usually they say
oh this is going to do these things

3030
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
oh this is going to do these things
 

3031
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,069
oh this is going to do these things
the product comes in is delivered and it

3032
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:08,079

3033
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,990
the product comes in is delivered and it
falls flat on its face

3034
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000

we need to save 20 of energy let's say
right and then marketing turns that into

3310
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
right and then marketing turns that into
 

3311
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,069
right and then marketing turns that into
something that's with creative and

3312
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
something that's with creative and
 

3313
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,829
something that's with creative and
everything and brings that message

3314
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:53,839
everything and brings that message
 

3315
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,190
everything and brings that message
across maybe it doesn't say that but it

3316
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
across maybe it doesn't say that but it
 

3317
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,069
across maybe it doesn't say that but it
comes maybe visually or some other way

make sure they're not telling a
fictional story right because they could

and then the product can't deliver that

3336
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
and then the product can't deliver that
 

3337
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,030
and then the product can't deliver that
it's like no no no no no keeps

00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:25,760
they're always representing the customer
 

3347
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,470
they're always representing the customer
so

3348
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,480
so
 

3349
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,549
so
you have to have a product manager

3350
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
you have to have a product manager
 

3351
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,630
you have to have a product manager
typically that's the founder

3352
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:30,640
typically that's the founder
 

3353
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,230
typically that's the founder
right in the beginning

3354
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
right in the beginning
 

3355
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,710
right in the beginning
and then over time you hire a product

01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,789
we talked about that you know joy that
comes from it

4004
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
comes from it
 

4005
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,269
comes from it
but then there's the behind the scenes

4006
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:31,279
but then there's the behind the scenes
 

4007
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,030
but then there's the behind the scenes
there's the team

4008
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,040
there's the team
 

4009
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,189
there's the team
there's everyone who brings it to life

4010
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
there's everyone who brings it to life
 

4011
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,470
there's everyone who brings it to life
brings that story to life

4012
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,480
brings that story to life
 

4013
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,470
brings that story to life
if you have a great story

4014
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:40,480
if you have a great story
 

4015
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,149
if you have a great story
and you know the why then you can

4016
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:42,159
and you know the why then you can
 

4017
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:44,390
and you know the why then you can
communicate it to those people who are

4018
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
communicate it to those people who are
 

4019
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,910
communicate it to those people who are
working on it

4020
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
working on it
 

4021
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,749
working on it
and then they bring their own thing into

4022
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
and then they bring their own thing into
 

4023
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:48,470
and then they bring their own thing into
it

4024
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
it
 

4025
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,110
it
right it becomes emotional for them too

4026
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
right it becomes emotional for them too
 

4027
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,470
right it becomes emotional for them too
it's not just a job it's a mission

4028
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480
it's not just a job it's a mission
 

4029
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,310
it's not just a job it's a mission
and so many of the details that are born

4030
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
and so many of the details that are born
 

4031
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,990
and so many of the details that are born
out of these

4032
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,000
out of these
 

4033
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,030
out of these
early prototypes these things that you

4034
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
early prototypes these things that you
 

4035
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,950
early prototypes these things that you
still haven't given full form to there

4036
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
still haven't given full form to there
 

4037
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,590
still haven't given full form to there
may be eighty percent done or maybe even

4038
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
may be eighty percent done or maybe even
 

4039
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,430
may be eighty percent done or maybe even
sixty percent done but you can see

4040
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:09,440
sixty percent done but you can see
 

4041
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,630
sixty percent done but you can see
enough in there

4042
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
enough in there
 

4043
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,870
enough in there
then you take those great ideas and you

4044
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880
then you take those great ideas and you
 

4045
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,110
then you take those great ideas and you
give the why's to the team

4046
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
give the why's to the team
 

4047
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,950
give the why's to the team
and so that they feel it

4048
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
and so that they feel it
 

4049
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,430
and so that they feel it
they can understand it then they bring

4050
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
they can understand it then they bring
 

4051
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,510
they can understand it then they bring
their best and their ideas

4052
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
their best and their ideas
 

4053
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,510
their best and their ideas
to the table and then you can select

4054
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
to the table and then you can select
 

4055
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,390
to the table and then you can select
from those and you can then start to

4056
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
from those and you can then start to
 

4057
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,750
from those and you can then start to
um you know

4058
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
um you know
 

4059
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,990
um you know
it could be just a pixel change it could

4060
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
it could be just a pixel change it could
 

4061
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,750
it could be just a pixel change it could
be a slight change on how you do the

4062
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
be a slight change on how you do the
 

4063
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,709
be a slight change on how you do the
audio for the feedback or maybe a curve

4064
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
audio for the feedback or maybe a curve
 

4065
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,630
audio for the feedback or maybe a curve
on the mechanics or something like that

4066
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
on the mechanics or something like that
 

4067
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,030
on the mechanics or something like that
of how it feels because everybody brings

4068
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
of how it feels because everybody brings
 

4069
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,350
of how it feels because everybody brings
themselves trying to you know feel this

4070
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
themselves trying to you know feel this
 

4071
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,550
themselves trying to you know feel this
thing they're not just doing something

4072
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
thing they're not just doing something
 

4073

if you can instill that mission and that
 

4077
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,709
if you can instill that mission and that
why into that team it doesn't have to be

4078
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
why into that team it doesn't have to be
 

4079
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,630
why into that team it doesn't have to be
big you get

4080

because you know a lot of stuff you

4168
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:09,120
because you know a lot of stuff you
 

4169
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,350
because you know a lot of stuff you
don't know is some of that stuff is

4170
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,360
don't know is some of that stuff is
 

4171
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,390
don't know is some of that stuff is
hacked in

4172
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
hacked in
 

4173
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,630
hacked in
maybe hacked in at the end it might it

4174
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
maybe hacked in at the end it might it
 

4175
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,310
maybe hacked in at the end it might it
it may not be the most beautiful

4176
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
it may not be the most beautiful
 

4177
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,669
it may not be the most beautiful
architecture that a geek would look at

4178
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
architecture that a geek would look at
 

4179
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,590
architecture that a geek would look at
and go oh my god that's so beautiful

4180
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
and go oh my god that's so beautiful
 

4181
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,270
and go oh my god that's so beautiful
because we can look at and visualize

4182
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,280
because we can look at and visualize
 

4183
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,510
because we can look at and visualize
this incredible software stack or

4184
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
this incredible software stack or
 

4185
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,350
this incredible software stack or
hardware stack some of it could just be

4186
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:25,360
hardware stack some of it could just be
 

4187
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,550
hardware stack some of it could just be
hacked in

4188
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
hacked in
 

4189
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,470
hacked in
you make it better over time but it was

4190
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:28,480
you make it better over time but it was
 

4191
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,830
you make it better over time but it was
that brilliant thing and we got to get

4192
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
that brilliant thing and we got to get
 

4193
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,750
that brilliant thing and we got to get
that in because that's the way you do it

4194
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
that in because that's the way you do it
 

4195
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,510
that in because that's the way you do it
now and we'll make it more efficient

4196
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
now and we'll make it more efficient
 

4197
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,189
now and we'll make it more efficient
later

4198
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
later
 

4199
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,910
later
maybe this is a good moment to draw a

4200
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
maybe this is a good moment to draw a
 

4201
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,350
maybe this is a good moment to draw a
distinction between design and

4202
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,360
distinction between design and
 

4203
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,430
distinction between design and
engineering and does such a distinction

4204
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
engineering and does such a distinction
 

4205
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,750
engineering and does such a distinction
even exist

4206
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
even exist
 

4207
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,390
even exist
are these distinct disciplines or no i

4208
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
are these distinct disciplines or no i
 

4209
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,830
are these distinct disciplines or no i
don't think they're just distinct i

4210
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840
don't think they're just distinct i
 

4211
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,830
don't think they're just distinct i
think they're different types of design

4212
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:49,840
think they're different types of design
 

4213
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,750
think they're different types of design
i think there's you know there's always

4214
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
i think there's you know there's always
 

4215
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,669
i think there's you know there's always
this you know this

4216
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
this you know this
 

4217
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,950
this you know this
idea of this oh on the mount designer

4218
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:56,960
idea of this oh on the mount designer
 

4219
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,189
idea of this oh on the mount designer
and it all comes down and it all flows

4220
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
and it all comes down and it all flows
 

4221
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,750
and it all comes down and it all flows
down like some magic

4222
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
down like some magic
 

4223
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,669
down like some magic
it's not there are electrical designs

4224
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
it's not there are electrical designs
 

4225
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,149
it's not there are electrical designs
there's ai designers there is data

4226
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
there's ai designers there is data
 

4227
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,270
there's ai designers there is data
scientist designers everybody has design

4228
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
scientist designers everybody has design
 

4229
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,709
scientist designers everybody has design
and there's a chapter in the book all

4230
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
and there's a chapter in the book all
 

4231
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,990
and there's a chapter in the book all
about that actually that it's not just

4232
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,000
about that actually that it's not just
 

4233
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,590
about that actually that it's not just
you go to the mount and it comes down

4234
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
you go to the mount and it comes down
 

4235
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,310
you go to the mount and it comes down
and you're enlightened it's each person

4236
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320
and you're enlightened it's each person
 

4237
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,709
and you're enlightened it's each person
brings their their form of design and

4238
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
brings their their form of design and
 

4239
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,430
brings their their form of design and
their craft because what if they're

4240
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
their craft because what if they're
 

4241
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,030
their craft because what if they're
really good they're artists in their own

4242
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,040
really good they're artists in their own
 

4243
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,709
really good they're artists in their own
right they're not just engineers they're

4244
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:26,719
right they're not just engineers they're
 

4245
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,790
right they're not just engineers they're
not just design they're artists they're

4246
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
not just design they're artists they're
 

4247
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,310
not just design they're artists they're
empathetic they really want to bring

4248
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
empathetic they really want to bring
 

4249
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,910
empathetic they really want to bring
their best a lot of the best engineers i

4250
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:31,920
their best a lot of the best engineers i
 

4251
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,910
their best a lot of the best engineers i
have are not the technical or that i've

4252
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920
have are not the technical or that i've
 

4253
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,310
have are not the technical or that i've
worked with are not the technical

4254
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320
worked with are not the technical
 

4255
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,390
worked with are not the technical
gotta get it exactly right they're the

4256
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
gotta get it exactly right they're the
 

4257
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,910
gotta get it exactly right they're the
artists they came from music or they

4258
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
artists they came from music or they
 

4259
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,149
artists they came from music or they
came from other things and they they see

4260
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
came from other things and they they see
 

4261
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,669
came from other things and they they see
that right when you work with very rigid

4262
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
that right when you work with very rigid
 

4263
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:46,870
that right when you work with very rigid
engineers

4264
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
engineers
 

4265
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,270
engineers
this is the way the only way

4266
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
this is the way the only way
 

4267
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,709
this is the way the only way
those are not the engineers i want to

4268
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:50,719
those are not the engineers i want to
 

4269
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,229
those are not the engineers i want to
work with

4270
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:52,239
work with
 

4271
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,630
work with
they're all like a bit artists at heart

4272
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:54,640
they're all like a bit artists at heart
 

4273
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,669
they're all like a bit artists at heart
right they they understand the practical

4274
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:57,679
right they they understand the practical
 

4275
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,270
right they they understand the practical
practicalness

4276
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
practicalness
 

4277
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,189
practicalness
they don't have to have the rigidity of

4278
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
they don't have to have the rigidity of
 

4279
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,790
they don't have to have the rigidity of
this is the way it's done like

4280
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
this is the way it's done like
 

4281
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,030
this is the way it's done like
where if you're building something new

4282
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,040
where if you're building something new
 

4283
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,510
where if you're building something new
all new and revolutionary none of us are

4284
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:09,520
all new and revolutionary none of us are
 

4285
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,750
all new and revolutionary none of us are
experts at it

4286
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
experts at it
 

4287
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,669
experts at it
and if you come with that expert mindset

4288
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
and if you come with that expert mindset
 

4289
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,270
and if you come with that expert mindset
just tell me and i can give you a story

4290
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,280
just tell me and i can give you a story
 

4291
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,310
just tell me and i can give you a story
i should probably give you that story um

4292
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
i should probably give you that story um
 

4293
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,750
i should probably give you that story um
about that if you come with the expert

4294
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
about that if you come with the expert
 

4295
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,510
about that if you come with the expert
and i'm the expert when you're doing

4296
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
and i'm the expert when you're doing
 

4297
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,590
and i'm the expert when you're doing
something no one's ever done before

4298
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
something no one's ever done before
 

4299
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,350
something no one's ever done before
i don't want you on the team

4300
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:25,360
i don't want you on the team
 

4301
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,030
i don't want you on the team
because we all are learning about

4302
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,040
because we all are learning about
 

4303
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,189
because we all are learning about
something that has never been

4304
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:29,199
something that has never been
 

4305
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,430
something that has never been
in existence before and we have to bring

4306
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
in existence before and we have to bring
 

4307
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,229
in existence before and we have to bring
that level of vulnerability and openness

4308
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:34,239
that level of vulnerability and openness
 

4309
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,470
that level of vulnerability and openness
to new ideas and new ways of doing

4310
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
to new ideas and new ways of doing
 

4311
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,510
to new ideas and new ways of doing
things

4312
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:37,520
things
 

4313
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,430
things
throughout the team

4314
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:39,440
throughout the team
 

4315
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,470
throughout the team
so you want people that are able to have

4316
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
so you want people that are able to have
 

4317
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,870
so you want people that are able to have
like beginner's mind or whatever like

4318
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
like beginner's mind or whatever like
 

4319
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,470
like beginner's mind or whatever like
don't don't come in as an expert what's

4320
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
don't don't come in as an expert what's
 

4321
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,390
don't don't come in as an expert what's
the story okay you're not a story okay

4322
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,400
the story okay you're not a story okay
 

4323
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,830
the story okay you're not a story okay
all right no i i can tell it's just all

4324
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:49,840
all right no i i can tell it's just all
 

4325
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,790
all right no i i can tell it's just all
right

4326
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
right
 

4327
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,070
right
so

4328
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
so
 

4329
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,950
so
so

4330
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:52,960
so
 

4331
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,790
so
you know you asked what were these risks

4332
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:54,800
you know you asked what were these risks
 

4333
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,630
you know you asked what were these risks
you know like on the early ipod and

4334
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
you know like on the early ipod and
 

4335
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,229
you know like on the early ipod and
there's there was there's a few big

4336
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:58,239
there's there was there's a few big
 

4337
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,390
there's there was there's a few big
risks like one and this this doesn't go

4338
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:00,400
risks like one and this this doesn't go
 

4339
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,390
risks like one and this this doesn't go
in the story but like putting rotating

4340
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
in the story but like putting rotating
 

4341
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,790
in the story but like putting rotating
media in your pocket and it could drop

4342
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
media in your pocket and it could drop
 

4343
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,189
media in your pocket and it could drop
at any time what happens there and like

4344
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
at any time what happens there and like
 

4345
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,950
at any time what happens there and like
you can damage because the heads and the

4346
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:08,960
you can damage because the heads and the
 

4347
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,910
you can damage because the heads and the
hard drive media are so close it smacks

4348
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
hard drive media are so close it smacks
 

4349
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,550
hard drive media are so close it smacks
it's dead right so that was one big one

4350
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
it's dead right so that was one big one
 

4351
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,870
it's dead right so that was one big one
like is holy right so that was

4352
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:16,880
like is holy right so that was
 

4353
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,070
like is holy right so that was
something we and we had to design

4354
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,080
something we and we had to design
 

4355
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,669
something we and we had to design
special tests and everything and special

4356
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
special tests and everything and special
 

4357
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,350
special tests and everything and special
software on that but then there was

4358
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
software on that but then there was
 

4359
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,470
software on that but then there was
another one which was at the early days

4360
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
another one which was at the early days
 

4361
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,790
another one which was at the early days
the way the first generations of ipods i

4362
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
the way the first generations of ipods i
 

4363
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,310
the way the first generations of ipods i
had to hack

4364
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
had to hack
 

4365
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,350
had to hack
the i had to hack the ide interface to

4366
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:31,360
the i had to hack the ide interface to
 

4367
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,709
the i had to hack the ide interface to
the hard drives

4368
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:32,719
the hard drives
 

4369
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:33,910
the hard drives
so i was like okay what we're going to

4370
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:33,920
so i was like okay what we're going to
 

4371
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,750
so i was like okay what we're going to
use is we're going to use this chip for

4372
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
use is we're going to use this chip for
 

4373
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,590
use is we're going to use this chip for
hard drive um hard drive to make a hard

4374
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
hard drive um hard drive to make a hard
 

4375
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,270
hard drive um hard drive to make a hard
drive you had to have a chip that did

4376
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:41,280
drive you had to have a chip that did
 

4377
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,910
drive you had to have a chip that did
firewire to a hard drive okay and then

4378
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
firewire to a hard drive okay and then
 

4379
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,630
firewire to a hard drive okay and then
that would become a portable hard drive

4380
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
that would become a portable hard drive
 

4381
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,189
that would become a portable hard drive
well then we had up

4382
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
well then we had up
 

4383
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,270
well then we had up
we had the mp3 player and and the user

4384
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:51,280
we had the mp3 player and and the user
 

4385
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,790
we had the mp3 player and and the user
interface and everything so there was

4386
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
interface and everything so there was
 

4387
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,310
interface and everything so there was
times when it was just this hard drive

4388
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
times when it was just this hard drive
 

4389
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,870
times when it was just this hard drive
and there was times when it was a mp3

4390
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:56,880
and there was times when it was a mp3
 

4391
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,790
and there was times when it was a mp3
player and i had to hot switch between

4392
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:00,800
player and i had to hot switch between
 

4393
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,229
player and i had to hot switch between
what the hard drive thinks it was

4394
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
what the hard drive thinks it was
 

4395
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,709
what the hard drive thinks it was
talking to yeah right so designed this

4396
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
talking to yeah right so designed this
 

4397
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,550
talking to yeah right so designed this
thing tore it apart done all this stuff

4398
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560
thing tore it apart done all this stuff
 

4399
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,070
thing tore it apart done all this stuff
and i was like

4400
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,080
and i was like
 

4401
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,990
and i was like
you know maybe i'm going to screw up ide

4402
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
you know maybe i'm going to screw up ide
 

4403
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,510
you know maybe i'm going to screw up ide
and there's something there's some holes

4404
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
and there's something there's some holes
 

4405
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,950
and there's something there's some holes
i'm going to see

4406
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
i'm going to see
 

4407
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,510
i'm going to see
so i go who's the expert at apple who

4408
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
so i go who's the expert at apple who
 

4409
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,310
so i go who's the expert at apple who
understands ide and everything

4410
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
understands ide and everything
 

4411
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,189
understands ide and everything
so

4412
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:19,199
so
 

4413
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,030
so
this person comes over

4414
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
this person comes over
 

4415
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,430
this person comes over
the mass storage specialist comes over

4416
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,440
the mass storage specialist comes over
 

4417
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,790
the mass storage specialist comes over
and i put on the whiteboard and said

4418
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,800
and i put on the whiteboard and said
 

4419
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,750
and i put on the whiteboard and said
here's how we're going to do this thing

4420
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:25,760
here's how we're going to do this thing
 

4421
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,430

4423
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,189
and here's the commands and this is how
it hot switches and everything he's like

4424
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
it hot switches and everything he's like
 

4425
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,430
it hot switches and everything he's like
that's never going to work yeah

the reflex there's a bunch of
 

4475
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,590
the reflex there's a bunch of
terminology they're telling me um it's a

4476

terminology they're telling me um it's a
 

4477

what about the feeling
 

4537
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,990
what about the feeling
of the story you create visually

4538
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
of the story you create visually
 

4539

of the story you create visually
the difference between a

4540
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,080
the difference between a
 

4541
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,790
the difference between a
a movie that's really well told

4542

a movie that's really well told
 

4543
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,310
a movie that's really well told
and it doesn't have all the effects and

01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,320
and it doesn't have all the effects and
 

4545
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,070
and it doesn't have all the effects and
everything versus maybe some of the

4546
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,080
everything versus maybe some of the
 

4547
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,830
everything versus maybe some of the
superhero movies we see all the time

4548
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
superhero movies we see all the time
 

4549

with
sure exactly but it it's if you're

4568
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
sure exactly but it it's if you're
 

4569
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,310
sure exactly but it it's if you're
focused on the story i guess you need to

start with a story you need to start the
story and if you bring in experts

4574
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
story and if you bring in experts
 

4575
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,990
story and if you bring in experts
they can often be

4576
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,000
they can often be
 

4577
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,750
they can often be
uh detrimental

4578
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:05,760
uh detrimental
 

4579
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,750
uh detrimental
i guess to the why they're they're too

4580
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:07,760
i guess to the why they're they're too
 

4581

good at doing the what well you can
 

4583
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,990
good at doing the what well you can
bring in experts for why there's lots of

4584
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,000
bring in experts for why there's lots of
 

4585
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,669
bring in experts for why there's lots of
experts for why

4586
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
experts for why
 

4587
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,390
experts for why
too many times we get experts for what

4588
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
too many times we get experts for what
 

4589
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,030
too many times we get experts for what
yes and then they only focus on the what

4590
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
yes and then they only focus on the what
 

4591
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,950
yes and then they only focus on the what
and so you so they come with the specs

4592
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
and so you so they come with the specs
 

4593
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,030
and so you so they come with the specs
and feeds and the the numbers and all

4594
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
and feeds and the the numbers and all
 

4595
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,709
and feeds and the the numbers and all
the other stuff but what you're really

01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:24,719
the other stuff but what you're really
 

4597
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,229
the other stuff but what you're really
asking for is i need somebody about the

4961
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,910
have to go and understand it's a
different type of device just because

4962
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:39,920
different type of device just because
 

4963
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,669
different type of device just because
that's that and it's successful for that

that's not the only thing you're going
to do with this device because people

4970
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:46,400
to do with this device because people
 

4971
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,709
to do with this device because people
only did messaging and maybe a few phone

and that killed the or excuse me brought
back the sim slot on the original iphone

5046
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,320
back the sim slot on the original iphone
 

5047
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,470
back the sim slot on the original iphone
because we're like

5048
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
because we're like
 

5049
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,430
because we're like
because he was just like we're going to

5050
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
because he was just like we're going to
 

5051
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,229
because he was just like we're going to
tell a t to not use a sim yeah right

5052
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:04,239
tell a t to not use a sim yeah right
 

5053
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:05,350
tell a t to not use a sim yeah right
we're going to just tell them to do it

5054
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
we're going to just tell them to do it
 

5055
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,390
we're going to just tell them to do it
differently

5056
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400
differently
 

5057
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,229
differently
right but we were like if we want this

5058
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:08,239
right but we were like if we want this
 

5059
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,430
right but we were like if we want this
thing to go anywhere around the world

5060
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
thing to go anywhere around the world
 

5061
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,430
thing to go anywhere around the world
you want to put that friction in people

5062
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
you want to put that friction in people
 

5063
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,790
you want to put that friction in people
are going to move from place to place

5064
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
are going to move from place to place
 

5065
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,310
are going to move from place to place
you know they have different sims

5066
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,320
you know they have different sims
 

5067
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,910
you know they have different sims
because of the prices and all that stuff

5068
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:15,920
because of the prices and all that stuff
 

5069
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,470
because of the prices and all that stuff
we had to show all of that data and then

5070
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
we had to show all of that data and then
 

5071
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,870
we had to show all of that data and then
that opinion-based decision got turned

5072
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
that opinion-based decision got turned
 

5073
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,510
that opinion-based decision got turned
into a data-driven decision and it and

5074
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
into a data-driven decision and it and
 

5075
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,669
into a data-driven decision and it and
the sim slot obviously showed up so

5076
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
the sim slot obviously showed up so
 

5077
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,070
the sim slot obviously showed up so
those are two ver at the very same time

5078
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,080
those are two ver at the very same time
 

5079
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,750
those are two ver at the very same time
yeah right

5080
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:29,760
yeah right
 

5081
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,470
yeah right
opinion can hold and so can data over

5082
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:32,480
opinion can hold and so can data over
 

5083
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,430
opinion can hold and so can data over
rule opinion when data does exist for a

5084
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:35,440
rule opinion when data does exist for a
 

5085
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,669
rule opinion when data does exist for a
v1 but the at the end of the day you

5086
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
v1 but the at the end of the day you
 

5087
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,390
v1 but the at the end of the day you
don't know what the right answer is

5088
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:40,400
don't know what the right answer is
 

5089
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,990
don't know what the right answer is
so

5090
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,000
so
 

5091
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,669
so
doing no

5092
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:43,679
doing no
 

5093
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,430
doing no
sim card slot

5094
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:45,440
sim card slot
 

5095
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,590
sim card slot
may have been the right decision

5096
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
may have been the right decision
 

5097
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,110
may have been the right decision
we won't know

5098
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,120
we won't know
 

5099
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,750
we won't know
because maybe if that was

5100
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
because maybe if that was
 

5101
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,430
because maybe if that was
the decision

5102
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
the decision
 

5103
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,590
the decision
then like many times throughout apple's

5104
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:55,600
then like many times throughout apple's
 

5105
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,310
then like many times throughout apple's
history you basically changed the tide

5106
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
history you basically changed the tide
 

5107
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,870
history you basically changed the tide
of how technology is done

5108
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:00,880
of how technology is done
 

5109
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,430
of how technology is done
yeah absolutely you know you never know

5110
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
yeah absolutely you know you never know
 

5111
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,430
yeah absolutely you know you never know
apple started wi-fi people don't

5112
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:05,440
apple started wi-fi people don't
 

5113
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,790
apple started wi-fi people don't
understand wi-fi came out of there there

5114
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:06,800
understand wi-fi came out of there there
 

5115
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,229
understand wi-fi came out of there there
was no wi-fi in 2001 apple started wi-fi

5116
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
was no wi-fi in 2001 apple started wi-fi
 

5117
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,470
was no wi-fi in 2001 apple started wi-fi
and then everyone else you know got onto

5118
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:12,480
and then everyone else you know got onto
 

5119
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,550
and then everyone else you know got onto
on board if you look at now where we're

5120
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,560
on board if you look at now where we're
 

5121
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,310
on board if you look at now where we're
going we're going to phones without sim

5122
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
going we're going to phones without sim
 

5123
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,350
going we're going to phones without sim
slots

5124
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
slots
 

5125
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,189
slots
because we have e sims right and now the

5126
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:19,199
because we have e sims right and now the
 

5127
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,510
because we have e sims right and now the
sim slot is becoming legacy legacy as a

5128
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
sim slot is becoming legacy legacy as a
 

5129
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,870
sim slot is becoming legacy legacy as a
legacy port

5130
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
legacy port
 

5131
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,629
legacy port
that legacy port will probably be gone

5132
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:24,639
that legacy port will probably be gone
 

5133
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,030
that legacy port will probably be gone
by

5134
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040

 

5135
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,590

six maybe ten years he'll be gone i'm

5136
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
six maybe ten years he'll be gone i'm
 

5137
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,030
six maybe ten years he'll be gone i'm
pretty sure of that

5138
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,040
pretty sure of that
 

5139
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,229
pretty sure of that
um because it's so much easier for

5140
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:32,239
um because it's so much easier for
 

5141
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:33,510
um because it's so much easier for
carries they don't have to have physical

5142
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
carries they don't have to have physical
 

5143
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,830
carries they don't have to have physical
things to go out and right

5144
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
things to go out and right
 

5145
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,470
things to go out and right
so right now it's just the early days

5146
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
so right now it's just the early days
 

5147
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,550
so right now it's just the early days
but it will happen and it will go its

5148
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
but it will happen and it will go its
 

5149
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,790
but it will happen and it will go its
way it'll fall away but it will take

5150
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:42,800
way it'll fall away but it will take
 

5151
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,950
way it'll fall away but it will take
time you just couldn't do it back then

5152
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
time you just couldn't do it back then
 

5153
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,430
time you just couldn't do it back then
so timing is essential here but at the

5154
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
so timing is essential here but at the
 

5155
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,870
so timing is essential here but at the
end of the day it's opinions and that's

5156
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
end of the day it's opinions and that's
 

5157
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,790
end of the day it's opinions and that's
where the genius is sometimes the data

5158
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
where the genius is sometimes the data
 

5159
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,110
where the genius is sometimes the data
tells you one thing but the data at the

5160
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:53,120
tells you one thing but the data at the
 

5161
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,830
tells you one thing but the data at the
end of the day does represent the past

5162
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:55,840
end of the day does represent the past
 

5163
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,149
end of the day does represent the past
exactly and the future may be different

5164
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
exactly and the future may be different
 

5165
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,750
exactly and the future may be different
than the past right

5166
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
than the past right
 

5167
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,870
than the past right
uh sometimes there's wisdom in the in

5168
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
uh sometimes there's wisdom in the in
 

5169
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,870
uh sometimes there's wisdom in the in
the past and sometimes

5170
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:04,880
the past and sometimes
 

5171
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,629
the past and sometimes
it's actually representative of

5172
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
it's actually representative of
 

5173
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:07,990
it's actually representative of
something that should be

5174
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,000
something that should be
 

5175
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,790
something that should be
uh overcome and uh progress looks like

5176
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
uh overcome and uh progress looks like
 

5177
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,990
uh overcome and uh progress looks like
leaving that stuff behind like um right

5178
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000
leaving that stuff behind like um right
 

5179
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,470
leaving that stuff behind like um right
the headphone jack right

5180
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:16,480
the headphone jack right
 

5181
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,430
the headphone jack right
i mean that when uh when different folks

5182
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
i mean that when uh when different folks
 

5183
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,110
i mean that when uh when different folks
were getting rid of

5184
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:21,120
were getting rid of
 

5185
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,189
were getting rid of
the headphone jack

5186
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:23,199
the headphone jack
 

5187
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,590
the headphone jack
boy that i would love to be a a fly in

5188

boy that i would love to be a a fly in
 

5189
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,870
boy that i would love to be a a fly in
the wall of those

5190
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
the wall of those
 

5191
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,910
the wall of those
oh discussions we had that oh

5192
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
oh discussions we had that oh
 

5193
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,669
oh discussions we had that oh
that was that was a discussion that

5194
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
that was that was a discussion that
 

5195
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,830
that was that was a discussion that
happened almost every year

5196
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:33,840
happened almost every year
 

5197
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,590
happened almost every year
yeah that was an every year should we

5198
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:35,600
yeah that was an every year should we
 

5199
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,590
yeah that was an every year should we
get rid of headphone jacks on the ipod

5200
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
get rid of headphone jacks on the ipod
 

5201
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,910
get rid of headphone jacks on the ipod
yeah right when are wireless headsets

5202
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:39,920
yeah right when are wireless headsets
 

5203
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,669
yeah right when are wireless headsets
going to happen what it right and it

5204
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:41,679
going to happen what it right and it
 

5205
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,669
going to happen what it right and it
took years to build all the right

5206
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
took years to build all the right
 

5207
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,229
took years to build all the right
protocols the chips all those things to

right
to say have the confidence because

5216
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
to say have the confidence because
 

5217
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,870
to say have the confidence because
bluetooth was good but it wasn't apple

5218
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:54,880
bluetooth was good but it wasn't apple
 

5219
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,870
bluetooth was good but it wasn't apple
like so nat it's like we got to make our

5220
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
like so nat it's like we got to make our
 

5221
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:57,910
like so nat it's like we got to make our
own chips we got to make our own

5222
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
own chips we got to make our own
 

5223
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,590
own chips we got to make our own
software stacks now we have the

5224
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,600
software stacks now we have the
 

5225
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,910
software stacks now we have the
confidence to remove the headphone jack

5226
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:01,920
confidence to remove the headphone jack
 

5227
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,990
confidence to remove the headphone jack
and actually make you pay 200 more for

5228
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,000
and actually make you pay 200 more for
 

5229
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,990
and actually make you pay 200 more for
your iphone that you were just paying

5230
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
your iphone that you were just paying
 

5231
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,750
your iphone that you were just paying
because it's a headphone jack now we've

5232
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:07,760
because it's a headphone jack now we've
 

5233
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,830
because it's a headphone jack now we've
grown our revenue we've given a new

5234
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
grown our revenue we've given a new
 

5235
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,030
grown our revenue we've given a new
experience to the user right and

5236
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,040
experience to the user right and
 

5237
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,590
experience to the user right and
ta-da you know it's just it's magic and

5238
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,600
ta-da you know it's just it's magic and
 

5239
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,350
ta-da you know it's just it's magic and
now if the world's transformed to

5240
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
now if the world's transformed to
 

5241
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,830
now if the world's transformed to
everyone you know moving to that right

5242
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:19,840
everyone you know moving to that right
 

5243
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,910
everyone you know moving to that right
but it took years to understand the

5244
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
but it took years to understand the
 

5245
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,790
but it took years to understand the
problem develop the technology to and

5246
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:24,800
problem develop the technology to and
 

5247
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,270
problem develop the technology to and
not just rush it to market to get a half

5248
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
not just rush it to market to get a half
 

5249
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,870
not just rush it to market to get a half
experience but to get it right and

5250
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:28,880
experience but to get it right and
 

5251
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,590
experience but to get it right and
refine it then ship it and only then

5252
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600
refine it then ship it and only then
 

5253
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,470
refine it then ship it and only then
after

5254
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480
after
 

5255
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,669
after
it was probably four or five years in

5256
01:30:33,669 --> 01:30:33,679
it was probably four or five years in
 

5257
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,870
it was probably four or five years in
development just like the m1 processor

5258
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
development just like the m1 processor
 

5259
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:37,830
development just like the m1 processor
right

5260
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
right
 

5261
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,350
right
that was a work from 2008

5262
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,360
that was a work from 2008
 

5263

confidence we're doing our own silicon

5270
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:48,000
confidence we're doing our own silicon
 

5271
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,470
confidence we're doing our own silicon
for all the iphones and ipods

5272
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480

ipads and such
 

5275
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,070
ipads and such
now we're going to turn to the mac and

5276
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
now we're going to turn to the mac and
 

5277
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,830
now we're going to turn to the mac and
make sure we have the best processor

5278
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:57,840
make sure we have the best processor
 

5279
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,270
make sure we have the best processor
right not just that we have the best

5280
01:30:59,270 --> 01:30:59,280
right not just that we have the best
 

5281
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,510
right not just that we have the best
integrated design team

5282
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
integrated design team
 

5283
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,550
integrated design team
and then

5284
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:02,560
and then
 

5285
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,990
and then
saying we're gonna you know and then

5286
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:04,000
saying we're gonna you know and then
 

5287
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,590
saying we're gonna you know and then
besting everyone making sure the

5288
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:05,600
besting everyone making sure the
 

5289
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,790
besting everyone making sure the
software's

5290
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
software's
 

5291
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,950
software's
and the hardware is designed at the same

5292
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:08,960
and the hardware is designed at the same
 

5293
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,709
and the hardware is designed at the same
time making sure the kernels all those

5294
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
time making sure the kernels all those
 

5295
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:11,590
time making sure the kernels all those
things are

5296
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
things are
 

5297
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,550
things are
are gonna use the best efficiency

5298
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:14,560
are gonna use the best efficiency
 

5299
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,470
are gonna use the best efficiency
and then popping it out

5300
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:16,480
and then popping it out
 

5301
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,189
and then popping it out
and then it feels seamless it's magic

5302
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:19,199
and then it feels seamless it's magic
 

5303
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,709
and then it feels seamless it's magic
there were no

5304
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:20,719
there were no

in real esoteric drivers or something

5308
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,000
in real esoteric drivers or something
 

5309
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,870
in real esoteric drivers or something
like that it just worked it was magic

5310
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
like that it just worked it was magic
 

5311
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,470

was constructive or destructive
 

5327
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,430
was constructive or destructive
in the process of

01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
in the process of
 

5329
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,629
in the process of
shaping these opinion-based

5330
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:52,639
shaping these opinion-based
 

5331
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,270

5333
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,669

so in

5334
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:57,679
so in
 

5335
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,790
so in
build i write a chapter called

01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:00,800
build i write a chapter called

yes

5338
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:01,600
yes
 

5339
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,830
yes
and you lay out beautifully

5340
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:03,840
and you lay out beautifully
 

5341
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,750
and you lay out beautifully
the types of

5342
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
the types of
 

5343
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,550
the types of
and uh maybe you could speak to

5344
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
and uh maybe you could speak to
 

5345
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,270
and uh maybe you could speak to
the constructive and the destructive

5346
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,280
the constructive and the destructive
 

5347
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,510
the constructive and the destructive
types of okay

5348
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:13,520
types of okay
 

5349
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,149
types of okay
so there's really two delineations that

5350
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
so there's really two delineations that
 

5351
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,430
so there's really two delineations that
i

5352
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440
i
 

5353
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,669
i
that i've found of you know real

5354
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
that i've found of you know real
 

5355
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,910
that i've found of you know real
fundamental ones and that is

5356
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:21,920
fundamental ones and that is
 

5357
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,550
fundamental ones and that is
again the why

5358
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,560
again the why
 

5359
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,110
again the why
why do i feel this person is an

5360
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:27,120
why do i feel this person is an
 

5361
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,070
why do i feel this person is an
okay they might not be

5362
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
okay they might not be
 

5363
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,709
okay they might not be
i feel this is a person who's an

5365
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,590

are they motivated by their ego

are they motivated by their ego
 

5367
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,390
are they motivated by their ego

sometimes those lines can be blurry but

5376
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
sometimes those lines can be blurry but
 

5377
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,950
sometimes those lines can be blurry but
it's usually pretty clear

5378

5379
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,750

sticking by it powering through you will
learn through the pain of it like

5602
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:50,320
learn through the pain of it like
 

5603

01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:54,159
the other is
 

5607
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,350
the other is
maybe

5608
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:55,360
maybe
 

5609
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,109
maybe
um the the vision driven

more and more of an if they have

5614
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:02,880
more and more of an if they have
 

5615
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,550
more and more of an if they have
a track record

5616
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
a track record
 

5617
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,669
a track record
of

5618
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:05,679
of
 

5619
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,750
of

can challenge them right right
steve was never that that's the great

5630
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,280
steve was never that that's the great
 

5631
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,270
steve was never that that's the great
thing he was he was never

5632
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,280
thing he was he was never
 

5633
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,430
thing he was he was never
unchallengeable you could challenge him

5634
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:23,440
unchallengeable you could challenge him
 

5635
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,629
unchallengeable you could challenge him
now let's

5636
01:37:24,629 --> 01:37:24,639
now let's
 

5637
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,830
now let's
now this the the plastic to glass story

5638
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
now this the the plastic to glass story
 

5639
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,030
now this the the plastic to glass story
is a perfect example of this

5640
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:31,040
is a perfect example of this
 

5641
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,350
is a perfect example of this
so at the beginning of the project well

5642
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,360
so at the beginning of the project well
 

5643
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,070
so at the beginning of the project well
before we were going we had always had

5644
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
before we were going we had always had
 

5645
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,590
before we were going we had always had
these things about you know plastic

5646
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:37,600
these things about you know plastic
 

5647
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,669
these things about you know plastic
front ipods these kinds of things these

5648
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:39,679
front ipods these kinds of things these
 

5649
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:44,070
front ipods these kinds of things these
scratches and all that stuff

5650
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080

 

5651
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,790

so we said are we going to have a glass

5652
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:46,800
so we said are we going to have a glass
 

5653
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,870
so we said are we going to have a glass
or a plastic display

5654
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:48,880
or a plastic display
 

5655
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,709
or a plastic display
a cover for the display because the

5656
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
a cover for the display because the
 

5657
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,669
a cover for the display because the
display was glass underneath it

5658
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
display was glass underneath it
 

5659
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,910
display was glass underneath it
we argued back and forth about glass

5660
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
we argued back and forth about glass
 

5661
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,030
we argued back and forth about glass
versus plastic and then we all landed

5662
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
versus plastic and then we all landed
 

5663
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,470
versus plastic and then we all landed
together on plastic

5664
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:02,480
together on plastic
 

5665
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,590
together on plastic
okay the original decision was plastic

5666
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
okay the original decision was plastic
 

5667
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,669
okay the original decision was plastic
and the reasons were okay we don't want

5668
01:38:07,669 --> 01:38:07,679
and the reasons were okay we don't want
 

5669
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,229
and the reasons were okay we don't want
to make a mistake glass can break

5670
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
to make a mistake glass can break
 

5671
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,669
to make a mistake glass can break
you know

5672
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
you know
 

5673
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,149
you know
people drop them all the time

5674
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
people drop them all the time
 

5675
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,990
people drop them all the time
so we don't want to have a fragile

5676
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
so we don't want to have a fragile
 

5677
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,590
so we don't want to have a fragile
device

5678
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:17,600
device
 

5679
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,550
device
because

5680
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,560
because
 

5681
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,229
because
you're going to be using even more than

5682
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
you're going to be using even more than
 

5683
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,109
you're going to be using even more than
a music player right

5684
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
a music player right
 

5685
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,470
a music player right
and you're going to be holding your head

5686
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:24,480
and you're going to be holding your head
 

5687
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,310
and you're going to be holding your head
and putting in your pocket and misses

5688
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:26,320
and putting in your pocket and misses
 

5689
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,590
and putting in your pocket and misses
and all that stuff

5690
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
and all that stuff
 

5691
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,229
and all that stuff
so we went down the road with plastic

5692
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
so we went down the road with plastic
 

5693
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,950
so we went down the road with plastic
when it was shown when the product was

5694
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
when it was shown when the product was
 

5695
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,669
when it was shown when the product was
shown at mac world

5696
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
shown at mac world
 

5697
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:41,510
shown at mac world
in 2007 the first time that was plastic

5698
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520

 

5699
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,910

we had just enough of them in the field

5700
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
we had just enough of them in the field
 

5701
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,830
we had just enough of them in the field
at the time we started to start seeing

5702
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:45,840
at the time we started to start seeing
 

5703
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,830
at the time we started to start seeing
light scratches on the

5704
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
light scratches on the
 

5705
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,790
light scratches on the
plastic

5706
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:50,800

 

5707
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,109

reviewers who didn't have the device yet

5708
01:38:53,109 --> 01:38:53,119
reviewers who didn't have the device yet
 

5709
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,350
reviewers who didn't have the device yet
because it was behind glass if you if if

5710
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:55,360
because it was behind glass if you if if
 

5711
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,750
because it was behind glass if you if if
you remember 2007 the jesus phone comes

up and no one could even touch them you
could just look at it in this beautiful

5716
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:01,440
could just look at it in this beautiful
 

5717
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,750
could just look at it in this beautiful
museum quality box like it came from the

5718
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
museum quality box like it came from the
 

5719
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,910
museum quality box like it came from the
future or whatever the past it was like

future or whatever the past it was like
oh and you just looked and that was all

5722
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
oh and you just looked and that was all
 

5723
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,470
oh and you just looked and that was all
you got but then people said well what

5724
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
you got but then people said well what
 

5725
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,790
you got but then people said well what
screen is what covers on that you know

5726
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
screen is what covers on that you know
 

5727
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,229
screen is what covers on that you know
reviewers who knew better you know and

5728
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:14,239
reviewers who knew better you know and
 

5729
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,390
reviewers who knew better you know and
they're like oh it's plastic and they

5730
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
they're like oh it's plastic and they
 

5731
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,470
they're like oh it's plastic and they
were like really

5732
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
were like really
 

5733
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,870
were like really
and so there was enough of a doubt there

5734
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
and so there was enough of a doubt there
 

5735
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,390
and so there was enough of a doubt there
and then when we started to do it and

5736
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
and then when we started to do it and
 

5737
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,390
and then when we started to do it and
then steve changed the frame of

5738
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,400
then steve changed the frame of
 

5739
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,790
then steve changed the frame of
reference of the question or of the

5740
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:26,800
reference of the question or of the
 

5741
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,950
reference of the question or of the
result of what the customer would think

5742
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:28,960
result of what the customer would think
 

5743
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,990
result of what the customer would think
and he was like

5744
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
and he was like
 

5745
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,709
and he was like
if we designed it with plastic

5746
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
if we designed it with plastic
 

5747
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,310
if we designed it with plastic
and it's in their pocket all the time

5748
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
and it's in their pocket all the time
 

5749
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,470
and it's in their pocket all the time
and it gets scratched by coins lightly

5750
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:36,480
and it gets scratched by coins lightly
 

5751
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,229
and it gets scratched by coins lightly
scratched or by keys or something like

5752
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:38,239
scratched or by keys or something like
 

5753
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,430
scratched or by keys or something like
that

5754
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:39,440
that
 

5755
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,510
that
that is a design problem

5756
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
that is a design problem
 

5757
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,510
that is a design problem
we need to fix the that was our bad

5758
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
we need to fix the that was our bad
 

5759
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,910
we need to fix the that was our bad
if they go off and drop it

5760
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920

of that failure
 

5777
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,510

because then they were part of why it
 

5783
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,189
because then they were part of why it
failed whereas the design they didn't do

5784
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:13,199
failed whereas the design they didn't do
 

5785
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,229

their pocket and it's you know it's
 

5789
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,790
their pocket and it's you know it's
scratching

5790
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
scratching
 

5791
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,470

and that's normal use
 

5793
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,149
and that's normal use
abnormal use has been dropped and we're

5794
01:40:20,149 --> 01:40:20,159
abnormal use has been dropped and we're
 

5795
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:20,870
abnormal use has been dropped and we're

that mindset when you framed the problem

5800
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
that mindset when you framed the problem
 

5801
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,109
that mindset when you framed the problem
and the solution in that way versus the

5802
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:31,119
and the solution in that way versus the
 

5803
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,109
and the solution in that way versus the
original framing where we all landed on

5804
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,119
original framing where we all landed on
 

5805
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,950
original framing where we all landed on
plastic so

5806
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
plastic so
 

5807
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,189
plastic so
and then he was unrelenting on that but

5808
01:40:37,189 --> 01:40:37,199
and then he was unrelenting on that but
 

5809
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,590
and then he was unrelenting on that but
we all had moved

we all had moved
and we have moved mindset and we

5812
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
and we have moved mindset and we
 

5813
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,070
and we have moved mindset and we
understood the why and we marshaled

5814
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080
understood the why and we marshaled
 

5815
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,510
understood the why and we marshaled
together

5883
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,270
there's also the three options you said
you you notice that the third option is

you you notice that the third option is
 

5885
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,510
you you notice that the third option is
always going to be the one that's picked

5886

always going to be the one that's picked

always going to be the one that's picked
uh sure those kinds of idiosyncrasies

then
try to put a label on it and put a label

6026
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:16,000
try to put a label on it and put a label

01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:20,480
you let that kind of culture happen
 

6031
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,750
you let that kind of culture happen
and it becomes somewhat

6032
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
and it becomes somewhat
 

6033
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,149
and it becomes somewhat
you know sometimes it's in jest

6034
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
you know sometimes it's in jest
 

6035
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,910
you know sometimes it's in jest
you know it has to be very much ingested

6036
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
you know it has to be very much ingested
 

6037
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,109
you know it has to be very much ingested
and those two people have to have a

6038
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:29,119
and those two people have to have a
 

6039
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,990
and those two people have to have a
really good working relationship so

really good working relationship so
 

6041
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,590
really good working relationship so
but other than that i'm sorry it's going

6042
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
but other than that i'm sorry it's going
 

6043
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,229
but other than that i'm sorry it's going
to be a lot more

6044
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:36,239
to be a lot more
 

6045
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,149
to be a lot more
you could say a septic in that way that

6046
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
you could say a septic in that way that
 

6047
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,590
you could say a septic in that way that
you're not going to add that stuff in

6048
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
you're not going to add that stuff in
 

6049
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,510
you're not going to add that stuff in
but you can do it with all other types

6050
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520
but you can do it with all other types
 

6051
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,149
but you can do it with all other types
of ways without saying that because then

6052
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
of ways without saying that because then
 

6053
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,910
of ways without saying that because then
people who do react to that kind of

6054
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920
people who do react to that kind of
 

6055
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,030
people who do react to that kind of
language

6056
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040

deep technology software hardware

6156
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:31,119
deep technology software hardware
 

6157
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,990

out the other way right and never got
 

6181
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,990
out the other way right and never got
really deep technically so that's two

6182
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,000
really deep technically so that's two
 

6183
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,149

make it beautiful on the inside and and
 

6237
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,149
make it beautiful on the inside and and
the even the traces on the boards have

6238
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:52,159
the even the traces on the boards have
 

6239
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,870
the even the traces on the boards have
to look a certain way so the teams made

6240
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:54,880
to look a certain way so the teams made
 

6241
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,550
to look a certain way so the teams made
the board they knew that would work and

6242
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:56,560
the board they knew that would work and
 

6243
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,550
the board they knew that would work and
then they made the board that the way

6244
01:47:58,550 --> 01:47:58,560
then they made the board that the way
 

6245
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,950
then they made the board that the way
steve wanted it and that didn't work and

6246
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
steve wanted it and that didn't work and
 

6247
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,189
steve wanted it and that didn't work and
then steve instantly figured out like at

6248
01:48:03,189 --> 01:48:03,199
then steve instantly figured out like at
 

6249
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,950
then steve instantly figured out like at
some point don't micromanage every

6250
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:04,960
some point don't micromanage every
 

6251
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,550
some point don't micromanage every
single detail there's some things he

6252
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
single detail there's some things he
 

6253
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,990
single detail there's some things he
doesn't know enough about so he would

6254
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
doesn't know enough about so he would
 

6255
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,830
doesn't know enough about so he would
get out of that but that was one of

6256
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:09,840
get out of that but that was one of
 

6257
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,990
get out of that but that was one of
those instances where he pushed really

6258
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,000
those instances where he pushed really
 

6259
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,590
those instances where he pushed really
hard and that's his opinion so they said

6260
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
hard and that's his opinion so they said
 

6261
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,470
hard and that's his opinion so they said
okay we're going to make it a

6262
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
okay we're going to make it a
 

6263
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,070
okay we're going to make it a
data-driven decision we're going to make

6264
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:16,080
data-driven decision we're going to make
 

6265
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,149
data-driven decision we're going to make
both i'm going to show you the results

6266
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
both i'm going to show you the results
 

6267
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,550
both i'm going to show you the results
right and then from there he didn't get

6268
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:20,560
right and then from there he didn't get
 

6269
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,310
right and then from there he didn't get
into those details so from that you

6270
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:22,320
into those details so from that you
 

6271
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,030
into those details so from that you
could have a great challenge right

6272
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:25,040
could have a great challenge right
 

6273
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,390
could have a great challenge right
because then you could get those data

6274
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:26,400
because then you could get those data
 

6275
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,910
because then you could get those data
and say we can't do that and let me show

6276
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:27,920
and say we can't do that and let me show
 

6277
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,149
and say we can't do that and let me show
you why or we can do that and then steve

6278
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:30,159
you why or we can do that and then steve
 

6279
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:31,270
you why or we can do that and then steve
would go you can't do that you're like

6280
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,280
would go you can't do that you're like
 

6281
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,950
would go you can't do that you're like
oh we can do that let me show you right

6282
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:32,960
oh we can do that let me show you right
 

6283
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,149
oh we can do that let me show you right
so there's certain times when you were

6284
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
so there's certain times when you were
 

6285
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:36,390
so there's certain times when you were
like bringing something to reality that

6286
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:36,400
like bringing something to reality that
 

6287
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,709
like bringing something to reality that
he didn't think could exist

6288
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
he didn't think could exist
 

6289
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,070
he didn't think could exist
right so

6290
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,080
right so
 

6291
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,310
right so
it was that it was always that creative

6292
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
it was that it was always that creative
 

6293
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,310
it was that it was always that creative
tension that interaction that was so

6294
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
tension that interaction that was so
 

6295
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,109
tension that interaction that was so
successful right i think but there was

6296
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
successful right i think but there was
 

6297
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,709
successful right i think but there was
one other fundamental thing that was

6298
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
one other fundamental thing that was
 

6299
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:49,830
one other fundamental thing that was
different

6300
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:49,840
different
 

6301
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,790
different
and that it graded on the team

6302
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
and that it graded on the team
 

6303
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,109
and that it graded on the team
and that i made sure and i learned from

6304
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:55,119
and that i made sure and i learned from
 

6305
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,390
and that i made sure and i learned from
to not do

6306
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,400
to not do
 

6307
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,350
to not do
and and i over maybe overdue now in the

6308
01:48:59,350 --> 01:48:59,360
and and i over maybe overdue now in the
 

6309
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,750
and and i over maybe overdue now in the
opposite direction which is

6310
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:01,760
opposite direction which is
 

6311
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,189
opposite direction which is
when there's a great idea that comes

6312
01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:03,199
when there's a great idea that comes
 

6313
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:04,629
when there's a great idea that comes
from the team

6314
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:04,639
from the team
 

6315
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:07,189
from the team
acknowledge that person and go that is a

6316
01:49:07,189 --> 01:49:07,199
acknowledge that person and go that is a
 

6317
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,629
acknowledge that person and go that is a
great idea as the leader you know the

6318
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
great idea as the leader you know the
 

6319
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,270
great idea as the leader you know the
opinion driven that's a great idea let's

6320
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
opinion driven that's a great idea let's
 

6321
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,870
opinion driven that's a great idea let's
build on that let's see if that can do

6322
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:12,880
build on that let's see if that can do
 

6323
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,229
build on that let's see if that can do
that or it's a great idea but not for

6324
01:49:14,229 --> 01:49:14,239
that or it's a great idea but not for
 

6325
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,229
that or it's a great idea but not for
now put it aside but call out when

6326
01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:16,239
now put it aside but call out when
 

6327
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,310
now put it aside but call out when
people have great ideas because it's

6328
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
people have great ideas because it's
 

6329
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,109
people have great ideas because it's
infectious and that means not ideas that

6330
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:21,119
infectious and that means not ideas that
 

6331
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,109
infectious and that means not ideas that
come bubble up to the customer level but

6332
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
come bubble up to the customer level but
 

6333
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,950
come bubble up to the customer level but
inside the organization people like they

6334
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
inside the organization people like they
 

6335
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,470
inside the organization people like they
get rewarded for their ideas and say

6336
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,480
get rewarded for their ideas and say
 

6337
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,950
get rewarded for their ideas and say
that's a great one

6338
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:28,960
that's a great one
 

6339
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,030
that's a great one
steve was always like

6340
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:31,040
steve was always like
 

6341
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,709
steve was always like
you give an idea

6342
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:32,719
you give an idea
 

6343
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:35,830
you give an idea
and he would go hmm okay

6344
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:35,840
and he would go hmm okay
 

6345
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,350
and he would go hmm okay
i don't know

6346
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,360
i don't know
 

6347
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,109
i don't know
the next day 24 hours later it would

6348
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
the next day 24 hours later it would
 

6349
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,030
the next day 24 hours later it would
come back with slight modifications i've

6350
01:49:41,030 --> 01:49:41,040
come back with slight modifications i've
 

6351
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,189
come back with slight modifications i've
had this genius idea

6352
01:49:43,189 --> 01:49:43,199
had this genius idea
 

6353
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,750
had this genius idea
right and it's sooner or later we'd we'd

6354
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:45,760
right and it's sooner or later we'd we'd
 

6355
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,510
right and it's sooner or later we'd we'd
look around the table and we'd like roll

6356
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,520
look around the table and we'd like roll
 

6357
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,430
look around the table and we'd like roll
our eyes and go here we go again so it

6358
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
our eyes and go here we go again so it
 

6359
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,070
our eyes and go here we go again so it
demotivates you from generating ideas a

6360
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:52,080
demotivates you from generating ideas a
 

6361
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,149
demotivates you from generating ideas a
little bit yeah well you know we got

6362
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:54,159
little bit yeah well you know we got
 

6363
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,470
little bit yeah well you know we got
used to it but you know later on in the

6364
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:56,480
used to it but you know later on in the
 

6365
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,510
used to it but you know later on in the
team yeah you know it was just not

6366
01:49:59,510 --> 01:49:59,520
team yeah you know it was just not
 

6367
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,350
team yeah you know it was just not
it it just it doesn't want to bring the

6368
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:01,360
it it just it doesn't want to bring the
 

6369
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,750
it it just it doesn't want to bring the
best right because if you're always like

6370
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:03,760
best right because if you're always like
 

6371
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,470
best right because if you're always like
er the reaction is never that's a genius

6372
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:06,480
er the reaction is never that's a genius
 

6373
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,510
er the reaction is never that's a genius
idea

6374
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
idea
 

6375
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,350
idea
it was always like it was either

6376
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,360
it was always like it was either
 

6377
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,550
it was always like it was either
negative or

6378
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:10,560
negative or
 

6379
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,310
negative or
neutral

6380
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
neutral
 

6381
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,070
neutral
right yeah then it doesn't it doesn't

6382
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:14,080
right yeah then it doesn't it doesn't
 

6383
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,070
right yeah then it doesn't it doesn't

6384
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080

sometimes it's fun when people get
 

6389
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,109
sometimes it's fun when people get

6407
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,430

that for later let's discuss it or say

6408
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,440
that for later let's discuss it or say
 

6409
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,109
that for later let's discuss it or say
that's a decent idea but did you think

6410
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,119
that's a decent idea but did you think
 

6411
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,109
that's a decent idea but did you think
about that idea this way not just no or

6412
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:43,119
about that idea this way not just no or
 

6413
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,910
about that idea this way not just no or
yes but let's talk about why that might

6414
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:45,920
yes but let's talk about why that might
 

6415
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,910
yes but let's talk about why that might
not be applicable in this case so that

6416
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:47,920
not be applicable in this case so that
 

6417
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,589
not be applicable in this case so that
they can learn so the next time they

6418
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:49,599
they can learn so the next time they
 

6419
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,669
they can learn so the next time they
bring the next idea they can modulate

6420
01:50:51,669 --> 01:50:51,679
bring the next idea they can modulate
 

6421
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:53,189

so then from that
 

6773
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,229
so then from that
we were

6774
01:56:58,229 --> 01:56:58,239
we were
 

6775
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,189
we were
made

6776
01:56:59,189 --> 01:56:59,199
made
 

6777
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:01,589
made
a prototype of an ipod plus phone a

6778
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
a prototype of an ipod plus phone a
 

6779
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,950
a prototype of an ipod plus phone a
classic with um well it was an ipod but

headset
 

6787
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:13,030
headset
wired headset to do the audio right

6788
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:13,040
wired headset to do the audio right
 

6789
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,109
wired headset to do the audio right
there was another project

6790
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:15,119
there was another project
 

6791
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:16,470
there was another project
at the same time because we were doing

6792
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:16,480
at the same time because we were doing
 

6793
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,990
at the same time because we were doing
videos in the uh the itunes music store

6794
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:20,000
videos in the uh the itunes music store
 

6795
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,750
videos in the uh the itunes music store
itunes video store

6796
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:21,760
itunes video store
 

6797
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,629
itunes video store
for music videos and movies

6798
01:57:24,629 --> 01:57:24,639
for music videos and movies
 

6799
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:27,189
for music videos and movies
and it would be a full screen ipod so

6800
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:27,199
and it would be a full screen ipod so
 

6801
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,950
and it would be a full screen ipod so
instead of the the classic the way you

6802
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:28,960
instead of the the classic the way you
 

6803
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,589
instead of the the classic the way you
know it um it would be full screen and

6804
01:57:31,589 --> 01:57:31,599
know it um it would be full screen and
 

6805
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:33,830
know it um it would be full screen and
it would have a virtual click wheel

6806
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
it would have a virtual click wheel
 

6807
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,669
it would have a virtual click wheel
you'd have a virtual like single touch

6808
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
you'd have a virtual like single touch
 

6809
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,550
you'd have a virtual like single touch
touch screen that you could scroll right

6810
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:38,560
touch screen that you could scroll right
 

6811
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,950
touch screen that you could scroll right
think of maybe an i an iphone like you

6812
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
think of maybe an i an iphone like you
 

6813
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,870
think of maybe an i an iphone like you
knew it right and then there was a third

6814
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:42,880
knew it right and then there was a third
 

6815
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,430
knew it right and then there was a third
project going on not in those two were

6816
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
project going on not in those two were
 

6817
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,790
project going on not in those two were
going on in my team but the third

6818
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:46,800
going on in my team but the third
 

6819
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,229
going on in my team but the third
project going on

6820
01:57:48,229 --> 01:57:48,239
project going on
 

6821
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:51,270
project going on
was the multi-touch screen

6822
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:51,280
was the multi-touch screen
 

6823
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,070
was the multi-touch screen
technology to drive a

6824
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,080
technology to drive a
 

6825
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:58,149
technology to drive a
uh mac tablet

6826
01:57:58,149 --> 01:57:58,159

 

6827
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,229

and so that mac tablet that that touch

6828
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:00,239
and so that mac tablet that that touch
 

6829
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,990
and so that mac tablet that that touch
screen technology

6830
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,000
screen technology
 

6831
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,830
screen technology
um there was just way too much you had

6832
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:03,840
um there was just way too much you had
 

6833
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,229
um there was just way too much you had
to change on the software and everything

6834
01:58:06,229 --> 01:58:06,239
to change on the software and everything
 

6835
01:58:06,239 --> 01:58:08,550
to change on the software and everything
to be able to use a tablet right we see

6836
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:08,560
to be able to use a tablet right we see
 

6837
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,589
to be able to use a tablet right we see
this all the time like people like

6838
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
this all the time like people like
 

6839
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,030
this all the time like people like
there's not enough tablet apps today

6840
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:11,040
there's not enough tablet apps today
 

6841
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,550
there's not enough tablet apps today
that are modified for tablet they're

6842
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:12,560
that are modified for tablet they're
 

6843
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,629
that are modified for tablet they're
just phone apps that are grown up right

6844
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:14,639
just phone apps that are grown up right
 

6845
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:16,790
just phone apps that are grown up right
so then they would just be mac

6846
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:16,800
so then they would just be mac
 

6847
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,310
so then they would just be mac
touch stuff so you'd have to have a

6848
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:18,320
touch stuff so you'd have to have a
 

6849
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,709
touch stuff so you'd have to have a
whole developer community that probably

6850
01:58:20,709 --> 01:58:20,719
whole developer community that probably
 

6851
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:21,990
whole developer community that probably
wasn't the best place to take that

6852
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,000
wasn't the best place to take that
 

6853
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,229
wasn't the best place to take that
technology first so you take that

6854
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:24,239
technology first so you take that
 

6855
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:25,990
technology first so you take that
technology marry it with the full screen

6856
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:26,000
technology marry it with the full screen
 

6857
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,070
technology marry it with the full screen
ipod and the phone stuff we were working

6858
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
ipod and the phone stuff we were working
 

6859
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,470
ipod and the phone stuff we were working
because the ipod phone with a rotary

6860
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
because the ipod phone with a rotary
 

6861
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,470
because the ipod phone with a rotary
dial was just like a rotary phone we

6862
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:32,480
dial was just like a rotary phone we
 

6863
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,390
dial was just like a rotary phone we
couldn't make that interface work well

6864
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
couldn't make that interface work well
 

6865
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,550
couldn't make that interface work well
for data input

6866
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
for data input
 

6867
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,950
for data input
um you put those three together and now

6868
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:38,960
um you put those three together and now
 

6869

01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,149
to make that first iphone os and then
there was another team working on the

6910
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:22,159
there was another team working on the
 

6911
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:23,189
there was another team working on the
apps

6912

apps
 

6913
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,390
apps
and then another team working on the

01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:24,400
and then another team working on the
 

6915
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,790
and then another team working on the
design of how it looked overall between

01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:26,800
design of how it looked overall between
 

6917
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,550
design of how it looked overall between
all that stuff so all of those things

6918
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:28,560
all that stuff so all of those things
 

6919
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,189
all that stuff so all of those things
came together to create what we know as

6920
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
came together to create what we know as
 

6921
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:33,109
came together to create what we know as
the first generation iphone and those

6922
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:33,119
the first generation iphone and those
 

6923
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,189
the first generation iphone and those
are all probably fascinating engineering

6924
01:59:35,189 --> 01:59:35,199
are all probably fascinating engineering
 

6925
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:39,109
are all probably fascinating engineering
challenges correct and great teams like

6926

the creating frankenstein os
 

6929
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,830
the creating frankenstein os
that's fascinating because you're

6930
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
that's fascinating because you're
 

6931
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,510
that's fascinating because you're
simplifying simplifying but then you're

6932
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,520
simplifying simplifying but then you're
 

6933
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,270
simplifying simplifying but then you're
just pulling different stuff from and

6934
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:47,280
just pulling different stuff from and
 

6935
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,510
just pulling different stuff from and
you're basically inventing i mean

6936
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
you're basically inventing i mean
 

6937
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,870
you're basically inventing i mean
they're probably not thinking of it that

6938
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:50,880
they're probably not thinking of it that
 

6939
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,070
they're probably not thinking of it that
way but

6940
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,080
way but
 

6941
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:55,109
way but

02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,030
characteristics of johnny that made you
a better person and designer

7192
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,040
a better person and designer
 

7193
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:13,669
a better person and designer
having worked with him

7194
02:04:13,669 --> 02:04:13,679

 

7195
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:16,550

watching the process that the design

7196
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:16,560
watching the process that the design
 

7197
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,589
watching the process that the design
team

7198
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
team
 

7199
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,990
team
that johnny led

7200
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:20,000
that johnny led
 

7201
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,589
that johnny led
i don't know where because that was over

7202
02:04:21,589 --> 02:04:21,599
i don't know where because that was over
 

7203
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:23,270
i don't know where because that was over
years i didn't see all of those things

7204
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:23,280
years i didn't see all of those things
 

7205
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,750
years i didn't see all of those things
but watching the design process of

7206
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:25,760
but watching the design process of
 

7207
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:28,069
but watching the design process of
really because it was really a team that

7208
02:04:28,069 --> 02:04:28,079
really because it was really a team that
 

7209
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:31,350
really because it was really a team that
was about materials it was about form it

7210
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:31,360
was about materials it was about form it
 

7211
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,750
was about materials it was about form it
was about colors it was about these

7212
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
was about colors it was about these
 

7213
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,750
was about colors it was about these
physical characteristics

7214
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:35,760
physical characteristics
 

7215
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,910
physical characteristics
it it when we talked about this earlier

7216
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:37,920
it it when we talked about this earlier
 

7217
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,669
it it when we talked about this earlier
was design what is design designs

7218
02:04:39,669 --> 02:04:39,679
was design what is design designs
 

7219
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,910
was design what is design designs
everywhere okay so what they were really

7220
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:41,920
everywhere okay so what they were really
 

7221
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,470
everywhere okay so what they were really
focused on was form

7222
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:44,480
focused on was form
 

7223
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:46,390
focused on was form
how the feel was how it looked the

7224
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:46,400
how the feel was how it looked the
 

7225
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,229
how the feel was how it looked the
aesthetics the physical aesthetics

7226
02:04:50,229 --> 02:04:50,239
aesthetics the physical aesthetics
 

7227
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:53,109
aesthetics the physical aesthetics
and watching going through that process

7228
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:53,119
and watching going through that process
 

7229
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:56,149
and watching going through that process
i learned so much in that process

7230
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
i learned so much in that process
 

7231
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,629
i learned so much in that process
about how to do colors

7232
02:04:58,629 --> 02:04:58,639
about how to do colors
 

7233
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:01,030
about how to do colors
how to do materials how to

7234
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040
how to do materials how to
 

7235
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,069
how to do materials how to
think

7236
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:02,079
think
 

7237
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:04,310
think
deeply about

7238
02:05:04,310 --> 02:05:04,320
deeply about
 

7239
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,510
deeply about
curves

7240
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
curves
 

7241
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,350
curves
right and shadows

7242
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
right and shadows
 

7243
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,350
right and shadows
and how it would look not just in your

7244
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:09,360
and how it would look not just in your
 

7245
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,350
and how it would look not just in your
hand but how it would look in the

7246
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
hand but how it would look in the
 

7247
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,709
hand but how it would look in the
photograph you were going to take from

7248
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
photograph you were going to take from
 

7249
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:14,069
photograph you were going to take from
marketing

7250
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:14,079
marketing
 

7251
02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:17,109
marketing
right so how it would look how it would

7252
02:05:17,109 --> 02:05:17,119
right so how it would look how it would
 

7253
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:18,629
right so how it would look how it would
feel

7254
02:05:18,629 --> 02:05:18,639
feel
 

7255
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:20,790
feel
all of it it was it was all of those

7256
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:20,800
all of it it was it was all of those
 

7257
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,790
all of it it was it was all of those
physical things

7258
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:22,800
physical things
 

7259
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,430
physical things
around that and watching the process to

7260
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:25,440
around that and watching the process to
 

7261
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,390
around that and watching the process to
get there

7262
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:28,400

 

7263
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:31,270

that was enlightening for me right it

7264
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:31,280
that was enlightening for me right it
 

7265
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:34,870
that was enlightening for me right it
opened my mind to go oh okay

7266
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:34,880
opened my mind to go oh okay
 

7267
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,229
opened my mind to go oh okay
just like there's a process for all

7268
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:36,239
just like there's a process for all
 

7269
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:38,470
just like there's a process for all
these other things it wasn't just

7270
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,480
these other things it wasn't just
 

7271
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,270
these other things it wasn't just
magic and you say

7272
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:41,280
magic and you say
 

7273
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,750
magic and you say
ah there it is it was really a process

7274
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
ah there it is it was really a process
 

7275
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,589
ah there it is it was really a process
of refinement you know of opening the

7276
02:05:45,589 --> 02:05:45,599
of refinement you know of opening the
 

7277
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:47,350
of refinement you know of opening the
funnel at the beginning and refining

7278
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:47,360
funnel at the beginning and refining
 

7279
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:51,030
funnel at the beginning and refining
down over time to get to that final

7280
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:51,040
down over time to get to that final
 

7281
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,790
down over time to get to that final
final and selecting and doing the

7282
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,800
final and selecting and doing the
 

7283
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,030
final and selecting and doing the
selection and certain types you could

7284
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,040
selection and certain types you could
 

7285
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,189
selection and certain types you could
certain times they were opinion-based

7286
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
certain times they were opinion-based
 

7287
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:58,149
certain times they were opinion-based
design

7288
02:05:58,149 --> 02:05:58,159
design
 

7289
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,709
design
details but a lot of data a lot of

7290
02:06:00,709 --> 02:06:00,719
details but a lot of data a lot of
 

7291
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:03,350
details but a lot of data a lot of
data-driven designs of what can we what

7292
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:03,360
data-driven designs of what can we what
 

7293
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,910
data-driven designs of what can we what
can we deliver in volume what can we do

7294
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
can we deliver in volume what can we do
 

7295
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,910
can we deliver in volume what can we do
different things so you always had these

7296
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:07,920
different things so you always had these
 

7297
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,270
different things so you always had these
constraints that you had to work with

7298
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
constraints that you had to work with
 

7299
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,189
constraints that you had to work with
under and sometimes

7300
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:11,199
under and sometimes
 

7301
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,669
under and sometimes
they uh and the team not just i would

7302
02:06:13,669 --> 02:06:13,679
they uh and the team not just i would
 

7303
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:15,589
they uh and the team not just i would
say we need this we're like we can't

7304
02:06:15,589 --> 02:06:15,599
say we need this we're like we can't
 

7305
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:18,069
say we need this we're like we can't
deliver that but maybe we were able to

7306
02:06:18,069 --> 02:06:18,079
deliver that but maybe we were able to
 

7307
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:19,990
deliver that but maybe we were able to
work together to find different design

7308
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:20,000
work together to find different design
 

7309
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,270
work together to find different design
characteristics and different

7310
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:21,280
characteristics and different
 

7311
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,350
characteristics and different
implementation characteristics that

7312
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:23,360
implementation characteristics that
 

7313
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:24,390
implementation characteristics that
could

7314
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,400
could
 

7315
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,790
could
get to that point without what they were

7316
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:26,800
get to that point without what they were
 

7317
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,870
get to that point without what they were
describing and instead of

7318
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:28,880
describing and instead of
 

7319
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:31,510
describing and instead of
yes yes yes no no no let's find some

7320
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:31,520
yes yes yes no no no let's find some
 

7321
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,390
yes yes yes no no no let's find some
other way to solve the problem together

7322
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:34,400
other way to solve the problem together
 

7323
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,310
other way to solve the problem together
yeah is

7324
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:36,320
yeah is
 

7325
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:38,950
yeah is
and i've seen this um

7326
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:38,960
and i've seen this um
 

7327
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,109
and i've seen this um
and several companies have more closely

7328
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:41,119
and several companies have more closely
 

7329
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:43,350
and several companies have more closely
interacted with like tesla as an example

7330
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:43,360
interacted with like tesla as an example
 

7331
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:44,550
interacted with like tesla as an example
sometimes

7332
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:44,560
sometimes
 

7333
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:47,750
sometimes
you know talking about curves

7334
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:47,760
you know talking about curves
 

7335
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,069
you know talking about curves
sometimes it's very painful on the

7336
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:50,079
sometimes it's very painful on the
 

7337
02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:51,669
sometimes it's very painful on the
engineering side

7338
02:06:51,669 --> 02:06:51,679
engineering side
 

7339
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:54,310
engineering side
to deliver a very specific kind of

7340
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
to deliver a very specific kind of
 

7341
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,629
to deliver a very specific kind of
absolute thing and

7342
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
absolute thing and
 

7343
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:58,550
absolute thing and
one question that comes up in my mind is

7344
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:58,560
one question that comes up in my mind is
 

7345
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,510
one question that comes up in my mind is
like well how far should we go to try to

7346
02:07:01,510 --> 02:07:01,520
like well how far should we go to try to
 

7347
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,790
like well how far should we go to try to
deliver

7348
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:02,800
deliver
 

7349
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,350
deliver
a tiny adjustment in a curve

7350
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
a tiny adjustment in a curve
 

7351
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:08,550
a tiny adjustment in a curve
in the curvature or in um

7352
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:08,560
in the curvature or in um
 

7353
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,470
in the curvature or in um
like the whatever the form factor is in

7354
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480

7649
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,030
was one thing i think the other big one
was not delivering you know it was all

7650
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:13,040
was not delivering you know it was all
 

7651
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,790
was not delivering you know it was all
of it was hard right it was constrained

7652
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:14,800
of it was hard right it was constrained
 

7653
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,310
of it was hard right it was constrained
we had only so much stuff we were

7654
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:16,320
we had only so much stuff we were
 

7655
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,550
we had only so much stuff we were
bootstrapped we didn't have massive

7656
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:18,560
bootstrapped we didn't have massive
 

7657
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,669
bootstrapped we didn't have massive
funding we didn't get hundreds of

7658
02:12:19,669 --> 02:12:19,679
funding we didn't get hundreds of
 

7659
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:21,510
funding we didn't get hundreds of
millions of dollars it was but we did it

7660
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:21,520
millions of dollars it was but we did it
 

7661
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,030
millions of dollars it was but we did it
for the right reasons but i think the

7662
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:23,040
for the right reasons but i think the
 

7663
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:25,350
for the right reasons but i think the
other big part of it was

7664
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:25,360
other big part of it was
 

7665
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:27,589
other big part of it was
not just building a disruptive product

7666
02:12:27,589 --> 02:12:27,599
not just building a disruptive product
 

7667
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:28,950
not just building a disruptive product
because a lot of the people on the team

7668
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:28,960
because a lot of the people on the team
 

7669
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,950
because a lot of the people on the team
had done that we knew what we were doing

7670
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
had done that we knew what we were doing
 

7671
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,790
had done that we knew what we were doing

02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:58,800
that's dream for them right so
 

7763
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,470
that's dream for them right so
this whole channel was fully controlled

7764
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:00,480
this whole channel was fully controlled
 

7765
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,629
this whole channel was fully controlled
by the product guys and it was almost

7766
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
by the product guys and it was almost
 

7767
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:04,950
by the product guys and it was almost
monopolistic in a way

7768
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:04,960
monopolistic in a way
 

7769
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,950
monopolistic in a way
so how do you go around that

7770
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:06,960
so how do you go around that
 

7771
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,990
so how do you go around that
so

7772
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:08,000
so
 

7773
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,149
so
creating a disruptive go to market

7774
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:10,159
creating a disruptive go to market
 

7775
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:11,030
creating a disruptive go to market
channel

7776
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
channel
 

7777
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,350
channel
one was direct to consumer right and all

7778
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:13,360
one was direct to consumer right and all
 

7779
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,830
one was direct to consumer right and all
the marketing that was necessary to get

7780
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:15,840
the marketing that was necessary to get
 

7781
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,669
the marketing that was necessary to get
that message across

7782
02:14:17,669 --> 02:14:17,679
that message across
 

7783
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:20,229
that message across
another one was getting the installation

7784
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:20,239
another one was getting the installation
 

7785
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:21,669
another one was getting the installation
right

7786
02:14:21,669 --> 02:14:21,679
right
 

7787
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,310
right
no one was self-installing thermostats

7788
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:24,320
no one was self-installing thermostats
 

7789
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,390
no one was self-installing thermostats
so how do we get enough people who are

7790
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,400
so how do we get enough people who are
 

7791
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,149
so how do we get enough people who are
early adopters to be able to

7792
02:14:28,149 --> 02:14:28,159
early adopters to be able to
 

7793
02:14:28,159 --> 02:14:30,470
early adopters to be able to
self-install them confidently

7794
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
self-install them confidently
 

7795
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,069
self-install them confidently
so they didn't still have to call the

7796
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
so they didn't still have to call the
 

7797
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:34,790
so they didn't still have to call the
guy to come and install it because then

7798
02:14:34,790 --> 02:14:34,800
guy to come and install it because then
 

7799
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,470
guy to come and install it because then
he would say this is a crap product no i

7800
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
he would say this is a crap product no i
 

7801
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,470
he would say this is a crap product no i
got the must better product right so you

7802
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:38,480
got the must better product right so you
 

7803
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,550
got the must better product right so you
had to get rid of that friction

7804
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:40,560
had to get rid of that friction
 

7805
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,229
had to get rid of that friction
and then ultimately how do you get the

7806
02:14:42,229 --> 02:14:42,239
and then ultimately how do you get the
 

7807
02:14:42,239 --> 02:14:44,229
and then ultimately how do you get the
people who were not just early adopters

7808
02:14:44,229 --> 02:14:44,239
people who were not just early adopters
 

7809
02:14:44,239 --> 02:14:45,910
people who were not just early adopters
but people who needed to see it and

7810
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:45,920
but people who needed to see it and
 

7811
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:47,589
but people who needed to see it and
touch it before they bought it how do

7812
02:14:47,589 --> 02:14:47,599
touch it before they bought it how do
 

7813
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,229
touch it before they bought it how do
you get that into retail when

7814
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
you get that into retail when
 

7815
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:52,390
you get that into retail when
the large brands of the time of

7816
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:52,400
the large brands of the time of
 

7817
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,470
the large brands of the time of
thermostats and home depot and lowe's

7818
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,480
thermostats and home depot and lowe's
 

7819
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,229
thermostats and home depot and lowe's
had contracts that they couldn't bring

7820
02:14:56,229 --> 02:14:56,239
had contracts that they couldn't bring
 

7821
02:14:56,239 --> 02:14:58,310
had contracts that they couldn't bring
in any other brands

7822
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:58,320
in any other brands
 

7823
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,229
in any other brands
they were owning the channel all the way

7824
02:15:00,229 --> 02:15:00,239
they were owning the channel all the way
 

7825
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:02,950
they were owning the channel all the way
to where there was an any sort of slight

7826
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:02,960
to where there was an any sort of slight
 

7827
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,669
to where there was an any sort of slight
customer choice and it was really

7828
02:15:05,669 --> 02:15:05,679
customer choice and it was really
 

7829
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:07,990
customer choice and it was really
contractor choice more than it was and

7830
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:08,000
contractor choice more than it was and
 

7831
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,030
contractor choice more than it was and
consumer choice so all of that had to be

7832
02:15:11,030 --> 02:15:11,040

innovated along with the product and so

7834
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:13,760

uh what's what's it take to take that

8460
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,160
uh what's what's it take to take that
 

8461
02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:00,230
uh what's what's it take to take that
leap maybe leave your

8462
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:00,240
leap maybe leave your
 

8463
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,070
leap maybe leave your
job

you start to see resonate and it's not

8654
02:29:17,349 --> 02:29:17,359
you start to see resonate and it's not
 

8655

you start to see resonate and it's not
about age it's just about this

8656
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:19,280
about age it's just about this
 

8657
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,750
about age it's just about this
connection right i have mentors

8658
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:21,760
connection right i have mentors
 

8659
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:23,110
connection right i have mentors
obviously when i was young all my

8660
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:23,120
obviously when i was young all my
 

8661
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:25,429
obviously when i was young all my
mentors were older and as i get older i

8662
02:29:25,429 --> 02:29:25,439
mentors were older and as i get older i
 

8663
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:27,270
mentors were older and as i get older i
have mentors who are younger than me or

8664
02:29:27,270 --> 02:29:27,280
have mentors who are younger than me or
 

8665
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,110
have mentors who are younger than me or
the same age right they're not all just

8666
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:29,120
the same age right they're not all just
 

8667
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:31,750
the same age right they're not all just
older right and so it's about that

8668
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:31,760
older right and so it's about that
 

8669
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:33,670
older right and so it's about that
connection it's about being on that same

8670
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:33,680
connection it's about being on that same
 

8671
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,870
connection it's about being on that same
wavelength

8672
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
wavelength
 

8673
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:37,110
wavelength
but they also they can

was so
 

8695
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:56,870
was so
detailed in the technology i needed to

8696
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
detailed in the technology i needed to
 

8697
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:59,030
detailed in the technology i needed to
see from other perspectives but then

8698
02:29:59,030 --> 02:29:59,040
see from other perspectives but then
 

8699
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,230
see from other perspectives but then
they wanted to learn more about the

they wanted to learn more about the
 

8701
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:01,990
they wanted to learn more about the
technology right or they thought that

8702
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:02,000
technology right or they thought that
 

8703
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,070
technology right or they thought that
this idea was so great that it should

8704
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,080
this idea was so great that it should
 

8705
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,630
this idea was so great that it should
exist now let's work together on that

8706
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:06,640
exist now let's work together on that
