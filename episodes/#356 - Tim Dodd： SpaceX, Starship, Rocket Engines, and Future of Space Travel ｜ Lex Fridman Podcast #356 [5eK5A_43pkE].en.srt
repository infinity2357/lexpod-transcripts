1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,969

and the nozzle so as you're saying

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:01,979
and the nozzle so as you're saying
 

3
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,290
and the nozzle so as you're saying
there's a bunch of different design

4
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,300
there's a bunch of different design
 

5
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,110
there's a bunch of different design
options but it's a critical part of this

6
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,120
options but it's a critical part of this
 

7
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,750
options but it's a critical part of this
yeah how you do that conversion which is

8
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:08,760
yeah how you do that conversion which is
 

9
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,570
yeah how you do that conversion which is
basically like how much can you convert

10
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:11,580
basically like how much can you convert
 

11
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,730
basically like how much can you convert
is really like the ultimate game how

12
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,740
is really like the ultimate game how
 

13
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,310
is really like the ultimate game how
much pressure and heat can we convert

14
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
much pressure and heat can we convert
 

15
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,410
much pressure and heat can we convert
into thrust like that's really at the

16
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
into thrust like that's really at the
 

17
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,370
into thrust like that's really at the
end of the day that's what a rocket

18
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,380
end of the day that's what a rocket
 

19
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,950
end of the day that's what a rocket
engine is

20
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:21,960

there's different versions of those

46
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,140
there's different versions of those
 

47
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,950
there's different versions of those
Falcon heavy Starship and also the the

48

Falcon one is where it all started the

52
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:02,039
Falcon one is where it all started the
 

53
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,709
Falcon one is where it all started the
original intent and the original idea of

54
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:03,719
original intent and the original idea of
 

55
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,710
original intent and the original idea of
of SpaceX was Elon wanted to try to get

56
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
of SpaceX was Elon wanted to try to get
 

57
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,350
of SpaceX was Elon wanted to try to get
something to Mars you know um he saw

58
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
something to Mars you know um he saw
 

59
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,149
something to Mars you know um he saw
that NASA didn't have a current Mars

60
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,159
that NASA didn't have a current Mars
 

61
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,929
that NASA didn't have a current Mars
plan

62
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:11,939
plan
 

63
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,969
plan
and he wanted to go to Mars so he

64
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:13,979
and he wanted to go to Mars so he
 

65
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,550
and he wanted to go to Mars so he
decided how do I best do this

66
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
decided how do I best do this
 

67
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,830
decided how do I best do this
um he literally wanted to at first

68
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
um he literally wanted to at first
 

69
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,490
um he literally wanted to at first
purchase a rocket from from Russia uh

70
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,500
purchase a rocket from from Russia uh
 

71
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,429
purchase a rocket from from Russia uh
then on the after a foiled attempt at

72
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
then on the after a foiled attempt at
 

73
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,050
then on the after a foiled attempt at
doing that he decided he was going to

74
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,060
doing that he decided he was going to
 

75
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,270
doing that he decided he was going to
try to develop his own rocket and the

76
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
try to develop his own rocket and the
 

77
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,770
try to develop his own rocket and the
Falcon one is what came out of that

78
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:30,780
Falcon one is what came out of that
 

79
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,929
Falcon one is what came out of that
process and he developed a pretty

80
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
process and he developed a pretty
 

81
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,370
process and he developed a pretty
incredible team like I don't know how

82
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,380
incredible team like I don't know how
 

83
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,690
incredible team like I don't know how
exactly he's stumbled upon the team that

84
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:35,700
exactly he's stumbled upon the team that
 

85
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,550
exactly he's stumbled upon the team that
he stumbled upon that quickly but the

86
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,560
he stumbled upon that quickly but the
 

87
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,870
he stumbled upon that quickly but the
people that he assembled were amazing

88
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
people that he assembled were amazing
 

89
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,050
people that he assembled were amazing
and they built the Falcon one which was

90
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,060
and they built the Falcon one which was
 

91
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,390
and they built the Falcon one which was
a single Merlin engine followed by an

92
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
a single Merlin engine followed by an
 

93
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,190
a single Merlin engine followed by an
upper stage engine called the Kestrel

94
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,200
upper stage engine called the Kestrel
 

95
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,630
upper stage engine called the Kestrel
engine

96
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,640
engine
 

97
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,370
engine
um pretty small compared to the things

98
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,380
um pretty small compared to the things
 

99
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,450
um pretty small compared to the things
they're working on today with that

100
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,460
they're working on today with that
 

101
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,569
they're working on today with that
Merlin engine continued to evolve uh

102
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:53,579
Merlin engine continued to evolve uh
 

103
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,310
Merlin engine continued to evolve uh
into being the power plant for the

104
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
into being the power plant for the
 

105
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,690
into being the power plant for the
Falcon 9. they went from a small lift

106
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:56,700
Falcon 9. they went from a small lift
 

107
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,429
Falcon 9. they went from a small lift
launch vehicle up into the medium-class

108
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
launch vehicle up into the medium-class
 

109
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,630
launch vehicle up into the medium-class
launch vehicle so they could provide

110
00:01:59,630 --> 00:01:59,640
launch vehicle so they could provide
 

111
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,670
launch vehicle so they could provide
services for NASA

112
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
services for NASA
 

113
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,050
services for NASA
um that's one of the big things they

114
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,060
um that's one of the big things they
 

115
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,490
um that's one of the big things they
first kind of hung their hat up was they

116
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,500
first kind of hung their hat up was they
 

117
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,170
first kind of hung their hat up was they
got the opportunity to fly cargo to the

118
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
got the opportunity to fly cargo to the
 

119
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,389
got the opportunity to fly cargo to the
International Space Station under um

120
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
International Space Station under um
 

121
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,949
International Space Station under um
originally it's called the cots program

122
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
originally it's called the cots program
 

123
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,290
originally it's called the cots program
the commercial orbital transportation

124
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
the commercial orbital transportation
 

125
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,930
the commercial orbital transportation
services uh for NASA which evolved into

126
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:14,940
services uh for NASA which evolved into
 

127
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,210
services uh for NASA which evolved into
the commercial resupply contracts and

128
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
the commercial resupply contracts and
 

129
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,010
the commercial resupply contracts and
that's when SpaceX developed both their

130
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,020
that's when SpaceX developed both their
 

131
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,670
that's when SpaceX developed both their
Dragon capsule which is a uh uncrewed at

132
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,680
Dragon capsule which is a uh uncrewed at
 

133
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,710
Dragon capsule which is a uh uncrewed at
first uh spacecraft that conducted the

134
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
first uh spacecraft that conducted the
 

135
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,470
first uh spacecraft that conducted the
ISS and the Falcon 9 rocket that can

136
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,480
ISS and the Falcon 9 rocket that can
 

137
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,670
ISS and the Falcon 9 rocket that can
take it to the International Space

138
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,680
take it to the International Space
 

139
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,850
take it to the International Space
Station and the dragon rides on is the

140
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:31,860
Station and the dragon rides on is the
 

141
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,570
Station and the dragon rides on is the
thing up top that rides on the big

142
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:34,580
thing up top that rides on the big
 

143
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,030
thing up top that rides on the big
booster thing that's uh that launches it

144
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,040
booster thing that's uh that launches it
 

145
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,670
booster thing that's uh that launches it
into orbit exactly yep so the Falcon 9's

146
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:40,680
into orbit exactly yep so the Falcon 9's
 

147
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,330
into orbit exactly yep so the Falcon 9's
the the semi truck the dragon capsules

148
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,340
the the semi truck the dragon capsules
 

149
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,130
the the semi truck the dragon capsules
the payload you know it's the thing

150
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,140
the payload you know it's the thing
 

151
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,330
the payload you know it's the thing
being dropped off basically at

152
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,340
being dropped off basically at
 

153
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,309
being dropped off basically at
assassination in this case the

154
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
assassination in this case the
 

155
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,690
assassination in this case the
destination is the International Space

156
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:50,700
destination is the International Space
 

157
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,309
destination is the International Space
Station

158
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
Station
 

159
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,729
Station
um and uh yeah so they developed those

160
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:55,739
um and uh yeah so they developed those
 

161
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,030
um and uh yeah so they developed those
relatively quickly and uh became a

162
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
relatively quickly and uh became a
 

163
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,530
relatively quickly and uh became a
commercial success before you know it

launches granted China beat them by two

178
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:14,819
launches granted China beat them by two
 

179
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,270
launches granted China beat them by two
launches this last in 2022 but

180
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
launches this last in 2022 but
 

181
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,670
launches this last in 2022 but
prior uh prior year SpaceX beat the

182
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
prior uh prior year SpaceX beat the
 

183
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,290
prior uh prior year SpaceX beat the
entire country of China I mean it's it's

184
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,300
entire country of China I mean it's it's
 

185
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,290
entire country of China I mean it's it's
nuts and just like you said the SpaceX

186
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:24,300
nuts and just like you said the SpaceX
 

187
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,050
nuts and just like you said the SpaceX
still beats China even this year in

188
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,060
still beats China even this year in
 

189
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,369
still beats China even this year in
terms of the amount of payload those

190
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:28,379
terms of the amount of payload those
 

191
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,649
terms of the amount of payload those
though so

192
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:29,659
though so
 

193
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,470
though so
yeah the mass the orbit right that uh

194
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
yeah the mass the orbit right that uh
 

195
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,530
yeah the mass the orbit right that uh
China had like 60 something a couple

196
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:36,540
China had like 60 something a couple
 

197
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,070
China had like 60 something a couple
more uh launches but the there was just

198
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
more uh launches but the there was just
 

199
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,229
more uh launches but the there was just
like small cubes that type of launches

200
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
like small cubes that type of launches
 

201
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,449
like small cubes that type of launches
exactly some of them are literally like

202
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:44,459
exactly some of them are literally like
 

203
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,009
exactly some of them are literally like
100 kilograms or something you know like

204
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:46,019
100 kilograms or something you know like
 

205
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,410

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,949
not not large payloads Bissell SpaceX
customers are different different so

208
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:51,959
customers are different different so
 

209
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,410
customers are different different so
whoever wants to send payloads up into

210
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,420
whoever wants to send payloads up into
 

211
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,809
whoever wants to send payloads up into
space yes but right now their biggest

212
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:56,819
space yes but right now their biggest
 

213
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,850

starlink with Starling one of the

216
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:00,540
starlink with Starling one of the
 

217
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,910
starlink with Starling one of the
biggest reasons they've launched so much

218
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
biggest reasons they've launched so much
 

219
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,589
biggest reasons they've launched so much
mass to Orbitz because starlink has

220
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
mass to Orbitz because starlink has
 

221
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,410
mass to Orbitz because starlink has
designed around the payload Fairing and

222
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,420
designed around the payload Fairing and
 

223
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,149

the payload capabilities of the Falcon 9
 

225
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,190
the payload capabilities of the Falcon 9
rocket so you know because they're

226
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200
rocket so you know because they're
 

227
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,570
rocket so you know because they're
vertically integrated because they build

228
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:11,580
vertically integrated because they build
 

229
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,770
vertically integrated because they build
their own satellites because they're

230
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:12,780
their own satellites because they're
 

231
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,390
their own satellites because they're
building their own rocket they can

232
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
building their own rocket they can
 

233
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,890
building their own rocket they can
literally design a system that's you

234
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:15,900
literally design a system that's you
 

235
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,569
literally design a system that's you
know another manufacturer might have

00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:17,579
know another manufacturer might have
 

237
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,969
know another manufacturer might have
made a more Square satellite that was

238
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:19,979
made a more Square satellite that was
 

239
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,890
made a more Square satellite that was
heavier or something but SpaceX looked

240
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:21,900
heavier or something but SpaceX looked
 

241
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,629
heavier or something but SpaceX looked
at it from a blank slate and said here's

242
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:23,639
at it from a blank slate and said here's
 

243
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,550
at it from a blank slate and said here's
our constraints our payload Mass

244
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,560
our constraints our payload Mass
 

245
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,810
our constraints our payload Mass
constraints are volume constraints and

246
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:26,820
constraints are volume constraints and
 

247
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,129
constraints are volume constraints and
they made a funky looking satellite

248
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:28,139
they made a funky looking satellite
 

249
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,570
they made a funky looking satellite
things like the size of a you know it's

250
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,580
things like the size of a you know it's
 

251
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,670
things like the size of a you know it's
like a table folded up which isn't

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
like a table folded up which isn't
 

253
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,230
like a table folded up which isn't
anything I've you know really ever seen

254
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,240
anything I've you know really ever seen
 

255
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,870
anything I've you know really ever seen
before so but it's purpose built to fit

256
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:35,880
before so but it's purpose built to fit
 

257
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,030
before so but it's purpose built to fit
as efficiently as possible inside their

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,040
as efficiently as possible inside their
 

259
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,830
as efficiently as possible inside their
Fairing and inside the capabilities of

260
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
Fairing and inside the capabilities of
 

261
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,330
Fairing and inside the capabilities of
that rocket so therefore

262
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,340
that rocket so therefore
 

263
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,610
that rocket so therefore
because they're launching those like an

insane amounts of mass like we've never
 

273
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,629
insane amounts of mass like we've never
seen before what about the different

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
seen before what about the different
 

275
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,550
seen before what about the different
versions of Falcon 9 before so we can

276
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
versions of Falcon 9 before so we can
 

277
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,930
versions of Falcon 9 before so we can
Linger on them what are some interesting

um still in the same diameter that the
 

303
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,029
um still in the same diameter that the
rocket was the fuselage was more or less

304
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
rocket was the fuselage was more or less
 

305
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,850
rocket was the fuselage was more or less
the same 3.7 meter wide diameter but the

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:25,860
the same 3.7 meter wide diameter but the
 

307
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,409
the same 3.7 meter wide diameter but the
the actual thrust structure changed and

308
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:27,419
the actual thrust structure changed and
 

309
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,810
the actual thrust structure changed and
one of the big efficiency gains was you

310
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:29,820
one of the big efficiency gains was you
 

311
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,310
one of the big efficiency gains was you
no longer have you know a corner engine

no longer have you know a corner engine
 

313
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,710
no longer have you know a corner engine
and then like a edge engine and then

314
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,720
and then like a edge engine and then
 

315
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,390
and then like a edge engine and then
another Corner engine you can just make

316

the same shape and then the your
 

323
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,330
the same shape and then the your
interchangeability and your

324
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:44,340
interchangeability and your
 

325
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,249
interchangeability and your
manufacturability becomes a lot simpler

326
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:46,259
manufacturability becomes a lot simpler
 

327
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,930
manufacturability becomes a lot simpler
so that was kind of one of the bigger

328
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:47,940
so that was kind of one of the bigger
 

329
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,610
so that was kind of one of the bigger
upgrades at first and they kept

330
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:49,620
upgrades at first and they kept
 

331
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,510
upgrades at first and they kept
stretching it every time they like

332
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
stretching it every time they like
 

333
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,010
stretching it every time they like
touched this thing it got longer and

334
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,020
touched this thing it got longer and
 

335
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,350
touched this thing it got longer and
like or taller and taller technically

336
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,360
like or taller and taller technically
 

337
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,029
like or taller and taller technically
um and then the next big feature that

338
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:56,039
um and then the next big feature that
 

339
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,570
um and then the next big feature that
you saw uh in 2014 would have been they

340
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,580
you saw uh in 2014 would have been they
 

341
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,029
you saw uh in 2014 would have been they
added Landing legs to a Falcon 9 rocket

342
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,039
added Landing legs to a Falcon 9 rocket
 

343
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,710
added Landing legs to a Falcon 9 rocket
which was I was at that was the first

344
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:03,720
which was I was at that was the first
 

345
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,330
which was I was at that was the first
launch I ever went to was actually to

346
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,340
launch I ever went to was actually to
 

347
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,230
launch I ever went to was actually to
see

348
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
see
 

349
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,029
see
um it was crs3 so commercial resupply

350
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:08,039
um it was crs3 so commercial resupply
 

351
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,170
um it was crs3 so commercial resupply
mission three and it was probably there

352
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,180
mission three and it was probably there
 

353
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,850
mission three and it was probably there
God I don't remember what that was like

354
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:10,860
God I don't remember what that was like
 

355
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,249
God I don't remember what that was like
their 14th or 15th launch or something

356
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:13,259
their 14th or 15th launch or something
 

357
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,469
their 14th or 15th launch or something
like pretty early on

358
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:15,479
like pretty early on
 

359
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,629
like pretty early on
um and people were literally laughing at

360
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
um and people were literally laughing at
 

361
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,070
um and people were literally laughing at
the idea of them putting Landing legs on

362
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,080
the idea of them putting Landing legs on
 

363
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,330
the idea of them putting Landing legs on
it they just thought it was stupid

364
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,340
it they just thought it was stupid
 

365
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,129
it they just thought it was stupid
they're like why are they wasting why is

366
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
they're like why are they wasting why is
 

367
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,469
they're like why are they wasting why is
this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting

368
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting
 

369
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,850
this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting
his time trying to

370
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:25,860
his time trying to
 

371
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,950
his time trying to
land a rocket it's not going to work so

372
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
land a rocket it's not going to work so
 

373
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,510
land a rocket it's not going to work so
you said the Mars planet was there in

374
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
you said the Mars planet was there in
 

375
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,430
you said the Mars planet was there in
the beginning uh what about the

376
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
the beginning uh what about the
 

377
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,650
the beginning uh what about the
reusability of rockets

378
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,660
reusability of rockets
 

379
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,270
reusability of rockets
was that there in the beginning

380
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
was that there in the beginning
 

381
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,730
was that there in the beginning
I think reusability definitely you know

382
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,740
I think reusability definitely you know
 

383
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,330
I think reusability definitely you know
it's it's a necessary part of making any

384
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,340
it's it's a necessary part of making any
 

385
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,890
it's it's a necessary part of making any
kind of interplanetary

386
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
kind of interplanetary
 

387
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,650
kind of interplanetary
Mission you know in order to actually do

388
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:45,660
Mission you know in order to actually do
 

389
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,930
Mission you know in order to actually do
that just financially you have to start

390
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:47,940
that just financially you have to start
 

391
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,189
that just financially you have to start
reusing these things in terms of the

392
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
reusing these things in terms of the
 

393
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,050
reusing these things in terms of the
development of the Falcon 1 and falcon

394
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,060
development of the Falcon 1 and falcon
 

395
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,270
development of the Falcon 1 and falcon
9.

396
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,280
9.
 

397
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,830
9.
how early on did the uh goal of reusing

398
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
how early on did the uh goal of reusing
 

399
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,330
how early on did the uh goal of reusing
the rocket having the rocket actually

400
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,340
the rocket having the rocket actually
 

401
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,330
the rocket having the rocket actually
land how early did that goal creep in I

402
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:02,340
land how early did that goal creep in I
 

403
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,090
land how early did that goal creep in I
I can't speak for Elon in SpaceX but it

404
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
I can't speak for Elon in SpaceX but it
 

405
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,129
I can't speak for Elon in SpaceX but it
was pretty um you know immediate they

406
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:07,139
was pretty um you know immediate they
 

407
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,390
was pretty um you know immediate they
wanted to try to recover and as a matter

408
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
wanted to try to recover and as a matter
 

409
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,590
wanted to try to recover and as a matter
of fact I think the very first two

410
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:09,600
of fact I think the very first two
 

411
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,990
of fact I think the very first two
Falcon 9 rockets and Falcon one I think

412
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
Falcon 9 rockets and Falcon one I think
 

413
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,330
Falcon 9 rockets and Falcon one I think
they even wanted to try to recover uh

414
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:14,340
they even wanted to try to recover uh
 

415
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,010
they even wanted to try to recover uh
using parachutes to recover the first

416
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,020
using parachutes to recover the first
 

417
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,270
using parachutes to recover the first
stage

418
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
stage
 

419
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,089
stage
um and it now fast forward you know

420
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:20,099
um and it now fast forward you know
 

421
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,309
um and it now fast forward you know
almost 20 years later and Rocket lab is

422
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
almost 20 years later and Rocket lab is
 

423
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,409
almost 20 years later and Rocket lab is
actually doing a concept like that where

424
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:24,419
actually doing a concept like that where
 

425
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,170
actually doing a concept like that where
they're uh pulling a parachute after the

426
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,180
they're uh pulling a parachute after the
 

427
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,850
they're uh pulling a parachute after the
first stage is re-entering and they

428
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:28,860
first stage is re-entering and they
 

429
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,170
first stage is re-entering and they
actually are trying to recover it with a

430
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,180
actually are trying to recover it with a
 

431
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,670
actually are trying to recover it with a
helicopter he's gonna try to snatch it

432
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
helicopter he's gonna try to snatch it
 

433
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,230
helicopter he's gonna try to snatch it
out of the air they've actually done it

434
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
out of the air they've actually done it
 

435
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,430
out of the air they've actually done it
they've actually done it successfully

436
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,440
they've actually done it successfully
 

437
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,469
they've actually done it successfully
once how does the helicopter grab the

438
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
once how does the helicopter grab the
 

439
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,390
once how does the helicopter grab the
the rocket with this giant like drag

440
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
the rocket with this giant like drag
 

441
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,969
the rocket with this giant like drag
line and a hook oh and then literally

442
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:40,979
line and a hook oh and then literally
 

443
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,790
line and a hook oh and then literally
just like grabs snags onto the parachute

444
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:43,800
just like grabs snags onto the parachute
 

445
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,189
just like grabs snags onto the parachute
wow and it's pretty amazing and but this

446
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
wow and it's pretty amazing and but this
 

447
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,110
wow and it's pretty amazing and but this
is a small rocket their Rocket's only

448
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
is a small rocket their Rocket's only
 

449
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,029
is a small rocket their Rocket's only
about a metric ton that the booster is

450
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,039
about a metric ton that the booster is
 

451
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,330
about a metric ton that the booster is
empty so the rocket releases parachutes

452
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,340
empty so the rocket releases parachutes
 

453
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,570
empty so the rocket releases parachutes
yep like really high up I'd love to see

454
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
yep like really high up I'd love to see
 

455
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,010
yep like really high up I'd love to see
this yeah that's an interesting idea

456
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
this yeah that's an interesting idea
 

457
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,930
this yeah that's an interesting idea
there's so many interesting ideas and

458
00:07:59,930 --> 00:07:59,940
there's so many interesting ideas and
 

459
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,450
there's so many interesting ideas and
possibilities like SpaceX basically just

460
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,460
possibilities like SpaceX basically just
 

461
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,129
possibilities like SpaceX basically just
innovated

462
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:04,139
innovated
 

463
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,430
innovated
a lot of different weird ideas just in

464
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
a lot of different weird ideas just in
 

465
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,870
a lot of different weird ideas just in
in the pursuit of making things more

466
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:08,880
in the pursuit of making things more
 

467
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,969
in the pursuit of making things more
efficient reusable

468
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:10,979
efficient reusable
 

469
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,469
efficient reusable
um all of that so basically thinking

470
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
um all of that so basically thinking
 

471
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,909
um all of that so basically thinking
from first principles how to solve this

472
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
from first principles how to solve this
 

473
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,710
from first principles how to solve this
problem and so what you find is like

474
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
problem and so what you find is like
 

475
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,330
problem and so what you find is like
you'll get all these kind of crazy kind

476
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:17,340
you'll get all these kind of crazy kind
 

477
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,430
you'll get all these kind of crazy kind
of solutions and with SpaceX they

478
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
of solutions and with SpaceX they
 

479
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,050
of solutions and with SpaceX they
weren't even getting to the point of the

480
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,060
weren't even getting to the point of the
 

481
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,909
weren't even getting to the point of the
booster surviving re-entry long enough

482
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:22,919
booster surviving re-entry long enough
 

483
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,469
booster surviving re-entry long enough
to be able to pull the parachutes yeah

484
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
to be able to pull the parachutes yeah
 

485
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,390
to be able to pull the parachutes yeah
you know they're Mass fractions you know

486
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
you know they're Mass fractions you know
 

487
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,650
you know they're Mass fractions you know
and in that varies

488
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,660
and in that varies
 

489
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,689
and in that varies
every single Rocket's different you know

490
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:29,699
every single Rocket's different you know
 

491
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,490
every single Rocket's different you know
all the you know for instance rocket lab

492
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,500
all the you know for instance rocket lab
 

493
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,389
all the you know for instance rocket lab
uses carbon composite fuselage and tanks

494
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:35,399
uses carbon composite fuselage and tanks
 

495
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,250
uses carbon composite fuselage and tanks
um or you know same thing and that's

496
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,260
um or you know same thing and that's
 

497
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,589
um or you know same thing and that's
very very lightweight has really good

498
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
very very lightweight has really good
 

499
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,790
very very lightweight has really good
Mass fractions and therefore they're

500
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
Mass fractions and therefore they're
 

501
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,230
Mass fractions and therefore they're
drag coefficients and things like that

502
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
drag coefficients and things like that
 

503
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,230
drag coefficients and things like that
they were able to survive re-entry of

504
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:45,240
they were able to survive re-entry of
 

505
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,490
they were able to survive re-entry of
the first stage which is something that

506
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,500
the first stage which is something that
 

507
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,070
the first stage which is something that
SpaceX wasn't able to do at the time

508
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,080
SpaceX wasn't able to do at the time
 

509
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,750
SpaceX wasn't able to do at the time
um what's what the kind of the big I

510
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
um what's what the kind of the big I
 

511
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,949
um what's what the kind of the big I
think breakthrough for SpaceX with

512
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
think breakthrough for SpaceX with
 

513
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,190
think breakthrough for SpaceX with
reusing the booster is they uh they

514
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
reusing the booster is they uh they
 

515
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,750
reusing the booster is they uh they
realized we have to basically slow down

516
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,760
realized we have to basically slow down
 

517
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,850
realized we have to basically slow down
before we hit the atmosphere so they

518
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
before we hit the atmosphere so they
 

519
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,710
before we hit the atmosphere so they
actually do what they used to call a

520
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
actually do what they used to call a
 

521
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,210
actually do what they used to call a
re-entry burn which I still think is the

522
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,220
re-entry burn which I still think is the
 

523
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,710
re-entry burn which I still think is the
correct term because it is re-entering

524
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,720
correct term because it is re-entering
 

525
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,850
correct term because it is re-entering
the atmosphere but now they call it the

526
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:04,860
the atmosphere but now they call it the
 

527
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,070
the atmosphere but now they call it the
entry burn and they light up three of

528
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,080
entry burn and they light up three of
 

529
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,350
entry burn and they light up three of
the nine Merlin engines uh not only to

530
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
the nine Merlin engines uh not only to
 

531
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,670
the nine Merlin engines uh not only to
slow it down but actually even while

532
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:10,680
slow it down but actually even while
 

533
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,470
slow it down but actually even while
those engines are firing it creates like

534
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
those engines are firing it creates like
 

535
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,050
those engines are firing it creates like
a a literal like force field as it's

536
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,060
a a literal like force field as it's
 

537
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,670
a a literal like force field as it's
falling through the through the

538
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:16,680
falling through the through the
 

539
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,190
falling through the through the
atmosphere interesting and uh but it

540
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
atmosphere interesting and uh but it
 

541
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,290
atmosphere interesting and uh but it
also decreases the velocity by almost

542
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,300
also decreases the velocity by almost
 

543
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,630
also decreases the velocity by almost
half or around half and then that

544
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:23,640
half or around half and then that
 

545
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,730
half or around half and then that
therefore decreases the amount of you

546
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:25,740
therefore decreases the amount of you
 

547
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,630
therefore decreases the amount of you
know the biggest thing with the

548
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
know the biggest thing with the
 

549
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,490
know the biggest thing with the
atmosphere is that as it gets compressed

550
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:28,500
atmosphere is that as it gets compressed
 

551
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,630
atmosphere is that as it gets compressed
against the front of any anything flying

552
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
against the front of any anything flying
 

553
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,490
against the front of any anything flying
through the atmosphere the compressed

554
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
through the atmosphere the compressed
 

555
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,769
through the atmosphere the compressed
atoms just get hot and they can get so

556
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:36,779
atoms just get hot and they can get so
 

557
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,269
atoms just get hot and they can get so
hot they turn into a plasma and they get

558
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:38,279
hot they turn into a plasma and they get
 

559
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,650
hot they turn into a plasma and they get
so hot they can just absolutely destroy

560
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
so hot they can just absolutely destroy
 

561
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,710
so hot they can just absolutely destroy
anything so they slow down enough that

562
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
anything so they slow down enough that
 

563
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,470
anything so they slow down enough that
the air molecules don't end up you know

564
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
the air molecules don't end up you know
 

565
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,290
the air molecules don't end up you know
destroying the vehicle on re-entry and

566
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,300
destroying the vehicle on re-entry and
 

567
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,610
destroying the vehicle on re-entry and
then they then they realize I think at

568
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:49,620
then they then they realize I think at
 

569
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,570
then they then they realize I think at
some point there's probably a similar

570
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,580
some point there's probably a similar
 

571
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,710
some point there's probably a similar
crossover they're like well if we're

572
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,720
crossover they're like well if we're
 

573
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,030
crossover they're like well if we're
lighting the engines already to slow

574
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
lighting the engines already to slow
 

575
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,590
lighting the engines already to slow
down in the atmosphere we can just use

576
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:54,600
down in the atmosphere we can just use
 

577
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,590
down in the atmosphere we can just use
that same engine to land and so like

578
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
that same engine to land and so like
 

579
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,090
that same engine to land and so like
well what if we just stuck Landing legs

580
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,100
well what if we just stuck Landing legs
 

581
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,889
well what if we just stuck Landing legs
on it and just landed the thing

582
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:00,899
on it and just landed the thing
 

583
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,930
on it and just landed the thing
vertically and next thing you know is

584
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
vertically and next thing you know is
 

585
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,750
vertically and next thing you know is
December 21st 2015 they did exactly that

586
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
December 21st 2015 they did exactly that
 

587
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,030
December 21st 2015 they did exactly that
for the first time so you were there

588
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,040
for the first time so you were there
 

589
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,070
for the first time so you were there
before that then right yeah yeah from

590
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
before that then right yeah yeah from
 

591
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,590
before that then right yeah yeah from
2014 yep early 2014. so that and for me

592
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
2014 yep early 2014. so that and for me
 

593
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,630
2014 yep early 2014. so that and for me
like that was so fun watching you know

594
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
like that was so fun watching you know
 

595
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,250
like that was so fun watching you know
that was like the peak of me just

596
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,260
that was like the peak of me just
 

597
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,889
that was like the peak of me just
becoming obsessed with uh with this idea

598
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:18,899
becoming obsessed with uh with this idea
 

599
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,170
becoming obsessed with uh with this idea
I'm watching with like and back in the

600
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,180
I'm watching with like and back in the
 

601
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,850
I'm watching with like and back in the
day it was like months between launches

602
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,860
day it was like months between launches
 

603
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,350
day it was like months between launches
you know so a launch was like a big idea

604
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,360
you know so a launch was like a big idea
 

605
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,870
you know so a launch was like a big idea
I'd wake up at 3am to watch this Landing

606
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
I'd wake up at 3am to watch this Landing
 

607
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,790
I'd wake up at 3am to watch this Landing
attempt or whatever you know and every

608
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
attempt or whatever you know and every
 

609
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,009
attempt or whatever you know and every
you know there's crs4

610
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:31,019
you know there's crs4
 

611
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,009
you know there's crs4
um almost almost landed crs5 almost

612
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:34,019
um almost almost landed crs5 almost
 

613
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,650
um almost almost landed crs5 almost
landed crs6 crs7 blew up I was watching

614
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:36,660
landed crs6 crs7 blew up I was watching
 

615
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,910
landed crs6 crs7 blew up I was watching
that on I think it was like a Saturday

616
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
that on I think it was like a Saturday
 

617
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,829
that on I think it was like a Saturday
morning or maybe a Sunday morning and I

618
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
morning or maybe a Sunday morning and I
 

619
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,570
morning or maybe a Sunday morning and I
remember watching that and watched it

620
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:41,580
remember watching that and watched it
 

621
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,370
remember watching that and watched it
blow up and I was like oh my God now

622
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,380
blow up and I was like oh my God now
 

623
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,130
blow up and I was like oh my God now
what you know and it blew up on Ascent

624
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,140
what you know and it blew up on Ascent
 

625
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,650
what you know and it blew up on Ascent
it was their first failure

626
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:48,660
it was their first failure
 

627
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,530
it was their first failure
um so it was their 18th flight I believe

628
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,540
um so it was their 18th flight I believe
 

629
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,290
um so it was their 18th flight I believe
crs7 the upper stage um had a uh one of

630
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:54,300
crs7 the upper stage um had a uh one of
 

631
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,030
crs7 the upper stage um had a uh one of
the butler's bottles inside the tanks

632
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,040
the butler's bottles inside the tanks
 

633
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,410
the butler's bottles inside the tanks
that are filled with helium and one of

634
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,420
that are filled with helium and one of
 

635
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,810
that are filled with helium and one of
those bottles broke off on ascent and

636
00:10:59,810 --> 00:10:59,820
those bottles broke off on ascent and
 

637
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,730
those bottles broke off on ascent and
actually just completely over pressured

638
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:01,740
actually just completely over pressured
 

639
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,050
actually just completely over pressured
this the upper stage and the upper stage

640
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,060
this the upper stage and the upper stage
 

641
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,449
this the upper stage and the upper stage
blew up and the whole rocket went kaboom

642
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:05,459
blew up and the whole rocket went kaboom
 

643
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,210
blew up and the whole rocket went kaboom
uh in an uncontrolled manner

644
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,220
uh in an uncontrolled manner
 

645
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,490
uh in an uncontrolled manner
and so uh so then they came back with

646
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,500
and so uh so then they came back with
 

647
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,290
and so uh so then they came back with
vengeance when they came back the first

648
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:12,300
vengeance when they came back the first
 

649
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,670
vengeance when they came back the first
mission back is the first time that they

650
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
mission back is the first time that they
 

651
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,230
mission back is the first time that they
landed a rocket which was awesome so

652
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,240
landed a rocket which was awesome so
 

653
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,610
landed a rocket which was awesome so
they returned to flight after the

654
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:16,620
they returned to flight after the
 

655
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,790
they returned to flight after the
anomaly was was uh yeah was was Landing

656
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:19,800
anomaly was was uh yeah was was Landing
 

657
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,310
anomaly was was uh yeah was was Landing
a rocket and stuck The Landing yep well

658
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
a rocket and stuck The Landing yep well
 

659
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,810
a rocket and stuck The Landing yep well
actually the first time so the first

660
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:23,820
actually the first time so the first
 

661
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,370
actually the first time so the first
time you were there what was that like

662
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,380
time you were there what was that like
 

663
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,350
time you were there what was that like
what do you remember from the from that

day just I was surprised at how much
 

667
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,790
day just I was surprised at how much
bigger the rocket was than I imagined I

668
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:31,800
bigger the rocket was than I imagined I
 

669
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,050
bigger the rocket was than I imagined I
was I originally when I was going down

670
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,060
was I originally when I was going down
 

671
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,130
was I originally when I was going down
to Kennedy Space Center I was

672
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,140
to Kennedy Space Center I was
 

673
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,350
to Kennedy Space Center I was
disappointed that I wasn't seeing like a

674
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,360
disappointed that I wasn't seeing like a
 

675
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,389
disappointed that I wasn't seeing like a
you know I didn't know a ton about

you know I didn't know a ton about
 

677
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,370
you know I didn't know a ton about
Rockets I knew enough to like know what

678
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,380
Rockets I knew enough to like know what
 

679
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,050
Rockets I knew enough to like know what
a space shuttle was what like the Saturn

680
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,060
a space shuttle was what like the Saturn
 

681
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,210
a space shuttle was what like the Saturn
V was you know but that was probably

682
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,220
V was you know but that was probably
 

683
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,769
V was you know but that was probably
about the end of my knowledge I just

684
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:45,779
about the end of my knowledge I just
 

685
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,569
about the end of my knowledge I just
remember being disappointed that I

686
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:47,579
remember being disappointed that I
 

687
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,610
remember being disappointed that I
wasn't seeing a big quote-unquote NASA

688
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:49,620

my head like oh I'm gonna see this
 

693
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,470
my head like oh I'm gonna see this
launch it's probably gonna be like you

694
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
launch it's probably gonna be like you
 

695
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,030
launch it's probably gonna be like you
know three stories tall or something you

696
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
know three stories tall or something you
 

697
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,650

some little firecracker and yay you know
 

703
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,690
some little firecracker and yay you know
and I think I'd almost impitched that

704
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:02,700
and I think I'd almost impitched that
 

705
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,670
and I think I'd almost impitched that
too I think the the people that I was

too I think the the people that I was
 

707
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,750
too I think the the people that I was
working for at the time I think they

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
working for at the time I think they
 

709
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,889
working for at the time I think they
kind of were downplaying it it's like

710
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:06,899
kind of were downplaying it it's like
 

711
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,449
kind of were downplaying it it's like
well it's not a big Rockets here it's

712
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:08,459
well it's not a big Rockets here it's
 

713
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,610
well it's not a big Rockets here it's
not gonna be that exciting you know but

not gonna be that exciting you know but
 

715
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,930
not gonna be that exciting you know but

this thing's huge this is not a small

718
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
this thing's huge this is not a small
 

719
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,790
this thing's huge this is not a small
rocket like this is It's you know it's

720
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
rocket like this is It's you know it's
 

721
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,870
rocket like this is It's you know it's
70 meters tall 220 feet tall it's huge

722
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
70 meters tall 220 feet tall it's huge
 

723
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,850
70 meters tall 220 feet tall it's huge
um and I think people forget like the

724
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:22,860
um and I think people forget like the
 

725
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,590
um and I think people forget like the
scale of that you know it might look

726
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
scale of that you know it might look
 

727
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,569
scale of that you know it might look
skinny and tall and all this stuff but

728
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:26,579
skinny and tall and all this stuff but
 

729
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,910
skinny and tall and all this stuff but
it's still a very very large piece of

730
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:28,920
it's still a very very large piece of
 

731
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,590
it's still a very very large piece of
Machinery it's physically about as as

732
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
Machinery it's physically about as as
 

733
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,569
Machinery it's physically about as as
large as you can ship the boosters about

734
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:32,579
large as you can ship the boosters about
 

735
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,769
large as you can ship the boosters about
as big as you can ship across the

736
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:33,779
as big as you can ship across the
 

737
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,750
as big as you can ship across the
country period without like completely

738
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
country period without like completely

Privileges and bridges and everything

746
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:42,779
Privileges and bridges and everything
 

747
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,230
Privileges and bridges and everything
it's you know 12 feet wide 3.7 meters

748
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,240
it's you know 12 feet wide 3.7 meters
 

749
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,930
it's you know 12 feet wide 3.7 meters
wide and it's 45 meters long so it's

750
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:47,940
wide and it's 45 meters long so it's
 

751
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,170
wide and it's 45 meters long so it's
like exactly what you can fit uh with a

752
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,180
like exactly what you can fit uh with a
 

753
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,670
like exactly what you can fit uh with a
pretty standard you know like before you

754
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:52,680
pretty standard you know like before you
 

755
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,110
pretty standard you know like before you
start getting into crazy amounts of

756
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,120
start getting into crazy amounts of
 

757
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,509
start getting into crazy amounts of
problems shipping the rocket and it's

758
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:56,519
problems shipping the rocket and it's
 

759
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,250
problems shipping the rocket and it's
huge it's huge and people just don't

760
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,260
huge it's huge and people just don't
 

761
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,990
huge it's huge and people just don't
understand that and so when I saw it

762
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
understand that and so when I saw it
 

763
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,129
understand that and so when I saw it
with my own eyes I remember just being

764
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:01,139
with my own eyes I remember just being
 

765
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,110
with my own eyes I remember just being
like this is so much cooler than I

766
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
like this is so much cooler than I
 

767
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,030
like this is so much cooler than I
thought it was hard to believe that that

768
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
thought it was hard to believe that that
 

769
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,949
thought it was hard to believe that that
thing is gonna have to lift off the

770
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
thing is gonna have to lift off the
 

771
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,110
thing is gonna have to lift off the
ground and launch up into the air maybe

772
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
ground and launch up into the air maybe
 

773
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,850
ground and launch up into the air maybe
that's the most humbling aspect of it

774
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860
that's the most humbling aspect of it
 

775
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,310
that's the most humbling aspect of it
that's something that size humans have

776
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,320
that's something that size humans have
 

777
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,930
that's something that size humans have
come up with a way to take something

778
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:14,940
come up with a way to take something
 

779
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,030
come up with a way to take something
that size and launching launch it up

780
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
that size and launching launch it up
 

781
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,550
that size and launching launch it up
into the air yeah there's certainly a

782
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
into the air yeah there's certainly a
 

783
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,110
into the air yeah there's certainly a
very humbling aspect when you watch it

784
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
very humbling aspect when you watch it
 

785
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,449
very humbling aspect when you watch it

getting to see that one fly oh I went

794
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
getting to see that one fly oh I went
 

795
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,850
getting to see that one fly oh I went
home my camera saw it I left my camera

796
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:31,860
home my camera saw it I left my camera
 

797
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,970
home my camera saw it I left my camera
out there like a remote triggered camera

798
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:33,980
out there like a remote triggered camera
 

799
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,470
out there like a remote triggered camera
uh my first image is as a launch

800
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
uh my first image is as a launch
 

801
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,569
uh my first image is as a launch
photographer at the time was it was crs3

802
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:38,579
photographer at the time was it was crs3
 

803
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,430
photographer at the time was it was crs3
but I went home it scrubbed too many

804
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,440
but I went home it scrubbed too many
 

805
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,750
but I went home it scrubbed too many
times this is back in the day they were

806
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
times this is back in the day they were
 

807
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,970
times this is back in the day they were
scrubbing like often and there'd be like

808
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:43,980
scrubbing like often and there'd be like
 

809
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,769
scrubbing like often and there'd be like
a three day five day seven day you just

810
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:45,779
a three day five day seven day you just
 

811
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,230
a three day five day seven day you just
never knew so I go home and I watch the

812
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
never knew so I go home and I watch the
 

813
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,610
never knew so I go home and I watch the
live stream of it so I didn't even get

814
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:49,620
live stream of it so I didn't even get
 

815
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,190
live stream of it so I didn't even get
an experience my first launch and any

816
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,200
an experience my first launch and any
 

817
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,050
an experience my first launch and any
anyone that's ever tried to you know go

818
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,060
anyone that's ever tried to you know go
 

819
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,850
anyone that's ever tried to you know go
to a launch is can probably empathize

820
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:55,860
to a launch is can probably empathize
 

821
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,190
to a launch is can probably empathize
because yeah scrubs are very common in

822
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,200
because yeah scrubs are very common in
 

823
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,769
because yeah scrubs are very common in
the space flight world so that one I

824
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:00,779
the space flight world so that one I
 

825
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,990
the space flight world so that one I
didn't get to see but since then

826
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,000
didn't get to see but since then
 

827
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,509
didn't get to see but since then
obviously I've been able to attend very

828
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
obviously I've been able to attend very
 

829
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,949
obviously I've been able to attend very
many launches uh how much do you

830
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
many launches uh how much do you
 

831
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,509
many launches uh how much do you
understand the control involved in the

832
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:08,519
understand the control involved in the
 

833
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,310
understand the control involved in the
landing how difficult is that problem I

834
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
landing how difficult is that problem I
 

835
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,509
landing how difficult is that problem I
couldn't tell you a single thing about

836
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
couldn't tell you a single thing about
 

837
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,129
couldn't tell you a single thing about
like the code and like the avionics

838
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:13,139
like the code and like the avionics
 

839
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,329
like the code and like the avionics
behind it but I can tell you all the

840
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:14,339
behind it but I can tell you all the
 

841
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,490
behind it but I can tell you all the
hardware that makes it happen if that

842
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,500
hardware that makes it happen if that
 

843
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,190
hardware that makes it happen if that
helps well that yeah I mean to me it

844
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,200
helps well that yeah I mean to me it
 

845
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,389
helps well that yeah I mean to me it
seems like whenever I talk to people

846
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
seems like whenever I talk to people
 

847
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,250
seems like whenever I talk to people
they say it's not

848
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,260
they say it's not
 

849
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,350
they say it's not
that big of a deal in terms of the the

850
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,360
that big of a deal in terms of the the
 

851
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,730
that big of a deal in terms of the the
level of intelligence and the control

852
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:25,740
level of intelligence and the control
 

853
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,170
level of intelligence and the control
but to me it's just like when you

854
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,180
but to me it's just like when you
 

855
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,430
but to me it's just like when you
observe it

856
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:28,440
observe it
 

857
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,069
observe it
it seems incredible because of all the

858
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:31,079
it seems incredible because of all the
 

859
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,650
it seems incredible because of all the
variables evolved all the uncertainties

860
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:33,660
variables evolved all the uncertainties
 

861
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,350
variables evolved all the uncertainties
involved all the

862
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
involved all the
 

863
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,750
involved all the
um because there's aerodynamics I mean

864
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:38,760
um because there's aerodynamics I mean
 

865
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,490
um because there's aerodynamics I mean
like there's at different temperatures

866
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,500
like there's at different temperatures
 

867
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,230
like there's at different temperatures
there's so so much going on with the

868
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
there's so so much going on with the
 

869
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,569
there's so so much going on with the
fuel the burning of the the combustion

870
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:44,579
fuel the burning of the the combustion
 

871
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,610
fuel the burning of the the combustion
just everything that's going on to be

872
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:46,620
just everything that's going on to be
 

873
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,710
just everything that's going on to be
able to do perform control at such high

874
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
able to do perform control at such high
 

875
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,730
able to do perform control at such high
stakes effectively like you know that

876
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:52,740
stakes effectively like you know that
 

877
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,930
stakes effectively like you know that
code is probably not written in

878
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:53,940
code is probably not written in
 

879
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,370
code is probably not written in
JavaScript I guess is what I'm saying

880
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:55,380
JavaScript I guess is what I'm saying
 

881
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,550
JavaScript I guess is what I'm saying
actually no I don't it if I remember I

882
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
actually no I don't it if I remember I
 

883
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,769
actually no I don't it if I remember I
again this is well outside of my domain

884
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:00,779
again this is well outside of my domain
 

885
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,389
again this is well outside of my domain
um but

886
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
um but
 

887
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,910
um but
um they've coded in a Common Language

888
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:04,920
um they've coded in a Common Language
 

889
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,949
um they've coded in a Common Language
it's it's uh that's probably it's

890
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
it's it's uh that's probably it's
 

891
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,810
it's it's uh that's probably it's
probably going to be c yeah I'm pretty

892
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:08,820
probably going to be c yeah I'm pretty
 

893
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,949
probably going to be c yeah I'm pretty
sure it is and that was one of the

894
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:09,959
sure it is and that was one of the
 

895
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,689
sure it is and that was one of the
things that was weird is that Elon when

896
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:11,699
things that was weird is that Elon when
 

897
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,129
things that was weird is that Elon when
he you know started SpaceX was like

898
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:13,139
he you know started SpaceX was like
 

899
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,030
he you know started SpaceX was like
we're just going to code in the most

900
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,040
we're just going to code in the most
 

901
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,129
we're just going to code in the most
common language so that we don't have to

902
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:16,139
common language so that we don't have to
 

903
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,290
common language so that we don't have to
like have people learn this archaic you

904
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:18,300
like have people learn this archaic you
 

905
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,269
like have people learn this archaic you
know weird thing we can just literally

906
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:20,279
know weird thing we can just literally
 

907
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,829
know weird thing we can just literally
pull people off the streets and be like

908
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
pull people off the streets and be like
 

909
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,509
pull people off the streets and be like
here write it you know and that's

910
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
here write it you know and that's
 

911
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,310
here write it you know and that's
probably C plus plus I mean it'd be epic

912
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,320
probably C plus plus I mean it'd be epic
 

913
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,230
probably C plus plus I mean it'd be epic
if it was like python or something but I

914
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,240
if it was like python or something but I
 

915
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,449
if it was like python or something but I
don't I I think like reliable systems

916
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:29,459
don't I I think like reliable systems
 

917
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,949
don't I I think like reliable systems
have to be written in CC plus plus

918
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
have to be written in CC plus plus
 

919
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,689
have to be written in CC plus plus
probably which is a common language

920
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:32,699
probably which is a common language
 

921
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,150
probably which is a common language
which is something uh I imagine like

922
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,160
which is something uh I imagine like
 

923
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,650
which is something uh I imagine like
NASA Engineers would probably have to

924
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:36,660
NASA Engineers would probably have to
 

925
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,930
NASA Engineers would probably have to
use some kind of proprietary language in

926
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:38,940
use some kind of proprietary language in
 

927
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,629
use some kind of proprietary language in
the in the olden days for for security

928
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,639
the in the olden days for for security
 

929
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,550
the in the olden days for for security
for privacy all that kind of stuff oh

930
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:43,560
for privacy all that kind of stuff oh
 

931
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,949
for privacy all that kind of stuff oh
and the old old days like yeah those are

932
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
and the old old days like yeah those are
 

933
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,050
and the old old days like yeah those are
inventing Yeah the code and language

934
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,060
inventing Yeah the code and language
 

935
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,310
inventing Yeah the code and language
from scratch

936
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,320
from scratch
 

937
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,949
from scratch
uh for sure it was still it's just still

938
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:51,959
uh for sure it was still it's just still
 

939
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,449
uh for sure it was still it's just still
incredible that it's able to do that

940
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:53,459
incredible that it's able to do that
 

941
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,189
incredible that it's able to do that
like just the feat of engineering

942
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
like just the feat of engineering
 

943
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,769
like just the feat of engineering
involved is just it's truly

944
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:57,779
involved is just it's truly
 

945
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,470
involved is just it's truly
it's like one of the Marvels to observe

946
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
it's like one of the Marvels to observe
 

947
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,870
it's like one of the Marvels to observe
about these Rockets coming back to Earth

948
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
about these Rockets coming back to Earth
 

949
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,449
about these Rockets coming back to Earth
uh that they're able to land like the

950
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:05,459
uh that they're able to land like the
 

951
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,550
uh that they're able to land like the
drama of it is just incredible to see

952
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:07,560
drama of it is just incredible to see
 

953
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,710
drama of it is just incredible to see
yeah well the one of the fun things to

954
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
yeah well the one of the fun things to
 

955
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,629
yeah well the one of the fun things to
remember too with specifically with the

956
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:11,639
remember too with specifically with the
 

957
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,670
remember too with specifically with the
Falcon 9 and the Falcon 9 or Falcon

958
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
Falcon 9 and the Falcon 9 or Falcon
 

959
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,990
Falcon 9 and the Falcon 9 or Falcon
heavy boosters I mean it's the same

960
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,000
heavy boosters I mean it's the same
 

961
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,370
heavy boosters I mean it's the same
thing basically

962
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,380
thing basically
 

963
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,470
thing basically
um they shut down all but one of the

964
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
um they shut down all but one of the
 

965
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,509
um they shut down all but one of the
nine engines and even with that one

966
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:20,519
nine engines and even with that one
 

967
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,310
nine engines and even with that one
engine at its minimum throttle setting

968
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
engine at its minimum throttle setting
 

969
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,069
engine at its minimum throttle setting
it's still too much thrust to hover

970
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:25,079
it's still too much thrust to hover
 

971
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,170
it's still too much thrust to hover
so as this Rocket's coming down

972
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,180
so as this Rocket's coming down
 

973
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,569
so as this Rocket's coming down
if they start a little bit too early if

974
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:29,579
if they start a little bit too early if
 

975
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,550
if they start a little bit too early if
they light that engine too early it will

976
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:31,560
they light that engine too early it will
 

977
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,650
they light that engine too early it will
actually stop above the ground and will

978
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:33,660
actually stop above the ground and will
 

979
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,290
actually stop above the ground and will
not be able to lower itself it will

980
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,300
not be able to lower itself it will
 

981
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,329
not be able to lower itself it will
literally stop like say and stay say

982
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:38,339
literally stop like say and stay say
 

983
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,430
literally stop like say and stay say
stop 200 feet above the ground

984
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,440
stop 200 feet above the ground
 

985
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,810
stop 200 feet above the ground
their only option is to kill the engine

986
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:41,820
their only option is to kill the engine
 

987
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,009
their only option is to kill the engine
and then it's just going to fall those

988
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
and then it's just going to fall those
 

989
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,829
and then it's just going to fall those
200 feet so they it's what we call like

990
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
200 feet so they it's what we call like
 

991
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,749
200 feet so they it's what we call like
a suicide burner a hover slam kind of

992
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
a suicide burner a hover slam kind of
 

993
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,790
a suicide burner a hover slam kind of
interchangeable terms because your

994
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:49,800
interchangeable terms because your
 

995
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,410
interchangeable terms because your
thrust to weight ratio is never below

996
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,420
thrust to weight ratio is never below
 

997
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,509
thrust to weight ratio is never below
one so they have to actually literally

998
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
one so they have to actually literally
 

999
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,189
one so they have to actually literally
be riding the throttle so what you do is

1000
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
be riding the throttle so what you do is
 

1001
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,990
be riding the throttle so what you do is
you kind of start ideally you know you

1002
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,000
you kind of start ideally you know you
 

1003
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,850
you kind of start ideally you know you
kind of start like in the middle of your

1004
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:58,860
kind of start like in the middle of your
 

1005
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,949
kind of start like in the middle of your
window of of throttle range so let's

1006
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
window of of throttle range so let's
 

1007
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,749
window of of throttle range so let's
pretend your engine can throttle down to

1008
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:02,759
pretend your engine can throttle down to
 

1009
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,809
pretend your engine can throttle down to
40 of its maximum rated thrust you might

1010
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:05,819
40 of its maximum rated thrust you might
 

1011
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,970
40 of its maximum rated thrust you might
start at like 70 percent of thrust in

1012
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:07,980
start at like 70 percent of thrust in
 

1013
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,890
start at like 70 percent of thrust in
the middle of that like window of where

1014
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:09,900
the middle of that like window of where
 

1015
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,390
the middle of that like window of where
it could burn so that so if all of a

1016
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,400
it could burn so that so if all of a
 

1017
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,409
it could burn so that so if all of a
sudden it's kind of coming in too hot

1018
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:12,419
sudden it's kind of coming in too hot
 

1019
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,210
sudden it's kind of coming in too hot
you have room to throttle up if you're

1020
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:14,220
you have room to throttle up if you're
 

1021
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,069
you have room to throttle up if you're
coming into you're actually you know a

1022
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
coming into you're actually you know a
 

1023
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,270
coming into you're actually you know a
little too early you throttle it down

1024
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
little too early you throttle it down
 

1025
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,289
little too early you throttle it down
you have a little bit of wiggle room

1026
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:18,299
you have a little bit of wiggle room
 

1027
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,929
you have a little bit of wiggle room
it's just amazing how smoothly and how

1028
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:20,939
it's just amazing how smoothly and how
 

1029
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,309
it's just amazing how smoothly and how
perfectly they're able to still control

1030
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
perfectly they're able to still control
 

1031
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,289
perfectly they're able to still control
that thing even though they're down to

1032
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,299
that thing even though they're down to
 

1033
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,449
that thing even though they're down to
one engine out of the nine and they're

1034
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,459
one engine out of the nine and they're
 

1035
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,890
one engine out of the nine and they're
still riding like the finest margin of

1036
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:27,900
still riding like the finest margin of
 

1037
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,850
still riding like the finest margin of
what's possible and they're they're

1038
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:28,860
what's possible and they're they're
 

1039
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,230
what's possible and they're they're
continually playing with that to try to

1040
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
continually playing with that to try to
 

1041
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,450
continually playing with that to try to
get it because every every bit of fuel

1042
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:32,460
get it because every every bit of fuel
 

1043
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,590
get it because every every bit of fuel
they're using and proponent they're

1044
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
they're using and proponent they're
 

1045
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,169
they're using and proponent they're
using to land is proponent they weren't

1046
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:36,179
using to land is proponent they weren't
 

1047
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,270
using to land is proponent they weren't
using to put something into space yeah

1048
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,280
using to put something into space yeah
 

1049
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,070
using to put something into space yeah
so they want that to be as efficient as

1050
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
so they want that to be as efficient as
 

1051
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,049
so they want that to be as efficient as
possible they're really like watching

1052
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:42,059
possible they're really like watching
 

1053
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,510
possible they're really like watching
them hone that in and and just continue

1054
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,520
them hone that in and and just continue
 

1055
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,789
them hone that in and and just continue
to evolve it and edit that and just get

1056
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
to evolve it and edit that and just get
 

1057
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,529
to evolve it and edit that and just get
it to be the Workhorse we're coming up

1058
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:48,539
it to be the Workhorse we're coming up
 

1059
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,590
it to be the Workhorse we're coming up
on a hundred consecutive Landings

1060
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,600
on a hundred consecutive Landings
 

1061
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,029
on a hundred consecutive Landings
perfect Landings 100 I think they've

1062
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
perfect Landings 100 I think they've
 

1063
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,770
perfect Landings 100 I think they've
done like 150 something Landings

1064
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:54,780
done like 150 something Landings
 

1065
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,990
done like 150 something Landings
altogether 160 altogether but we're

1066
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,000
altogether 160 altogether but we're
 

1067
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,510
altogether 160 altogether but we're
talking like in a row without blowing up

1068
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
talking like in a row without blowing up
 

1069
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,430
talking like in a row without blowing up
which you know five years ago was

1070
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
which you know five years ago was
 

1071
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,590
which you know five years ago was
completely experimental and insane and

1072
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
completely experimental and insane and
 

1073
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,669
completely experimental and insane and
now we're coming up to the point where

1074
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:04,679
now we're coming up to the point where
 

1075
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,590
now we're coming up to the point where
we're 100 in a row it's like this is

1076
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,600
we're 100 in a row it's like this is
 

1077
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,230
we're 100 in a row it's like this is
becoming more reliable in the landing

1078
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,240
becoming more reliable in the landing
 

1079
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,210
becoming more reliable in the landing
which is not the primary Mission this is

1080
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,220
which is not the primary Mission this is
 

1081
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,370
which is not the primary Mission this is
purely for spacex's like gain is to

1082
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:13,380
purely for spacex's like gain is to
 

1083
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,289
purely for spacex's like gain is to
recover the booster it has nothing to do

1084
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:15,299
recover the booster it has nothing to do
 

1085
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,610
recover the booster it has nothing to do
with the effect of getting the payload

1086
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,620
with the effect of getting the payload
 

1087
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,190
with the effect of getting the payload
on orbit you know most of the time and

1088
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
on orbit you know most of the time and
 

1089
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,590
on orbit you know most of the time and
the landing is really only for their

1090
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
the landing is really only for their
 

1091
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,750
the landing is really only for their
their benefit and their gain long-term

1092
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
their benefit and their gain long-term
 

1093
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,390
their benefit and their gain long-term
gain like it's a long-term investment in

1094
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
gain like it's a long-term investment in
 

1095
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,190
gain like it's a long-term investment in
in being able to recover the the

1096
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,200
in being able to recover the the
 

1097
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,470
in being able to recover the the
boosters 100 can you believe all this

1098
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
boosters 100 can you believe all this
 

1099
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,630
boosters 100 can you believe all this
was done in basically 10 years so that

1100
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
was done in basically 10 years so that
 

1101
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,789
was done in basically 10 years so that
we've seen this development over a

1102
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
we've seen this development over a
 

1103
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,650
we've seen this development over a
period of 10 years oh man so like where

1104
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:36,660
period of 10 years oh man so like where
 

1105
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,789
period of 10 years oh man so like where
we started uh commercial space flight

1106
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
we started uh commercial space flight
 

1107
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,570
we started uh commercial space flight
at scale to today where it's almost uh

1108
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:44,580
at scale to today where it's almost uh
 

1109
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,930
at scale to today where it's almost uh
almost starting to be mundane yeah how

1110
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:47,940
almost starting to be mundane yeah how
 

1111
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,169
almost starting to be mundane yeah how
can I be able to do yeah uh I I can't

1112
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:51,179
can I be able to do yeah uh I I can't
 

1113
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,490
can I be able to do yeah uh I I can't
really believe it I mean obviously even

1114
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:52,500
really believe it I mean obviously even
 

1115
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,190
really believe it I mean obviously even
just in the I I think I'm a fairly fair

1116
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
just in the I I think I'm a fairly fair
 

1117
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,750
just in the I I think I'm a fairly fair
weather fan really didn't start paying

1118
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:56,760
weather fan really didn't start paying
 

1119
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,909
weather fan really didn't start paying
attention to like 2014. yeah and just

1120
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
attention to like 2014. yeah and just
 

1121
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,950
attention to like 2014. yeah and just
seeing what it was like back then to

1122
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
seeing what it was like back then to
 

1123
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,690
seeing what it was like back then to
what it's like like I don't watch every

1124
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:02,700
what it's like like I don't watch every
 

1125
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,430
what it's like like I don't watch every
launch at all anymore like I'll catch

1126
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:04,440
launch at all anymore like I'll catch
 

1127
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,470
launch at all anymore like I'll catch
the big ones yeah I'll stream some of

1128
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
the big ones yeah I'll stream some of
 

1129
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,029
the big ones yeah I'll stream some of
the really big ones but like back in the

1130
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:08,039
the really big ones but like back in the
 

1131
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,710
the really big ones but like back in the
day I like I said would wake up in the

1132
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:09,720
day I like I said would wake up in the
 

1133
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,730
day I like I said would wake up in the
middle of the night to catch these

1134
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:10,740
middle of the night to catch these
 

1135
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,289
middle of the night to catch these
streams or you know catch these launches

1136
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:12,299
streams or you know catch these launches
 

1137
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,970
streams or you know catch these launches
and watch them because they were such a

1138
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,980
and watch them because they were such a
 

1139
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,250
and watch them because they were such a
big deal and there's maybe only five of

1140
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,260
big deal and there's maybe only five of
 

1141
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,810
big deal and there's maybe only five of
them a year you know and so it's a

1142
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:17,820
them a year you know and so it's a
 

1143
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,310
them a year you know and so it's a
really big deal nowadays it's like oh

1144
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,320
really big deal nowadays it's like oh
 

1145
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,350
really big deal nowadays it's like oh
yeah there's literally like two a week

1146
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
yeah there's literally like two a week
 

1147
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,870
yeah there's literally like two a week
on average now it's insane from SpaceX

1148
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:23,880
on average now it's insane from SpaceX
 

1149
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,830
on average now it's insane from SpaceX
alone

1150
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:24,840
alone
 

1151
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,630
alone
let alone you know United launch

1152
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
let alone you know United launch
 

1153
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,549
let alone you know United launch
Alliance rocket lab any of the Chinese

1154
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
Alliance rocket lab any of the Chinese
 

1155
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,529
Alliance rocket lab any of the Chinese
missions you know I mean all of there's

1156
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:30,539
missions you know I mean all of there's
 

1157
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,450
missions you know I mean all of there's
countless it's insane it's hard to

1158
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:32,460
countless it's insane it's hard to
 

1159
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,250
countless it's insane it's hard to
really really really hard to keep up

1160
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,260
really really really hard to keep up
 

1161
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,230
really really really hard to keep up
with I wonder at which point in the

1162
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
with I wonder at which point in the
 

1163
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,830
with I wonder at which point in the
future the number of uh launches to

1164
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
future the number of uh launches to
 

1165
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,409
future the number of uh launches to
orbit will exceed the number of launches

1166
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:42,419
orbit will exceed the number of launches
 

1167
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,970
orbit will exceed the number of launches
of airplanes

1168
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:43,980
of airplanes
 

1169
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,650
of airplanes
like on the surface of Earth yeah I have

1170
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:45,660
like on the surface of Earth yeah I have
 

1171
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,870
like on the surface of Earth yeah I have
to admit I kind of have a hard time

1172
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:47,880
to admit I kind of have a hard time
 

1173
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,270
to admit I kind of have a hard time
extrapolating out that far you know

1174
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,280
extrapolating out that far you know
 

1175
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,049
extrapolating out that far you know
there's a lot of people that are like

1176
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,059
there's a lot of people that are like
 

1177
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,549
there's a lot of people that are like
big futurists and really do think about

1178
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
big futurists and really do think about
 

1179
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,930
big futurists and really do think about
like interplanetary stuff and think

1180
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:53,940
like interplanetary stuff and think
 

1181
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,090
like interplanetary stuff and think
about colonizing Mars and stuff I have a

1182
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,100
about colonizing Mars and stuff I have a
 

1183
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,710
about colonizing Mars and stuff I have a
hard time predicting like when

1184
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:57,720
hard time predicting like when
 

1185
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,630
hard time predicting like when
starship's Gonna Fly the orbital launch

1186
00:19:59,630 --> 00:19:59,640
starship's Gonna Fly the orbital launch
 

1187
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,730
starship's Gonna Fly the orbital launch
you know and that's like imminentish

1188
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:01,740
you know and that's like imminentish
 

1189
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,010
you know and that's like imminentish
like month or two scale time frame and

1190
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
like month or two scale time frame and
 

1191
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,930
like month or two scale time frame and
yet I'm still like I can't tell you when

1192
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:05,940
yet I'm still like I can't tell you when
 

1193
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,250
yet I'm still like I can't tell you when
that's gonna I can't tell you anything

1194
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,260
that's gonna I can't tell you anything
 

1195
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,409
that's gonna I can't tell you anything
about like when we're gonna land on Mars

1196
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:09,419
about like when we're gonna land on Mars
 

1197
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,330
about like when we're gonna land on Mars
or what that's what that economy and

1198
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,340
or what that's what that economy and
 

1199
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,770
or what that's what that economy and
what that you know the scale of launch

1200
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:12,780
what that you know the scale of launch
 

1201
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,150
what that you know the scale of launch
operations is going to look like in

1202
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
operations is going to look like in
 

1203
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,590
operations is going to look like in
order to do that because it's just so

1204
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
order to do that because it's just so
 

1205
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,450
order to do that because it's just so
hard to I wouldn't have predicted where

1206
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,460
hard to I wouldn't have predicted where
 

1207
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,250
hard to I wouldn't have predicted where
we're at today five years ago you know

1208
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,260
we're at today five years ago you know
 

1209
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,710
we're at today five years ago you know
it's it's insane it's so hard to predict

1210
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:21,720
it's it's insane it's so hard to predict
 

1211
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,789
it's it's insane it's so hard to predict
and

1212
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
and
 

1213
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,590
and
yeah but it's it's funny because there's

1214
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:24,600
yeah but it's it's funny because there's
 

1215
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,270
yeah but it's it's funny because there's
so many like new companies starting up

1216
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,280
so many like new companies starting up
 

1217
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,950
so many like new companies starting up
trying to predict that and it's a really

1218
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:27,960
trying to predict that and it's a really
 

1219
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,409
trying to predict that and it's a really
exciting you know startup culture right

1220
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:30,419
exciting you know startup culture right
 

1221
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,510
exciting you know startup culture right
I think uh when you make certain

1222
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,520
I think uh when you make certain
 

1223
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,190
I think uh when you make certain
engineering decisions

1224
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,200
engineering decisions
 

1225
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,230
engineering decisions
and hiring decisions and like what you

1226
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
and hiring decisions and like what you
 

1227
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,330
and hiring decisions and like what you
focus on in terms of both business and

1228
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,340
focus on in terms of both business and
 

1229
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,029
focus on in terms of both business and
Engineering it's good to think on the

1230
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
Engineering it's good to think on the
 

1231
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,130
Engineering it's good to think on the
scale of 10 20 50 100 years that's one

1232
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,140
scale of 10 20 50 100 years that's one
 

1233
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,090
scale of 10 20 50 100 years that's one
of the things that Elon has

1234
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,100
of the things that Elon has
 

1235
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,570
of the things that Elon has
exceptionally good at which is asking uh

1236
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:47,580
exceptionally good at which is asking uh
 

1237
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,010
exceptionally good at which is asking uh
the question okay this might seem

1238
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,020
the question okay this might seem
 

1239
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,470
the question okay this might seem
impossible right now but what's the

1240
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,480
impossible right now but what's the
 

1241
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,230
impossible right now but what's the
obvious way to do this if we look out 20

1242
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
obvious way to do this if we look out 20
 

1243
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,529
obvious way to do this if we look out 20
years and then you start to make

1244
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:57,539
years and then you start to make
 

1245
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,090
years and then you start to make
decisions you start to make decisions

1246
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,100
decisions you start to make decisions
 

1247
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,770
decisions you start to make decisions
about robotics about bringing computer

1248
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:00,780
about robotics about bringing computer
 

1249
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,070
about robotics about bringing computer
interfaces about space travel there they

1250
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
interfaces about space travel there they
 

1251
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,169
interfaces about space travel there they
make a lot of sense when you look at the

1252
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:06,179
make a lot of sense when you look at the
 

1253
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,930
make a lot of sense when you look at the
scale of 10 20 50 100 years and don't

1254
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:08,940
scale of 10 20 50 100 years and don't
 

1255
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,909
scale of 10 20 50 100 years and don't
make any sense if you if you look at the

1256
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:10,919
make any sense if you if you look at the
 

1257
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,730
make any sense if you if you look at the
scale of of just months so but of course

1258
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:13,740
scale of of just months so but of course
 

1259
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,730
scale of of just months so but of course
the actual work of day to day is focused

1260
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:16,740
the actual work of day to day is focused
 

1261
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,529
the actual work of day to day is focused
on the next few months because there's

1262
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:18,539
on the next few months because there's
 

1263
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,090
on the next few months because there's
deadlines there's missions they have to

1264
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,100
deadlines there's missions they have to
 

1265
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,250
deadlines there's missions they have to
accomplish anyway we uh returning back

1266
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,260
accomplish anyway we uh returning back
 

1267
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,250
accomplish anyway we uh returning back
to the brief history

1268
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,260
to the brief history
 

1269
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,810
to the brief history
Rockets

1270
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:25,820
Rockets
 

1271
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,430
Rockets
the Falcon heavy so what what else is

1272
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,440
the Falcon heavy so what what else is
 

1273
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,230
the Falcon heavy so what what else is
there so we talked about Falcon 9 and

1274
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
there so we talked about Falcon 9 and
 

1275
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,390
there so we talked about Falcon 9 and
the rapid development there yeah what

1276
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
the rapid development there yeah what
 

1277
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,610
the rapid development there yeah what
other flavors of of Falcon is there and

1278
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:34,620
other flavors of of Falcon is there and
 

1279
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,409
other flavors of of Falcon is there and
how does that take us to Starship yeah

1280
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:36,419
how does that take us to Starship yeah
 

1281
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,630
how does that take us to Starship yeah
realistically the Falcon 9 evolved more

1282
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
realistically the Falcon 9 evolved more
 

1283
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,850
realistically the Falcon 9 evolved more
or less kind of like just got more

1284
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:40,860
or less kind of like just got more
 

1285
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,350
or less kind of like just got more
powerful in a little bit longer and more

1286
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,360
powerful in a little bit longer and more
 

1287
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,430
powerful in a little bit longer and more
capable

1288
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
capable
 

1289
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,470
capable
but nowadays they fly What's called the

1290
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:45,480
but nowadays they fly What's called the
 

1291
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,909
but nowadays they fly What's called the
block five even though it's like the

1292
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:46,919
block five even though it's like the
 

1293
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,190
block five even though it's like the
eighth or ninth iteration of the of the

1294
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
eighth or ninth iteration of the of the
 

1295
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,390
eighth or ninth iteration of the of the
Falcon now but they call it block five

1296
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
Falcon now but they call it block five
 

1297
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,070
Falcon now but they call it block five
it's the one that has the black Landing

1298
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
it's the one that has the black Landing
 

1299
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,990
it's the one that has the black Landing
legs the black inner stage they have a

1300
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
legs the black inner stage they have a
 

1301
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,549
legs the black inner stage they have a
fleet of roughly 10 or so that are doing

1302
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:55,559
fleet of roughly 10 or so that are doing
 

1303
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,110
fleet of roughly 10 or so that are doing
the majority of the legwork these days

1304
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
the majority of the legwork these days
 

1305
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,570
the majority of the legwork these days
and they're flying you know up to 15

1306
00:21:59,570 --> 00:21:59,580
and they're flying you know up to 15
 

1307
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,730
and they're flying you know up to 15
times I think right now is the current

1308
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:01,740
times I think right now is the current
 

1309
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,010
times I think right now is the current
booster leader they're also recovering

1310
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,020
booster leader they're also recovering
 

1311
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,810
booster leader they're also recovering
the fairing so the nose cone of the

1312
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:05,820
the fairing so the nose cone of the
 

1313
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,990
the fairing so the nose cone of the
Rockets are frequently if not every time

1314
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
Rockets are frequently if not every time
 

1315
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,730
Rockets are frequently if not every time
being recovered

1316
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:10,740
being recovered
 

1317
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,470
being recovered
um same with the same with the booster

1318
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
um same with the same with the booster
 

1319
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,210
um same with the same with the booster
for the most part and the only thing

1320
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
for the most part and the only thing
 

1321
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,590
for the most part and the only thing
being expended is the upper stage and

1322
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
being expended is the upper stage and
 

1323
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,810
being expended is the upper stage and
that's kind of where the Falcon 9 is

1324
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:17,820
that's kind of where the Falcon 9 is
 

1325
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,870
that's kind of where the Falcon 9 is
ending it's really doesn't make sense to

1326
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
ending it's really doesn't make sense to
 

1327
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,730
ending it's really doesn't make sense to
develop that infrastructure any longer

1328
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:22,740
develop that infrastructure any longer
 

1329
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,010
develop that infrastructure any longer
so they went with the next step which is

1330
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,020
so they went with the next step which is
 

1331
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,669
so they went with the next step which is
go even bigger physically so they have

1332
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:28,679
go even bigger physically so they have
 

1333
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,470
go even bigger physically so they have
more margin for upper stage reusability

1334
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
more margin for upper stage reusability
 

1335
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,990
more margin for upper stage reusability
and that's what we see with Starship and

1336
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,000
and that's what we see with Starship and
 

1337
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,149
and that's what we see with Starship and
super heavy so the super heavy booster

1338
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:35,159
super heavy so the super heavy booster
 

1339
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,250
super heavy so the super heavy booster
uh the whole system is confusing the

1340
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,260
uh the whole system is confusing the
 

1341
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,210
uh the whole system is confusing the
whole system is kind of considered

1342
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,220
whole system is kind of considered
 

1343
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,610
whole system is kind of considered
Starship but it technically the Starship

1344
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:40,620
Starship but it technically the Starship
 

1345
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,470
Starship but it technically the Starship
is just the upper stage which is also

1346
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
is just the upper stage which is also
 

1347
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,330
is just the upper stage which is also
like the spaceship which is also the

1348
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:44,340
like the spaceship which is also the
 

1349
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,610
like the spaceship which is also the
upper stage and then the booster itself

1350
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:46,620
upper stage and then the booster itself
 

1351
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,289
upper stage and then the booster itself
is considered the super heavy booster

1352
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:48,299
is considered the super heavy booster
 

1353
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,510
is considered the super heavy booster
and that's what they've been working on

1354
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:50,520
and that's what they've been working on
 

1355
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,750
and that's what they've been working on
uh publicly it came out in 2016 as the

1356
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
uh publicly it came out in 2016 as the
 

1357
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,149
uh publicly it came out in 2016 as the
at the time it was the its the inter

1358
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
at the time it was the its the inter
 

1359
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,270
at the time it was the its the inter
planetary transportation system uh later

1360
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
planetary transportation system uh later
 

1361
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,490
planetary transportation system uh later
in I think about 20 by the end of that

1362
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,500
in I think about 20 by the end of that
 

1363
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,289
in I think about 20 by the end of that
year 2017 it kind of became known as the

1364
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:03,299
year 2017 it kind of became known as the
 

1365
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,669
year 2017 it kind of became known as the
bfr the big Falcon rocket yes yeah

1366
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
bfr the big Falcon rocket yes yeah
 

1367
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,470
bfr the big Falcon rocket yes yeah
um and then I think it was about end of

1368
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:09,480
um and then I think it was about end of
 

1369
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,750
um and then I think it was about end of
2018 they started calling it Starship

1370
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
2018 they started calling it Starship
 

1371
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,090
2018 they started calling it Starship
but that is the that is where we're at

1372
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,100
but that is the that is where we're at
 

1373
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,070
but that is the that is where we're at
today and that's what their uh working

1374
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
today and that's what their uh working
 

1375
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,470
today and that's what their uh working
full steam ahead on and uh what about

1376
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
full steam ahead on and uh what about
 

1377
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,570
full steam ahead on and uh what about
dragon and we mentioned Dragon uh crew

1378
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
dragon and we mentioned Dragon uh crew
 

1379
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,730
dragon and we mentioned Dragon uh crew
Dragon cargo Dragon yeah so they went

1380
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:22,740
Dragon cargo Dragon yeah so they went
 

1381
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,310
Dragon cargo Dragon yeah so they went
from the cargo version of dragon that

1382
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,320
from the cargo version of dragon that
 

1383
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,430
from the cargo version of dragon that
flew about 20 times uh successfully to

1384
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:28,440
flew about 20 times uh successfully to
 

1385
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,930
flew about 20 times uh successfully to
the International Space Station uh

1386
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:29,940
the International Space Station uh
 

1387
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,430
the International Space Station uh
except for that one crs7 where the

1388
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
except for that one crs7 where the
 

1389
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,169
except for that one crs7 where the
rocket blew up in the capsule obviously

1390
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:33,179
rocket blew up in the capsule obviously
 

1391
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,789
rocket blew up in the capsule obviously
didn't make it to the ISS

1392
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
didn't make it to the ISS
 

1393
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,590
didn't make it to the ISS
um then they went into the dragon true

1394
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:36,600
um then they went into the dragon true
 

1395
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,690
um then they went into the dragon true
Dragon 2 which has two variants it has a

1396
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:38,700
Dragon 2 which has two variants it has a
 

1397
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,909
Dragon 2 which has two variants it has a
crew variant so we just call it crew

1398
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
crew variant so we just call it crew
 

1399
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,710
crew variant so we just call it crew
dragon and then there's the cargo

1400
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
dragon and then there's the cargo
 

1401
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,770
dragon and then there's the cargo
version of of dragon two

1402
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:45,780
version of of dragon two
 

1403
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,570
version of of dragon two
um and that's just an updated sleeker

1404
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:47,580
um and that's just an updated sleeker
 

1405
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,630
um and that's just an updated sleeker
sexier version of dragon and it's

1406
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:49,640
sexier version of dragon and it's
 

1407
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,490
sexier version of dragon and it's
ironically it's heavier altogether so it

1408
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:52,500
ironically it's heavier altogether so it
 

1409
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,830
ironically it's heavier altogether so it
uh you'll never see those those cool

1410
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:54,840
uh you'll never see those those cool
 

1411
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,090
uh you'll never see those those cool
return to launch site Landing the

1412
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,100
return to launch site Landing the
 

1413
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,950
return to launch site Landing the
boosters coming back to land for CRS

1414
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:57,960
boosters coming back to land for CRS
 

1415
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,049
boosters coming back to land for CRS
missions anymore like we used to but

1416
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,059
missions anymore like we used to but
 

1417
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,870
missions anymore like we used to but
they landed on the Drone ship anyway and

1418
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
they landed on the Drone ship anyway and
 

1419
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,549
they landed on the Drone ship anyway and
um and yeah that's been flying

1420
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
um and yeah that's been flying
 

1421
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,690
um and yeah that's been flying
successfully that's kind of the so

1422
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:05,700
successfully that's kind of the so
 

1423
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,549
successfully that's kind of the so
there's the starlink dragon Falcon 9

1424
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:07,559
there's the starlink dragon Falcon 9
 

1425
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,470
there's the starlink dragon Falcon 9
Falcon heavy and Starship system it's

1426
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:09,480
Falcon heavy and Starship system it's
 

1427
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,730
Falcon heavy and Starship system it's
kind of the whole

1428
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:10,740
kind of the whole
 

1429
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,250
kind of the whole
the whole SpaceX world really in terms

1430
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,260
the whole SpaceX world really in terms
 

1431
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,169
the whole SpaceX world really in terms
of the the spaceships involved so what

1432
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:15,179
of the the spaceships involved so what
 

1433
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,730
of the the spaceships involved so what
what do you are some of the major

1434
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:16,740
what do you are some of the major
 

1435
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,610
what do you are some of the major
milestones in that history we kind of

1436
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:19,620
milestones in that history we kind of
 

1437
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,450
milestones in that history we kind of
mentioned

1438
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:20,460
mentioned
 

1439
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,149
mentioned
a few yeah like in the landing is there

1440
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:23,159
a few yeah like in the landing is there
 

1441
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,130
a few yeah like in the landing is there
something that kind of stands out yeah I

1442
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,140
something that kind of stands out yeah I
 

1443
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,570
something that kind of stands out yeah I
would say definitely

1444
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:26,580
would say definitely
 

1445
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,130
would say definitely
um the big ones obviously like any of

1446
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,140
um the big ones obviously like any of
 

1447
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,149
um the big ones obviously like any of
the first like the first flight of

1448
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:29,159
the first like the first flight of
 

1449
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,590
the first like the first flight of
Falcon one first flight of Falcon 9

1450
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
Falcon one first flight of Falcon 9
 

1451
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,490
Falcon one first flight of Falcon 9
first time they went to the

1452
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:31,500
first time they went to the
 

1453
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,409
first time they went to the
International Space Station

1454
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:33,419
International Space Station
 

1455
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,690
International Space Station
um the first time they landed a booster

1456
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:35,700
um the first time they landed a booster
 

1457
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,250
um the first time they landed a booster
um the first time they reused a booster

1458
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:37,260
um the first time they reused a booster
 

1459
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,230
um the first time they reused a booster
which is I think about six months after

1460
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,240
which is I think about six months after
 

1461
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,950
which is I think about six months after
no oh it was a year after it was SCS 10

1462
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
no oh it was a year after it was SCS 10
 

1463
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,570
no oh it was a year after it was SCS 10
um

1464
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:43,580
um
 

1465
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,649
um
2017 it was the first time they they

1466
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:45,659
2017 it was the first time they they
 

1467
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,029
2017 it was the first time they they
reused one of those boosters you know

1468
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
reused one of those boosters you know
 

1469
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,890
reused one of those boosters you know
and that was a big milestone like can we

1470
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:48,900
and that was a big milestone like can we
 

1471
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,110
and that was a big milestone like can we
even yeah we recovered one we we caught

1472
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
even yeah we recovered one we we caught
 

1473
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,610
even yeah we recovered one we we caught
one you know it's like we got one now

1474
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,620
one you know it's like we got one now
 

1475
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,690
one you know it's like we got one now
what

1476
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:53,700
what
 

1477
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,010
what
um that was the first time they reflew

1478
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,020
um that was the first time they reflew
 

1479
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,090
um that was the first time they reflew
one

1480
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,100
one
 

1481
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,950
one
um yeah then flying humans was a huge

1482
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:57,960
um yeah then flying humans was a huge
 

1483
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,110
um yeah then flying humans was a huge
one dm2 Bob and Doug

1484
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,120
one dm2 Bob and Doug
 

1485
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,529
one dm2 Bob and Doug
um for NASA

1486
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:02,539
um for NASA
 

1487
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,789
um for NASA
that was incredible you know that was

1488
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
that was incredible you know that was
 

1489
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,370
that was incredible you know that was
that was a huge huge step I think for

1490
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,380
that was a huge huge step I think for
 

1491
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,890
that was a huge huge step I think for
SpaceX was flying people so it's this

1492
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:09,900
SpaceX was flying people so it's this
 

1493
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,049
SpaceX was flying people so it's this
first major commercial

1494
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:12,059
first major commercial
 

1495
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,690
first major commercial
launching of humans out into space yeah

1496
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:14,700
launching of humans out into space yeah
 

1497
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,130
launching of humans out into space yeah
and not just into space because you know

1498
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,140
and not just into space because you know
 

1499
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,470
and not just into space because you know
there's been people that have done you

1500
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
there's been people that have done you
 

1501
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,029
there's been people that have done you
know space flights with you know like

1502
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:20,039
know space flights with you know like
 

1503
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,810
know space flights with you know like
sub-orbital hops but going into orbit

1504
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:22,820
sub-orbital hops but going into orbit
 

1505
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,070
sub-orbital hops but going into orbit
and especially docking and rendezvous

1506
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,080
and especially docking and rendezvous
 

1507
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,210
and especially docking and rendezvous
with the International Space Station is

1508
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,220
with the International Space Station is
 

1509
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,850
with the International Space Station is
a it's a big deal it's a whole it until

1510
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:28,860
a it's a big deal it's a whole it until
 

1511
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,830
a it's a big deal it's a whole it until
you really understand the physics

1512
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:30,840
you really understand the physics
 

1513
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,450
you really understand the physics
involved in the scale involved with like

1514
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,460
involved in the scale involved with like
 

1515
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,890
involved in the scale involved with like
just crossing the karma line going

1516
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:33,900
just crossing the karma line going
 

1517
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,049
just crossing the karma line going
straight up versus going into orbit like

1518
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:36,059
straight up versus going into orbit like
 

1519
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,310
straight up versus going into orbit like
they're just completely different things

1520
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,320
they're just completely different things
 

1521
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,630
they're just completely different things
almost what about uh Starship are we oh

1522
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
almost what about uh Starship are we oh
 

1523
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,890
almost what about uh Starship are we oh
are we in a place where we can talk

1524
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:42,900
are we in a place where we can talk
 

1525
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,049
are we in a place where we can talk
about Milestones with Starship has there

1526
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,059
about Milestones with Starship has there
 

1527
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,390
about Milestones with Starship has there
been or has it just been an Epic Journey

1528
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:47,400
been or has it just been an Epic Journey
 

1529
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,090
been or has it just been an Epic Journey
of failure and successes of testing and

1530
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,100
of failure and successes of testing and
 

1531
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,690
of failure and successes of testing and
and so on was there like even yeah what

1532
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:53,700
and so on was there like even yeah what
 

1533
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,090
and so on was there like even yeah what
would you classify at this point as uh

1534
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,100
would you classify at this point as uh
 

1535
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,610
would you classify at this point as uh
as a milestone a Starship or bfr

1536
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:58,620
as a milestone a Starship or bfr
 

1537
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,350
as a milestone a Starship or bfr
whatever the name is I was able to

1538
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,360
whatever the name is I was able to
 

1539
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,269
whatever the name is I was able to
achieve well so far the Milestones we've

1540
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:02,279
achieve well so far the Milestones we've
 

1541
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,190
achieve well so far the Milestones we've
seen I'd say the first one would be the

1542
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,200
seen I'd say the first one would be the
 

1543
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,289
seen I'd say the first one would be the
Hop of they call it star Hopper and it's

1544
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:06,299
Hop of they call it star Hopper and it's
 

1545
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,269
Hop of they call it star Hopper and it's
basically a very rudimentary rocket but

1546
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:08,279
basically a very rudimentary rocket but
 

1547
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,370
basically a very rudimentary rocket but
it was the first time they they utilized

1548
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:10,380
it was the first time they they utilized
 

1549
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,990
it was the first time they they utilized
their new Raptor engine to produce

1550
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
their new Raptor engine to produce
 

1551
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,149
their new Raptor engine to produce
thrusted to fly something

1552
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
thrusted to fly something
 

1553
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,850
thrusted to fly something
it first flew like literally like three

1554
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:16,860
it first flew like literally like three
 

1555
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,990
it first flew like literally like three
meters off the ground or something like

1556
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
meters off the ground or something like
 

1557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,669
meters off the ground or something like
Tethered to the ground then it flew like

1558
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
Tethered to the ground then it flew like
 

1559
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,850
Tethered to the ground then it flew like
15 and then finally it flew 150 meters

1560
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:22,860
15 and then finally it flew 150 meters
 

1561
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,630
15 and then finally it flew 150 meters
um and that was in 2019 and that was the

1562
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
um and that was in 2019 and that was the
 

1563
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,430
um and that was in 2019 and that was the
first big milestone of of Starship and

1564
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,440
first big milestone of of Starship and
 

1565
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,730
first big milestone of of Starship and
then after that we saw uh sn5 sn6 kind

1566
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:31,740
then after that we saw uh sn5 sn6 kind
 

1567
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,470
then after that we saw uh sn5 sn6 kind
of do the similar like 150 meter hops

1568
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:33,480
of do the similar like 150 meter hops
 

1569
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,630
of do the similar like 150 meter hops
with a little bit more elegant systems

1570
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:35,640
with a little bit more elegant systems
 

1571
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,190
with a little bit more elegant systems
you know proving out more of their their

1572
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
you know proving out more of their their
 

1573
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,169
you know proving out more of their their
tank building proving out more of their

1574
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:39,179
tank building proving out more of their
 

1575
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,029
tank building proving out more of their
you know a lot of just subsystems and

1576
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
you know a lot of just subsystems and
 

1577
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,149
you know a lot of just subsystems and
then the big ones physically were in uh

1578
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
then the big ones physically were in uh
 

1579
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,909
then the big ones physically were in uh
end end end end of 2020 and early 2021

1580
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:46,919
end end end end of 2020 and early 2021
 

1581
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,029
end end end end of 2020 and early 2021
when they flew the uh sn8 9 10 11 and

1582
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:50,039
when they flew the uh sn8 9 10 11 and
 

1583
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,310
when they flew the uh sn8 9 10 11 and
15. what is the n stand for in SN I

1584
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
15. what is the n stand for in SN I
 

1585
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,730
15. what is the n stand for in SN I
think just serial number yeah these are

1586
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:55,740
think just serial number yeah these are
 

1587
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,310
think just serial number yeah these are
just names numbers numerical

1588
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
just names numbers numerical
 

1589
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,230
just names numbers numerical
representations of the different testing

1590
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
representations of the different testing
 

1591
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,630
representations of the different testing
efforts they skipped some numbers right

1592
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
efforts they skipped some numbers right
 

1593
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,029
efforts they skipped some numbers right
yeah if they if they scratch uh a test

1594
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
yeah if they if they scratch uh a test
 

1595
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,350
yeah if they if they scratch uh a test
yeah and lots of times it'd be like

1596
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,360
yeah and lots of times it'd be like
 

1597
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,669
yeah and lots of times it'd be like
literally they're building you know

1598
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
literally they're building you know
 

1599
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,130
literally they're building you know
because at Starbase and it what SpaceX

1600
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,140
because at Starbase and it what SpaceX
 

1601
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,990
because at Starbase and it what SpaceX
is working like the one foot is always

1602
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
is working like the one foot is always
 

1603
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,549
is working like the one foot is always
in front of someone else's foot and like

1604
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:13,559
in front of someone else's foot and like
 

1605
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,990
in front of someone else's foot and like
the arm is not knowing what the leg is

1606
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
the arm is not knowing what the leg is
 

1607
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,529
the arm is not knowing what the leg is
doing sometimes yeah they they will have

1608
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:18,539
doing sometimes yeah they they will have
 

1609
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,850
doing sometimes yeah they they will have
someone working on you know they'll just

1610
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:19,860
someone working on you know they'll just
 

1611
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,529
someone working on you know they'll just
be like hurry up and build 40 of these

1612
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:21,539
be like hurry up and build 40 of these
 

1613
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,690
be like hurry up and build 40 of these
tank sections and you build the bulkhead

1614
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,700
tank sections and you build the bulkhead
 

1615
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,950
tank sections and you build the bulkhead
and you build the downcomer and you

1616
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960
and you build the downcomer and you
 

1617
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,750
and you build the downcomer and you
build the header tank blah blah and all

1618
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:26,760
build the header tank blah blah and all
 

1619
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,890
build the header tank blah blah and all
of a sudden like oh we actually evolved

1620
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:27,900
of a sudden like oh we actually evolved
 

1621
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,210
of a sudden like oh we actually evolved
that we don't use that header tank now

1622
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,220
that we don't use that header tank now
 

1623
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,350
that we don't use that header tank now
so it's going to go on to this one so

1624
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,360
so it's going to go on to this one so
 

1625
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,029
so it's going to go on to this one so
they'll have like parts of certain

1626
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:32,039
they'll have like parts of certain
 

1627
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,490
they'll have like parts of certain
Rockets built in fact ask literally

1628
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,500
Rockets built in fact ask literally
 

1629
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,710
Rockets built in fact ask literally
scrap it like not scrap it like in the

1630
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
scrap it like not scrap it like in the
 

1631
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,149
scrap it like not scrap it like in the
you know joke term but like literally

1632
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
you know joke term but like literally
 

1633
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,970
you know joke term but like literally
just go scrap it and they uh so yeah

1634
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:40,980
just go scrap it and they uh so yeah
 

1635
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,769
just go scrap it and they uh so yeah
they just evolve and iterate so quickly

1636
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:42,779
they just evolve and iterate so quickly
 

1637
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,070
they just evolve and iterate so quickly
there was some epic explosions

1638
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
there was some epic explosions
 

1639
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,890
there was some epic explosions
um I think Starship something about it

1640
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:48,900
um I think Starship something about it
 

1641
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,470
um I think Starship something about it
uh probably just the amount of fuel just

1642
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:51,480
uh probably just the amount of fuel just
 

1643
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,649
uh probably just the amount of fuel just
leads to some epic epic failures oh yeah

1644
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:54,659
leads to some epic epic failures oh yeah
 

1645
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,570
leads to some epic epic failures oh yeah
probably would you say Starship is the

1646
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,580
probably would you say Starship is the
 

1647
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,909
probably would you say Starship is the
source of the most epic failures in

1648
00:27:58,909 --> 00:27:58,919
source of the most epic failures in
 

1649
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,950
source of the most epic failures in
terms of size of explosion so you can

1650
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
terms of size of explosion so you can
 

1651
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,870
terms of size of explosion so you can
literally measure in like a yield of

1652
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
literally measure in like a yield of
 

1653
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,669
literally measure in like a yield of
explosive power you know like like you

1654
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:04,679
explosive power you know like like you
 

1655
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,250
explosive power you know like like you
could TNT like you can take a look at uh

1656
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,260
could TNT like you can take a look at uh
 

1657
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,810
could TNT like you can take a look at uh
how much repellent is left over at the

1658
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:08,820
how much repellent is left over at the
 

1659
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,549
how much repellent is left over at the
at the time of the explosion and you

1660
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
at the time of the explosion and you
 

1661
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,830
at the time of the explosion and you
know Starship what's flown so far even

1662
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:12,840
know Starship what's flown so far even
 

1663
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,029
know Starship what's flown so far even
though it's physically one of the

1664
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:14,039
though it's physically one of the
 

1665
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,430
though it's physically one of the
largest flying objects ever uh just with

1666
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
largest flying objects ever uh just with
 

1667
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,830
largest flying objects ever uh just with
the Upper State alone they've not filled

1668
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:18,840
the Upper State alone they've not filled
 

1669
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,570
the Upper State alone they've not filled
it more than like 10 or 20 percent full

1670
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:20,580
it more than like 10 or 20 percent full
 

1671
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,090
it more than like 10 or 20 percent full
of propellant yeah and so it actually

1672
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,100
of propellant yeah and so it actually
 

1673
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,130
of propellant yeah and so it actually
hasn't been the the failures have been

1674
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:25,140
hasn't been the the failures have been
 

1675
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,310
hasn't been the the failures have been
really epic looking uh big visual

1676
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
really epic looking uh big visual
 

1677
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,350
really epic looking uh big visual
Fireballs but in terms of space flight

1678
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,360
Fireballs but in terms of space flight
 

1679
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,690
Fireballs but in terms of space flight
they're still pretty small explosions

1680
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:32,700
they're still pretty small explosions
 

1681
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,610
they're still pretty small explosions
believe it or not they could still go

1682
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:34,620
believe it or not they could still go
 

1683
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,269
believe it or not they could still go
bigger yo yeah a lot a lot and of course

1684
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:38,279
bigger yo yeah a lot a lot and of course
 

1685
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,210
bigger yo yeah a lot a lot and of course
the test payload of a Tesla Roadster was

1686
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,220
the test payload of a Tesla Roadster was
 

1687
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,430
the test payload of a Tesla Roadster was
launched um I forget what year that was

1688
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
launched um I forget what year that was
 

1689
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,710
launched um I forget what year that was
yeah that's 2018. that was quite epic

1690
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,720
yeah that's 2018. that was quite epic
 

1691
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,570
yeah that's 2018. that was quite epic
would you put that on a milestone oh

1692
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:47,580
would you put that on a milestone oh
 

1693
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,310
would you put that on a milestone oh
yeah yeah Falcon heavy demo was like

1694
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,320
yeah yeah Falcon heavy demo was like
 

1695
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,010
yeah yeah Falcon heavy demo was like
definitely a a big big big milestone

1696
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,020
definitely a a big big big milestone
 

1697
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,130
definitely a a big big big milestone
yeah is that funny to you that there's a

1698
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,140
yeah is that funny to you that there's a
 

1699
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,470
yeah is that funny to you that there's a
roadster floating out there yeah we know

1700
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:57,480
roadster floating out there yeah we know
 

1701
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,029
roadster floating out there yeah we know
the location of that Roaster at this oh

1702
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
the location of that Roaster at this oh
 

1703
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,029
the location of that Roaster at this oh
yeah where is roadster.com yeah oh yeah

1704
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:02,039
yeah where is roadster.com yeah oh yeah
 

1705
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,590
yeah where is roadster.com yeah oh yeah
where's is it orbiting something yeah

1706
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
where's is it orbiting something yeah
 

1707
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,409
where's is it orbiting something yeah
it's orbiting the Sun it's orbiting the

1708
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:06,419
it's orbiting the Sun it's orbiting the
 

1709
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,330
it's orbiting the Sun it's orbiting the
Sun and its orbit is basically between

1710
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,340
Sun and its orbit is basically between
 

1711
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,390
Sun and its orbit is basically between
the Earth's orbit and Beyond Mars so I

1712
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,400
the Earth's orbit and Beyond Mars so I
 

1713
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,430
the Earth's orbit and Beyond Mars so I
think of like 2.5 Au if I remember right

1714
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
think of like 2.5 Au if I remember right
 

1715
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,190
think of like 2.5 Au if I remember right
so it's it's beyond Mars's orbit and its

1716
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,200
so it's it's beyond Mars's orbit and its
 

1717
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,570
so it's it's beyond Mars's orbit and its
highest point and it's back at Earth

1718
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:17,580
highest point and it's back at Earth
 

1719
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,430
highest point and it's back at Earth
kind of in its lowest point I wonder if

1720
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
kind of in its lowest point I wonder if
 

1721
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,590
kind of in its lowest point I wonder if
there's a mission where you're going to

1722
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
there's a mission where you're going to
 

1723
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,810
there's a mission where you're going to
somehow connect with it once again and

1724
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:23,820
somehow connect with it once again and
 

1725
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,909
somehow connect with it once again and
like Place extra things into it I wonder

1726
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
like Place extra things into it I wonder
 

1727
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,370
like Place extra things into it I wonder
how challenging that is technically oh

1728
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:28,380
how challenging that is technically oh
 

1729
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,630
how challenging that is technically oh
yeah it could it could absolutely be

1730
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:29,640
yeah it could it could absolutely be
 

1731
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,529
yeah it could it could absolutely be
done

1732
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:30,539
done
 

1733
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,810
done
um you know the hard thing at this point

1734
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:32,820
um you know the hard thing at this point
 

1735
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,909
um you know the hard thing at this point
because it's on an eccentric orbit would

1736
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:34,919
because it's on an eccentric orbit would
 

1737
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,889
because it's on an eccentric orbit would
be rendezvousing with it because you

1738
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:36,899
be rendezvousing with it because you
 

1739
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,510
be rendezvousing with it because you
kind of have to be in alignment with its

1740
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,520
kind of have to be in alignment with its
 

1741
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,430
kind of have to be in alignment with its
orbit to really line up well with it

1742
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,440
orbit to really line up well with it
 

1743
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,590
orbit to really line up well with it
yeah um but yeah I mean someday I don't

1744
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:42,600
yeah um but yeah I mean someday I don't
 

1745
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,210
yeah um but yeah I mean someday I don't
see any reason why we couldn't at least

1746
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,220
see any reason why we couldn't at least
 

1747
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,130
see any reason why we couldn't at least
send for sure an uncrewed you know felon

1748
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,140
send for sure an uncrewed you know felon
 

1749
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,529
send for sure an uncrewed you know felon
wanted to just fly a a robot out there

1750
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:48,539
wanted to just fly a a robot out there
 

1751
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,389
wanted to just fly a a robot out there
to check up on it and photograph it or

1752
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
to check up on it and photograph it or
 

1753
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,250
to check up on it and photograph it or
something like we could that could be

1754
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,260
something like we could that could be
 

1755
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,930
something like we could that could be
well within the realm of things and get

1756
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:53,940
well within the realm of things and get
 

1757
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,769
well within the realm of things and get
an uh Optimus uh robot up there

1758
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:56,779
an uh Optimus uh robot up there
 

1759
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,350
an uh Optimus uh robot up there
uh so that was the story uh brilliantly

1760
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,360
uh so that was the story uh brilliantly
 

1761
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,049
uh so that was the story uh brilliantly
told by you of the Rockets uh for SpaceX

1762
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:03,059
told by you of the Rockets uh for SpaceX
 

1763
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,269
told by you of the Rockets uh for SpaceX
what about through the lens of engines

1764
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
what about through the lens of engines
 

1765
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,130
what about through the lens of engines
can you give a brief history of the

1766
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:07,140
can you give a brief history of the
 

1767
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,610
can you give a brief history of the
SpaceX rocket engines that were uh used

1768
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:10,620
SpaceX rocket engines that were uh used
 

1769
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,230
SpaceX rocket engines that were uh used
that we haven't covered so you mentioned

1770
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
that we haven't covered so you mentioned
 

1771
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,149
that we haven't covered so you mentioned
all started with the Merlin engine and a

1772
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
all started with the Merlin engine and a
 

1773
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,649
all started with the Merlin engine and a
custom engine what

1774
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:15,659
custom engine what
 

1775
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,649
custom engine what
um yeah through that lens yeah what's

1776
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:18,659
um yeah through that lens yeah what's
 

1777
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,630
um yeah through that lens yeah what's
there the engines are relatively small

1778
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
there the engines are relatively small
 

1779
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,430
there the engines are relatively small
number which is which is easy for us

1780
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:22,440
number which is which is easy for us
 

1781
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,690
number which is which is easy for us
there's either Merlin and Merlin's

1782
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:23,700
there's either Merlin and Merlin's
 

1783
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,549
there's either Merlin and Merlin's
evolved throughout time to be from like

1784
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:25,559
evolved throughout time to be from like
 

1785
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,930
evolved throughout time to be from like
the Merlin to the Merlin one seed and

1786
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:26,940
the Merlin to the Merlin one seed and
 

1787
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,909
the Merlin to the Merlin one seed and
Merlin 1D to the Merlin 1D full thrust

1788
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:28,919
Merlin 1D to the Merlin 1D full thrust
 

1789
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,230
Merlin 1D to the Merlin 1D full thrust
and all these other kind of tweaks of

1790
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:30,240
and all these other kind of tweaks of
 

1791
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,750
and all these other kind of tweaks of
the same architecture uh Kestrel ended

1792
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:32,760
the same architecture uh Kestrel ended
 

1793
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,549
the same architecture uh Kestrel ended
with Falcon one

1794
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
with Falcon one
 

1795
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,870
with Falcon one
um they also have the Merlin vacuum

1796
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
um they also have the Merlin vacuum
 

1797
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,250
um they also have the Merlin vacuum
engine which is the upper stage engine

1798
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:37,260
engine which is the upper stage engine
 

1799
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,610
engine which is the upper stage engine
for Falcon 9. same relative uh system

1800
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:40,620
for Falcon 9. same relative uh system
 

1801
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,350
for Falcon 9. same relative uh system
but just optimized for vacuum so it has

1802
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,360
but just optimized for vacuum so it has
 

1803
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,510
but just optimized for vacuum so it has
a much larger Bell nozzle there's the

1804
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:44,520
a much larger Bell nozzle there's the
 

1805
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,669
a much larger Bell nozzle there's the
Draco thrusters which you know you kind

1806
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:46,679
Draco thrusters which you know you kind
 

1807
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,950
Draco thrusters which you know you kind
of can consider engines well they are

1808
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
of can consider engines well they are
 

1809
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,630
of can consider engines well they are
rocket engines but they're just small

1810
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
rocket engines but they're just small
 

1811
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,610
rocket engines but they're just small
they're not like the orbital engines

1812
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:52,620
they're not like the orbital engines
 

1813
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,230
they're not like the orbital engines
there's these super Draco engines which

1814
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
there's these super Draco engines which
 

1815
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,289
there's these super Draco engines which
are the abort thrusters on on crew

1816
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:57,299
are the abort thrusters on on crew
 

1817
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,330
are the abort thrusters on on crew
Dragon capsule and then nowadays they

1818
00:30:59,330 --> 00:30:59,340
Dragon capsule and then nowadays they
 

1819
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,210
Dragon capsule and then nowadays they
have the Raptor engine and the Raptor

1820
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,220
have the Raptor engine and the Raptor
 

1821
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,370
have the Raptor engine and the Raptor
vacuum variant but they've already had

1822
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,380
vacuum variant but they've already had
 

1823
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,450
vacuum variant but they've already had
two versions of raptor we've already

1824
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:05,460
two versions of raptor we've already
 

1825
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,529
two versions of raptor we've already
seen kind of the Raptor development

1826
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:06,539
seen kind of the Raptor development
 

1827
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,730
seen kind of the Raptor development
engine

1828
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:07,740
engine
 

1829
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,049
engine
um it kind of seemed like a raptor 1.5

1830
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:09,059
um it kind of seemed like a raptor 1.5
 

1831
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,990
um it kind of seemed like a raptor 1.5
whereas kind of taking hints of the

1832
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
whereas kind of taking hints of the
 

1833
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,149
whereas kind of taking hints of the
future Raptor but now we're well within

1834
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
future Raptor but now we're well within
 

1835
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,370
future Raptor but now we're well within
the well within what you'd consider a

1836
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:16,380
the well within what you'd consider a
 

1837
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,930
the well within what you'd consider a
Raptor 2 variant

1838
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:17,940
Raptor 2 variant
 

1839
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,930
Raptor 2 variant
and that's really it yeah for the uh the

1840
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:20,940
and that's really it yeah for the uh the
 

1841
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,549
and that's really it yeah for the uh the
Raptor maybe I'll ask you that

1842
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
Raptor maybe I'll ask you that
 

1843
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,830
Raptor maybe I'll ask you that
separately but I like in general and

1844
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:24,840
separately but I like in general and
 

1845
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,870
separately but I like in general and
people

1846
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:25,880
people
 

1847
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,549
people
who doesn't know whoever the astronaut

1848
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
who doesn't know whoever the astronaut
 

1849
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,769
who doesn't know whoever the astronaut
is but if you don't somehow know go go

1850
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:30,779
is but if you don't somehow know go go
 

1851
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,830
is but if you don't somehow know go go
go check his uh your YouTube channel out

1852
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
go check his uh your YouTube channel out
 

1853
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,529
go check his uh your YouTube channel out
you're an incredible educator about the

1854
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:36,539
you're an incredible educator about the
 

1855
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,769
you're an incredible educator about the
the super technical and uh the more sort

1856
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:39,779
the super technical and uh the more sort
 

1857
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,169
the super technical and uh the more sort
of even the the philosophical the actual

1858
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:42,179
of even the the philosophical the actual
 

1859
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,210
of even the the philosophical the actual
like the the actual space travel so you

1860
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,220
like the the actual space travel so you
 

1861
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,730
like the the actual space travel so you
go down to the raw details of it and

1862
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:46,740
go down to the raw details of it and
 

1863
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,289
go down to the raw details of it and
there's just great videos on the Raptor

1864
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:48,299
there's just great videos on the Raptor
 

1865
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,490
there's just great videos on the Raptor
engine

1866
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:49,500
engine
 

1867
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,090
engine
um

1868
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,100
um
 

1869
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,029
um
I think you have one on Merlin uh and

1870
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
I think you have one on Merlin uh and
 

1871
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,370
I think you have one on Merlin uh and
and also actual tours with Elon where he

1872
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,380
and also actual tours with Elon where he
 

1873
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,230
and also actual tours with Elon where he
discusses some of those things I'm one

1874
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,240
discusses some of those things I'm one
 

1875
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,510
discusses some of those things I'm one
of the tourists he says uh he's full of

1876
00:31:59,510 --> 00:31:59,520
of the tourists he says uh he's full of
 

1877
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,850
of the tourists he says uh he's full of
good lines that guy uh he says something

1878
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:01,860
good lines that guy uh he says something
 

1879
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,970
good lines that guy uh he says something
about uh the number of fiddly bits

1880
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:04,980
about uh the number of fiddly bits
 

1881
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,210
about uh the number of fiddly bits
and he's uh the number of fiddly bits

1882
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,220
and he's uh the number of fiddly bits
 

1883
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,090
and he's uh the number of fiddly bits
was decreased between Raptor two and

1884
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,100
was decreased between Raptor two and
 

1885
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,950
was decreased between Raptor two and
Raptor one yeah and I I think that's

1886
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
Raptor one yeah and I I think that's
 

1887
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,029
Raptor one yeah and I I think that's
actually a really beautiful

1888
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:14,039
actually a really beautiful
 

1889
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,210
actually a really beautiful
representation of um the engineering

1890
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:17,220
representation of um the engineering
 

1891
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,830
representation of um the engineering
efforts there which is constantly trying

1892
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:18,840
efforts there which is constantly trying
 

1893
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,930
efforts there which is constantly trying
to simplify oh yeah increase the

1894
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:20,940
to simplify oh yeah increase the
 

1895
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,330
to simplify oh yeah increase the
efficiency of the engines but also

1896
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:23,340
efficiency of the engines but also
 

1897
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,850
efficiency of the engines but also
uh simplify the design so you can

1898
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:25,860
uh simplify the design so you can
 

1899
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,970
uh simplify the design so you can
manufacture it and in general

1900
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:27,980
manufacture it and in general
 

1901
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,470
manufacture it and in general
simplification leads to better

1902
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
simplification leads to better
 

1903
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,029
simplification leads to better
performance and testing you know and

1904
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:32,039
performance and testing you know and
 

1905
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,130
performance and testing you know and
everything so the number of fiddly bits

1906
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,140
everything so the number of fiddly bits
 

1907
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,169
everything so the number of fiddly bits
I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on

1908
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:36,179
I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on
 

1909
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,970
I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page on
that now as an index is actually a

1910
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:37,980
that now as an index is actually a
 

1911
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,889
that now as an index is actually a
really good one well and when you think

1912
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:39,899
really good one well and when you think
 

1913
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,810
really good one well and when you think
about it I I don't know of any other

1914
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:41,820
about it I I don't know of any other
 

1915
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,149
about it I I don't know of any other
company prior that had kind of try to

1916
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
company prior that had kind of try to
 

1917
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,169
company prior that had kind of try to
measure their performance of their

1918
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:45,179
measure their performance of their
 

1919
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,789
measure their performance of their
engine not and like thrust to weight

1920
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
engine not and like thrust to weight
 

1921
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,470
engine not and like thrust to weight
ratio or like how efficient it is like

1922
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
ratio or like how efficient it is like
 

1923
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,029
ratio or like how efficient it is like
in specific impulse but literally in

1924
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:50,039
in specific impulse but literally in
 

1925
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,850
in specific impulse but literally in
like dollar to thrust ratio like how

1926
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:52,860
like dollar to thrust ratio like how
 

1927
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,370
like dollar to thrust ratio like how
much does this engine cost how much

1928
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,380
much does this engine cost how much
 

1929
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,889
much does this engine cost how much
thrust can it produce and like using

1930
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:57,899
thrust can it produce and like using
 

1931
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,630
thrust can it produce and like using
that as a trade study instead of just

1932
00:32:59,630 --> 00:32:59,640
that as a trade study instead of just
 

1933
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,610
that as a trade study instead of just
like pure metrics of you know because at

1934
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:01,620
like pure metrics of you know because at
 

1935
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,409
like pure metrics of you know because at
the end of the day like okay if it's if

1936
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:03,419
the end of the day like okay if it's if
 

1937
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,510
the end of the day like okay if it's if
it's cheaper and does you know x amount

1938
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:05,520
it's cheaper and does you know x amount
 

1939
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,070
it's cheaper and does you know x amount
of work even if it's less efficient it

1940
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,080
of work even if it's less efficient it
 

1941
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,169
of work even if it's less efficient it
can actually be better long term

1942
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:09,179
can actually be better long term
 

1943
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,210
can actually be better long term
and so I guess another way it's not even

1944
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:11,220
and so I guess another way it's not even
 

1945
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,370
and so I guess another way it's not even
just thrust I don't know if that metric

1946
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,380
just thrust I don't know if that metric
 

1947
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,409
just thrust I don't know if that metric
is used but basically the cost of

1948
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:15,419
is used but basically the cost of
 

1949
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,330
is used but basically the cost of
getting one kilogram

1950
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,340
getting one kilogram
 

1951
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,029
getting one kilogram
of thing up into space yeah that's

1952
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:20,039
of thing up into space yeah that's
 

1953
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,169
of thing up into space yeah that's
basically what they're trying to

1954
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:21,179
basically what they're trying to
 

1955
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,110
basically what they're trying to
minimize especially yeah at the end of

1956
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,120
minimize especially yeah at the end of
 

1957
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,490
minimize especially yeah at the end of
the day that is definitely the ultimate

1958
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:25,500
the day that is definitely the ultimate
 

1959
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,350
the day that is definitely the ultimate
metric is how much does one kilogram

1960
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
metric is how much does one kilogram
 

1961
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,509
metric is how much does one kilogram
cost to orbit eventually you know and

1962
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
cost to orbit eventually you know and
 

1963
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,210
cost to orbit eventually you know and
but there's it's so funny because

1964
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,220
but there's it's so funny because
 

1965
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,350
but there's it's so funny because
spaceflight is just the ultimate you

1966
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
spaceflight is just the ultimate you
 

1967
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,450
spaceflight is just the ultimate you
know it's the ultimate compromise every

1968
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,460
know it's the ultimate compromise every
 

1969
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,850
know it's the ultimate compromise every
little thing any variable can just

1970
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:37,860
little thing any variable can just
 

1971
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,830
little thing any variable can just
change everything else so you can tweak

1972
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
change everything else so you can tweak
 

1973
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,149
change everything else so you can tweak
so many different things to get to

1974
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:41,159
so many different things to get to
 

1975
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,190
so many different things to get to
different numbers and conclusions you

1976
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
different numbers and conclusions you
 

1977
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,230
different numbers and conclusions you
know but even things like on your first

1978
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,240
know but even things like on your first
 

1979
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,549
know but even things like on your first
stage when you're when you're the

1980
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
stage when you're when you're the
 

1981
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,230
stage when you're when you're the
Rocket's pointing straight up and the

1982
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
Rocket's pointing straight up and the
 

1983
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,310
Rocket's pointing straight up and the
engines are pointing straight down

1984
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,320
engines are pointing straight down
 

1985
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,769
engines are pointing straight down
you're dealing more with the thrust to

1986
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:51,779
you're dealing more with the thrust to
 

1987
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,029
you're dealing more with the thrust to
weight ratio of the rocket so how much

1988
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
weight ratio of the rocket so how much
 

1989
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,409
weight ratio of the rocket so how much
thrust is it producing versus how much

1990
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:54,419
thrust is it producing versus how much
 

1991
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,750
thrust is it producing versus how much
is gravity pulling down on it is

1992
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:56,760
is gravity pulling down on it is
 

1993
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,250
is gravity pulling down on it is
actually a more important metric than

1994
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:58,260
actually a more important metric than
 

1995
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,889
actually a more important metric than
how raw efficient the engine is so it's

1996
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:00,899
how raw efficient the engine is so it's
 

1997
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,330
how raw efficient the engine is so it's
funny then in space it's kind of the

1998
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:02,340
funny then in space it's kind of the
 

1999
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,470
funny then in space it's kind of the
opposite thrust to weight ratio doesn't

2000
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,480
opposite thrust to weight ratio doesn't
 

2001
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,049
opposite thrust to weight ratio doesn't
really matter uh what really matters is

2002
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:06,059
really matter uh what really matters is
 

2003
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,149
really matter uh what really matters is
the actual the specific impulses color

2004
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
the actual the specific impulses color
 

2005
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,030
the actual the specific impulses color
like the the nozzle escape velocity of

2006
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
like the the nozzle escape velocity of
 

2007
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,909
like the the nozzle escape velocity of
the or the injection velocity of the how

2008
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
the or the injection velocity of the how
 

2009
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,649
the or the injection velocity of the how
fast is the gas moving it's like the

2010
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:15,659
fast is the gas moving it's like the
 

2011
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,990
fast is the gas moving it's like the
more important number on or orbit but

2012
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
more important number on or orbit but
 

2013
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,609
more important number on or orbit but
it's it's just so crazy because there's

2014
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:19,619
it's it's just so crazy because there's
 

2015
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,109
it's it's just so crazy because there's
all these like I would just love to see

2016
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
all these like I would just love to see
 

2017
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,089
all these like I would just love to see
the trade studies you know when you're

2018
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:23,099
the trade studies you know when you're
 

2019
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,409
the trade studies you know when you're
like trying to figure out like is this

2020
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:24,419
like trying to figure out like is this
 

2021
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,669
like trying to figure out like is this
more important than this or this or this

2022
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
more important than this or this or this
 

2023
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,230
more important than this or this or this
and it's like you change this one little

2024
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,240
and it's like you change this one little
 

2025
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,450
and it's like you change this one little
thing also you know like all the

2026
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:29,460
thing also you know like all the
 

2027
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,970
thing also you know like all the
everything changes it's just even the

2028
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:31,980
everything changes it's just even the
 

2029
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,530
everything changes it's just even the
profile like the launch profile the

2030
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:33,540
profile like the launch profile the
 

2031
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,290
profile like the launch profile the
trajectory of it the I mean everything

2032
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,300
trajectory of it the I mean everything
 

2033
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,690
trajectory of it the I mean everything
I wonder what that trade out discussions

2034
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:38,700
I wonder what that trade out discussions
 

2035
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,190
I wonder what that trade out discussions
are like because you can't really

2036
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,200
are like because you can't really
 

2037
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,190
are like because you can't really
perfectly plan everything so and you

2038
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
perfectly plan everything so and you
 

2039
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,169
perfectly plan everything so and you
always have to have some

2040
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:45,179
always have to have some
 

2041
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,889
always have to have some
spare leeway on on you know especially

2042
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:48,899
spare leeway on on you know especially
 

2043
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,470
spare leeway on on you know especially
as you're testing new vehicles like

2044
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:51,480
as you're testing new vehicles like
 

2045
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,690
as you're testing new vehicles like
Starship yeah so Origins are important

2046
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:53,700
Starship yeah so Origins are important
 

2047
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,609
Starship yeah so Origins are important
yeah having having a margin given all

2048
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:55,619
yeah having having a margin given all
 

2049
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,530
yeah having having a margin given all
the uncertainty that's there yeah it's

2050
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:57,540
the uncertainty that's there yeah it's
 

2051
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,670
the uncertainty that's there yeah it's
really interesting like how they do

2052
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,680
really interesting like how they do
 

2053
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,630
really interesting like how they do
those kinds of trade-offs because

2054
00:34:59,630 --> 00:34:59,640
those kinds of trade-offs because
 

2055
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,490
those kinds of trade-offs because
they're also rapidly designing and

2056
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:01,500
they're also rapidly designing and
 

2057
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,270
they're also rapidly designing and
redesigning and re-engineering

2058
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,280
redesigning and re-engineering
 

2059
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,550
redesigning and re-engineering
and uh the ultimately you want to give

2060
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:07,560
and uh the ultimately you want to give
 

2061
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,109
and uh the ultimately you want to give
yourself the freedom to constantly

2062
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119
yourself the freedom to constantly
 

2063
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,270
yourself the freedom to constantly
innovate but then through the process of

2064
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
innovate but then through the process of
 

2065
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,349
innovate but then through the process of
testing

2066
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:12,359
testing
 

2067
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,450
testing
you solidify the thing that can be

2068
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,460
you solidify the thing that can be
 

2069
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,069
you solidify the thing that can be
relied upon especially if it's a crude

2070
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
relied upon especially if it's a crude
 

2071
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,829
relied upon especially if it's a crude
Mission yeah that how to do that in a

2072
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:18,839
Mission yeah that how to do that in a
 

2073
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,730
Mission yeah that how to do that in a
rapid cycle I I remember at some point

2074
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:21,740
rapid cycle I I remember at some point
 

2075
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,230
rapid cycle I I remember at some point
that NASA as they're leading up to

2076
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,240
that NASA as they're leading up to
 

2077
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,490
that NASA as they're leading up to
Flying humans for the first time for

2078
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:25,500
Flying humans for the first time for
 

2079
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,810
Flying humans for the first time for
NASA

2080
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:26,820
NASA
 

2081
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,310
NASA
um you know there's some talk that like

2082
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
um you know there's some talk that like
 

2083
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,170
um you know there's some talk that like
we're gonna do a design freeze because

2084
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,180
we're gonna do a design freeze because
 

2085
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,150
we're gonna do a design freeze because
SpaceX does evolve and iterate so

2086
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
SpaceX does evolve and iterate so
 

2087
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,010
SpaceX does evolve and iterate so
quickly you know they were saying that

2088
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,020
quickly you know they were saying that
 

2089
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,569
quickly you know they were saying that
it was leading because especially at the

2090
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:35,579
it was leading because especially at the
 

2091
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,210
it was leading because especially at the
time it was a mission called emo six and

2092
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,220
time it was a mission called emo six and
 

2093
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,950
time it was a mission called emo six and
they lost a rocket they've only lost two

2094
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:39,960
they lost a rocket they've only lost two
 

2095
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,770
they lost a rocket they've only lost two
rockets like ever really as far as um

2096
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:42,780
rockets like ever really as far as um
 

2097
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,569
rockets like ever really as far as um
you know trying to get something to

2098
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:44,579
you know trying to get something to
 

2099
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,630
you know trying to get something to
space for the Falcon 9 sorry

2100
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:47,640
space for the Falcon 9 sorry
 

2101
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,450
space for the Falcon 9 sorry
um and the second one ammo 6 I mean that

2102
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,460
um and the second one ammo 6 I mean that
 

2103
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,609
um and the second one ammo 6 I mean that
was back in 2016 so it's it's been a

2104
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:52,619
was back in 2016 so it's it's been a
 

2105
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,609
was back in 2016 so it's it's been a
long time and uh but at the time you

2106
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:55,619
long time and uh but at the time you
 

2107
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,829
long time and uh but at the time you
know they're looking at flying humans in

2108
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
know they're looking at flying humans in
 

2109
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,030
know they're looking at flying humans in
the near future

2110
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
the near future
 

2111
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,550
the near future
and it's like if you guys keep tweaking

2112
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:01,560
and it's like if you guys keep tweaking
 

2113
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,870
and it's like if you guys keep tweaking
this thing every time you take it out to

2114
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
this thing every time you take it out to
 

2115
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,670
this thing every time you take it out to
the pad really it's gonna be a problem

2116
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:04,680
the pad really it's gonna be a problem
 

2117
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,430
the pad really it's gonna be a problem
you know and so there's some pressure

2118
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
you know and so there's some pressure
 

2119
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,230
you know and so there's some pressure
from NASA to kind of slow down on that

2120
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,240
from NASA to kind of slow down on that
 

2121
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,609
from NASA to kind of slow down on that
iterative process

2122
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:10,619
iterative process
 

2123
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,250
iterative process
and uh but that is also why they were

2124
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,260
and uh but that is also why they were
 

2125
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,750
and uh but that is also why they were
able to evolve the Falcon 9 to be what

2126
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:14,760
able to evolve the Falcon 9 to be what
 

2127
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,550
able to evolve the Falcon 9 to be what
it is today is because they did just

2128
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
it is today is because they did just
 

2129
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,530
it is today is because they did just
evolve it so quickly literally like one

2130
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,540
evolve it so quickly literally like one
 

2131
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,329
evolve it so quickly literally like one
after another was never really the same

2132
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:20,339
after another was never really the same
 

2133
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,829
after another was never really the same
and we're definitely seeing that with

2134
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,839
and we're definitely seeing that with
 

2135
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,530
and we're definitely seeing that with
Starship now like it's

2136
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:23,540
Starship now like it's
 

2137
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,870
Starship now like it's
evolves so quickly that you just can't

2138
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
evolves so quickly that you just can't
 

2139
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,550
evolves so quickly that you just can't
even keep up with it you know so there's

2140
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
even keep up with it you know so there's
 

2141
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,770
even keep up with it you know so there's
a fascinating culture uh Clash there

2142
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:30,780
a fascinating culture uh Clash there
 

2143
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,990
a fascinating culture uh Clash there
have you just in observing and

2144
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,000
have you just in observing and
 

2145
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,510
have you just in observing and
interacting with NASA folks seen them

2146
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
interacting with NASA folks seen them
 

2147
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,609
interacting with NASA folks seen them
sort of grow and change and evolve

2148
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:37,619
sort of grow and change and evolve
 

2149
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,950
sort of grow and change and evolve
themselves sort of inspired by this new

2150
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:39,960
themselves sort of inspired by this new
 

2151
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,450
themselves sort of inspired by this new
development in commercial space flight

2152
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:41,460
development in commercial space flight
 

2153
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,910
development in commercial space flight
oh yeah yeah there's a lot of especially

2154
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
oh yeah yeah there's a lot of especially
 

2155
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,770
oh yeah yeah there's a lot of especially
like around dm2 there's a lot of talks

2156
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:45,780
like around dm2 there's a lot of talks
 

2157
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,150
like around dm2 there's a lot of talks
in the press conferences and stuff where

2158
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,160
in the press conferences and stuff where
 

2159
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,910
in the press conferences and stuff where
you'd hear people say you know this was

2160
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
you'd hear people say you know this was
 

2161
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,290
you'd hear people say you know this was
a big this is well outside of our

2162
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,300
a big this is well outside of our
 

2163
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,150
a big this is well outside of our
comfort zone to work with SpaceX in this

2164
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,160
comfort zone to work with SpaceX in this
 

2165
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,410
comfort zone to work with SpaceX in this
manner because we're we take this

2166
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,420
manner because we're we take this
 

2167
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,690
manner because we're we take this
approach to things where X Y and Z in

2168
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,700
approach to things where X Y and Z in
 

2169
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,950
approach to things where X Y and Z in
this in this way the way we normally

2170
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:57,960
this in this way the way we normally
 

2171
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,349
this in this way the way we normally
certify things and we're not used to

2172
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:00,359
certify things and we're not used to
 

2173
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,750
certify things and we're not used to
SpaceX like well let's just try it you

2174
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:02,760
SpaceX like well let's just try it you
 

2175
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,510
SpaceX like well let's just try it you
know like and and do something you know

2176
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
know like and and do something you know
 

2177
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,730
know like and and do something you know
to a point and so they they said it

2178
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:07,740
to a point and so they they said it
 

2179
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,290
to a point and so they they said it
ended up being fantastic they loved

2180
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,300
ended up being fantastic they loved
 

2181
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,550
ended up being fantastic they loved
working that way because it was just

2182
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
working that way because it was just
 

2183
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,190
working that way because it was just
less paperwork almost and more just do

2184
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
less paperwork almost and more just do
 

2185
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,750
less paperwork almost and more just do
and

2186
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:14,760
and
 

2187
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,970
and
um and but at the same time SpaceX I

2188
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:16,980
um and but at the same time SpaceX I
 

2189
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,470
um and but at the same time SpaceX I
think even expressed I don't remember if

2190
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
think even expressed I don't remember if
 

2191
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,970
think even expressed I don't remember if
it was Hans koenigsman or someone in a

2192
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:19,980
it was Hans koenigsman or someone in a
 

2193
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,349
it was Hans koenigsman or someone in a
press conference said well we really

2194
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
press conference said well we really
 

2195
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,550
press conference said well we really
liked having someone just double check

2196
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
liked having someone just double check
 

2197
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,870
liked having someone just double check
us so that we're not doing something

2198
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:23,880
us so that we're not doing something
 

2199
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,550
us so that we're not doing something
super stupid right before we test

2200
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,560
super stupid right before we test
 

2201
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,930
super stupid right before we test
something you know

2202
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:26,940
something you know
 

2203
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,310
something you know
um so there was a cool collaboration

2204
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
um so there was a cool collaboration
 

2205
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,530
um so there was a cool collaboration
because it is uh two very different

2206
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:30,540
because it is uh two very different
 

2207
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,109
because it is uh two very different
philosophies of uh of development and

2208
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
philosophies of uh of development and
 

2209
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,150
philosophies of uh of development and
managing you know space programs I

2210
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,160
managing you know space programs I
 

2211
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,470
managing you know space programs I
wanted to talk to you a lot about

2212
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
wanted to talk to you a lot about
 

2213
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,030
wanted to talk to you a lot about
engines

2214
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,040
engines
 

2215
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,370
engines
and maybe about Starship and maybe about

2216
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:40,380
and maybe about Starship and maybe about
 

2217
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,010
and maybe about Starship and maybe about
your own becoming an actual astronaut

2218
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,020
your own becoming an actual astronaut
 

2219
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,770
your own becoming an actual astronaut
but like let's just go there uh before

2220
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:45,780
but like let's just go there uh before
 

2221
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,069
but like let's just go there uh before
all that and and talk about the actual

2222
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:49,079
all that and and talk about the actual
 

2223
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,710
all that and and talk about the actual
culture of SpaceX and uh your

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:51,720
culture of SpaceX and uh your
 

2225
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,349
culture of SpaceX and uh your
conversations with uh Elon you've toured

2226
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:54,359
conversations with uh Elon you've toured
 

2227
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,510
conversations with uh Elon you've toured
SpaceX facilities with him you've

2228
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:56,520
SpaceX facilities with him you've
 

2229
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,010
SpaceX facilities with him you've
interviewed him you've interacted with

2230
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,020
interviewed him you've interacted with
 

2231
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,390
interviewed him you've interacted with
him

2232
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,400
him
 

2233
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,550
him
uh what have you learned about Rockets

2234
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,560
uh what have you learned about Rockets
 

2235
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,349
uh what have you learned about Rockets
about propulsion about engineering about

2236
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
about propulsion about engineering about
 

2237
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,450
about propulsion about engineering about
design about life from those

2238
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:05,460
design about life from those
 

2239
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,849
design about life from those
interactions he's pretty transparent

2240
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:07,859
interactions he's pretty transparent
 

2241
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:12,170
interactions he's pretty transparent
open human being as an engineer as a as

2242
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,180
open human being as an engineer as a as
 

2243
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,270
open human being as an engineer as a as
a leader as a person

2244
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,280
a leader as a person
 

2245
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,589
a leader as a person
I would definitely say the biggest

2246
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:15,599
I would definitely say the biggest
 

2247
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,589
I would definitely say the biggest
takeaway I've had from my times with

2248
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:18,599
takeaway I've had from my times with
 

2249
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,810
takeaway I've had from my times with
Elon at SpaceX is

2250
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:20,820
Elon at SpaceX is
 

2251
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,030
Elon at SpaceX is
real like the the idea of questionnaire

2252
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
real like the the idea of questionnaire
 

2253
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,550
real like the the idea of questionnaire
constraints he says that a lot but he

2254
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,560
constraints he says that a lot but he
 

2255
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,510
constraints he says that a lot but he
also does it a lot like he though you

2256
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
also does it a lot like he though you
 

2257
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,550
also does it a lot like he though you
know there'll be times where like

2258
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:31,560
know there'll be times where like
 

2259
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,349
know there'll be times where like
you'll see him change on a dime because

2260
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
you'll see him change on a dime because
 

2261
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,270
you'll see him change on a dime because
he's like rethinking of something in a

2262
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
he's like rethinking of something in a
 

2263
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,609
he's like rethinking of something in a
newer different way and for me you know

2264
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:37,619
newer different way and for me you know
 

2265
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,650
newer different way and for me you know
I I think we all put constraints on

2266
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:39,660
I I think we all put constraints on
 

2267
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,870
I I think we all put constraints on
ourselves we think about our own limits

2268
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:41,880
ourselves we think about our own limits
 

2269
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,550
ourselves we think about our own limits
you know on

2270
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:43,560
you know on
 

2271
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,710
you know on
on things that we can or cannot do and I

2272
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:45,720
on things that we can or cannot do and I
 

2273
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,569
on things that we can or cannot do and I
think it's made me kind of question like

2274
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:47,579
think it's made me kind of question like
 

2275
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,690
think it's made me kind of question like
well why am I why did I say no I can't

2276
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:50,700
well why am I why did I say no I can't
 

2277
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,630
well why am I why did I say no I can't
do that or you know uh you know just off

2278
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
do that or you know uh you know just off
 

2279
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,170
do that or you know uh you know just off
the top of my head a good example uh I

2280
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,180
the top of my head a good example uh I
 

2281
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,170
the top of my head a good example uh I
so in Iowa I live in Iowa or half the

2282
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,180
so in Iowa I live in Iowa or half the
 

2283
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,150
so in Iowa I live in Iowa or half the
time or whatever and uh there's a bike

2284
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
time or whatever and uh there's a bike
 

2285
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,410
time or whatever and uh there's a bike
right across the state of Iowa called

2286
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:03,420
right across the state of Iowa called
 

2287
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,870
right across the state of Iowa called
Ragbrai and every year you just you know

2288
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:05,880
Ragbrai and every year you just you know
 

2289
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,190
Ragbrai and every year you just you know
like thousands of people get together

2290
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
like thousands of people get together
 

2291
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,010
like thousands of people get together
and they they ride across Iowa and it

2292
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,020
and they they ride across Iowa and it
 

2293
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,230
and they they ride across Iowa and it
was last summer I met up with some

2294
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
was last summer I met up with some
 

2295
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,190
was last summer I met up with some
friends and like hey you want to go on

2296
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
friends and like hey you want to go on
 

2297
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,569
friends and like hey you want to go on
rag bar this year I'm like it's like a

2298
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:14,579
rag bar this year I'm like it's like a
 

2299
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,250
rag bar this year I'm like it's like a
week away they're like yeah you want to

2300
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:16,260
week away they're like yeah you want to
 

2301
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,250
week away they're like yeah you want to
go I'm like yeah and so I did without

2302
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:19,260
go I'm like yeah and so I did without
 

2303
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,990
go I'm like yeah and so I did without
and it was one of those moments where I

2304
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,000
and it was one of those moments where I
 

2305
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,370
and it was one of those moments where I
was proud of myself because like I it's

2306
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:22,380
was proud of myself because like I it's
 

2307
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,650
was proud of myself because like I it's
easy to just be like no you know I'm not

2308
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:24,660
easy to just be like no you know I'm not
 

2309
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,569
easy to just be like no you know I'm not
ready or this is my constraint is like

2310
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:26,579
ready or this is my constraint is like
 

2311
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,970
ready or this is my constraint is like
I'm not in shape but like just question

2312
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:28,980
I'm not in shape but like just question
 

2313
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,010
I'm not in shape but like just question
that you know and and so I think when it

2314
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,020
that you know and and so I think when it
 

2315
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,150
that you know and and so I think when it
comes down to questioning your own

2316
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
comes down to questioning your own
 

2317
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,069
comes down to questioning your own
constraints it's yes even to that level

2318
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
constraints it's yes even to that level
 

2319
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,810
constraints it's yes even to that level
like why do you question yourself on

2320
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:35,820
like why do you question yourself on
 

2321
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,030
like why do you question yourself on
what you can and cannot do so that's for

2322
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,040
what you can and cannot do so that's for
 

2323
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,530
what you can and cannot do so that's for
your personal life is really powerful

2324
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:39,540
your personal life is really powerful
 

2325
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,810
your personal life is really powerful
but a little bit more intuitive I think

2326
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:41,820
but a little bit more intuitive I think
 

2327
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,970
but a little bit more intuitive I think
what's really hard is to question

2328
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:43,980
what's really hard is to question
 

2329
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,849
what's really hard is to question
constraints in a place like Aeronautics

2330
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:46,859
constraints in a place like Aeronautics
 

2331
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:51,589
constraints in a place like Aeronautics
or or robotics or autonomous vehicles or

2332
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:51,599
or or robotics or autonomous vehicles or
 

2333
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,810
or or robotics or autonomous vehicles or
Vehicles because there's

2334
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:53,820
Vehicles because there's
 

2335
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,510
Vehicles because there's
people there's experts everywhere that

2336
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:56,520
people there's experts everywhere that
 

2337
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,670
people there's experts everywhere that
have done it for decades and everyone

2338
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:58,680
have done it for decades and everyone
 

2339
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,890
have done it for decades and everyone
admires those experts and respects those

2340
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:00,900
admires those experts and respects those
 

2341
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,990
admires those experts and respects those
experts and you for you to step into a

2342
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,000
experts and you for you to step into a
 

2343
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,530
experts and you for you to step into a
room and knowing not much more than just

2344
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:06,540
room and knowing not much more than just
 

2345
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,710
room and knowing not much more than just
uh what's in a Wikipedia article yeah

2346
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:09,720
uh what's in a Wikipedia article yeah
 

2347
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,530
uh what's in a Wikipedia article yeah
and to just use your intuition and first

2348
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:12,540
and to just use your intuition and first
 

2349

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:14,700
principles thinking to disagree with the
 

2351
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,109

experts that takes uh that takes some uh
 

2353
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,270
experts that takes uh that takes some uh
guts I think well you can't have

2354
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:20,280
guts I think well you can't have
 

2355
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,589
guts I think well you can't have
everyone doing that either you know like

2356
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
everyone doing that either you know like
 

2357
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,810
everyone doing that either you know like
there has to be some humility of knowing

2358
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:23,820
there has to be some humility of knowing
 

2359
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,930
there has to be some humility of knowing
that something is a hardened concept and

2360
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:26,940
that something is a hardened concept and
 

2361
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,430
that something is a hardened concept and
a hard you know like especially I'm not

2362
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:28,440
a hard you know like especially I'm not
 

2363
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,290
a hard you know like especially I'm not
an engineer I don't I don't do this

2364
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,300
an engineer I don't I don't do this
 

2365
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,569
an engineer I don't I don't do this
stuff you know but I can imagine you

2366
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:32,579
stuff you know but I can imagine you
 

2367
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,430
stuff you know but I can imagine you
sitting there having spent six years on

2368
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:34,440
sitting there having spent six years on

crowdog propellants or whatever and

2372
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,280
crowdog propellants or whatever and
 

2373
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,950
crowdog propellants or whatever and
someone walks in and says why don't you

2374
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:39,960
someone walks in and says why don't you
 

2375
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,210
someone walks in and says why don't you
put a heater element in there you know

2376
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:41,220
put a heater element in there you know
 

2377
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,349
put a heater element in there you know
or something that's you know something

2378
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:42,359
or something that's you know something
 

2379
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,930
or something that's you know something
like because probably you know we've

2380
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:44,940
like because probably you know we've
 

2381
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,670
like because probably you know we've
done that 40 times whatever whatever you

2382
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:46,680
done that 40 times whatever whatever you
 

2383
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,250
done that 40 times whatever whatever you
know like I'm sure there are things like

2384
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:49,260
know like I'm sure there are things like
 

2385
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,730
know like I'm sure there are things like
that that are very frustrating but but I

2386
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:52,740
that that are very frustrating but but I
 

2387
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,410
that that are very frustrating but but I
know what that's like you know the thing

2388
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:54,420
know what that's like you know the thing
 

2389
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,030
know what that's like you know the thing
is with the experts they're always going

2390
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,040
is with the experts they're always going
 

2391
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,410
is with the experts they're always going
to be frustrated

2392
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:57,420
to be frustrated
 

2393
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,450
to be frustrated
when the Newbie comes in with their

2394
00:40:59,450 --> 00:40:59,460
when the Newbie comes in with their
 

2395
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,790
when the Newbie comes in with their
first principles thinking but sometimes

2396
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:01,800
first principles thinking but sometimes
 

2397
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,530
first principles thinking but sometimes
that frustration is Justified and

2398
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:03,540
that frustration is Justified and
 

2399
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,510
that frustration is Justified and
sometimes it's not sometimes just

2400
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
sometimes it's not sometimes just
 

2401
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,030
sometimes it's not sometimes just
stubbornness for failing to acknowledge

2402
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,040
stubbornness for failing to acknowledge
 

2403
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,950
stubbornness for failing to acknowledge
a better way and I've seen it both

2404
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:09,960
a better way and I've seen it both
 

2405
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,329
a better way and I've seen it both
directions so which is really

2406
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:11,339
directions so which is really
 

2407
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,130
directions so which is really
interesting so you need you need both

2408
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:13,140
interesting so you need you need both
 

2409
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,810
interesting so you need you need both
but that tension is always going to be

2410
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:14,820
but that tension is always going to be
 

2411
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,210
but that tension is always going to be
there and there has to be a almost like

2412
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:17,220
there and there has to be a almost like
 

2413
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,390
there and there has to be a almost like
a dictatorial imperative that breaks

2414
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
a dictatorial imperative that breaks
 

2415
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,030
a dictatorial imperative that breaks
through the the expertise of the way

2416
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
through the the expertise of the way
 

2417
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,829
through the the expertise of the way
things have been been done in the past

2418
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:24,839
things have been been done in the past
 

2419
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,990
things have been been done in the past
to push forward like a new way of doing

2420
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,000
to push forward like a new way of doing
 

2421
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,170
to push forward like a new way of doing
it and elon's done that um I've seen a

2422
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:30,180
it and elon's done that um I've seen a
 

2423
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,930
it and elon's done that um I've seen a
lot of great Engineers uh do that in the

2424
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:32,940
lot of great Engineers uh do that in the
 

2425
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,849
lot of great Engineers uh do that in the
Machining machine learning world because

2426
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:34,859
Machining machine learning world because
 

2427
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,829
Machining machine learning world because
there's been so much Development I've

2428
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:36,839
there's been so much Development I've
 

2429
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,210
there's been so much Development I've
seen that happen usually when there's

2430
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:38,220
seen that happen usually when there's
 

2431
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,609
seen that happen usually when there's
like rapid development that starts to

2432
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:40,619
like rapid development that starts to
 

2433
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,030
like rapid development that starts to
come into play yeah and yeah and I've

2434
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,040
come into play yeah and yeah and I've
 

2435
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,030
come into play yeah and yeah and I've
seen that autonomous vehicle space

2436
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,040
seen that autonomous vehicle space
 

2437
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,290
seen that autonomous vehicle space
bringing computer interfaces that Elon

2438
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,300
bringing computer interfaces that Elon
 

2439
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,329
bringing computer interfaces that Elon
has evolved with all of it it's kind of

2440
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:50,339
has evolved with all of it it's kind of
 

2441
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:51,770
has evolved with all of it it's kind of
fascinating to watch

2442
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:51,780
fascinating to watch
 

2443
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,390
fascinating to watch
um what about the actual design and

2444
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:53,400
um what about the actual design and
 

2445
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,130
um what about the actual design and
Engineering of the engine since you've

2446
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,140
Engineering of the engine since you've
 

2447
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,950
Engineering of the engine since you've
learned about so many different kinds of

2448
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:57,960
learned about so many different kinds of
 

2449
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,890
learned about so many different kinds of
engines over the past few years

2450
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:00,900
engines over the past few years
 

2451
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,750
engines over the past few years
just like what stands out to you about

2452
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:02,760
just like what stands out to you about
 

2453
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,970
just like what stands out to you about
the way that engineering is done at

2454
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:04,980
the way that engineering is done at
 

2455
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,290
the way that engineering is done at
SpaceX or that Elon does engineering the

2456
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:09,300
SpaceX or that Elon does engineering the
 

2457
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,970
SpaceX or that Elon does engineering the
hardest thing to

2458
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:10,980
hardest thing to
 

2459
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,370
hardest thing to
kind of remember is like how much stuff

2460
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:13,380
kind of remember is like how much stuff
 

2461
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,069
kind of remember is like how much stuff
was developed in the 50s and 60s you

2462
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079
was developed in the 50s and 60s you
 

2463
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,870
was developed in the 50s and 60s you
know the the concepts finally being

2464
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:17,880
know the the concepts finally being
 

2465
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,089
know the the concepts finally being
utilized today were already literally

2466
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:20,099
utilized today were already literally
 

2467
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,130
utilized today were already literally
done in the 60s yeah you know so a lot

2468
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,140
done in the 60s yeah you know so a lot
 

2469
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,050
done in the 60s yeah you know so a lot
of the things that SpaceX is doing isn't

2470
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,060
of the things that SpaceX is doing isn't
 

2471
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,109
of the things that SpaceX is doing isn't
a novel concept per se you know they're

2472
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
a novel concept per se you know they're
 

2473
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,730
a novel concept per se you know they're
like for instance the Raptor engine

2474
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:28,740
like for instance the Raptor engine
 

2475
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,250
like for instance the Raptor engine
utilizes the full flow stage combustion

2476
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,260
utilizes the full flow stage combustion
 

2477
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,270
utilizes the full flow stage combustion
cycle engine

2478
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,280
cycle engine
 

2479
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,370
cycle engine
and that was already developed by the

2480
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,380
and that was already developed by the
 

2481
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,650
and that was already developed by the
Soviets in the 60s for an engine called

2482
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:36,660
Soviets in the 60s for an engine called
 

2483
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,430
Soviets in the 60s for an engine called
the rd270 and it's makes sense like on

2484
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,440
the rd270 and it's makes sense like on
 

2485
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,829
the rd270 and it's makes sense like on
paper 100 it makes sense because you're

2486
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
paper 100 it makes sense because you're
 

2487
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,050
paper 100 it makes sense because you're
basically extracting the absolute

2488
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,060
basically extracting the absolute
 

2489
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,430
basically extracting the absolute
maximum

2490
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:46,440
maximum
 

2491
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,790
maximum
potential of the chemical energy in both

2492
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:49,800
potential of the chemical energy in both
 

2493
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,870
potential of the chemical energy in both
propellants

2494
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
propellants
 

2495
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,150
propellants
and you know at the at the end of the

2496
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,160
and you know at the at the end of the
 

2497
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,770
and you know at the at the end of the
day like you have to be dumb enough to

2498
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:54,780
day like you have to be dumb enough to
 

2499
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,030
day like you have to be dumb enough to
say we're going to try using this thing

2500
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,040
say we're going to try using this thing
 

2501
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,829
say we're going to try using this thing
because it's actually really complicated

2502
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
because it's actually really complicated
 

2503
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,109
because it's actually really complicated
to to do what they're doing but at the

2504
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:00,119
to to do what they're doing but at the
 

2505
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,790
to to do what they're doing but at the
same time like sore so are Rockets like

2506
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:01,800
same time like sore so are Rockets like
 

2507
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,170
same time like sore so are Rockets like
rocket engines are already stupid

2508
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,180
rocket engines are already stupid
 

2509
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,230
rocket engines are already stupid
complicated so adding you know 10 20

2510
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
complicated so adding you know 10 20
 

2511
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,750
complicated so adding you know 10 20
more you know pain in the butt during

2512
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:08,760
more you know pain in the butt during
 

2513
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,230
more you know pain in the butt during
the r d if it's you know in the long

2514
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
the r d if it's you know in the long
 

2515
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,329
the r d if it's you know in the long
long long 20 30 year existence or

2516
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:14,339
long long 20 30 year existence or
 

2517
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,829
long long 20 30 year existence or
whatever you know like future of that

2518
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
whatever you know like future of that
 

2519
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,510
whatever you know like future of that
engine is that going to be worth it

2520
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
engine is that going to be worth it
 

2521
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,849
engine is that going to be worth it
obviously SpaceX said yeah I think we

2522
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:19,859
obviously SpaceX said yeah I think we
 

2523
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,589
obviously SpaceX said yeah I think we
can actually develop this this Raptor

2524
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
can actually develop this this Raptor
 

2525
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,809
can actually develop this this Raptor
engine so it's just interesting to see

2526
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:23,819
engine so it's just interesting to see
 

2527
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:25,670
engine so it's just interesting to see
the things that have been looked at or

2528
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
the things that have been looked at or
 

2529
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,230
the things that have been looked at or
even reusability you know like the space

2530
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,240
even reusability you know like the space
 

2531
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,710
even reusability you know like the space
shuttle was reusable it was fully uh the

2532
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:30,720
shuttle was reusable it was fully uh the
 

2533
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,329
shuttle was reusable it was fully uh the
upper stage you know the shuttle itself

2534
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:32,339
upper stage you know the shuttle itself
 

2535
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,430
upper stage you know the shuttle itself
the Orbiter was you know I mean that

2536
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:34,440
the Orbiter was you know I mean that
 

2537
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,589
the Orbiter was you know I mean that
thing was for all intents and purposes a

2538
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:36,599
thing was for all intents and purposes a
 

2539
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,089
thing was for all intents and purposes a
reusable rocket

2540
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:38,099
reusable rocket
 

2541
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,010
reusable rocket
now did it live up to its expectations

2542
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:40,020
now did it live up to its expectations
 

2543
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,490
now did it live up to its expectations
not necessarily so it left a lot of bad

2544
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:43,500
not necessarily so it left a lot of bad
 

2545
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,829
not necessarily so it left a lot of bad
taste in people's mouth on the the ideas

2546
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
taste in people's mouth on the the ideas
 

2547
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,050
taste in people's mouth on the the ideas
of reusability so for SpaceX to kind of

2548
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,060
of reusability so for SpaceX to kind of
 

2549
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,250
of reusability so for SpaceX to kind of
come back into the room and on the table

2550
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:49,260
come back into the room and on the table
 

2551
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,050
come back into the room and on the table
and say we're going to use the reusable

2552
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,060
and say we're going to use the reusable
 

2553
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,730
and say we're going to use the reusable
rocket specifically we're going to do a

2554
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:52,740
rocket specifically we're going to do a
 

2555
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,870
rocket specifically we're going to do a
fully reasonable rocket you know a lot

2556
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
fully reasonable rocket you know a lot
 

2557
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,490
fully reasonable rocket you know a lot
of people are even still the day a lot

2558
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:55,500
of people are even still the day a lot
 

2559
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,470
of people are even still the day a lot
of people going

2560
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
of people going
 

2561
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,150
of people going
yeah you're not gonna be able to do that

2562
00:43:59,150 --> 00:43:59,160
yeah you're not gonna be able to do that
 

2563
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,030
yeah you're not gonna be able to do that
even today even today so like long term

2564
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,040
even today even today so like long term
 

2565
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,010
even today even today so like long term
you're not gonna be able to reuse a

2566
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,020
you're not gonna be able to reuse a
 

2567
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,630
you're not gonna be able to reuse a
scale

2568
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:05,640
scale
 

2569
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,630
scale
yeah but yeah definitely I think the

2570
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
yeah but yeah definitely I think the
 

2571
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,950
yeah but yeah definitely I think the
number of people that are saying that

2572
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:09,960
number of people that are saying that
 

2573
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,770
number of people that are saying that
today is is a small portion of those

2574
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:12,780
today is is a small portion of those
 

2575
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,210
today is is a small portion of those
that were saying that type of thing five

2576
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,220
that were saying that type of thing five
 

2577
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,770
that were saying that type of thing five
years ago you know when Elon did that

2578
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:15,780
years ago you know when Elon did that
 

2579
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,050
years ago you know when Elon did that
announcement in 2016

2580
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:18,060
announcement in 2016
 

2581
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,990
announcement in 2016
um for the its it was very very

2582
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,000
um for the its it was very very
 

2583
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,790
um for the its it was very very
aspirational and people were just like

2584
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
aspirational and people were just like
 

2585
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,950
aspirational and people were just like
yeah right you know and there's a large

2586
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
yeah right you know and there's a large
 

2587
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,349
yeah right you know and there's a large
number of people that had the factual

2588
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
number of people that had the factual
 

2589
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,870
number of people that had the factual
reasons to to think that and do that you

2590
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:29,880
reasons to to think that and do that you
 

2591
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,370
reasons to to think that and do that you
know um at the time they'd only landed

2592
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:31,380
know um at the time they'd only landed
 

2593
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,630
know um at the time they'd only landed
like two Rockets or something you know

2594
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
like two Rockets or something you know
 

2595
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,490
like two Rockets or something you know
when they did that or maybe three it was

2596
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:34,500
when they did that or maybe three it was
 

2597
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,230
when they did that or maybe three it was
a very small number uh when they

2598
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
a very small number uh when they
 

2599
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,309
a very small number uh when they
announced that actually they had just

2600
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:37,319
announced that actually they had just
 

2601
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,230
announced that actually they had just
lost a couple months prior they just

2602
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:39,240
lost a couple months prior they just
 

2603
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,809
lost a couple months prior they just
lost mo6 so they like they were still

2604
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:41,819
lost mo6 so they like they were still
 

2605
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,370
lost mo6 so they like they were still
this young blossoming company and they

2606
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:43,380
this young blossoming company and they
 

2607
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,390
this young blossoming company and they
come in and be like we figured out

2608
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
come in and be like we figured out
 

2609
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,370
come in and be like we figured out
reusability and now we're gonna go full

2610
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:46,380
reusability and now we're gonna go full
 

2611
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,510
reusability and now we're gonna go full
scale make the world's biggest most

2612
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
scale make the world's biggest most
 

2613
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,849
scale make the world's biggest most
heaviest most powerful rocket ever and

2614
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:49,859
heaviest most powerful rocket ever and
 

2615
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,530
heaviest most powerful rocket ever and
we're going to fully reuse it and it's

2616
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:51,540
we're going to fully reuse it and it's
 

2617
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,170
we're going to fully reuse it and it's
gonna go to Mars but it's just pretty

2618
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,180
gonna go to Mars but it's just pretty
 

2619
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,050
gonna go to Mars but it's just pretty
out there like it really was and yeah

2620
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:57,060
out there like it really was and yeah
 

2621
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,910
out there like it really was and yeah
you know it's all about perspective but

2622
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:58,920
you know it's all about perspective but
 

2623
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,609
you know it's all about perspective but
now again we're coming up on 100

2624
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:00,619
now again we're coming up on 100
 

2625
00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:03,770
now again we're coming up on 100
consecutive Landings of an orbital class

2626
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:03,780
consecutive Landings of an orbital class
 

2627
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,230
consecutive Landings of an orbital class
rocket that's you know 45 meters tall

2628
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
rocket that's you know 45 meters tall
 

2629
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,270
rocket that's you know 45 meters tall
3.7 meters wide like this thing is huge

2630
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,280
3.7 meters wide like this thing is huge
 

2631
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,210
3.7 meters wide like this thing is huge
weighs 20 metric tons even empty when

2632
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,220
weighs 20 metric tons even empty when
 

2633
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,730
weighs 20 metric tons even empty when
it's Landing that thing's already huge

2634
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:13,740
it's Landing that thing's already huge
 

2635
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,230
it's Landing that thing's already huge
so seeing the success of that I think

2636
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,240
so seeing the success of that I think
 

2637
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,510
so seeing the success of that I think
people are now more like well okay maybe

2638
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
people are now more like well okay maybe
 

2639
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,130
people are now more like well okay maybe
maybe there is actually

2640
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:19,140
maybe there is actually
 

2641
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,990
maybe there is actually
the opportunity to be fully reusable

2642
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,000
the opportunity to be fully reusable
 

2643
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,030
the opportunity to be fully reusable
that's definitely probably the biggest

2644
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,040
that's definitely probably the biggest
 

2645
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,750
that's definitely probably the biggest
constraint that I think has been

2646
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
constraint that I think has been
 

2647
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,990
constraint that I think has been
questioned that is yep and then of

2648
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:27,000
questioned that is yep and then of
 

2649
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,609
questioned that is yep and then of
course like the broader one of cost of

2650
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:28,619
course like the broader one of cost of
 

2651
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,650
course like the broader one of cost of
bringing down costs uh

2652
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:30,660
bringing down costs uh
 

2653
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,930
bringing down costs uh
that he's able to you're able to kind of

2654
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:32,940
that he's able to you're able to kind of
 

2655
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,870
that he's able to you're able to kind of
bring down costs so much the this

2656
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:35,880
bring down costs so much the this
 

2657
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,690
bring down costs so much the this
something like colonizing Mars our many

2658
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:38,700
something like colonizing Mars our many
 

2659
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,250
something like colonizing Mars our many
trips to Mars will be a possibility

2660
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:40,260
trips to Mars will be a possibility
 

2661
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,829
trips to Mars will be a possibility
because yeah people don't even it seems

2662
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
because yeah people don't even it seems
 

2663
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,410
because yeah people don't even it seems
so far out that they don't even have

2664
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:45,420
so far out that they don't even have
 

2665
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,750
so far out that they don't even have
time or give effort to questioning it

2666
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
time or give effort to questioning it
 

2667
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,790
time or give effort to questioning it
yeah but it's the implied questioning

2668
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:49,800
yeah but it's the implied questioning
 

2669
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,730
yeah but it's the implied questioning
can you really do that many launches

2670
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:52,740
can you really do that many launches
 

2671
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,010
can you really do that many launches
actually do it can you actually do it

2672
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:55,020
actually do it can you actually do it
 

2673
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,390
actually do it can you actually do it
yeah it's looking I think it's one of

2674
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:56,400
yeah it's looking I think it's one of
 

2675
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,530
yeah it's looking I think it's one of
those things where you look at the curve

2676
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:57,540
those things where you look at the curve
 

2677
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,750
those things where you look at the curve
you know you look at like 10 years ago

2678
00:45:59,750 --> 00:45:59,760
you know you look at like 10 years ago
 

2679
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,390
you know you look at like 10 years ago
that was ridiculous yeah following this

2680
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
that was ridiculous yeah following this
 

2681
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,490
that was ridiculous yeah following this
curve if SpaceX goes from you know two

2682
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:04,500
curve if SpaceX goes from you know two
 

2683
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,930
curve if SpaceX goes from you know two
years ago launching I don't remember

2684
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:05,940
years ago launching I don't remember
 

2685
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,910
years ago launching I don't remember
what it was 40 times to 60 times to 100

2686
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
what it was 40 times to 60 times to 100
 

2687
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,670
what it was 40 times to 60 times to 100
times this year is there is there amount

2688
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:10,680
times this year is there is there amount
 

2689
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,710
times this year is there is there amount
and if we just keep extrapolating that

2690
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
and if we just keep extrapolating that
 

2691
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,050
and if we just keep extrapolating that
out if they maybe not that exponential

2692
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,060
out if they maybe not that exponential
 

2693
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,150
out if they maybe not that exponential
maybe it goes more linear or whatever

2694
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,160
maybe it goes more linear or whatever
 

2695
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,730
maybe it goes more linear or whatever
what's 20 30 years like the amount of

2696
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:19,740
what's 20 30 years like the amount of
 

2697
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,470
what's 20 30 years like the amount of
stuff we can put on orbit and and the

2698
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:21,480
stuff we can put on orbit and and the
 

2699
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,210
stuff we can put on orbit and and the
potential we have to do things like

2700
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:23,220
potential we have to do things like
 

2701
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,190
potential we have to do things like
absolutely now I don't want to put a

2702
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
absolutely now I don't want to put a
 

2703
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,230
absolutely now I don't want to put a
time frame like you know yeah I think

2704
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:27,240
time frame like you know yeah I think
 

2705
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,870
time frame like you know yeah I think
but you gotta think it's it we're

2706
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:29,880
but you gotta think it's it we're
 

2707
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,309
but you gotta think it's it we're
increasingly number of launches we're

2708
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:31,319
increasingly number of launches we're
 

2709
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,990
increasingly number of launches we're
increasing the amount of things in space

2710
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,000
increasing the amount of things in space
 

2711
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,190
increasing the amount of things in space
we're increasing the amount of payload

2712
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:34,200
we're increasing the amount of payload
 

2713
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,109
we're increasing the amount of payload
on orbit that's probably not going to

2714
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:36,119
on orbit that's probably not going to
 

2715
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,349
on orbit that's probably not going to
decrease anytime soon and therefore

2716
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:39,359
decrease anytime soon and therefore
 

2717
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,390
decrease anytime soon and therefore
eventually like the idea of going to

2718
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:41,400
eventually like the idea of going to
 

2719
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,450
eventually like the idea of going to
Mars is absolutely reasonable let me ask

2720
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:44,460
Mars is absolutely reasonable let me ask
 

2721
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,370
Mars is absolutely reasonable let me ask
a difficult question that needs to be

2722
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:46,380
a difficult question that needs to be
 

2723
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,990
a difficult question that needs to be
asked here

2724
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
asked here
 

2725
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,130
asked here
can SpaceX continue uh its successes

2726
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:52,140
can SpaceX continue uh its successes
 

2727
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,809
can SpaceX continue uh its successes
without Elon

2728

this long-term Mission to Mars

2730
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:57,420
this long-term Mission to Mars
 

2731
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,109
this long-term Mission to Mars
I I think the discussion about Tesla and

2732
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:00,119
I I think the discussion about Tesla and
 

2733
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,050
I I think the discussion about Tesla and
autopilot or Robotics are in your link

2734
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,060
autopilot or Robotics are in your link
 

2735
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,390

with main computer interfaces is a

2736
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:05,400
with main computer interfaces is a
 

2737
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,730
with main computer interfaces is a
question wholly separate from the SpaceX

2738
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:07,740
question wholly separate from the SpaceX
 

2739
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,670
question wholly separate from the SpaceX
question because there's a lot of other

2740
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:10,680
question because there's a lot of other
 

2741

2745
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,809

um some different but amazing

um some different but amazing
 

2747
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,690

2754
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
design and electric vehicles there's a
 

2755
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,450

lot of people that are doing incredible

2756
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:29,460
lot of people that are doing incredible
 

2757
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,270
lot of people that are doing incredible
brain computer interfaces but while

2758
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,280
brain computer interfaces but while
 

2759
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,130
brain computer interfaces but while
there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX

2760
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:34,140
there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX
 

2761
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,510
there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX
and we'll talk about many of them

2762
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
and we'll talk about many of them
 

2763
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,670
and we'll talk about many of them
they're doing amazing work it seems like

2764
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
they're doing amazing work it seems like
 

2765
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,490
they're doing amazing work it seems like
he's really driving progress here over

2766
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:40,500
he's really driving progress here over
 

2767
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,470
he's really driving progress here over
the past 10 years what do you think

2768
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
the past 10 years what do you think
 

2769
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,609
the past 10 years what do you think
about that

2770
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:43,619
about that
 

2771
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,370
about that
okay the first thing I think

2772
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,380
okay the first thing I think
 

2773
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,710
okay the first thing I think
to remind people is just how many

2774
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
to remind people is just how many
 

2775
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,450
to remind people is just how many
brilliant people do work at each of

2776
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:50,460
brilliant people do work at each of
 

2777
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,589
brilliant people do work at each of
these companies obviously yes you know

2778
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
these companies obviously yes you know
 

2779
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,069
these companies obviously yes you know
elon's had the some of the best teams

2780
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:55,079
elon's had the some of the best teams
 

2781
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,290
elon's had the some of the best teams
assembled ever just incredible people he

2782
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,300
assembled ever just incredible people he
 

2783
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,510
assembled ever just incredible people he
knows this he he will gladly tell people

2784
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
knows this he he will gladly tell people
 

2785
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,910
knows this he he will gladly tell people
and he says it often like the amazing

2786
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
and he says it often like the amazing
 

2787
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,410
and he says it often like the amazing
people the amazing teams here so it is

2788
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:03,420
people the amazing teams here so it is
 

2789
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,210
people the amazing teams here so it is
important to remember that

2790
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:05,220
important to remember that
 

2791
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,829
important to remember that
um that being said like there is

2792
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:06,839
um that being said like there is
 

2793
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,109
um that being said like there is
something to elon's

2794
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
something to elon's
 

2795
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,770
something to elon's
just super far forward not taking no for

2796
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:12,780
just super far forward not taking no for
 

2797
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,630
just super far forward not taking no for
an answer on things approached and and

2798
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:16,640
an answer on things approached and and
 

2799
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,609
an answer on things approached and and
almost to his dismay I think

2800
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:19,619
almost to his dismay I think
 

2801
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:23,030
almost to his dismay I think
he is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so

2802
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
he is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so
 

2803
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,010
he is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so
much that it almost almost gets to the

2804
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:25,020
much that it almost almost gets to the
 

2805
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,650
much that it almost almost gets to the
border of like being you know like throw

2806
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:27,660
border of like being you know like throw
 

2807
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,809
border of like being you know like throw
out everything before it's even we've

2808
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:29,819
out everything before it's even we've
 

2809
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,010
out everything before it's even we've
we've known or not but the same time

2810
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,020
we've known or not but the same time
 

2811
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,609
we've known or not but the same time
like it moves the needles so fast so far

2812
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:34,619
like it moves the needles so fast so far
 

2813
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,589
like it moves the needles so fast so far
so as far as the question of would

2814
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:36,599
so as far as the question of would
 

2815
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,349
so as far as the question of would
SpaceX continue to like succeed and be

2816
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
SpaceX continue to like succeed and be
 

2817
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,089
SpaceX continue to like succeed and be
able to ultimately go to Mars without

2818
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:41,099
able to ultimately go to Mars without
 

2819
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,609
able to ultimately go to Mars without
Elon the Mars thing I think would

2820
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:43,619
Elon the Mars thing I think would
 

2821
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,829
Elon the Mars thing I think would
probably be hard to uphold without I

2822
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
probably be hard to uphold without I
 

2823
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,510
probably be hard to uphold without I
think a lot of that drive for Mars is

2824
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
think a lot of that drive for Mars is
 

2825
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,250
think a lot of that drive for Mars is
from Elon

2826
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:49,260
from Elon
 

2827
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,170
from Elon
um it is maybe too Fantastical for the

2828
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:51,180
um it is maybe too Fantastical for the
 

2829
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,670
um it is maybe too Fantastical for the
average person and the average employee

2830
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:52,680
average person and the average employee
 

2831
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,230
average person and the average employee
and maybe the average CEO that might

2832
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
and maybe the average CEO that might
 

2833
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,930
and maybe the average CEO that might
step in to have a company's Mission be

2834
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:56,940
step in to have a company's Mission be
 

2835
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,250
step in to have a company's Mission be
to go to Mars like it's just or even

2836
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,260
to go to Mars like it's just or even
 

2837
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,470
to go to Mars like it's just or even
governments yeah clearly because like

2838
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
governments yeah clearly because like
 

2839
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,230
governments yeah clearly because like
you said the Mars plan was non-existent

2840
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,240
you said the Mars plan was non-existent
 

2841
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,450
you said the Mars plan was non-existent
for NASA yeah still really there isn't

2842
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:05,460
for NASA yeah still really there isn't
 

2843
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,150
for NASA yeah still really there isn't
much you know so

2844
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
much you know so
 

2845
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,089
much you know so
I I think if how many people I'm sorry

2846
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:11,099
I I think if how many people I'm sorry
 

2847
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,650
I I think if how many people I'm sorry
to interrupt how many people are talking

2848
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:12,660
to interrupt how many people are talking
 

2849
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,109
to interrupt how many people are talking
about it's obvious that we need to

2850
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:15,119
about it's obvious that we need to
 

2851
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,510
about it's obvious that we need to
become multi-planetary right there's not

2852
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
become multi-planetary right there's not
 

2853
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,589
become multi-planetary right there's not
a

2854
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:18,599
a
 

2855
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,230
a
there's the Mars society and like

2856
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:21,240
there's the Mars society and like
 

2857
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,809
there's the Mars society and like
serious leaders of engineering uh

2858
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:23,819
serious leaders of engineering uh
 

2859
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,569
serious leaders of engineering uh
efforts yeah or nations and so on yeah

2860
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:26,579
efforts yeah or nations and so on yeah
 

2861
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:29,750
efforts yeah or nations and so on yeah
which it does seem if you think about it

2862
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
which it does seem if you think about it
 

2863
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,589
which it does seem if you think about it
that it it's obvious yeah and the grand

2864
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:32,599
that it it's obvious yeah and the grand
 

2865
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:35,270
that it it's obvious yeah and the grand
eventuality it is obvious of the of

2866
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
eventuality it is obvious of the of
 

2867
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,010
eventuality it is obvious of the of
human civilization this whole human

2868
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,020
human civilization this whole human
 

2869
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,430
human civilization this whole human
experiment we have here we should be uh

2870
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:40,440
experiment we have here we should be uh
 

2871
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,670
experiment we have here we should be uh
expanding out into the cosmos 100 so I

2872
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
expanding out into the cosmos 100 so I
 

2873
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,950
expanding out into the cosmos 100 so I
think the big mission if we're measuring

2874
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:45,960
think the big mission if we're measuring
 

2875
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,410
think the big mission if we're measuring
SpaceX spacex's success on getting to

2876
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:48,420
SpaceX spacex's success on getting to
 

2877
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,390
SpaceX spacex's success on getting to
Mars or not I think they'd have a really

2878
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:50,400
Mars or not I think they'd have a really
 

2879
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,069
Mars or not I think they'd have a really
hard time

2880
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:52,079
hard time
 

2881
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,930
hard time
um continuing to fulfill that drive

2882
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:53,940
um continuing to fulfill that drive
 

2883
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,150
um continuing to fulfill that drive
without Elon at the helm

2884
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
without Elon at the helm
 

2885
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,270
without Elon at the helm
um now I think there's a certain balance

2886
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
um now I think there's a certain balance
 

2887
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,490
um now I think there's a certain balance
and beauty of Elon specifically when it

2888
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:01,500
and beauty of Elon specifically when it
 

2889
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,849
and beauty of Elon specifically when it
was Tesla and SpaceX where Elon will go

2890
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:04,859
was Tesla and SpaceX where Elon will go
 

2891
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:07,790
was Tesla and SpaceX where Elon will go
in you know have mild tornadoes around

2892
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:07,800
in you know have mild tornadoes around
 

2893
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,589
in you know have mild tornadoes around
the factory and the the engineering you

2894
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
the factory and the the engineering you
 

2895
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,630
the factory and the the engineering you
know and like mix everything up and and

2896
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:11,640
know and like mix everything up and and
 

2897
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,030
know and like mix everything up and and
things get sometimes just totally thrown

2898
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,040
things get sometimes just totally thrown
 

2899
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,010
things get sometimes just totally thrown
together you know and and totally just

2900
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,020
together you know and and totally just
 

2901
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,170
together you know and and totally just
like get it done just to to get it done

2902
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:18,180
like get it done just to to get it done
 

2903
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,630
like get it done just to to get it done
and start moving that direction and then

2904
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
and start moving that direction and then
 

2905
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,710
and start moving that direction and then
he'll leave and go do that same thing

2906
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:21,720
he'll leave and go do that same thing
 

2907
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,450
he'll leave and go do that same thing
you know at SpaceX or Tesla vice versa

2908
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:23,460
you know at SpaceX or Tesla vice versa
 

2909
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,370
you know at SpaceX or Tesla vice versa
and then there's a little bit of a calm

2910
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:25,380
and then there's a little bit of a calm
 

2911
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,809
and then there's a little bit of a calm
where people come back in and they fill

2912
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:26,819
where people come back in and they fill
 

2913
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,550
where people come back in and they fill
in those gaps you know and I think

2914
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:28,560
in those gaps you know and I think
 

2915
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,750
in those gaps you know and I think
that's kind of always been a pretty

2916
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:29,760
that's kind of always been a pretty
 

2917
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,970
that's kind of always been a pretty
healthy thing honestly is like I think

2918
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:31,980
healthy thing honestly is like I think
 

2919
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,170
healthy thing honestly is like I think
if he is too focused on on any one thing

2920
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:35,180
if he is too focused on on any one thing
 

2921
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,730
if he is too focused on on any one thing
it almost is like a spin too much you

2922
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:37,740
it almost is like a spin too much you
 

2923
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,589
it almost is like a spin too much you
know like it's like like too many

2924
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
know like it's like like too many
 

2925
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,930
know like it's like like too many
tornadoes yeah too many tornadoes and

2926
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:41,940
tornadoes yeah too many tornadoes and
 

2927
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,390
tornadoes yeah too many tornadoes and
and I think it could almost be like you

2928
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
and I think it could almost be like you
 

2929
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,730
and I think it could almost be like you
need someone to come back in and like

2930
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:46,740
need someone to come back in and like
 

2931
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,290
need someone to come back in and like
you know like backfill almost because

2932
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,300
you know like backfill almost because
 

2933
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,730
you know like backfill almost because
I've heard definitely stories of like

2934
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:49,740
I've heard definitely stories of like
 

2935
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,490
I've heard definitely stories of like
like well probably a good a good example

2936
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:52,500
like well probably a good a good example
 

2937
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,630
like well probably a good a good example
would be last

2938
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:53,640
would be last
 

2939
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,549
would be last
um last well was that last year two

2940
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:55,559
um last well was that last year two
 

2941
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,230
um last well was that last year two
years ago 2020

2942
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:57,240
years ago 2020
 

2943
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,250
years ago 2020
two yeah was that yeah or no 2021 they

2944
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:01,260
two yeah was that yeah or no 2021 they
 

2945
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,650
two yeah was that yeah or no 2021 they
did a the First full stack of the

2946
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:03,660
did a the First full stack of the
 

2947
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,170
did a the First full stack of the
Starship super heavy and they called it

2948
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,180
Starship super heavy and they called it
 

2949
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,370
Starship super heavy and they called it
the big surge all of a sudden like

2950
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:07,380
the big surge all of a sudden like
 

2951
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,770
the big surge all of a sudden like
thousands of SpaceX employees you know

2952
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:09,780
thousands of SpaceX employees you know
 

2953
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,630
thousands of SpaceX employees you know
came down to Starbase and they just

2954
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:11,640
came down to Starbase and they just
 

2955
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,490
came down to Starbase and they just
started building like you wouldn't

2956
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
started building like you wouldn't
 

2957
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,109
started building like you wouldn't
freaking believe I mean it's just things

2958
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
freaking believe I mean it's just things
 

2959
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,510
freaking believe I mean it's just things
going crazy it was actually in the

2960
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
going crazy it was actually in the
 

2961
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,650
going crazy it was actually in the
middle of that first interview I did

2962
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:18,660
middle of that first interview I did
 

2963
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,970
middle of that first interview I did
with him was in the middle of that surge

2964
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:19,980
with him was in the middle of that surge
 

2965
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,950
with him was in the middle of that surge
there was like commotion like you

2966
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:21,960
there was like commotion like you
 

2967
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,910
there was like commotion like you
wouldn't believe you couldn't hardly

2968
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:22,920
wouldn't believe you couldn't hardly
 

2969
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,349
wouldn't believe you couldn't hardly
talk because there's just so much going

2970
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
talk because there's just so much going
 

2971
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,870
talk because there's just so much going
on people just welding and blah blah you

2972
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
on people just welding and blah blah you
 

2973
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,730
on people just welding and blah blah you
know everything they did during that

2974
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:28,740
know everything they did during that
 

2975
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,829
know everything they did during that
period was basically scrapped

2976
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:30,839
period was basically scrapped
 

2977
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,370
period was basically scrapped
because it was just not done very well

2978
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:34,380
because it was just not done very well
 

2979
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,510
because it was just not done very well
but

2980
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
but
 

2981
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,089
but
they got a fully stacked Starship rocket

2982
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:38,099
they got a fully stacked Starship rocket
 

2983
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,010
they got a fully stacked Starship rocket
out on their launch pad

2984
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:40,020
out on their launch pad
 

2985
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,950
out on their launch pad
you know and it it said it I think at

2986
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
you know and it it said it I think at
 

2987
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,230
you know and it it said it I think at
some point you kind of have to stabilize

2988
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:45,240
some point you kind of have to stabilize
 

2989
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,370
some point you kind of have to stabilize
some things enough and just say like

2990
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:46,380
some things enough and just say like
 

2991
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,010
some things enough and just say like
this is what we're doing to catalyze

2992
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:49,020
this is what we're doing to catalyze
 

2993
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,690
this is what we're doing to catalyze
some things and say now do this it's

2994
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:50,700
some things and say now do this it's
 

2995
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,790
some things and say now do this it's
almost like do it for fake not do it for

2996
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:52,800
almost like do it for fake not do it for
 

2997
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,410
almost like do it for fake not do it for
real almost it's funny because through

2998
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:54,420
real almost it's funny because through
 

2999
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,450
real almost it's funny because through
that time because I had a lot a lot of

3000
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:56,460
that time because I had a lot a lot of
 

3001
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,790
that time because I had a lot a lot of
conversation with them I think that

3002
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:58,800
conversation with them I think that
 

3003
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,250
conversation with them I think that
process was hugely stressful there was a

3004
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:01,260
process was hugely stressful there was a
 

3005
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,870
process was hugely stressful there was a
sense I don't know where that sense is

3006
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
sense I don't know where that sense is
 

3007
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,490
sense I don't know where that sense is
today but there's a sense that Starship

3008
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:04,500
today but there's a sense that Starship
 

3009
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,829
today but there's a sense that Starship
is going to be very hard to pull off

3010
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:06,839
is going to be very hard to pull off
 

3011
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:09,650
is going to be very hard to pull off
yeah that's still borderline impossible

3012
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:09,660
yeah that's still borderline impossible
 

3013
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,049
yeah that's still borderline impossible
to pull off and then and that was really

3014
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:12,059
to pull off and then and that was really
 

3015
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:14,150
to pull off and then and that was really
weighing heavy on him and the team and

3016
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
weighing heavy on him and the team and
 

3017
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,370
weighing heavy on him and the team and
everybody yeah so like to have this

3018
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:16,380
everybody yeah so like to have this
 

3019
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,770
everybody yeah so like to have this
chaos of development is fascinating yeah

3020
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:18,780
chaos of development is fascinating yeah
 

3021
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,710
chaos of development is fascinating yeah
big time and I think they really had to

3022
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:21,720
big time and I think they really had to
 

3023
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,730
big time and I think they really had to
push

3024
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:22,740
push
 

3025
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,410
push
you know if they hadn't done that if

3026
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,420
you know if they hadn't done that if
 

3027
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,230
you know if they hadn't done that if
they hadn't done that big push

3028
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:27,240
they hadn't done that big push
 

3029
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,690
they hadn't done that big push
you know we might only be now seeing a

3030
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:29,700
you know we might only be now seeing a
 

3031
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,210
you know we might only be now seeing a
rocket stacked for the first time

3032
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:32,220
rocket stacked for the first time
 

3033
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,470
rocket stacked for the first time
um you know it might be a lot more

3034
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:33,480
um you know it might be a lot more
 

3035
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,870
um you know it might be a lot more
finished rocket a lot more High Fidelity

3036
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:35,880
finished rocket a lot more High Fidelity
 

3037
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,490
finished rocket a lot more High Fidelity
a lot more flight worthy rocket finished

3038
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:37,500
a lot more flight worthy rocket finished
 

3039
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,829
a lot more flight worthy rocket finished
and and stacked but

3040
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:39,839
and and stacked but
 

3041
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,390
and and stacked but
um and they might not have to walk stuff

3042
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:41,400
um and they might not have to walk stuff
 

3043
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,950
um and they might not have to walk stuff
backwards but the same time like you do

3044
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:42,960
backwards but the same time like you do
 

3045
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,430
backwards but the same time like you do
have to in this world you do have to

3046
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:46,440
have to in this world you do have to
 

3047
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,670
have to in this world you do have to
push really hard uh to make rapid

3048
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
push really hard uh to make rapid
 

3049
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,530
push really hard uh to make rapid
iteration and Rapid change in progress

3050
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:51,540
iteration and Rapid change in progress
 

3051
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,930
iteration and Rapid change in progress
so it's it's interesting I don't know so

3052
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:53,940
so it's it's interesting I don't know so

space flight and even our like planetary
defense like be able to defend ourselves

3272
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:13,380
defense like be able to defend ourselves
 

3273
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,829
defense like be able to defend ourselves
against asteroids like if politics has

3274
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
against asteroids like if politics has
 

3275
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,809
against asteroids like if politics has
their way and everything goes to crap

3276
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:17,819
their way and everything goes to crap
 

3277
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:19,790
their way and everything goes to crap
and we don't even get to you know yeah

3278
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:19,800
and we don't even get to you know yeah
 

3279
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,829
and we don't even get to you know yeah
we're not going to be able to you know

3280
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
we're not going to be able to you know
 

3281
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,390
we're not going to be able to you know
continue space flight and things like

3282
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:23,400
continue space flight and things like
 

3283
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,730
continue space flight and things like
that but like I don't know I just think

3284
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:25,740
that but like I don't know I just think
 

3285
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,230
that but like I don't know I just think
there's better ways to do it and more

3286
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:27,240
there's better ways to do it and more
 

3287
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,089
there's better ways to do it and more
uniting ways to do it than

3288
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:29,099
uniting ways to do it than
 

3289
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:31,549
uniting ways to do it than
than you know what feels like a mature

3290
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:31,559
than you know what feels like a mature
 

3291
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,470
than you know what feels like a mature
name calling sometimes you know yeah I

3292
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:33,480
name calling sometimes you know yeah I
 

3293
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,970
name calling sometimes you know yeah I
think the political bickering that most

3294
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:34,980
think the political bickering that most
 

3295
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,010
think the political bickering that most
people talk about that that's on top of

3296
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,020
people talk about that that's on top of
 

3297
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,170
people talk about that that's on top of
most people's minds is the thing they'll

3298
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:39,180
most people's minds is the thing they'll
 

3299
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,670
most people's minds is the thing they'll
be completely forgotten by history it

3300
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:40,680
be completely forgotten by history it
 

3301
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,710
be completely forgotten by history it
has actually very little impact yes

3302
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
has actually very little impact yes
 

3303
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,230
has actually very little impact yes
politics matters but like one percent of

3304
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,240
politics matters but like one percent of
 

3305
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,650
politics matters but like one percent of
it I think most of it is just

3306
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:48,660
it I think most of it is just
 

3307
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,130
it I think most of it is just
political bickering the push and pull of

3308
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,140
political bickering the push and pull of
 

3309
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,109
political bickering the push and pull of
the red team and the blue team and the

3310
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:54,119
the red team and the blue team and the
 

3311
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:57,470
the red team and the blue team and the
and then it the uh the news media that

3312
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:57,480
and then it the uh the news media that
 

3313
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,450
and then it the uh the news media that
feeds off the division for the attention

3314
00:57:59,450 --> 00:57:59,460
feeds off the division for the attention
 

3315
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,210
feeds off the division for the attention
and it's just like a fun athletic event

3316
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:02,220
and it's just like a fun athletic event
 

3317
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,069
and it's just like a fun athletic event
almost with the blue team and the red

3318
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
almost with the blue team and the red
 

3319
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,470
almost with the blue team and the red
team so 100 for that you kind of have to

3320
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
team so 100 for that you kind of have to
 

3321
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,510
team so 100 for that you kind of have to
have a historical perspective on it like

3322
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:08,520
have a historical perspective on it like
 

3323
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,190
have a historical perspective on it like
most things

3324
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:10,200
most things
 

3325
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,650
most things
uh will not really have a significant

3326
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:12,660
uh will not really have a significant
 

3327
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,390
uh will not really have a significant
impact and we should focus on

3328
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
impact and we should focus on
 

3329
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,430
impact and we should focus on
development of science technology

3330
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:16,440
development of science technology
 

3331
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,470
development of science technology
engineering which is the thing that

3332
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
engineering which is the thing that
 

3333
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,170
engineering which is the thing that
grows the pie 100 this is just this is

3334
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:21,180
grows the pie 100 this is just this is
 

3335
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,210
grows the pie 100 this is just this is
what the economists know well yeah which

3336
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:23,220
what the economists know well yeah which
 

3337
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,069
what the economists know well yeah which
is the Innovation the engineering that's

3338
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:25,079
is the Innovation the engineering that's
 

3339
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,569
is the Innovation the engineering that's
what actually makes everybody richer

3340
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:26,579
what actually makes everybody richer
 

3341
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:28,549
what actually makes everybody richer
yeah it's kind of political bickering is

3342
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
yeah it's kind of political bickering is
 

3343
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,710
yeah it's kind of political bickering is
just eating the pie and not just richer

3344
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
just eating the pie and not just richer
 

3345
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,930
just eating the pie and not just richer
but it improves their lives you know we

3346
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:32,940
but it improves their lives you know we
 

3347
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,990
but it improves their lives you know we
can look at every modern technology that

3348
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
can look at every modern technology that
 

3349
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,030
can look at every modern technology that
is bestowed upon us today air

3350
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,040
is bestowed upon us today air
 

3351
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,650
is bestowed upon us today air

3357
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,170
blah blah you know 100 years ago so many
of the things that I listed either

3358
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,180
of the things that I listed either
 

3359
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,270
of the things that I listed either
didn't exist or were only accessible by

3360
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
didn't exist or were only accessible by
 

3361
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,370
didn't exist or were only accessible by
the ultra wealthy you know and it's

3362
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:49,380
the ultra wealthy you know and it's
 

3363
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,990
the ultra wealthy you know and it's
through the innovation of Technology and

3364
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,000
through the innovation of Technology and
 

3365
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,450
through the innovation of Technology and
Engineering and education that we're

3366
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:53,460
Engineering and education that we're
 

3367
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,470
Engineering and education that we're
able to

3368
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
able to
 

3369
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,569
able to
have it be that even someone below the

3370
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:56,579
have it be that even someone below the
 

3371
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:58,190
have it be that even someone below the
poverty line and most of the developed

3372
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,200
poverty line and most of the developed
 

3373
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,750
poverty line and most of the developed
world will have a good number of those

3374
00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
world will have a good number of those
 

3375
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,789
world will have a good number of those
things in their life um and that's just

3376
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:01,799
things in their life um and that's just
 

3377
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:03,410
things in their life um and that's just
continuing to increase and continue to

3378
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:03,420
continuing to increase and continue to
 

3379
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,370
continuing to increase and continue to
get better

3380
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:04,380
get better
 

3381
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,670
get better
so I I think yeah that's to me that's

3382
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
so I I think yeah that's to me that's
 

3383
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,309
so I I think yeah that's to me that's
in the grand scheme more important but

3384
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
in the grand scheme more important but
 

3385
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,349
in the grand scheme more important but
um to each their own

3386
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:12,359
um to each their own
 

3387
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,329
um to each their own
speaking of amazing technological

3388
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:14,339
speaking of amazing technological
 

3389
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:17,150
speaking of amazing technological
development uh you have uh you have a

3390
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:17,160
development uh you have uh you have a
 

3391
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,010
development uh you have uh you have a
few videos on this but how does a rocket

3392
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:19,020
few videos on this but how does a rocket
 

3393
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,410
few videos on this but how does a rocket
engine work

3394
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:20,420
engine work
 

3395
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,210
engine work
uh you've you're wearing some of the

3396
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,220
uh you've you're wearing some of the
 

3397
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,049
uh you've you're wearing some of the
instruction manuals but uh for one one

3398
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:27,059
instruction manuals but uh for one one
 

3399
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:28,670
instruction manuals but uh for one one
type of it like what what's the fuel

3400
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:28,680
type of it like what what's the fuel
 

3401
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,470
type of it like what what's the fuel
what are the kind of types of different

3402
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
what are the kind of types of different
 

3403
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,510
what are the kind of types of different
rockets that you can kind of give an

3404
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:32,520
rockets that you can kind of give an
 

3405
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,690
rockets that you can kind of give an
overview yeah ultimately a rocket engine

3406
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:35,700
overview yeah ultimately a rocket engine
 

3407
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,309
overview yeah ultimately a rocket engine
converts

3408
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:37,319
converts
 

3409
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:39,710
converts
um high pressure and heat into kinetic

3410
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:39,720
um high pressure and heat into kinetic
 

3411
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,049
um high pressure and heat into kinetic
energy like that's the only real job of

3412
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:42,059
energy like that's the only real job of
 

3413
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,390
energy like that's the only real job of
a rocket engine is to take uh high

3414
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
a rocket engine is to take uh high
 

3415
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,609
a rocket engine is to take uh high
pressure gas hot high pressure gas I'm

3416
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:46,619
pressure gas hot high pressure gas I'm
 

3417
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,049
pressure gas hot high pressure gas I'm
very energized there's a lot of energy

3418
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:48,059
very energized there's a lot of energy
 

3419
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,470
very energized there's a lot of energy
involved and then literally turning that

3420
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:51,480
involved and then literally turning that
 

3421
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,730
involved and then literally turning that
into

3422
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:52,740
into
 

3423
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,650
into
molecules shooting in One Direction into

3424
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:54,660
molecules shooting in One Direction into
 

3425
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,910
molecules shooting in One Direction into
kinetic energy

3426
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
kinetic energy
 

3427
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,849
kinetic energy
so um yeah what you do basically you

3428
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:58,859
so um yeah what you do basically you
 

3429
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,710
so um yeah what you do basically you
know I mean the simplest version of it

3430
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
know I mean the simplest version of it
 

3431
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,569
know I mean the simplest version of it
is of course like famously a balloon you

3432
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:02,579
is of course like famously a balloon you
 

3433
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,190
is of course like famously a balloon you
take a balloon you fill it up with air

3434
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:04,200
take a balloon you fill it up with air
 

3435
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,589
take a balloon you fill it up with air
you've got a pressure you let go of it

3436
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:06,599
you've got a pressure you let go of it
 

3437
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,870
you've got a pressure you let go of it
uh some of the air shoots out in a

3438
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:08,880
uh some of the air shoots out in a
 

3439
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,390
uh some of the air shoots out in a
general direction-ish you converted that

3440
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:11,400
general direction-ish you converted that
 

3441
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,890
general direction-ish you converted that
pressure into kinetic energy now if you

3442
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:12,900
pressure into kinetic energy now if you
 

3443
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,230
pressure into kinetic energy now if you
start scaling that up you know you can

3444
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,240
start scaling that up you know you can
 

3445
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,089
start scaling that up you know you can
continue to do something like that like

3446
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:17,099
continue to do something like that like
 

3447
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,710
continue to do something like that like
um cold gas Thruster would be kind of

3448
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
um cold gas Thruster would be kind of
 

3449
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,809
um cold gas Thruster would be kind of
the most simple and easiest rocket

3450
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:20,819
the most simple and easiest rocket
 

3451
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:22,130
the most simple and easiest rocket
engine to make would be a cold gas

3452
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:22,140
engine to make would be a cold gas
 

3453
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,170
engine to make would be a cold gas
Thruster and all that is you literally

3454
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,180
Thruster and all that is you literally
 

3455
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,329
Thruster and all that is you literally
just take air or specifically nitrogen

3456
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:26,339
just take air or specifically nitrogen
 

3457
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:27,589
just take air or specifically nitrogen
because it's a little bit more dense

3458
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
because it's a little bit more dense
 

3459
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,210
because it's a little bit more dense
than all the others or you know and it's

3460
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:29,220
than all the others or you know and it's
 

3461
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,130
than all the others or you know and it's
the majority of our atmosphere

3462
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,140
the majority of our atmosphere
 

3463
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,289
the majority of our atmosphere
um you can uh or sorry it's more sparse

3464
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:33,299
um you can uh or sorry it's more sparse
 

3465
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:36,589
um you can uh or sorry it's more sparse
you can condense that down shorten a

3466
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:36,599
you can condense that down shorten a
 

3467
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,109
you can condense that down shorten a
really high pressure bottle and then uh

3468
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
really high pressure bottle and then uh
 

3469
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,549
really high pressure bottle and then uh
just literally shoot it through what's

3470
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
just literally shoot it through what's
 

3471
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,109
just literally shoot it through what's
called a d level nozzle which is

3472
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:42,119
called a d level nozzle which is
 

3473
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:43,490
called a d level nozzle which is
something that chokes the flow a little

3474
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:43,500
something that chokes the flow a little
 

3475
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,530
something that chokes the flow a little
bit gets it to be

3476
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:45,540
bit gets it to be
 

3477
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,750
bit gets it to be
um takes it and gets it into supersonic

3478
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
um takes it and gets it into supersonic
 

3479
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,329
um takes it and gets it into supersonic
speeds once it's at supersonic speed you

3480
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:50,339
speeds once it's at supersonic speed you
 

3481
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:51,470
speeds once it's at supersonic speed you
actually can't choke it down anymore

3482
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:51,480
actually can't choke it down anymore
 

3483
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,630
actually can't choke it down anymore
you'll just constrict the flow of of

3484
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:53,640
you'll just constrict the flow of of
 

3485
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,690
you'll just constrict the flow of of
mass flow constrict the airflow so you

3486
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:56,700
mass flow constrict the airflow so you
 

3487
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,430
mass flow constrict the airflow so you
actually go opposite you start making it

3488
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:58,440
actually go opposite you start making it
 

3489
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,230
actually go opposite you start making it
wider and once it's already at

3490
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
wider and once it's already at
 

3491
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,089
wider and once it's already at
supersonic speeds if you expand it and

3492
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:02,099
supersonic speeds if you expand it and
 

3493
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:03,650
supersonic speeds if you expand it and
make it wider it actually gets faster

3494
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:03,660
make it wider it actually gets faster
 

3495
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,329
make it wider it actually gets faster
and faster so at first you know when

3496
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:05,339
and faster so at first you know when
 

3497
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,910
and faster so at first you know when
it's subsonic gas you start shrinking

3498
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
it's subsonic gas you start shrinking
 

3499
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,190
it's subsonic gas you start shrinking
you can strict the flow you know it's

3500
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:10,200
you can strict the flow you know it's
 

3501
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,809
you can strict the flow you know it's
actually speeding up just like you know

3502
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:11,819
actually speeding up just like you know
 

3503
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:13,609
actually speeding up just like you know
a highway if you go from you know or any

3504
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:13,619
a highway if you go from you know or any
 

3505
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,430
a highway if you go from you know or any
of these examples like a water hose you

3506
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:16,440
of these examples like a water hose you
 

3507
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,990
of these examples like a water hose you
you know if you pinch it down you want

3508
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
you know if you pinch it down you want
 

3509
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,130
you know if you pinch it down you want
to flow the same amount of water from

3510
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,140
to flow the same amount of water from
 

3511
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,870
to flow the same amount of water from
point A to point B through a smaller

3512
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
point A to point B through a smaller
 

3513
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,609
point A to point B through a smaller
pipe you can you can flow more water or

3514
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:22,619
pipe you can you can flow more water or
 

3515
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,049
pipe you can you can flow more water or
the same amount of water from point A to

3516
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:24,059
the same amount of water from point A to
 

3517
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,430
the same amount of water from point A to
point B with a smaller pipe it just has

3518
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
point B with a smaller pipe it just has
 

3519
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,470
point B with a smaller pipe it just has
to go faster so obviously you can

3520
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:27,480
to go faster so obviously you can
 

3521
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,609
to go faster so obviously you can
constrict it but at some point you

3522
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:28,619
constrict it but at some point you
 

3523
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,930
constrict it but at some point you
actually get to a physical limitation

3524
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:29,940
actually get to a physical limitation
 

3525
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,730
actually get to a physical limitation
and that happens to be the speed of

3526
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:31,740
and that happens to be the speed of
 

3527
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,950
and that happens to be the speed of
sound once it gets to the local speed of

3528
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:33,960
sound once it gets to the local speed of
 

3529
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,750
sound once it gets to the local speed of
sound

3530
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:34,760
sound
 

3531
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,890
sound
you can then actually do the opposite

3532
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:36,900
you can then actually do the opposite
 

3533
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,569
you can then actually do the opposite
you actually expand it back out and

3534
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:38,579
you actually expand it back out and
 

3535
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:40,730
you actually expand it back out and
you're continuing to convert

3536
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:40,740
you're continuing to convert
 

3537
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,030
you're continuing to convert
um the the pressure into velocity at

3538
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,040
um the the pressure into velocity at
 

3539
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,470
um the the pressure into velocity at
that point but it's now Supersonic and

3540
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:45,480
that point but it's now Supersonic and
 

3541
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,510
that point but it's now Supersonic and
what's interesting is while you're doing

3542
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
what's interesting is while you're doing
 

3543
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,069
what's interesting is while you're doing
that you're actually cooling it down too

3544
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:49,079
that you're actually cooling it down too
 

3545
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,349
that you're actually cooling it down too
each each bit of that pipe that you're

3546
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
each each bit of that pipe that you're
 

3547
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,910
each each bit of that pipe that you're
making wider and wider and wider you're

3548
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:52,920
making wider and wider and wider you're
 

3549
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,430
making wider and wider and wider you're
cooling down so the more heat energy you

3550
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
cooling down so the more heat energy you
 

3551
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,710
cooling down so the more heat energy you
have to work with the more work you can

3552
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:57,720
have to work with the more work you can
 

3553
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,990
have to work with the more work you can
actually do so at some point a hot high

3554
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
actually do so at some point a hot high
 

3555
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,270
actually do so at some point a hot high
pressure rocket engine is the best

3556
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:02,280
pressure rocket engine is the best
 

3557
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,010
pressure rocket engine is the best
source of like that's the ultimate

3558
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:04,020
source of like that's the ultimate
 

3559
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,990
source of like that's the ultimate
amount of work you can do and the nozzle

3560
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
amount of work you can do and the nozzle
 

3561
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,849
amount of work you can do and the nozzle
so as you're saying there's a bunch of

3562
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:07,859
so as you're saying there's a bunch of
 

3563
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:10,430
so as you're saying there's a bunch of
different design options but it's a

3564
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:10,440
different design options but it's a
 

3565
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,710
different design options but it's a
critical part of this yeah how you do

3566
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:12,720
critical part of this yeah how you do
 

3567
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,569
critical part of this yeah how you do
that conversion which is basically like

3568
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:14,579
that conversion which is basically like
 

3569
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:17,690
that conversion which is basically like
how much can you convert is really like

3570
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:17,700
how much can you convert is really like
 

3571
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,210
how much can you convert is really like
the ultimate game how much pressure and

3572
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:20,220
the ultimate game how much pressure and
 

3573
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,910
the ultimate game how much pressure and
heat can we convert into thrust like

3574
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:22,920
heat can we convert into thrust like
 

3575
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,870
heat can we convert into thrust like
that's really at the end of the day

3576
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:23,880
that's really at the end of the day
 

3577
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,970
that's really at the end of the day
that's what a rocket engine is so you

3578
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:25,980
that's what a rocket engine is so you
 

3579
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,230
that's what a rocket engine is so you
have to have a powerful enough rocket

3580
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:27,240
have to have a powerful enough rocket
 

3581
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,870
have to have a powerful enough rocket
engine to actually lift the rocket and

3582
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:29,880
engine to actually lift the rocket and
 

3583
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,089
engine to actually lift the rocket and
we'll rocket is mostly just fuel it's

3584
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:32,099
we'll rocket is mostly just fuel it's
 

3585
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:35,030
we'll rocket is mostly just fuel it's
like 90 90 plus percent just the weight

3586
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,040
like 90 90 plus percent just the weight
 

3587
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,349
like 90 90 plus percent just the weight
of fuel so you just have to lift the

3588
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:36,359
of fuel so you just have to lift the
 

3589
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:37,910
of fuel so you just have to lift the
fuel that's going to take it

3590
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
fuel that's going to take it
 

3591
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,370
fuel that's going to take it
uh you know into orbit and that's the

3592
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:40,380
uh you know into orbit and that's the
 

3593
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,530
uh you know into orbit and that's the
thing specifically for Rockets you're

3594
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:42,540
thing specifically for Rockets you're
 

3595
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,450
thing specifically for Rockets you're
just saying generally rocket engines but

3596
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:44,460
just saying generally rocket engines but
 

3597
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,990
just saying generally rocket engines but
for the task of going to orbit you're

3598
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
for the task of going to orbit you're
 

3599
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,690
for the task of going to orbit you're
Fighting Gravity Earth gravity which is

3600
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:50,700
Fighting Gravity Earth gravity which is
 

3601
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,250
Fighting Gravity Earth gravity which is
fundamentally different than moon

3602
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,260
fundamentally different than moon
 

3603
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,849
fundamentally different than moon
gravity or yeah Mars gravity yeah uh or

3604
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:55,859
gravity or yeah Mars gravity yeah uh or
 

3605
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,470
gravity or yeah Mars gravity yeah uh or
like you said traveling out the space

3606
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:57,480
like you said traveling out the space
 

3607
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,829
like you said traveling out the space
Earth has a pretty intense

3608
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839
Earth has a pretty intense
 

3609
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,589
Earth has a pretty intense
gravity it's to overcome we're lucky

3610
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
gravity it's to overcome we're lucky
 

3611
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,270
gravity it's to overcome we're lucky
because if I think if it's ten percent

3612
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:05,280
because if I think if it's ten percent
 

3613
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,789
because if I think if it's ten percent
either way like 10 harder it'd be like

3614
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:07,799
either way like 10 harder it'd be like
 

3615
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:10,670
either way like 10 harder it'd be like
oh we could still do it you know we'd

3616
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:10,680
oh we could still do it you know we'd
 

3617
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,870
oh we could still do it you know we'd
still be with our current technology

3618
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:11,880
still be with our current technology
 

3619
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,890
still be with our current technology
we'd still be able to get stuff into

3620
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:12,900
we'd still be able to get stuff into
 

3621
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,770
we'd still be able to get stuff into
orbit man things like reusability and

3622
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:15,780
orbit man things like reusability and
 

3623
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,990
orbit man things like reusability and
this you know commercialization the

3624
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,000
this you know commercialization the
 

3625
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,130
this you know commercialization the
success that we've seen in the last 10

3626
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:19,140
success that we've seen in the last 10
 

3627
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,690
success that we've seen in the last 10
years it would just be on two thinner

3628
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:20,700
years it would just be on two thinner
 

3629
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,630
years it would just be on two thinner
margins I think 10 easier and we would

3630
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:23,640
margins I think 10 easier and we would
 

3631
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,430
margins I think 10 easier and we would
have been like I mean it's just like

3632
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
have been like I mean it's just like
 

3633
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,170
have been like I mean it's just like
totally different it's so much it's so

3634
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:27,180
totally different it's so much it's so
 

3635
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,910
totally different it's so much it's so
much easier it's like this big you know

3636
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:28,920
much easier it's like this big you know
 

3637
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,950
much easier it's like this big you know
sliding scale and 10 in either direction

3638
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
sliding scale and 10 in either direction
 

3639
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,230
sliding scale and 10 in either direction
we'd be either screwed or really happy

3640
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:33,240
we'd be either screwed or really happy
 

3641
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,289
we'd be either screwed or really happy
you know as far as getting in his face

3642
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:36,299
you know as far as getting in his face
 

3643
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:38,450
you know as far as getting in his face
so it's just hard enough that it things

3644
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:38,460
so it's just hard enough that it things
 

3645
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,490
so it's just hard enough that it things
like fully reusable becomes very very

3646
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:40,500
like fully reusable becomes very very
 

3647
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,650
like fully reusable becomes very very
very difficult I think it's completely

3648
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:42,660
very difficult I think it's completely
 

3649
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,930
very difficult I think it's completely
achievable we have all the pieces to

3650
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:44,940
achievable we have all the pieces to
 

3651
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,849
achievable we have all the pieces to
make it achievable does not disobey any

3652
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:46,859
make it achievable does not disobey any
 

3653
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:48,589
make it achievable does not disobey any
laws of physics it does not disobey any

3654
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:48,599
laws of physics it does not disobey any
 

3655
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,210
laws of physics it does not disobey any
there's no like hard to stop through

3656
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:50,220
there's no like hard to stop through
 

3657
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,329
there's no like hard to stop through
it's just very very very hard and so

3658
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:53,339
it's just very very very hard and so
 

3659
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:55,730
it's just very very very hard and so
ultimately yeah like on Earth for the

3660
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:55,740
ultimately yeah like on Earth for the
 

3661
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,410
ultimately yeah like on Earth for the
first bit of launch again when the

3662
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:57,420
first bit of launch again when the
 

3663
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,210
first bit of launch again when the
Rocket's pointing straight up and it and

3664
01:03:59,210 --> 01:03:59,220
Rocket's pointing straight up and it and
 

3665
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,289
Rocket's pointing straight up and it and
the engines are pointing straight down

3666
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:00,299
the engines are pointing straight down
 

3667
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:02,390
the engines are pointing straight down
pointy end up play me and down you're

3668
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400
pointy end up play me and down you're
 

3669
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,490
pointy end up play me and down you're
Fighting Gravity and so that's kind of

3670
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:04,500
Fighting Gravity and so that's kind of
 

3671
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,289
Fighting Gravity and so that's kind of
your biggest enemy outside of the

3672
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:06,299
your biggest enemy outside of the
 

3673
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:08,630
your biggest enemy outside of the
Earth's atmosphere too so what kind of

3674
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
Earth's atmosphere too so what kind of
 

3675
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,390
Earth's atmosphere too so what kind of
uh sources of fuel is there so this

3676
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:11,400
uh sources of fuel is there so this
 

3677
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,910
uh sources of fuel is there so this
chemical Rockets liquid solid gas hybrid

3678
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
chemical Rockets liquid solid gas hybrid
 

3679
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,030
chemical Rockets liquid solid gas hybrid
uh there's electric so what what are the

3680
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:17,040
uh there's electric so what what are the
 

3681
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,650
uh there's electric so what what are the
kinds of fuels we're talking about what

3682
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:18,660
kinds of fuels we're talking about what
 

3683
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,690
kinds of fuels we're talking about what
are oxidizes what what can you just

3684
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:20,700
are oxidizes what what can you just
 

3685
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,849
are oxidizes what what can you just
explain your shirt I guess

3686
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:22,859
explain your shirt I guess
 

3687
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,410
explain your shirt I guess
yeah

3688
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:23,420
yeah
 

3689
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:28,490
yeah
the components so uh so really I mean

3690
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:28,500
the components so uh so really I mean
 

3691
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,190
the components so uh so really I mean
fuels it's there's kind of two terms

3692
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
fuels it's there's kind of two terms
 

3693
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,329
fuels it's there's kind of two terms
we'll you'll generally hear the word

3694
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:32,339
we'll you'll generally hear the word
 

3695
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:34,430
we'll you'll generally hear the word
propellant being used is anything that

3696
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:34,440
propellant being used is anything that
 

3697
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,650
propellant being used is anything that
is used to propel a spacecraft or used

3698
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:36,660
is used to propel a spacecraft or used
 

3699
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,270
is used to propel a spacecraft or used
in a rocket engine so

3700
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:38,280
in a rocket engine so
 

3701
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,289
in a rocket engine so
um you have to have you know you can

3702
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:39,299
um you have to have you know you can
 

3703
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,210
um you have to have you know you can
have a fuel here you have to have a fuel

3704
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:41,220
have a fuel here you have to have a fuel
 

3705
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,650
have a fuel here you have to have a fuel
you have to have an oxidizer and you

3706
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:42,660
you have to have an oxidizer and you
 

3707
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,089
you have to have an oxidizer and you
have to have a spark to actually get

3708
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:44,099
have to have a spark to actually get
 

3709
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:46,430
have to have a spark to actually get
those things burning and that's just a

3710
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:46,440
those things burning and that's just a
 

3711
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,890
those things burning and that's just a
general law of like the universe you

3712
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:48,900
general law of like the universe you
 

3713
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,329
general law of like the universe you
have to have fuel and oxidizer and a

3714
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:50,339
have to have fuel and oxidizer and a
 

3715
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:51,589
have to have fuel and oxidizer and a
spark

3716
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
spark
 

3717
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,470
spark
um now some fuels will by themselves

3718
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
um now some fuels will by themselves
 

3719
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,930
um now some fuels will by themselves
spark like hypergolic fuels But

3720
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:56,940
spark like hypergolic fuels But
 

3721
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,430
spark like hypergolic fuels But
ultimately you're always left with some

3722
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:58,440
ultimately you're always left with some
 

3723
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,829
ultimately you're always left with some
kind of fuel oxidizer in a spark so um

3724
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:00,839
kind of fuel oxidizer in a spark so um
 

3725
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,930
kind of fuel oxidizer in a spark so um
the the general ones used most often in

3726
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:02,940
the the general ones used most often in
 

3727
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,670
the the general ones used most often in
Rockets liquid oxygen is kind of the

3728
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
Rockets liquid oxygen is kind of the
 

3729
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,430
Rockets liquid oxygen is kind of the
king of well there's better oxidizers

3730
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
king of well there's better oxidizers
 

3731
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,930
king of well there's better oxidizers
but they're extremely extremely hard to

3732
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:08,940
but they're extremely extremely hard to
 

3733
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,210
but they're extremely extremely hard to
work with like fluorine

3734
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:11,220
work with like fluorine
 

3735
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,789
work with like fluorine
um but the generally liquid oxygen so

3736
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:13,799
um but the generally liquid oxygen so
 

3737
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:15,530
um but the generally liquid oxygen so
you just chill oxygen down too it's

3738
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:15,540
you just chill oxygen down too it's
 

3739
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,250
you just chill oxygen down too it's
liquid state minus 183 degrees Celsius

3740
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:18,260
liquid state minus 183 degrees Celsius
 

3741
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,109
liquid state minus 183 degrees Celsius
so it can be dense enough to store in

3742
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
so it can be dense enough to store in
 

3743
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,250
so it can be dense enough to store in
tanks you know it's a thousand times

3744
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:22,260
tanks you know it's a thousand times
 

3745
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,990
tanks you know it's a thousand times
more dense when it's in a liquid than it

3746
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
more dense when it's in a liquid than it
 

3747
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,690
more dense when it's in a liquid than it
is as a gas

3748
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:25,700
is as a gas
 

3749
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,690
is as a gas
rp1 which is basically kerosene is a

3750
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:29,700
rp1 which is basically kerosene is a
 

3751
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,250
rp1 which is basically kerosene is a
very common fuel

3752
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:31,260
very common fuel
 

3753
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,829
very common fuel
another common fuel nowadays is methane

3754
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
another common fuel nowadays is methane
 

3755
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,309
another common fuel nowadays is methane
liquid methane liquid hydrogen is

3756
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:37,319
liquid methane liquid hydrogen is
 

3757
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:38,809
liquid methane liquid hydrogen is
another it's the most efficient

3758
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:38,819
another it's the most efficient
 

3759
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:40,430
another it's the most efficient
potential for the most efficient since

3760
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:40,440
potential for the most efficient since
 

3761
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,950
potential for the most efficient since
it's one of the lightest molecules so if

3762
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
it's one of the lightest molecules so if
 

3763
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,250
it's one of the lightest molecules so if
I think correct me if I'm wrong but

3764
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:45,260
I think correct me if I'm wrong but
 

3765
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:49,490
I think correct me if I'm wrong but
Falcon 9 uses kerosene and then a

3766
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:49,500
Falcon 9 uses kerosene and then a
 

3767
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,470
Falcon 9 uses kerosene and then a
Starship uses methane because methane

3768
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:51,480
Starship uses methane because methane
 

3769
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,970
Starship uses methane because methane
yep for fuel and they both use liquid

3770
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:52,980
yep for fuel and they both use liquid
 

3771
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,349
yep for fuel and they both use liquid
oxygen for their oxidized for the

3772
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:54,359
oxygen for their oxidized for the
 

3773
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,270
oxygen for their oxidized for the
oxidizer okay yep

3774
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:56,280
oxidizer okay yep
 

3775
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,530
oxidizer okay yep
um but then you know if you get into

3776
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:57,540
um but then you know if you get into
 

3777
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,849
um but then you know if you get into
hypergolics you'll normally have

3778
01:05:58,849 --> 01:05:58,859
hypergolics you'll normally have
 

3779
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:01,010
hypergolics you'll normally have
nitrogen tetroxide which is your

3780
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,020
nitrogen tetroxide which is your
 

3781
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,710
nitrogen tetroxide which is your
oxidizer and some form of hydrazine

3782
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:03,720
oxidizer and some form of hydrazine
 

3783
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,829
oxidizer and some form of hydrazine
for your fuel

3784
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
for your fuel
 

3785
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,910
for your fuel
there's solid rocket propellants like

3786
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
there's solid rocket propellants like
 

3787
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,170
there's solid rocket propellants like
solid rocket boosters and those are

3788
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:09,180
solid rocket boosters and those are
 

3789
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,450
solid rocket boosters and those are
actually pre-mixed your oxidizer is

3790
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:11,460
actually pre-mixed your oxidizer is
 

3791
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,970
actually pre-mixed your oxidizer is
inherently like baked literally like

3792
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:13,980
inherently like baked literally like
 

3793
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,549
inherently like baked literally like
kind of baked into the sludge of of fuel

3794
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
kind of baked into the sludge of of fuel
 

3795
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,730
kind of baked into the sludge of of fuel
so like for SpaceX it's all uh chemical

3796
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:19,740
so like for SpaceX it's all uh chemical
 

3797
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,970
so like for SpaceX it's all uh chemical
liquid fuels yep yep so how many solid

3798
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:22,980
liquid fuels yep yep so how many solid
 

3799
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,089
liquid fuels yep yep so how many solid
base uh fuels are there is that are they

3800
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:26,099
base uh fuels are there is that are they
 

3801
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,289
base uh fuels are there is that are they
still being used today is there most

3802
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:27,299
still being used today is there most
 

3803
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:29,150
still being used today is there most
Rockets yeah and the United States

3804
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:29,160
Rockets yeah and the United States
 

3805
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,829
Rockets yeah and the United States
really is the only ones that well the

3806
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:30,839
really is the only ones that well the
 

3807
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:32,930
really is the only ones that well the
only ones I guess early on because it

3808
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:32,940
only ones I guess early on because it
 

3809
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,130
only ones I guess early on because it
was really just the Soviet Union versus

3810
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:34,140
was really just the Soviet Union versus
 

3811
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,750
was really just the Soviet Union versus
the United States the United States

3812
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
the United States the United States
 

3813
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,270
the United States the United States
started to use solids pretty early on uh

3814
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:38,280
started to use solids pretty early on uh
 

3815
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,950
started to use solids pretty early on uh
they're simple and easy but these days

3816
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:39,960
they're simple and easy but these days
 

3817
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,450
they're simple and easy but these days
like you know you'll still see them kind

3818
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:41,460
like you know you'll still see them kind
 

3819
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,730
like you know you'll still see them kind
of as traditionally like boosters like

3820
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:43,740
of as traditionally like boosters like
 

3821
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,789
of as traditionally like boosters like
they're used to just uh help get

3822
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
they're used to just uh help get
 

3823
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,109
they're used to just uh help get
something off the ground or help give it

3824
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:48,119
something off the ground or help give it
 

3825
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:49,789
something off the ground or help give it
a little extra boost

3826
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:49,799
a little extra boost
 

3827
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,230
a little extra boost
um so the space shuttle famously had

3828
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:51,240
um so the space shuttle famously had
 

3829
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,270
um so the space shuttle famously had
those two huge white solid rocket

3830
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
those two huge white solid rocket
 

3831
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,710
those two huge white solid rocket
boosters attached to the orange fuel

3832
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:54,720
boosters attached to the orange fuel
 

3833
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,650
boosters attached to the orange fuel
tank those are solid rocket repellents

3834
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:57,660
tank those are solid rocket repellents
 

3835
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,870
tank those are solid rocket repellents
um things like the atlas 5 can have up

3836
01:06:59,870 --> 01:06:59,880
um things like the atlas 5 can have up
 

3837
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,270
um things like the atlas 5 can have up
to five smaller solid rocket boosters

3838
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:02,280
to five smaller solid rocket boosters
 

3839
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,089
to five smaller solid rocket boosters
there's very few rockets that use a Pure

3840
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:05,099
there's very few rockets that use a Pure
 

3841
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:07,250
there's very few rockets that use a Pure
uh at least these days they use a Pure

3842
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:07,260
uh at least these days they use a Pure
 

3843
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,190
uh at least these days they use a Pure
solid rocket motor for its first stage

3844
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:10,200
solid rocket motor for its first stage
 

3845
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,510
solid rocket motor for its first stage
um there still are especially in China

3846
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
um there still are especially in China
 

3847
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,069
um there still are especially in China
there's a lot of startup rocket

3848
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:13,079
there's a lot of startup rocket
 

3849
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,210
there's a lot of startup rocket
companies that kind of use just missile

3850
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:14,220
companies that kind of use just missile
 

3851
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,890
companies that kind of use just missile
technology you know they might use like

3852
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:15,900
technology you know they might use like
 

3853
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,150
technology you know they might use like
a they might just be a variant of an

3854
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:17,160
a they might just be a variant of an
 

3855
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,650
a they might just be a variant of an
ICBM

3856
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:18,660
ICBM
 

3857
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,150
ICBM
um that just use solid rocket fuel

3858
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
um that just use solid rocket fuel
 

3859
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,609
um that just use solid rocket fuel
because it is very relatively easy to

3860
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:22,619
because it is very relatively easy to
 

3861
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,250
because it is very relatively easy to
develop you know model rockets use solid

3862
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:25,260
develop you know model rockets use solid
 

3863
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,569
develop you know model rockets use solid
rocket Motors and stuff like that so

3864
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:26,579
rocket Motors and stuff like that so
 

3865
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,370
rocket Motors and stuff like that so
they're they're still around but they're

3866
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:28,380
they're they're still around but they're
 

3867
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,250
they're they're still around but they're
just not as elegant and not as uh yeah

3868
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:31,260
just not as elegant and not as uh yeah
 

3869
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,190
just not as elegant and not as uh yeah
not as as used these days so uh what are

3870
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,200
not as as used these days so uh what are
 

3871
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,130
not as as used these days so uh what are
rocket engine Cycles again I think

3872
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:37,140
rocket engine Cycles again I think
 

3873
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,690
rocket engine Cycles again I think
getting more to you towards your shirt

really really really really well done uh
 

3893
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,529
really really really really well done uh
so it's called rocket engine Cycles how

3894
01:07:57,529 --> 01:07:57,539
so it's called rocket engine Cycles how
 

3895
01:07:57,539 --> 01:07:59,870
so it's called rocket engine Cycles how
do you power a rocket engine and you go

3896
01:07:59,870 --> 01:07:59,880
do you power a rocket engine and you go
 

3897
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,250
do you power a rocket engine and you go
through all the different options is

3898
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,260
through all the different options is
 

3899
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,170
through all the different options is
there something you could say about uh

3900
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:03,180
there something you could say about uh
 

3901
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,410
there something you could say about uh
open cycle close cycle full flow

3902
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:06,420
open cycle close cycle full flow
 

3903
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,789
open cycle close cycle full flow
um all the different variants that you

3904
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:07,799
um all the different variants that you
 

3905
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:10,789
um all the different variants that you
can use words to explain yeah without

3906
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:10,799
can use words to explain yeah without
 

3907
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,529
can use words to explain yeah without
all the pretty pictures yeah without the

3908
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:12,539
all the pretty pictures yeah without the
 

3909
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:14,329
all the pretty pictures yeah without the
pretty pictures so ultimately you know

3910
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:14,339
pretty pictures so ultimately you know
 

3911
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,249
pretty pictures so ultimately you know
like we said we your ultimate goals you

3912
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,259
like we said we your ultimate goals you
 

3913
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,309
like we said we your ultimate goals you
want to get heat and pressure into an

3914
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:19,319
want to get heat and pressure into an
 

3915
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,349
want to get heat and pressure into an
engine so obviously at some point you

3916
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
engine so obviously at some point you
 

3917
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,030
engine so obviously at some point you
can either make really thick tanks of

3918
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
can either make really thick tanks of
 

3919
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,789
can either make really thick tanks of
your rocket you can like get it so thick

3920
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:25,799
your rocket you can like get it so thick
 

3921
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:27,410
your rocket you can like get it so thick
that you store the propellants at really

3922
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:27,420
that you store the propellants at really
 

3923
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,450
that you store the propellants at really
really high pressures but obviously like

3924
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:29,460
really high pressures but obviously like
 

3925
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,829
really high pressures but obviously like
that doesn't scale very well at some

3926
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:30,839
that doesn't scale very well at some
 

3927
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,090
that doesn't scale very well at some
point your Rocket's so heavy you can't

3928
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,100
point your Rocket's so heavy you can't
 

3929
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,709
point your Rocket's so heavy you can't
even leave the ground or you know it's

3930
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:33,719
even leave the ground or you know it's
 

3931
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,749
even leave the ground or you know it's
just so much of your mass is just

3932
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
just so much of your mass is just
 

3933
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,729
just so much of your mass is just
literally the walls of the rocket so at

3934
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:37,739
literally the walls of the rocket so at
 

3935
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,110
literally the walls of the rocket so at
some point people realize hey we could

3936
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
some point people realize hey we could
 

3937
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,510
some point people realize hey we could
actually just pump the fuels and the

3938
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
actually just pump the fuels and the
 

3939
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,249
actually just pump the fuels and the
oxidizer into the engine at a high

3940
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:43,259
oxidizer into the engine at a high
 

3941
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:44,630
oxidizer into the engine at a high
pressure and increase the pressure

3942
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:44,640
pressure and increase the pressure
 

3943
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,970
pressure and increase the pressure
through a pump now obviously a pump is

3944
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:46,980
through a pump now obviously a pump is
 

3945
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,709
through a pump now obviously a pump is
going to require energy you have to get

3946
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719
going to require energy you have to get
 

3947
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,809
going to require energy you have to get
that energy from somewhere

3948
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:50,819
that energy from somewhere
 

3949
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,610
that energy from somewhere
um and again at some point people were

3950
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:52,620
um and again at some point people were
 

3951
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,470
um and again at some point people were
like well Rockets are

3952
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
like well Rockets are
 

3953
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,269
like well Rockets are
there's already Rocket Fuel here you

3954
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:56,279
there's already Rocket Fuel here you
 

3955
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,470
there's already Rocket Fuel here you
know we'll just use some of the energy

3956
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:57,480
know we'll just use some of the energy
 

3957
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,050
know we'll just use some of the energy
from the rocket fuel to spin these pumps

3958
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:00,060
from the rocket fuel to spin these pumps
 

3959
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,729
from the rocket fuel to spin these pumps
so that that would be considered like

3960
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:01,739
so that that would be considered like
 

3961
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:04,490
so that that would be considered like
open cycle closed cycle full flow stage

3962
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:04,500
open cycle closed cycle full flow stage
 

3963
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,950
open cycle closed cycle full flow stage
combustion Cycles are are ways to

3964
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
combustion Cycles are are ways to
 

3965
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,749
combustion Cycles are are ways to
tap into the propellant actually and

3966
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:08,759
tap into the propellant actually and
 

3967
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:10,130
tap into the propellant actually and
then there's tap off expanders like I

3968
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:10,140
then there's tap off expanders like I
 

3969
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,269
then there's tap off expanders like I
mean all of them kind of do the same

3970
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
mean all of them kind of do the same
 

3971
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,249
mean all of them kind of do the same
thing but you end up at some point

3972
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:13,259
thing but you end up at some point
 

3973
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,769
thing but you end up at some point
spinning a turbine uh you know a turbine

3974
01:09:15,769 --> 01:09:15,779
spinning a turbine uh you know a turbine
 

3975
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,410
spinning a turbine uh you know a turbine
can take uh some of the heat energy and

3976
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:18,420
can take uh some of the heat energy and
 

3977
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,450
can take uh some of the heat energy and
the and the and the pressure

3978
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:20,460
the and the and the pressure
 

3979
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,329
the and the and the pressure
uh of an engine and then they can that

3980
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:23,339
uh of an engine and then they can that
 

3981
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,309
uh of an engine and then they can that
can be connected to a shaft to pumps and

3982
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:25,319
can be connected to a shaft to pumps and
 

3983
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:27,289
can be connected to a shaft to pumps and
those pumps can you know increase the

3984
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:27,299
those pumps can you know increase the
 

3985
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:28,970
those pumps can you know increase the
pressure of the propellants

3986
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:28,980
pressure of the propellants
 

3987
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,709
pressure of the propellants
and force it into the combustion chamber

3988
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
and force it into the combustion chamber
 

3989
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,370
and force it into the combustion chamber
now the difference between open cycle

3990
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,380
now the difference between open cycle
 

3991
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,870
now the difference between open cycle
closed cycle full flaw all those is what

3992
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:35,880
closed cycle full flaw all those is what
 

3993
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,950
closed cycle full flaw all those is what
happens

3994
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:36,960
happens
 

3995
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,829
happens
after the gas has flown through the

3996
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
after the gas has flown through the
 

3997
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,289
after the gas has flown through the
turbine so after you've used the turbine

3998
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:42,299
turbine so after you've used the turbine
 

3999
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:44,090
turbine so after you've used the turbine
and spun up the energy you know spun up

4000
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,100
and spun up the energy you know spun up
 

4001
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,309
and spun up the energy you know spun up
the engine what happens to that gas so

4002
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,319
the engine what happens to that gas so
 

4003
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,289
the engine what happens to that gas so
in an open cycle engine you basically

4004
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:48,299
in an open cycle engine you basically
 

4005
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:50,689
in an open cycle engine you basically
have like a separate small rocket engine

4006
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:50,699
have like a separate small rocket engine
 

4007
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:52,669
have like a separate small rocket engine
in a sense it's a gas generator they

4008
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:52,679
in a sense it's a gas generator they
 

4009
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:55,669
in a sense it's a gas generator they
call it and that will be used to create

4010
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:55,679
call it and that will be used to create
 

4011
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,229
call it and that will be used to create
someone you know take a little we'll say

4012
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:57,239
someone you know take a little we'll say
 

4013
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,870
someone you know take a little we'll say
10 of your the propellant flowing to the

4014
01:09:59,870 --> 01:09:59,880
10 of your the propellant flowing to the
 

4015
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,910
10 of your the propellant flowing to the
engine instead you reroute it to like a

4016
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
engine instead you reroute it to like a
 

4017
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,290
engine instead you reroute it to like a
smaller rocket engine called the gas

4018
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:03,300
smaller rocket engine called the gas
 

4019
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,510
smaller rocket engine called the gas
generator you point that at your turbine

4020
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
generator you point that at your turbine
 

4021
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,490
generator you point that at your turbine
and that will spin your turbine up to

4022
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:07,500
and that will spin your turbine up to
 

4023
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,350
and that will spin your turbine up to
you know ridiculous speeds 30 000 plus

4024
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
you know ridiculous speeds 30 000 plus
 

4025
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,770
you know ridiculous speeds 30 000 plus
RPM and then after it spins it's wasted

4026
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:12,780
RPM and then after it spins it's wasted
 

4027
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,350
RPM and then after it spins it's wasted
most of its its energy you know and it's

4028
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
most of its its energy you know and it's
 

4029
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,450
most of its its energy you know and it's
just dumped overboard that would be open

4030
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,460
just dumped overboard that would be open
 

4031
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,130
just dumped overboard that would be open
cycle you're not worrying about it after

4032
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,140
cycle you're not worrying about it after
 

4033
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,930
cycle you're not worrying about it after
that point but you are left with a lot

4034
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:20,940
that point but you are left with a lot
 

4035
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,530
that point but you are left with a lot
of unburnt un you know unused fuel a

4036
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:24,540
of unburnt un you know unused fuel a
 

4037
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,490
of unburnt un you know unused fuel a
good amount of that fuel is just

4038
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:25,500
good amount of that fuel is just
 

4039
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,689
good amount of that fuel is just
completely and especially because the

4040
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:26,699
completely and especially because the
 

4041
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:29,570
completely and especially because the
turbine uh you you have to keep it from

4042
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:29,580
turbine uh you you have to keep it from
 

4043
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,550
turbine uh you you have to keep it from
melting so you can't run it at like

4044
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:31,560
melting so you can't run it at like
 

4045

01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:35,699
ratios not necessarily stoichiometric
 

4049
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:36,890
ratios not necessarily stoichiometric
and a rocket engine you actually don't

4050
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:36,900
and a rocket engine you actually don't
 

4051
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,990
and a rocket engine you actually don't
want it to be near stoichiometric where

4052
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,000
want it to be near stoichiometric where
 

4053
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,149
want it to be near stoichiometric where
you're releasing all the energy you

4054
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:41,159
you're releasing all the energy you
 

4055
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:42,470
you're releasing all the energy you
actually want to release

4056
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
actually want to release
 

4057
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,970
actually want to release
um you actually want to be throwing out

4058
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:43,980
um you actually want to be throwing out
 

4059
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,649
um you actually want to be throwing out
the lighter molecule so it can be shot

4060
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:45,659
the lighter molecule so it can be shot
 

4061
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,530
the lighter molecule so it can be shot
out faster generally in the engine so um

4062
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:48,540
out faster generally in the engine so um
 

4063
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,630
out faster generally in the engine so um
but in order to have a turbine survive

4064
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
but in order to have a turbine survive
 

4065
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,310
but in order to have a turbine survive
you have to actually cool you have to

4066
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,320
you have to actually cool you have to
 

4067
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,709
you have to actually cool you have to
have the gas going through it it can't

4068
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:54,719
have the gas going through it it can't
 

4069
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,209
have the gas going through it it can't
be stupid stupid hot or else you're just

4070
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:56,219
be stupid stupid hot or else you're just
 

4071
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:57,950
be stupid stupid hot or else you're just
going to melt your turbine so they

4072
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:57,960
going to melt your turbine so they
 

4073
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,689
going to melt your turbine so they
normally um especially in the open cycle

4074
01:10:59,689 --> 01:10:59,699
normally um especially in the open cycle
 

4075
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:01,970
normally um especially in the open cycle
you just run it really fuel Rich so

4076
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:01,980
you just run it really fuel Rich so
 

4077
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,070
you just run it really fuel Rich so
there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped

4078
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped
 

4079
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,169
there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped
into it that will keep the temperatures

4080
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:06,179
into it that will keep the temperatures
 

4081
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,430
into it that will keep the temperatures
at a reasonable

4082
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
at a reasonable
 

4083
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,050
at a reasonable
uh you know at a reasonable temperature

4084
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:09,060
uh you know at a reasonable temperature
 

4085
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,209
uh you know at a reasonable temperature
so you end up with this like dark [\h__\h]

4086
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:11,219
so you end up with this like dark [\h__\h]
 

4087
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:12,770
so you end up with this like dark [\h__\h]
smoke pouring out of that gas generator

4088
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:12,780
smoke pouring out of that gas generator
 

4089
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,050
smoke pouring out of that gas generator
that's just unburned fuel it's just

4090
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,060
that's just unburned fuel it's just
 

4091
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,209
that's just unburned fuel it's just
wasted fuel it never got a chance to be

4092
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:17,219
wasted fuel it never got a chance to be
 

4093
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:19,189
wasted fuel it never got a chance to be
used oh interesting you know like in the

4094
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
used oh interesting you know like in the
 

4095
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,390
used oh interesting you know like in the
combustion chamber it's not it's not

4096
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
combustion chamber it's not it's not
 

4097
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,950

being used to propel the rocket you know

4098
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:21,960
being used to propel the rocket you know
 

4099
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,110
being used to propel the rocket you know
it's just being used to cool down the

4100
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:24,120
it's just being used to cool down the
 

4101
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,090
it's just being used to cool down the
the repellent that's being used to spin

4102
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:26,100
the repellent that's being used to spin
 

4103
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,770
the repellent that's being used to spin
the turbine that's being used to spin

4104
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:27,780
the turbine that's being used to spin
 

4105
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,570
the turbine that's being used to spin
the pumps to push a lot of propellant

4106
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:29,580
the pumps to push a lot of propellant
 

4107
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,649
the pumps to push a lot of propellant
into the engine

4108
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:30,659
into the engine
 

4109
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:31,850
into the engine
so

4110
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:31,860
so
 

4111
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,410
so
you know it doesn't take too long before

4112
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:33,420
you know it doesn't take too long before
 

4113
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,510
you know it doesn't take too long before
you know your a greedy rocket scientist

4114
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
you know your a greedy rocket scientist
 

4115
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,770
you know your a greedy rocket scientist
being like look at all this wasted

4116
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:36,780
being like look at all this wasted
 

4117
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,570
being like look at all this wasted
propellant all this potential energy

4118
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:38,580
propellant all this potential energy
 

4119
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,370
propellant all this potential energy
that's just literally being spewed out

4120
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:40,380
that's just literally being spewed out
 

4121
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,709
that's just literally being spewed out
the side of the rocket so that's where

4122
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
the side of the rocket so that's where
 

4123
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,870
the side of the rocket so that's where
the closed cycle comes in so now we have

4124
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880
the closed cycle comes in so now we have
 

4125
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,550
the closed cycle comes in so now we have
to get that propellant take it from

4126
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
to get that propellant take it from
 

4127
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,510
to get that propellant take it from
basically

4128
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
basically
 

4129
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,250
basically
what was being wasted through the

4130
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:49,260
what was being wasted through the
 

4131
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,750
what was being wasted through the
turbine and you're going to try pumping

4132
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:50,760
turbine and you're going to try pumping
 

4133
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,970
turbine and you're going to try pumping
it back into the engine now you don't

4134
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:52,980
it back into the engine now you don't
 

4135
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,510
it back into the engine now you don't
literally just pump that that gas that's

4136
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,520
literally just pump that that gas that's
 

4137
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,910
literally just pump that that gas that's
you know that hot that gas into the

4138
01:11:58,910 --> 01:11:58,920
you know that hot that gas into the
 

4139
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,470
you know that hot that gas into the
engine because it's actually way too low

4140
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
engine because it's actually way too low
 

4141
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,050
engine because it's actually way too low
of pressure uh compared to the main

4142
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,060
of pressure uh compared to the main
 

4143
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,850
of pressure uh compared to the main
combustion chamber by that point by the

4144
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:04,860
combustion chamber by that point by the
 

4145
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,050
combustion chamber by that point by the
time has gone through the turbine it's

4146
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:06,060
time has gone through the turbine it's
 

4147
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,970
time has gone through the turbine it's
lost most of its pressure and heat to

4148
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:07,980
lost most of its pressure and heat to
 

4149
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,410
lost most of its pressure and heat to
the turbine so if you tried pumping it

4150
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:09,420
the turbine so if you tried pumping it
 

4151
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,030
the turbine so if you tried pumping it
into the engine you know just taking

4152
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
into the engine you know just taking
 

4153
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,290
into the engine you know just taking
that pipe and sticking it right into the

4154
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:12,300
that pipe and sticking it right into the
 

4155
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,810
that pipe and sticking it right into the
combustion chamber that the much higher

4156
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:14,820
combustion chamber that the much higher
 

4157
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,010
combustion chamber that the much higher
pressure hotter combustion chamber would

4158
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,020
pressure hotter combustion chamber would
 

4159
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,649
pressure hotter combustion chamber would
just go backwards and it'd stall out the

4160
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:18,659
just go backwards and it'd stall out the
 

4161
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:19,850
just go backwards and it'd stall out the
engine and blow up the engine and

4162
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:19,860
engine and blow up the engine and
 

4163
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,950
engine and blow up the engine and
whatever what have you so what they

4164
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:21,960
whatever what have you so what they
 

4165
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,510
whatever what have you so what they
actually do is they normally will send

4166
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
actually do is they normally will send
 

4167
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,850
actually do is they normally will send
there might be some variations of this

4168
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:25,860
there might be some variations of this
 

4169
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,990
there might be some variations of this
but the general concept is you actually

4170
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:27,000
but the general concept is you actually
 

4171
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,930
but the general concept is you actually
flow all of your fuel or all of your

4172
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:29,940
flow all of your fuel or all of your
 

4173
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,810
flow all of your fuel or all of your
oxidizer through the turbine so that

4174
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,820
oxidizer through the turbine so that
 

4175
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,209
oxidizer through the turbine so that
would be closed cycle so there's fuel

4176
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:35,219
would be closed cycle so there's fuel
 

4177
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:36,770
would be closed cycle so there's fuel
Rich closed cycle which would be your

4178
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:36,780
Rich closed cycle which would be your
 

4179
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,870
Rich closed cycle which would be your
flowing all of the fuel through the

4180
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
flowing all of the fuel through the
 

4181
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,050
flowing all of the fuel through the
turbine or there's oxidizer closed cycle

4182
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,060
turbine or there's oxidizer closed cycle
 

4183
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,310
turbine or there's oxidizer closed cycle
which is where you're flowing all of the

4184
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:43,320
which is where you're flowing all of the
 

4185
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,570
which is where you're flowing all of the
oxidizer that's going into the engine

4186
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:44,580
oxidizer that's going into the engine
 

4187
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,030
oxidizer that's going into the engine
through the turbine now the trick here

4188
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,040
through the turbine now the trick here
 

4189
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,970
through the turbine now the trick here
is you have to have that turbine after

4190
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:49,980
is you have to have that turbine after
 

4191
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,830
is you have to have that turbine after
it's done its work so after it's taken

4192
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
it's done its work so after it's taken
 

4193
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,270
it's done its work so after it's taken
some of the potential energy some of the

4194
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
some of the potential energy some of the
 

4195
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,130
some of the potential energy some of the
heat energy from we're now calling it a

4196
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:55,140
heat energy from we're now calling it a
 

4197
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,090
heat energy from we're now calling it a
pre-burner by the way instead of it

4198
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:56,100
pre-burner by the way instead of it
 

4199
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,610
pre-burner by the way instead of it
being a gas generator you now call that

4200
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:58,620
being a gas generator you now call that
 

4201
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,530
being a gas generator you now call that
device that's that's creating pressure

4202
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:00,540
device that's that's creating pressure
 

4203
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,570
device that's that's creating pressure
to spin the turbine you're not calling

4204
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:02,580
to spin the turbine you're not calling
 

4205
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,649
to spin the turbine you're not calling
that a pre-burner because it's just

4206
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:03,659
that a pre-burner because it's just
 

4207
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:06,050
that a pre-burner because it's just
going to pre-burn some of your fuel or

4208
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:06,060
going to pre-burn some of your fuel or
 

4209
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,490
going to pre-burn some of your fuel or
some of your oxidizer

4210
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:07,500
some of your oxidizer
 

4211
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,890
some of your oxidizer
the trick is that has to be by the time

4212
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:09,900
the trick is that has to be by the time
 

4213
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,689
the trick is that has to be by the time
it's gone through the turbine it has to

4214
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:11,699
it's gone through the turbine it has to
 

4215
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:13,189
it's gone through the turbine it has to
be higher pressure

4216
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
be higher pressure
 

4217
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,050
be higher pressure
than the combustion chamber because

4218
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:15,060
than the combustion chamber because
 

4219
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,610
than the combustion chamber because
otherwise it's going to go backwards

4220
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:16,620
otherwise it's going to go backwards
 

4221
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,590
otherwise it's going to go backwards
still so you really have to get that

4222
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:18,600
still so you really have to get that
 

4223
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,169
still so you really have to get that
pre-burner up to ridiculously high

4224
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:21,179
pre-burner up to ridiculously high
 

4225
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,169
pre-burner up to ridiculously high
pressures like at least 20 higher than

4226
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:24,179
pressures like at least 20 higher than
 

4227
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:25,250
pressures like at least 20 higher than
your main combustion chamber and these

4228
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:25,260
your main combustion chamber and these
 

4229
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,570
your main combustion chamber and these
combustion Chambers you know we're

4230
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:26,580
combustion Chambers you know we're
 

4231
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,189
combustion Chambers you know we're
talking about engines that are at you

4232
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:28,199
talking about engines that are at you
 

4233
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:32,149
talking about engines that are at you
know 200 100 to 200 even in spacex's

4234
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
know 200 100 to 200 even in spacex's
 

4235
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,370
know 200 100 to 200 even in spacex's
Raptor engine up to 300 bar in the main

4236
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,380
Raptor engine up to 300 bar in the main
 

4237
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,290
Raptor engine up to 300 bar in the main
combustion chamber so that's what is

4238
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:36,300
combustion chamber so that's what is
 

4239
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,370
combustion chamber so that's what is
that 4500 PSI basically insane amounts

4240
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:40,380
that 4500 PSI basically insane amounts
 

4241
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,750
that 4500 PSI basically insane amounts
of of pressure inside these combustion

4242
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:41,760
of of pressure inside these combustion
 

4243
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,370
of of pressure inside these combustion
Chambers so your turbine has to be even

4244
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:43,380
Chambers so your turbine has to be even
 

4245
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,709
Chambers so your turbine has to be even
above that or your your gas generator or

4246
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:45,719
above that or your your gas generator or
 

4247
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:47,450
above that or your your gas generator or
your pre-burner sorry has to be higher

4248
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:47,460
your pre-burner sorry has to be higher
 

4249
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,550
your pre-burner sorry has to be higher
pressure than that even in order to have

4250
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:49,560
pressure than that even in order to have
 

4251
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,689
pressure than that even in order to have
the flow going the right direction

4252
01:13:50,689 --> 01:13:50,699
the flow going the right direction
 

4253
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:51,890
the flow going the right direction
through the engine

4254
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:51,900
through the engine
 

4255
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,169
through the engine
so now you'll you'll have those closed

4256
01:13:54,169 --> 01:13:54,179
so now you'll you'll have those closed
 

4257
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,330
so now you'll you'll have those closed
Cycles you'll have fuel Rich you have

4258
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:56,340
Cycles you'll have fuel Rich you have
 

4259
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,830
Cycles you'll have fuel Rich you have
oxidizer Rich

4260
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
oxidizer Rich
 

4261
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,270
oxidizer Rich
um the tricks now you're starting to get

4262
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
um the tricks now you're starting to get
 

4263
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,649
um the tricks now you're starting to get
it's crazy there's just so many

4264
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:00,659
it's crazy there's just so many
 

4265
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:02,810
it's crazy there's just so many
compromises every little decision you

4266
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:02,820
compromises every little decision you
 

4267
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,669
compromises every little decision you
have of like oh I did this now I know

4268
01:14:04,669 --> 01:14:04,679
have of like oh I did this now I know
 

4269
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,770
have of like oh I did this now I know
well now crap it's gonna do this for

4270
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:06,780
well now crap it's gonna do this for
 

4271
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,050
well now crap it's gonna do this for
instance fuel Rich if you ran kerosene

4272
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:09,060
instance fuel Rich if you ran kerosene
 

4273
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,330
instance fuel Rich if you ran kerosene
fuel Rich you know how I mentioned soot

4274
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:11,340
fuel Rich you know how I mentioned soot
 

4275
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,850
fuel Rich you know how I mentioned soot
coming out of the gas generator well if

4276
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:13,860
coming out of the gas generator well if
 

4277
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,890
coming out of the gas generator well if
you run soot

4278
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:15,900
you run soot
 

4279
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,729
you run soot
um

4280
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:16,739
um
 

4281
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,290
um
through your through your engine like

4282
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:18,300
through your through your engine like
 

4283
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,430
through your through your engine like
that and how to go through your

4284
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
that and how to go through your
 

4285
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,870
that and how to go through your
injectors like back into the engine

4286
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
injectors like back into the engine
 

4287
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,970
injectors like back into the engine
it'll clog the pores of the injectors

4288
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:22,980
it'll clog the pores of the injectors
 

4289
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,709
it'll clog the pores of the injectors
and it will end up blowing up the engine

4290
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
and it will end up blowing up the engine
 

4291
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,169
and it will end up blowing up the engine
the soot itself is so damaging

4292
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:27,179
the soot itself is so damaging
 

4293
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:29,570
the soot itself is so damaging
that you can't really run a fuel-rich

4294
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:29,580
that you can't really run a fuel-rich
 

4295
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,750
that you can't really run a fuel-rich
kerosene engine what exactly is so it's

4296
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:32,760
kerosene engine what exactly is so it's
 

4297
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,250
kerosene engine what exactly is so it's
like fuel somehow mixed up with the

4298
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:34,260
like fuel somehow mixed up with the
 

4299
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,189
like fuel somehow mixed up with the
smoke like what I wonder what what is it

4300
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
smoke like what I wonder what what is it
 

4301
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,530
smoke like what I wonder what what is it
chemically it's just some weird it's

4302
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:39,540
chemically it's just some weird it's
 

4303
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,750
chemically it's just some weird it's
mostly just carbon it's mostly just that

4304
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
mostly just carbon it's mostly just that
 

4305
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,450
mostly just carbon it's mostly just that
carbon that dark solid solid chunks of

4306
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:44,460
carbon that dark solid solid chunks of
 

4307
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,729
carbon that dark solid solid chunks of
carbon and it can cake up and just

4308
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:46,739
carbon and it can cake up and just
 

4309
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:49,790
carbon and it can cake up and just
literally like you know like yeah it's

4310
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
literally like you know like yeah it's
 

4311
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,250
literally like you know like yeah it's
it's like ash almost you know like at

4312
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:52,260
it's like ash almost you know like at
 

4313
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,510
it's like ash almost you know like at
some point you know especially under

4314
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
some point you know especially under
 

4315
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,590
some point you know especially under
those High pressures and high

4316
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:54,600
those High pressures and high
 

4317
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,229
those High pressures and high
temperatures it can physically build up

4318
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:57,239
temperatures it can physically build up
 

4319
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,209
temperatures it can physically build up
and you know turn into like stalagmites

4320
01:14:59,209 --> 01:14:59,219
and you know turn into like stalagmites
 

4321
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:02,810
and you know turn into like stalagmites
and stalactites of of carbon really hard

4322
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:02,820
and stalactites of of carbon really hard
 

4323
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,149
and stalactites of of carbon really hard
you know for forged in a rocket engine

4324
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:05,159
you know for forged in a rocket engine
 

4325
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,130
you know for forged in a rocket engine
carbon I wonder how you figure all that

4326
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:07,140
carbon I wonder how you figure all that
 

4327
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,570
carbon I wonder how you figure all that
out too is that's the experimentation

4328
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:08,580
out too is that's the experimentation
 

4329
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,310
out too is that's the experimentation
some of that has come chemist like

4330
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
some of that has come chemist like
 

4331
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,930
some of that has come chemist like
theoretical but like you're gonna have

4332
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:11,940
theoretical but like you're gonna have
 

4333
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,270
theoretical but like you're gonna have
to build the thing at scale and actually

4334
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,280
to build the thing at scale and actually
 

4335
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,490
to build the thing at scale and actually
test the trial and if you're trying here

4336
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:16,500
test the trial and if you're trying here
 

4337
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,890
test the trial and if you're trying here
there's many decades of trial and error

4338
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:18,900
there's many decades of trial and error
 

4339
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:21,110
there's many decades of trial and error
and many pieces of engines that you're

4340
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
and many pieces of engines that you're
 

4341
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,070
and many pieces of engines that you're
trying to piece back to they're going

4342
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
trying to piece back to they're going
 

4343
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,330
trying to piece back to they're going
like what the hell happened here yeah

4344
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:23,340
like what the hell happened here yeah
 

4345
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,209
like what the hell happened here yeah
what happened yeah okay so uh so that's

4346
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:26,219
what happened yeah okay so uh so that's
 

4347
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:28,250
what happened yeah okay so uh so that's
closed cycle so how do we get to full

4348
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:28,260
closed cycle so how do we get to full
 

4349
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,990
closed cycle so how do we get to full
flow so in either of those situations

4350
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,000
flow so in either of those situations
 

4351
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,729
flow so in either of those situations
you're still actually just having the

4352
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:31,739
you're still actually just having the
 

4353
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:33,169
you're still actually just having the
opposite so if you're fuel Rich you know

4354
01:15:33,169 --> 01:15:33,179
opposite so if you're fuel Rich you know
 

4355
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:34,189
opposite so if you're fuel Rich you know
all the fuel is going through the

4356
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:34,199
all the fuel is going through the
 

4357
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:37,550
all the fuel is going through the
turbine but um only a tiny bit of oxygen

4358
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:37,560
turbine but um only a tiny bit of oxygen
 

4359
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,990
turbine but um only a tiny bit of oxygen
is actually being put into that

4360
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,000
is actually being put into that
 

4361
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,110
is actually being put into that
pre-burner to to spin the pumps and the

4362
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:42,120
pre-burner to to spin the pumps and the
 

4363
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,669
pre-burner to to spin the pumps and the
rest of the the rest of the oxygen is

4364
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
rest of the the rest of the oxygen is
 

4365
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,290
rest of the the rest of the oxygen is
actually going through the pump the

4366
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:45,300
actually going through the pump the
 

4367
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,490
actually going through the pump the
primary pump and straight into the

4368
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:46,500
primary pump and straight into the
 

4369
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,689
primary pump and straight into the
combustion chamber

4370
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:47,699
combustion chamber
 

4371
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:49,490
combustion chamber
now full flow the idea is you're going

4372
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:49,500
now full flow the idea is you're going
 

4373
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,810
now full flow the idea is you're going
to actually pre-burn both your

4374
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:50,820
to actually pre-burn both your
 

4375
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,669
to actually pre-burn both your
propellants both your propellants are

4376
01:15:52,669 --> 01:15:52,679
propellants both your propellants are
 

4377
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:54,410
propellants both your propellants are
going to go through a pre-burner and

4378
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:54,420
going to go through a pre-burner and
 

4379
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,270
going to go through a pre-burner and
they're both going to end up spinning

4380
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,280
they're both going to end up spinning
 

4381
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,270
they're both going to end up spinning
one of the pumps so you'll have a gas a

4382
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,280
one of the pumps so you'll have a gas a
 

4383
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,890
one of the pumps so you'll have a gas a
fuel rich pre-burner and you're going to

4384
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:00,900
fuel rich pre-burner and you're going to
 

4385
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,050
fuel rich pre-burner and you're going to
have an oxygen-rich pre-burner each one

4386
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,060
have an oxygen-rich pre-burner each one
 

4387
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,930
have an oxygen-rich pre-burner each one
of those is going to get just you know

4388
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:05,940
of those is going to get just you know
 

4389
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,310
of those is going to get just you know
they're going to heat it up just enough

4390
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:07,320
they're going to heat it up just enough
 

4391
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,430
they're going to heat it up just enough
and get it up to just enough pressure to

4392
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:10,440
and get it up to just enough pressure to
 

4393
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,930
and get it up to just enough pressure to
spin up that turbine as fast as they

4394
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:11,940
spin up that turbine as fast as they
 

4395
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,310
spin up that turbine as fast as they
need to do to get the pumps up to the

4396
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:13,320
need to do to get the pumps up to the
 

4397
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,169
need to do to get the pumps up to the
right pressure and still have enough

4398
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:15,179
right pressure and still have enough
 

4399
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,790
right pressure and still have enough
pressure through the turbine to overcome

4400
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
pressure through the turbine to overcome
 

4401
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,110
pressure through the turbine to overcome
the pressure inside the main combustion

combust from there on and because
 

4429
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,450

the fascinating thing is they're coaxed
 

4463
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:25,850
the fascinating thing is they're coaxed
and there's gases and combustion but

4464
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:25,860
and there's gases and combustion but
 

4465
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,470
and there's gases and combustion but
yeah they they just take a little bit

01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:27,480
yeah they they just take a little bit
 

4467
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,689
yeah they they just take a little bit
more it takes more time in the

01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:29,699
more it takes more time in the
 

4469
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:32,030
more it takes more time in the

01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,729
you kind of generally the easiest is

expelling the the exhaust gas
 

4503
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,750
expelling the the exhaust gas
um the gas generator exhaust you're not

4504
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
um the gas generator exhaust you're not
 

4505
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,010
um the gas generator exhaust you're not
having to worry about it you just spin

4506
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:07,020
having to worry about it you just spin
 

4507
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,229
having to worry about it you just spin

4508
01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:09,239
up that thing as much as you need and
 

4509
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:11,510
up that thing as much as you need and
deal with it right no big deal

deal with it right no big deal
 

4511
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,750
deal with it right no big deal
um closed Cycles offers 10 to 15 greater

performance generally because you know

4514
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
performance generally because you know
 

4515
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,070
performance generally because you know
you're not wasting that propellant and

4516
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,080
you're not wasting that propellant and
 

4517
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,689
you're not wasting that propellant and
but it's it's complicated it's a lot

4518
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:20,699
but it's it's complicated it's a lot
 

4519
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:21,649
but it's it's complicated it's a lot
more complicated especially if you're

4520
01:18:21,649 --> 01:18:21,659
more complicated especially if you're
 

4521
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,930
more complicated especially if you're
doing oxygen rich now you're having hot

4522
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:23,940
doing oxygen rich now you're having hot
 

4523
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,410
doing oxygen rich now you're having hot
gaseous oxygen uh in your engine which

4524
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:27,420
gaseous oxygen uh in your engine which
 

4525
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,790
gaseous oxygen uh in your engine which
just generally wants to react with

01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,470
oxygen is just a recipe for things to
catch on fire that shouldn't be on fire

4532
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480

catch on fire that shouldn't be on fire
so Metals you know under those

4534
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:39,179
so Metals you know under those
 

4535
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:40,689
so Metals you know under those
conditions lots of times we'll just

4536
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:40,699
conditions lots of times we'll just
 

4537
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,890

spontaneously start burning you know

4538
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:42,900
spontaneously start burning you know
 

4539
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,050
spontaneously start burning you know
you'll actually turn your metal and it

4540
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:45,060
you'll actually turn your metal and it
 

4541
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,550
you'll actually turn your metal and it
will now become fuel you'll be engine

4542
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560
will now become fuel you'll be engine
 

4543
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,350
will now become fuel you'll be engine
Rich before you know it because you're

hot oxygen nice is uh is eating and

4546
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:51,480
hot oxygen nice is uh is eating and
 

4547
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,169
hot oxygen nice is uh is eating and
using that engine as fuel basically so

4548
01:18:54,169 --> 01:18:54,179
using that engine as fuel basically so
 

4549
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:55,970
using that engine as fuel basically so
um oxygen rich is generally very hard

4550
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:55,980
um oxygen rich is generally very hard
 

4551
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,830
um oxygen rich is generally very hard
but that is what the Soviet Union ended

4552
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:57,840
but that is what the Soviet Union ended
 

4553
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,630
but that is what the Soviet Union ended
up doing with almost their entire line

4554
01:18:59,630 --> 01:18:59,640
up doing with almost their entire line
 

4555
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,570
up doing with almost their entire line
of Vengeance was close cycle oxygen rich

4556
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:02,580
of Vengeance was close cycle oxygen rich
 

4557
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,250
of Vengeance was close cycle oxygen rich
but you know so those two are kind of

4558
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:04,260
but you know so those two are kind of
 

4559
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,950
but you know so those two are kind of
generally hard but offer great

4560
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:06,960
generally hard but offer great
 

4561
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,810

performance benefits over open cycle uh

4562
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:08,820
performance benefits over open cycle uh
 

4563
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,010
performance benefits over open cycle uh
but at the end of the day you know full

4564
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:10,020
but at the end of the day you know full
 

4565
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,770
but at the end of the day you know full
flow is by far the it's the ultimate of

4566
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:12,780
flow is by far the it's the ultimate of
 

4567
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,990
flow is by far the it's the ultimate of
all of them it's the most difficult but

4568
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:15,000
all of them it's the most difficult but
 

4569
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,669
all of them it's the most difficult but
it also has the most potential to be the

4570
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:16,679
it also has the most potential to be the
 

4571
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:19,010
it also has the most potential to be the
most efficient Starship the Raptor too

4572
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
most efficient Starship the Raptor too
 

4573
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,689
most efficient Starship the Raptor too
the the why is that engine using full

4574
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:20,699
the the why is that engine using full
 

4575
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:21,830
the the why is that engine using full
flow

4576

flow
 

4577
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,229
flow
because it's the best I mean it's just

4578
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
because it's the best I mean it's just
 

4579
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,910
because it's the best I mean it's just
physics wise if you're trying to extract

4580
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
physics wise if you're trying to extract
 

4581
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,290
physics wise if you're trying to extract
as much energy out of your propellants

4582
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:27,300
as much energy out of your propellants
 

4583
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,790
as much energy out of your propellants
there there just isn't another cycle

4584
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
there there just isn't another cycle
 

4585
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,910
there there just isn't another cycle
type that that is uh better than it but

4586
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:31,920
type that that is uh better than it but
 

4587
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,950
type that that is uh better than it but
of course it's very very hard to develop

4588
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:33,960
of course it's very very hard to develop
 

4589
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,649
of course it's very very hard to develop
you know so far to date the rd270 in the

4590
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:36,659
you know so far to date the rd270 in the
 

4591
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,390
you know so far to date the rd270 in the
60s was built

4592
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
60s was built
 

4593
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,590
60s was built
um there is a powerhead demonstrator

4594
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
um there is a powerhead demonstrator
 

4595
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,330
um there is a powerhead demonstrator
built in the United States in the in the

4596
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:41,340
built in the United States in the in the
 

4597
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,250
built in the United States in the in the
90s and early 2000s I think maybe just

4598
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:43,260
90s and early 2000s I think maybe just
 

4599
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,189
90s and early 2000s I think maybe just
the early 2000s um that was just the

4600
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,199
the early 2000s um that was just the
 

4601
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,350
the early 2000s um that was just the
just the power Just the the pumps and

4602
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:48,360
just the power Just the the pumps and
 

4603
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,970
just the power Just the the pumps and
the turbines and the pre-burners no

4604
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:49,980
the turbines and the pre-burners no
 

4605
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,430
the turbines and the pre-burners no
chamber no nothing that was a big deal

4606
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:52,440
chamber no nothing that was a big deal
 

4607
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,750
chamber no nothing that was a big deal
only the United States took you know

4608
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
only the United States took you know
 

4609
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,550
only the United States took you know
millions of dollars to just develop that

4610
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:55,560
millions of dollars to just develop that
 

4611
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,350
millions of dollars to just develop that
and then there's spacex's Raptor engine

4612
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
and then there's spacex's Raptor engine
 

4613
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,390
and then there's spacex's Raptor engine
so you talked about uh the combustion

4614
01:19:59,390 --> 01:19:59,400
so you talked about uh the combustion
 

4615
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,689
so you talked about uh the combustion
chamber and how damn hot things get high

4616
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:02,699
chamber and how damn hot things get high

4619
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,010
pressure
a lot of heat uh how do you keep the

4620
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:07,020
a lot of heat uh how do you keep the
 

4621
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,270
a lot of heat uh how do you keep the
thing cool you have a great video on

4622
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:08,280
thing cool you have a great video on
 

4623
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,470
thing cool you have a great video on
this how do you get it from uh from what

4624
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
this how do you get it from uh from what
 

4625
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,270
this how do you get it from uh from what
do you call it metal Rich engine Rich

4626
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:16,280
do you call it metal Rich engine Rich
 

4627
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,669
do you call it metal Rich engine Rich
engine Rich from like the the metal from

4628
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
engine Rich from like the the metal from
 

4629
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,070

melting well one of the ways is to let

4630
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
melting well one of the ways is to let
 

4631
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,750
melting well one of the ways is to let
it be engine Rich there's actually you

4632
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
it be engine Rich there's actually you
 

4633
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,070
it be engine Rich there's actually you
can use a blade of cooling you can

4634
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:25,080
can use a blade of cooling you can
 

4635
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,209
can use a blade of cooling you can
literally let

4636
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:26,219
literally let
 

4637
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:27,350
literally let
um make the walls thicker than you

4638
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
um make the walls thicker than you
 

4639
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,370
um make the walls thicker than you
normally make it make it out of a

4640
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:28,380
normally make it make it out of a
 

4641
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,870
normally make it make it out of a
material that will ablate away that will

4642
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:29,880
material that will ablate away that will
 

4643
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,070
material that will ablate away that will
kind of chip away and take some of the

4644
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
kind of chip away and take some of the
 

4645
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,810
kind of chip away and take some of the
heat away with it it's very again

4646
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:32,820
heat away with it it's very again
 

4647
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,850
heat away with it it's very again
primitive and it's actually what SpaceX

4648
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:34,860
primitive and it's actually what SpaceX
 

4649
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,189
primitive and it's actually what SpaceX
first used on their first Merlin engines

4650
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
first used on their first Merlin engines
 

4651
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,290
first used on their first Merlin engines
they used ablative cooling

4652
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:39,300
they used ablative cooling
 

4653
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,390
they used ablative cooling
um so it's basically a carbon nozzle and

4654
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:41,400
um so it's basically a carbon nozzle and
 

4655
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,970
um so it's basically a carbon nozzle and
you just let it get the carbon the inner

4656
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:43,980
you just let it get the carbon the inner
 

4657
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,649
you just let it get the carbon the inner
layer of the of the engine was not of

4658
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:45,659
layer of the of the engine was not of
 

4659
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:47,330
layer of the of the engine was not of
his carbon and you just let it get

4660
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:47,340
his carbon and you just let it get
 

4661
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,550
his carbon and you just let it get
chewed away and eaten away and that's

4662
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:49,560
chewed away and eaten away and that's
 

4663
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,370
chewed away and eaten away and that's
just something you factor in uh it's not

4664
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:52,380
just something you factor in uh it's not
 

4665
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,729
just something you factor in uh it's not
a very elegant and it's definitely not

4666
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:55,739
a very elegant and it's definitely not
 

4667
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:57,830
a very elegant and it's definitely not
reusable in that sense so there's

4668
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
reusable in that sense so there's
 

4669
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,470
reusable in that sense so there's
probably really good models about like

4670
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
probably really good models about like
 

4671
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,510
probably really good models about like
how it melts away the rate at which

4672
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:02,520
how it melts away the rate at which
 

4673
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,910
how it melts away the rate at which
melts away to know what thickness yeah

4674
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:04,920
melts away to know what thickness yeah
 

4675
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,850
melts away to know what thickness yeah
but boy is it dangerous right this is

4676
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:07,860
but boy is it dangerous right this is
 

4677
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,250
but boy is it dangerous right this is
part of the design it seems so silly so

4678
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:10,260
part of the design it seems so silly so
 

4679
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,649
part of the design it seems so silly so
obviously you probably you know it's

4680
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:12,659
obviously you probably you know it's
 

4681
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,030
obviously you probably you know it's
again it's not the most elegant and the

4682
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:14,040
again it's not the most elegant and the
 

4683
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,950
again it's not the most elegant and the
problem too your geometry physically is

4684
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:15,960
problem too your geometry physically is
 

4685
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,390
problem too your geometry physically is
changing too because as you're eroding

4686
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:17,400
changing too because as you're eroding
 

4687
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,669
changing too because as you're eroding
the walls now things like your expansion

4688
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:19,679
the walls now things like your expansion
 

4689
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,350
the walls now things like your expansion
ratio or the ratio between your throat

4690
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
ratio or the ratio between your throat
 

4691
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,270
ratio or the ratio between your throat
and the nozzle exit is changing yeah

4692
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
and the nozzle exit is changing yeah
 

4693
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,130
and the nozzle exit is changing yeah
because the thickness like the throat

4694
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,140
because the thickness like the throat
 

4695
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,750
because the thickness like the throat
diameter is actually like everything is

4696
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:26,760
diameter is actually like everything is
 

4697
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,510
diameter is actually like everything is
changing so it's it's not great it might

4698
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
changing so it's it's not great it might
 

4699
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,250
changing so it's it's not great it might
might not be melting away uniformly

4700
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:31,260
might not be melting away uniformly
 

4701
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,870
might not be melting away uniformly
there could be some like weird pockets

4702
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
there could be some like weird pockets
 

4703
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,330
there could be some like weird pockets
for aerodynamics stuff it's just a bunch

4704
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:35,340
for aerodynamics stuff it's just a bunch
 

4705
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,209
for aerodynamics stuff it's just a bunch
of chaos just can which I can't imagine

4706
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:38,219
of chaos just can which I can't imagine
 

4707
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:40,130
of chaos just can which I can't imagine
having to like figure all that stuff out

4708
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:40,140
having to like figure all that stuff out
 

4709
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,870
having to like figure all that stuff out
honestly yeah

4710
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:41,880
honestly yeah
 

4711
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,570
honestly yeah
um so the uh the more elegant thing to

4712
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:44,580
um so the uh the more elegant thing to
 

4713
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,770
um so the uh the more elegant thing to
do there's there's a couple other things

4714
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:45,780
do there's there's a couple other things
 

4715
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,209
do there's there's a couple other things
you can do but the kind of the most

4716
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:47,219
you can do but the kind of the most
 

4717
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:48,410
you can do but the kind of the most
common one especially when we're dealing

4718
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:48,420
common one especially when we're dealing
 

4719
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,510
common one especially when we're dealing
with liquid field Rockets is something

4720
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:50,520
with liquid field Rockets is something
 

4721
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,550
with liquid field Rockets is something
called regeneratively Cooling and the

4722
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
called regeneratively Cooling and the
 

4723
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,709
called regeneratively Cooling and the
the idea is you basically just flow fuel

4724
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
the idea is you basically just flow fuel
 

4725
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,770
the idea is you basically just flow fuel
or fuel or oxidizer through the walls of

4726
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:57,780
or fuel or oxidizer through the walls of
 

4727
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,229
or fuel or oxidizer through the walls of
the of the nozzle on the chamber

4728
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:00,239
the of the nozzle on the chamber
 

4729
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,570
the of the nozzle on the chamber
um before they go through like into the

4730
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:02,580
um before they go through like into the
 

4731
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,430
um before they go through like into the
injector or into the actual combustion

4732
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:04,440
injector or into the actual combustion
 

4733
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,850
injector or into the actual combustion
chamber by doing that your your taking

4734
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:07,860
chamber by doing that your your taking
 

4735
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,590
chamber by doing that your your taking
heat out of the you know you're taking

4736
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:09,600
heat out of the you know you're taking
 

4737
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,510
heat out of the you know you're taking
heat out of the metal the walls and

4738
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
heat out of the metal the walls and
 

4739
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,830
heat out of the metal the walls and
you're putting it in the propellant so

4740
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:12,840
you're putting it in the propellant so
 

4741
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,149
you're putting it in the propellant so
you're typically heating the propellant

4742
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
you're typically heating the propellant
 

4743
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,410
you're typically heating the propellant
up which is remember when I said there's

4744
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:15,420
up which is remember when I said there's
 

4745
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,630
up which is remember when I said there's
gas interaction versus a liquid like

4746
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:17,640
gas interaction versus a liquid like
 

4747
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,610
gas interaction versus a liquid like
liquid gas lots of times even if you

4748
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:19,620
liquid gas lots of times even if you
 

4749
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,250
liquid gas lots of times even if you
pump them both that you know as

4750
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:22,260
pump them both that you know as
 

4751
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,169
pump them both that you know as
um they you know both being pumped as

4752
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:24,179
um they you know both being pumped as
 

4753
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:26,090
um they you know both being pumped as
liquids by the time it goes through the

4754
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,100
liquids by the time it goes through the
 

4755
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,470
liquids by the time it goes through the
walls of the chamber lots of times one

4756
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:27,480
walls of the chamber lots of times one
 

4757
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,630
walls of the chamber lots of times one
of them is Phase changed into a gas so

4758
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:29,640
of them is Phase changed into a gas so
 

4759
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,950
of them is Phase changed into a gas so
now you do have that gas liquid

4760
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:30,960
now you do have that gas liquid
 

4761
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,229
now you do have that gas liquid
interaction that's because they're using

4762
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:33,239
interaction that's because they're using
 

4763
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:35,510
interaction that's because they're using
that the fuel or the oxidizer to to cool

4764
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:35,520
that the fuel or the oxidizer to to cool
 

4765
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,490
that the fuel or the oxidizer to to cool
the walls of the of the engine so when

4766
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:37,500
the walls of the of the engine so when
 

4767
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,689
the walls of the of the engine so when
you look at a rocket engine although it

4768
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:38,699
you look at a rocket engine although it
 

4769
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:41,270
you look at a rocket engine although it
looks like you know a nice beautifully

4770
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
looks like you know a nice beautifully
 

4771
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,209
looks like you know a nice beautifully
uniform cylinder you know smooth thing

4772
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:44,219
uniform cylinder you know smooth thing
 

4773
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:45,830
uniform cylinder you know smooth thing
um there's either there's oftentimes

4774
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:45,840
um there's either there's oftentimes
 

4775
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,410
um there's either there's oftentimes
like uh the channels actually like

4776
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:48,420
like uh the channels actually like
 

4777
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,630
like uh the channels actually like
milled into the walls that they run fuel

4778
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:50,640
milled into the walls that they run fuel
 

4779
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,649
milled into the walls that they run fuel
through and even though they're tight

4780
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:51,659
through and even though they're tight
 

4781
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:52,850
through and even though they're tight
you know they can be like two three

4782
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:52,860
you know they can be like two three
 

4783
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,709
you know they can be like two three
millimeters thick they'll actually still

4784
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
millimeters thick they'll actually still
 

4785
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,330
millimeters thick they'll actually still
have a channel that goes down on u-turns

4786
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:56,340
have a channel that goes down on u-turns
 

4787
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,610
have a channel that goes down on u-turns
and comes around and comes back all the

4788
01:22:58,610 --> 01:22:58,620
and comes around and comes back all the
 

4789
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,930
and comes around and comes back all the
way down to the tip of the nozzle and

4790
01:22:59,930 --> 01:22:59,940
way down to the tip of the nozzle and
 

4791
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,850
way down to the tip of the nozzle and
everything so it's it's just insane that

4792
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:01,860
everything so it's it's just insane that
 

4793
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,890
everything so it's it's just insane that
you know that that's pre-designed and

4794
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:03,900
you know that that's pre-designed and
 

4795
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,649
you know that that's pre-designed and
that's that's like uh so they design

4796
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:06,659
that's that's like uh so they design
 

4797
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,930
that's that's like uh so they design
those channels yeah there's probably

4798
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:08,940
those channels yeah there's probably
 

4799
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,970
those channels yeah there's probably
some optimization there and like how the

4800
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:10,980
some optimization there and like how the
 

4801
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,530
some optimization there and like how the
flow happens well especially because you

4802
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:12,540
flow happens well especially because you
 

4803
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,270
flow happens well especially because you
you're thinking about a conical thing or

4804
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,280
you're thinking about a conical thing or
 

4805
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,189
you're thinking about a conical thing or
like a some iconical thing where the the

4806
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:16,199
like a some iconical thing where the the
 

4807
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,990
like a some iconical thing where the the
area is getting smaller and smaller and

4808
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
area is getting smaller and smaller and
 

4809
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,850
area is getting smaller and smaller and
smaller you're flowing the same amount

4810
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:19,860
smaller you're flowing the same amount
 

4811
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,890
smaller you're flowing the same amount
of propellant through it as you are down

4812
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:21,900
of propellant through it as you are down
 

4813
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,390
of propellant through it as you are down
you know what I mean like the propellant

4814
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:23,400
you know what I mean like the propellant
 

4815
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,890
you know what I mean like the propellant
has to so they have all these unique

4816
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:24,900
has to so they have all these unique
 

4817
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,810
has to so they have all these unique
things like you know sometimes uh

4818
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:26,820
things like you know sometimes uh
 

4819
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,149
things like you know sometimes uh
different manifolds where they'll inject

4820
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:29,159
different manifolds where they'll inject
 

4821
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,189
different manifolds where they'll inject
more or less fuel in certain areas and

4822
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
more or less fuel in certain areas and
 

4823
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,470
more or less fuel in certain areas and
there must be like propellant simulation

4824
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:33,480
there must be like propellant simulation
 

4825
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,870
there must be like propellant simulation
software because they can't surely can't

4826
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:35,880
software because they can't surely can't
 

4827
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,830
software because they can't surely can't
like

4828
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:36,840
like
 

4829
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,770
like
test this on actual physical

4830
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:39,780
test this on actual physical
 

4831
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,510
test this on actual physical
well back in the day they had to just

4832
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
well back in the day they had to just
 

4833
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,790
well back in the day they had to just
build it well you mean back back in the

4834
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:43,800
build it well you mean back back in the
 

4835
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,750
build it well you mean back back in the
day

4836
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:44,760
day
 

4837
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,169

walked up uphill in both ways it was

4838
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:48,179
walked up uphill in both ways it was
 

4839
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:51,649
walked up uphill in both ways it was
like I mean like any anything back in

4840
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:51,659
like I mean like any anything back in
 

4841
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:54,290
like I mean like any anything back in
the day before computers were you like

4842
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:54,300
the day before computers were you like
 

4843
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,510
the day before computers were you like
like

4844
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:56,520
like
 

4845
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,550
like
you just had to do it and like your

4846
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:58,560
you just had to do it and like your
 

4847
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,350
you just had to do it and like your
simulation or modeling was like a sheet

4848
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:00,360
simulation or modeling was like a sheet
 

4849
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,729
simulation or modeling was like a sheet
of paper where you're like calculating

4850
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:01,739
of paper where you're like calculating
 

4851
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:05,090
of paper where you're like calculating
stuff well but you can heat flux you

4852
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:05,100
stuff well but you can heat flux you
 

4853
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,770
stuff well but you can heat flux you
know like you can literally see how much

4854
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:06,780
know like you can literally see how much
 

4855
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,630
know like you can literally see how much
energy and how much heat is inside the

4856
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:08,640
energy and how much heat is inside the
 

4857
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,790
energy and how much heat is inside the
combustion chamber how much you know and

4858
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
combustion chamber how much you know and
 

4859
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,470
combustion chamber how much you know and
that is a a measurable thing even

4860
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
that is a a measurable thing even
 

4861
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,790
that is a a measurable thing even
without a computer now I'm not near

4862
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:13,800
without a computer now I'm not near
 

4863
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,229
without a computer now I'm not near
smart enough to do any of this like I've

4864
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:15,239
smart enough to do any of this like I've
 

4865
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,689
smart enough to do any of this like I've
never tried measuring the heat flux of

4866
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:17,699
never tried measuring the heat flux of
 

4867
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:18,709
never tried measuring the heat flux of
anything I barely even know what that

4868
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
anything I barely even know what that
 

4869
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,149
anything I barely even know what that
means I'm just smart enough

01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159

 

4871
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,370

to be but that is something that people

4872
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:25,380
to be but that is something that people
 

4873
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,689
to be but that is something that people
would calculate and they find out okay

4874
01:24:26,689 --> 01:24:26,699
would calculate and they find out okay
 

4875
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,850
would calculate and they find out okay
copper you know does a better job of

um so yeah you know materials people

4884
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:37,320
um so yeah you know materials people
 

4885
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,090
um so yeah you know materials people
like I've met just in all walks of life

4886
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,100
like I've met just in all walks of life
 

4887
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,950
like I've met just in all walks of life
especially just through MIT through

especially just through MIT through
 

4889
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,010
especially just through MIT through
everywhere whereas some people

4890
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:46,020
everywhere whereas some people
 

4891
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:50,870
everywhere whereas some people
are just like a hundred X smarter than

4892
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:50,880
are just like a hundred X smarter than
 

4893
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,910
are just like a hundred X smarter than
anyone you've ever met at a particular

anyone you've ever met at a particular
 

4895
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,310
anyone you've ever met at a particular
thing like you mentioned copper they'll

4896
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,320
thing like you mentioned copper they'll
 

4897
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,530
thing like you mentioned copper they'll
know the heat dissipation through

4898
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:57,540
know the heat dissipation through
 

4899
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,790
know the heat dissipation through
different materials they'll understand

4900
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
different materials they'll understand
 

4901
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,490
different materials they'll understand
that like more than it's like holy [\h__\h]

it's possible for a human being to

4904
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:03,719
it's possible for a human being to
 

4905
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:05,930
it's possible for a human being to
deeply understand a thing dude Aerospace

4906
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:05,940
deeply understand a thing dude Aerospace
 

4907
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,149
deeply understand a thing dude Aerospace
is full of that you'll have people that

4908
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
is full of that you'll have people that
 

4909
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:12,649
is full of that you'll have people that
are so niche in some thing that no one

4910
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:12,659
are so niche in some thing that no one
 

4911
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,090
are so niche in some thing that no one
like the average person has never even

4912
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:14,100
like the average person has never even
 

4913
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,130
like the average person has never even
remotely thought of yet this person has

4914
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:16,140
remotely thought of yet this person has
 

4915
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,890
remotely thought of yet this person has
done it 40 000 different ways in a you

4916
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:18,900
done it 40 000 different ways in a you
 

4917
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,750
done it 40 000 different ways in a you
know in a an environment being like well

4918
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:20,760
know in a an environment being like well
 

4919
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,370
know in a an environment being like well
we found out that if we turn it four

4920
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:22,380
we found out that if we turn it four
 

4921
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,649
we found out that if we turn it four
degrees that way and add four percent

4922
01:25:24,649 --> 01:25:24,659
degrees that way and add four percent

degrees that way and add four percent
niobium you know like just things you're

4924
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:26,699
niobium you know like just things you're
 

4925

like
 

4927
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,410
like
what is your life and how do you know

4928
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:30,420
what is your life and how do you know
 

4929
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,570
what is your life and how do you know
this and the funny thing about them they

4930
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:32,580
this and the funny thing about them they
 

4931
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,270
this and the funny thing about them they
usually don't think it's a big deal yeah

4932
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
usually don't think it's a big deal yeah
 

4933
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,950
usually don't think it's a big deal yeah
they're usually like they're they're so

4934
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:36,960
they're usually like they're they're so
 

4935
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,930
they're usually like they're they're so
nonchalant about it that if you don't

4936
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:38,940
nonchalant about it that if you don't
 

4937
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:42,169
nonchalant about it that if you don't
actually you have to know enough you

4938
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:42,179
actually you have to know enough you
 

4939
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,669
actually you have to know enough you
actually have to know quite a lot to

4940
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
actually have to know quite a lot to
 

4941
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,169
actually have to know quite a lot to
appreciate

4942
01:25:45,169 --> 01:25:45,179
appreciate
 

4943
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:47,330
appreciate
how much more they know yeah because

4944
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:47,340
how much more they know yeah because
 

4945
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,709
how much more they know yeah because
otherwise you won't even notice it

4946
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719
otherwise you won't even notice it
 

4947
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,570
otherwise you won't even notice it
because there are popular culture

4948
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:50,580
because there are popular culture
 

4949
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:54,290
because there are popular culture
doesn't celebrate the intricacies of uh

4950
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:54,300
doesn't celebrate the intricacies of uh
 

4951
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,689
doesn't celebrate the intricacies of uh
scientific or engineering Mastery which

4952
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:56,699
scientific or engineering Mastery which
 

4953
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,129
scientific or engineering Mastery which
is interesting there's all these people

4954
01:25:58,129 --> 01:25:58,139
is interesting there's all these people
 

4955
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:00,229
is interesting there's all these people
that lurk in the shadows they're just

4956
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:00,239
that lurk in the shadows they're just
 

4957
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,209
that lurk in the shadows they're just
Geniuses yes like you see you'll have

4958
01:26:02,209 --> 01:26:02,219
Geniuses yes like you see you'll have
 

4959
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:04,490
Geniuses yes like you see you'll have
like the LeBrons who are like good at

4960
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:04,500
like the LeBrons who are like good at
 

4961
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,870
like the LeBrons who are like good at
basketball so we understand that they're

4962
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:05,880
basketball so we understand that they're
 

4963
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,790
basketball so we understand that they're
good at basketball they do this thing

4964
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:07,800
good at basketball they do this thing
 

4965
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,290
good at basketball they do this thing
with the ball and the hoop and they do

4966
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:09,300
with the ball and the hoop and they do
 

4967
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,149
with the ball and the hoop and they do
like it really well better than a lot of

4968
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:11,159
like it really well better than a lot of
 

4969
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:12,890
like it really well better than a lot of
other people under pressure like we

4970
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:12,900
other people under pressure like we
 

4971
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,990
other people under pressure like we
celebrated big public spectacles yeah

4972
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,000

01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:02,280
some point you realize nothing goes
 

5129
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,590
some point you realize nothing goes
faster and it's louder and makes more

5130
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
faster and it's louder and makes more
 

5131
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,149
faster and it's louder and makes more
power or the rocket you know I think

5132
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:05,159
power or the rocket you know I think
 

5133
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,649
power or the rocket you know I think
that's I think that's kind of where

5134
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:06,659
that's I think that's kind of where
 

5135
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:08,510
that's I think that's kind of where
where I eventually just ended up you

5136
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:08,520
where I eventually just ended up you
 

5137
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,010
where I eventually just ended up you
know wound up there just because there

5138
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:10,020
know wound up there just because there
 

5139
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,750
know wound up there just because there
is nothing cooler than that yeah that's

5140
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
is nothing cooler than that yeah that's
 

5141
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,370
is nothing cooler than that yeah that's
the ultimate level it reaches the car

5142
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:13,380
the ultimate level it reaches the car
 

5143
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,490
the ultimate level it reaches the car
guy is to become a rock guy yeah 100 and

5144
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:16,500
guy is to become a rock guy yeah 100 and
 

5145
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,870
guy is to become a rock guy yeah 100 and
at some point some Car Guys literally

5146
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:17,880
at some point some Car Guys literally
 

5147
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,430
at some point some Car Guys literally
become rocket guys and strap Rockets to

5148
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
become rocket guys and strap Rockets to
 

5149
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,689
become rocket guys and strap Rockets to
cars and try and break land speed

5150
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:20,699
cars and try and break land speed
 

5151
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:22,729
cars and try and break land speed
records you know like it's yeah it's

5152
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:22,739
records you know like it's yeah it's
 

5153
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:25,729
records you know like it's yeah it's
it's the same universe here and yeah uh

5154
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:25,739
it's the same universe here and yeah uh
 

5155
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:28,250
it's the same universe here and yeah uh
so Elon with your conversation with him

5156
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:28,260
so Elon with your conversation with him
 

5157
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,470
so Elon with your conversation with him
on on the Raptor too was talking about

5158
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
on on the Raptor too was talking about
 

5159
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,689
on on the Raptor too was talking about
what you were talking about like there's

5160
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:32,699
what you were talking about like there's
 

5161
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:35,090
what you were talking about like there's
an excessive amount of cooling to be on

5162
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:35,100
an excessive amount of cooling to be on
 

5163
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,590
an excessive amount of cooling to be on
the safe side as you're developing the

5164
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:36,600
the safe side as you're developing the
 

5165
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,450
the safe side as you're developing the
engine uh what kind of cooling was that

5166
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:38,460
engine uh what kind of cooling was that
 

5167
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,310
engine uh what kind of cooling was that
so that would be film cooling so

5168
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
so that would be film cooling so
 

5169
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,050
so that would be film cooling so
remember how a little bit ago we were

5170
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:42,060
remember how a little bit ago we were
 

5171
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,370
remember how a little bit ago we were
talking about keeping the turbine from

5172
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:43,380
talking about keeping the turbine from
 

5173
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,950
talking about keeping the turbine from
melting you can just run it off of like

5174
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:45,960
melting you can just run it off of like
 

5175
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,169
melting you can just run it off of like
off nominal basically off you know

5176
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:48,179
off nominal basically off you know
 

5177
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:50,209
off nominal basically off you know
typically fuel rich just run more fuel

5178
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:50,219
typically fuel rich just run more fuel
 

5179
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,189
typically fuel rich just run more fuel
through that so it's cool enough you can

5180
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:52,199
through that so it's cool enough you can
 

5181
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,050
through that so it's cool enough you can
actually do that locally kind of in your

5182
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:54,060
actually do that locally kind of in your
 

5183
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,090
actually do that locally kind of in your
engine so you can keep it so you know

5184
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:56,100
engine so you can keep it so you know
 

5185
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,970
engine so you can keep it so you know
imagine a combustion chamber and the top

5186
01:29:58,970 --> 01:29:58,980
imagine a combustion chamber and the top
 

5187
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,470
imagine a combustion chamber and the top
of it's just a flat like imagine a

5188
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
of it's just a flat like imagine a
 

5189
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,510
of it's just a flat like imagine a
shower head and then you have like you

5190
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:02,520
shower head and then you have like you
 

5191
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,010
shower head and then you have like you
know the combustion chamber attached to

5192
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:04,020
know the combustion chamber attached to
 

5193
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,990
know the combustion chamber attached to
it the Outer Perimeter there the the

5194
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
it the Outer Perimeter there the the
 

5195
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,610
it the Outer Perimeter there the the
part where the flame front would be

5196
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:07,620
part where the flame front would be
 

5197
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:08,990
part where the flame front would be
touching the walls you can actually have

5198
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,000
touching the walls you can actually have
 

5199
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,390
touching the walls you can actually have
just more fuel injectors so you're

5200
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:11,400
just more fuel injectors so you're
 

5201
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,870
just more fuel injectors so you're
injecting locally of more fuel-rich Zone

5202
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
injecting locally of more fuel-rich Zone
 

5203
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,390
injecting locally of more fuel-rich Zone
along the entire nozzle and that would

5204
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,400
along the entire nozzle and that would
 

5205
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,030
along the entire nozzle and that would
be called film cooling so it's less

5206
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:20,040
be called film cooling so it's less
 

5207
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,110
be called film cooling so it's less
efficient though again you're kind of

5208
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,120
efficient though again you're kind of
 

5209
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,970
efficient though again you're kind of
wasting fuel there's fuel that's running

5210
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:22,980
wasting fuel there's fuel that's running
 

5211
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,490
wasting fuel there's fuel that's running
you know and your your mixture ratio is

5212
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:25,500
you know and your your mixture ratio is
 

5213
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,890
you know and your your mixture ratio is
off but only for a little portion of

5214
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:27,900
off but only for a little portion of
 

5215
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,750
off but only for a little portion of
your the big picture you know so that's

5216
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
your the big picture you know so that's
 

5217
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,189
your the big picture you know so that's
one of those compromises like you can do

5218
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:31,199
one of those compromises like you can do
 

5219
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,470
one of those compromises like you can do
additional film cooling to make sure

5220
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:33,480
additional film cooling to make sure
 

5221
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,510
additional film cooling to make sure
you're not melting your engine uh you

5222
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:35,520
you're not melting your engine uh you
 

5223
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,129
you're not melting your engine uh you
know but at the cost of performance you

5224
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:37,139
know but at the cost of performance you
 

5225
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:40,010
know but at the cost of performance you
actually but you can also be smart and

5226
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,020
actually but you can also be smart and
 

5227
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,570
actually but you can also be smart and
use film cooling you know there's fun

5228
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:41,580
use film cooling you know there's fun
 

5229
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,910
use film cooling you know there's fun
little clever tricks for instance you'll

5230
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:43,920
little clever tricks for instance you'll
 

5231
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,850
little clever tricks for instance you'll
notice on the F1 engine that was on the

5232
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:46,860
notice on the F1 engine that was on the
 

5233
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:49,610
notice on the F1 engine that was on the
Saturn V you know the biggest uh rocket

5234
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:49,620
Saturn V you know the biggest uh rocket
 

5235
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,950
Saturn V you know the biggest uh rocket
that had been built to date prior now to

5236
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:51,960
that had been built to date prior now to
 

5237
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,450
that had been built to date prior now to
Starship

5238
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:53,460
Starship
 

5239
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,390
Starship
um the F1 has this huge huge huge

5240
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
um the F1 has this huge huge huge
 

5241
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,610
um the F1 has this huge huge huge
engines there's five of them on the

5242
01:30:58,610 --> 01:30:58,620
engines there's five of them on the
 

5243
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,550
engines there's five of them on the
Saturn V and you'll notice that like the

5244
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:01,560
Saturn V and you'll notice that like the
 

5245
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,890
Saturn V and you'll notice that like the
gas generator has a pipe that comes down

5246
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:03,900
gas generator has a pipe that comes down
 

5247
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,110
gas generator has a pipe that comes down
and then it actually splits off in a

5248
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:06,120
and then it actually splits off in a
 

5249
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,090
and then it actually splits off in a
manifold and wraps around part of the

5250
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,100
manifold and wraps around part of the
 

5251
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,050
manifold and wraps around part of the
nozzle

5252
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:09,060
nozzle
 

5253
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,850
nozzle
and that manifold

5254
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:10,860
and that manifold
 

5255
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,510
and that manifold
takes the hot gas from the turbine which

5256
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:14,520
takes the hot gas from the turbine which
 

5257
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,189
takes the hot gas from the turbine which
which is actually I mean it's not hot

5258
01:31:16,189 --> 01:31:16,199
which is actually I mean it's not hot
 

5259
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:18,169
which is actually I mean it's not hot
it's actually cold gas compared to the

5260
01:31:18,169 --> 01:31:18,179
it's actually cold gas compared to the
 

5261
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:20,030
it's actually cold gas compared to the
combustion chamber but it's you know in

5262
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:20,040
combustion chamber but it's you know in
 

5263
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,530
combustion chamber but it's you know in
human terms it's still you wouldn't want

5264
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:21,540
human terms it's still you wouldn't want
 

5265
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,990
human terms it's still you wouldn't want
to put your hand in it you know not live

5266
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,000
to put your hand in it you know not live
 

5267
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,290
to put your hand in it you know not live
um and it actually pipes that gas into

5268
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:27,300
um and it actually pipes that gas into
 

5269
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,850
um and it actually pipes that gas into
the nozzle so that it creates a film

5270
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:28,860
the nozzle so that it creates a film
 

5271
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:32,510
the nozzle so that it creates a film
cooling a an actual boundary layer of

5272
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:32,520
cooling a an actual boundary layer of
 

5273
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,970
cooling a an actual boundary layer of
cooler gas against the hotter combustion

5274
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:34,980
cooler gas against the hotter combustion
 

5275
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,310
cooler gas against the hotter combustion
chamber gas so basically repurposing

5276
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:37,320
chamber gas so basically repurposing
 

5277
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,410
chamber gas so basically repurposing
that gas that was normally wasted and

5278
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:39,420
that gas that was normally wasted and
 

5279
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,570
that gas that was normally wasted and
they pump it back into the engine and

5280
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:41,580
they pump it back into the engine and
 

5281
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,250
they pump it back into the engine and
then into the nozzle like kind of

5282
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:43,260
then into the nozzle like kind of
 

5283
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,990
then into the nozzle like kind of
further down so the trick there is it

5284
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:45,000
further down so the trick there is it
 

5285
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,890
further down so the trick there is it
has to be

5286
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:45,900
has to be
 

5287
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,530
has to be
far enough down that the pressure at the

5288
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:48,540
far enough down that the pressure at the
 

5289
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,669
far enough down that the pressure at the
in the nozzle because remember as the

5290
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
in the nozzle because remember as the
 

5291
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,750
in the nozzle because remember as the
nozzle gets bigger and bigger and bigger

5292
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:50,760
nozzle gets bigger and bigger and bigger
 

5293
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,890
nozzle gets bigger and bigger and bigger
the pressure is getting lower and lower

5294
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:51,900
the pressure is getting lower and lower
 

5295
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,689
the pressure is getting lower and lower
and the temperature is getting lower and

5296
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:53,699
and the temperature is getting lower and
 

5297
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:55,010
and the temperature is getting lower and
lower so you have to find this trade-off

5298
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:55,020
lower so you have to find this trade-off
 

5299
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,370
lower so you have to find this trade-off
point where the pressure is is lower

5300
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:58,380
point where the pressure is is lower
 

5301
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,729
point where the pressure is is lower
than that gas from the turbine and then

5302
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:01,739
than that gas from the turbine and then
 

5303
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:03,950
than that gas from the turbine and then
you pump it in and it's cooler than the

5304
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:03,960
you pump it in and it's cooler than the
 

5305
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,229
you pump it in and it's cooler than the
then the gas still is in the nozzle and

5306
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
then the gas still is in the nozzle and
 

5307
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,090
then the gas still is in the nozzle and
it can help not melt your nozzle so

5308
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:08,100
it can help not melt your nozzle so
 

5309
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,709
it can help not melt your nozzle so
you'll notice that the F1 is actually a

5310
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:09,719
you'll notice that the F1 is actually a
 

5311
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:11,570
you'll notice that the F1 is actually a
good example of regen cooling so the

5312
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:11,580
good example of regen cooling so the
 

5313
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,669
good example of regen cooling so the
chamber walls you can physically see the

5314
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
chamber walls you can physically see the
 

5315
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,050
chamber walls you can physically see the
pipes actually

5316
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:15,060
pipes actually
 

5317
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,370
pipes actually
um on the F1 because it's so big and

5318
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:16,380
um on the F1 because it's so big and
 

5319
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,229
um on the F1 because it's so big and
they just literally used pipes and bent

5320
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
they just literally used pipes and bent
 

5321
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,510
they just literally used pipes and bent
them and you can see the the coolant

5322
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:20,520
them and you can see the the coolant
 

5323
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,649
them and you can see the the coolant
channels all the way up and down the

5324
01:32:21,649 --> 01:32:21,659
channels all the way up and down the
 

5325
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:23,510
channels all the way up and down the
engine until you get to that manifold

5326
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:23,520
engine until you get to that manifold
 

5327
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,030
engine until you get to that manifold
then from there on it just has what's

5328
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,040
then from there on it just has what's
 

5329
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,649
then from there on it just has what's
called a nozzle extension and it keeps

5330
01:32:27,649 --> 01:32:27,659
called a nozzle extension and it keeps
 

5331
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:29,689
called a nozzle extension and it keeps
going and going and going and that

5332
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:29,699
going and going and going and that
 

5333
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:31,490
going and going and going and that
section of nozzle is cooled by the film

5334
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:31,500
section of nozzle is cooled by the film
 

5335
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,830
section of nozzle is cooled by the film
cooling of the gas generator

5336
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
cooling of the gas generator
 

5337
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,669
cooling of the gas generator
I mean the aerodynamics of cooler gas

5338
01:32:37,669 --> 01:32:37,679
I mean the aerodynamics of cooler gas
 

5339
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,070
I mean the aerodynamics of cooler gas
and the high gas

5340
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
and the high gas
 

5341
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,010
and the high gas
because you have to have this kind of

5342
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:42,020
because you have to have this kind of
 

5343
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:45,169
because you have to have this kind of
layer right to protective layer of cool

5344
01:32:45,169 --> 01:32:45,179
layer right to protective layer of cool
 

5345
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:47,510
layer right to protective layer of cool
like understanding that obviously

5346
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,520
like understanding that obviously
 

5347
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,070
like understanding that obviously
probably has to do in modern times

5348
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:49,080
probably has to do in modern times
 

5349
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,570
probably has to do in modern times
there's probably really good simulation

5350
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:50,580
there's probably really good simulation
 

5351
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:53,510
there's probably really good simulation
of aerodynamics but and to do it in

5352
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:53,520
of aerodynamics but and to do it in
 

5353
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,149
of aerodynamics but and to do it in
terms of pressure too like um to make

5354
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:56,159
terms of pressure too like um to make
 

5355
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,010
terms of pressure too like um to make
sure it's in the right place yeah that

5356
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:58,020
sure it's in the right place yeah that
 

5357
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,930
sure it's in the right place yeah that
doesn't like go back up go backwards

5358
01:32:59,930 --> 01:32:59,940
doesn't like go back up go backwards
 

5359
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,090
doesn't like go back up go backwards
exactly if they have that manifold even

5360
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:02,100
exactly if they have that manifold even
 

5361
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,030
exactly if they have that manifold even
six inches too high on that nozzle yeah

5362
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,040
six inches too high on that nozzle yeah
 

5363
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,950
six inches too high on that nozzle yeah
it's just going to go upwards you know

5364
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:06,960
it's just going to go upwards you know
 

5365
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,570
it's just going to go upwards you know
and pressure always wants to flow from

5366
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:08,580
and pressure always wants to flow from
 

5367
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,610
and pressure always wants to flow from
high to low the number of options you

5368
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:10,620
high to low the number of options you
 

5369
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,129
high to low the number of options you
have here that result in it going boom

5370
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:13,139
have here that result in it going boom
 

5371
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:16,850
have here that result in it going boom
is very large near Infinity yeah

5372
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:16,860
is very large near Infinity yeah
 

5373
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,350
is very large near Infinity yeah
especially because I mean you can't do

5374
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:18,360
especially because I mean you can't do
 

5375
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:21,229
especially because I mean you can't do
like a small model of it maybe you can

5376
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:21,239
like a small model of it maybe you can
 

5377
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:23,030
like a small model of it maybe you can
no you can't you can't really scale very

5378
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
no you can't you can't really scale very
 

5379
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,010
no you can't you can't really scale very
well no you have to you have to do the

5380
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:25,020
well no you have to you have to do the
 

5381
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,870
well no you have to you have to do the
full testing and that's why you have all

5382
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
full testing and that's why you have all
 

5383
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,149
full testing and that's why you have all
the kind of that's

5384
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:29,159
the kind of that's
 

5385
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:31,370
the kind of that's
that's why you have a Starship all the

5386
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:31,380
that's why you have a Starship all the
 

5387
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,010
that's why you have a Starship all the
tests that you know you think why would

5388
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:34,020
tests that you know you think why would
 

5389
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,169
tests that you know you think why would
you need to do so many static fires and

5390
01:33:36,169 --> 01:33:36,179
you need to do so many static fires and
 

5391
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:37,850
you need to do so many static fires and
so many tests and why is it failing so

5392
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:37,860
so many tests and why is it failing so
 

5393
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,010
so many tests and why is it failing so
many times can't you get it right but

5394
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:40,020
many times can't you get it right but
 

5395
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,750
many times can't you get it right but
like it's very tough to get it right

5396
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
like it's very tough to get it right
 

5397
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,669
like it's very tough to get it right
well and when you're pushing the

5398
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
well and when you're pushing the
 

5399
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,010
well and when you're pushing the
boundaries you want to know where and

5400
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:46,020
boundaries you want to know where and
 

5401
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,270
boundaries you want to know where and
how it's going to fail that's right so

5402
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
how it's going to fail that's right so
 

5403
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,530
how it's going to fail that's right so
you can engineer around them so that's

5404
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:48,540
you can engineer around them so that's
 

5405
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,810
you can engineer around them so that's
that's a luxury that SpaceX does have

5406
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:50,820
that's a luxury that SpaceX does have
 

5407
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,189
that's a luxury that SpaceX does have
with the scale of raptor you know

5408
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
with the scale of raptor you know
 

5409
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:53,390
with the scale of raptor you know
they're building Raptor cheaper than

5410
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:53,400
they're building Raptor cheaper than
 

5411
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,250
they're building Raptor cheaper than
probably almost any other engine you

5412
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,260
probably almost any other engine you
 

5413
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:56,570
probably almost any other engine you
know maybe beside some of their own at

5414
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:56,580
know maybe beside some of their own at
 

5415
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,250
know maybe beside some of their own at
least at that scale

5416
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:58,260
least at that scale
 

5417
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,870
least at that scale
um then before they're testing you know

5418
01:33:59,870 --> 01:33:59,880
um then before they're testing you know
 

5419
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,750
um then before they're testing you know
I think since last March or last April

5420
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:02,760
I think since last March or last April
 

5421
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,629
I think since last March or last April
they've tested a thousand Raptor you

5422
01:34:05,629 --> 01:34:05,639
they've tested a thousand Raptor you
 

5423
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,790
they've tested a thousand Raptor you
know a thousand engine fires I guess not

5424
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:07,800
know a thousand engine fires I guess not
 

5425
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,470
know a thousand engine fires I guess not
just Raptors but

5426
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:09,480
just Raptors but
 

5427
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,270
just Raptors but
um you know that's just an insane amount

5428
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
um you know that's just an insane amount
 

5429
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,129
um you know that's just an insane amount
of data and an insane amount of edge

5430
01:34:13,129 --> 01:34:13,139
of data and an insane amount of edge
 

5431
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:14,810
of data and an insane amount of edge
cases to learn oh my God we found out

5432
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:14,820
cases to learn oh my God we found out
 

5433
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,189
cases to learn oh my God we found out
that we're actually slightly over

5434
01:34:16,189 --> 01:34:16,199
that we're actually slightly over
 

5435
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:17,870
that we're actually slightly over
spinning our turbine at this degree in

5436
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:17,880
spinning our turbine at this degree in
 

5437
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,390
spinning our turbine at this degree in
this frequency is harmonic at this blah

5438
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400
this frequency is harmonic at this blah
 

5439
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,470
this frequency is harmonic at this blah
blah blah and almost realize it's

5440
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:21,480
blah blah and almost realize it's
 

5441
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,450
blah blah and almost realize it's
rattling and you know it did this and

5442
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:23,460
rattling and you know it did this and
 

5443
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,770
rattling and you know it did this and
then you can engineer around that you

5444
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:24,780
then you can engineer around that you
 

5445
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:28,610
then you can engineer around that you
know it's like it I'll ultimately you

5446
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:28,620
know it's like it I'll ultimately you
 

5447
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,290
know it's like it I'll ultimately you
know I think Elon said something like

5448
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:30,300
know I think Elon said something like
 

5449
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,590
know I think Elon said something like
high production rate uh solves many ills

5450
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
high production rate uh solves many ills
 

5451
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,390
high production rate uh solves many ills
or something along those lines and it's

5452
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:35,400
or something along those lines and it's
 

5453
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,189
or something along those lines and it's
just true if you have an insane amount

5454
01:34:37,189 --> 01:34:37,199
just true if you have an insane amount
 

5455
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:38,870
just true if you have an insane amount
of engines and an insane amount of data

5456
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
of engines and an insane amount of data
 

5457
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,729
of engines and an insane amount of data
an insane amount of failures to learn

5458
01:34:40,729 --> 01:34:40,739
an insane amount of failures to learn
 

5459
01:34:40,739 --> 01:34:43,010
an insane amount of failures to learn
from you just know your system inside

5460
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:43,020
from you just know your system inside
 

5461
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,169
from you just know your system inside
and out you know those margins you know

5462
01:34:45,169 --> 01:34:45,179
and out you know those margins you know
 

5463
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,610
and out you know those margins you know
where the failure points are you know

5464
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:46,620
where the failure points are you know
 

5465
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,709
where the failure points are you know
how to engineer around them and that's

5466
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
how to engineer around them and that's
 

5467
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,330
how to engineer around them and that's
how I approach dating no I'm just

5468
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:50,340
how I approach dating no I'm just
 

5469
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,669
how I approach dating no I'm just
kidding

5470
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:51,679
kidding
 

5471
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,890
kidding
because we're talking about engines uh

5472
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:54,900
because we're talking about engines uh
 

5473
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,709
because we're talking about engines uh
so most Rockets I think all Rockets have

5474
01:34:57,709 --> 01:34:57,719
so most Rockets I think all Rockets have
 

5475
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,350
so most Rockets I think all Rockets have
multiple stages uh today uh maybe

5476
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:00,360
multiple stages uh today uh maybe
 

5477
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,610
multiple stages uh today uh maybe
they'll take us in a discussion of what

5478
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:01,620
they'll take us in a discussion of what
 

5479
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,770
they'll take us in a discussion of what
ideas that could be for single stage uh

5480
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:03,780
ideas that could be for single stage uh
 

5481
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,689
ideas that could be for single stage uh
to orbit Rockets but can you describe

5482
01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:05,699
to orbit Rockets but can you describe
 

5483
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:06,890
to orbit Rockets but can you describe
this whole thing that you've been

5484
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:06,900
this whole thing that you've been
 

5485
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,689
this whole thing that you've been
mentioning here and there of multiple

5486
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:08,699
mentioning here and there of multiple
 

5487
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:11,030
mentioning here and there of multiple
stages of a rocket yeah no that's a good

5488
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:11,040
stages of a rocket yeah no that's a good
 

5489
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,610
stages of a rocket yeah no that's a good
question so ultimately you know like I

5490
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:13,620
question so ultimately you know like I
 

5491
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,310
question so ultimately you know like I
said you're kind of pushing about 90 the

5492
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,320
said you're kind of pushing about 90 the
 

5493
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,810
said you're kind of pushing about 90 the
Rockets like basically just fuel with

5494
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:17,820
Rockets like basically just fuel with
 

5495
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,910
Rockets like basically just fuel with
some skin on it you know what I mean

5496
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
some skin on it you know what I mean
 

5497
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,669
some skin on it you know what I mean
um and so uh that skin weighs a lot of

5498
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:22,679
um and so uh that skin weighs a lot of
 

5499
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:25,490
um and so uh that skin weighs a lot of
you know skin in the engines do weigh a

5500
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:25,500
you know skin in the engines do weigh a
 

5501
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,110
you know skin in the engines do weigh a
lot you know like I said the Falcon 99

5502
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:27,120
lot you know like I said the Falcon 99
 

5503
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,270
lot you know like I said the Falcon 99
zone is about 20 tons just the boosters

5504
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:29,280
zone is about 20 tons just the boosters
 

5505
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,430
zone is about 20 tons just the boosters
about 20 metric tons

5506
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
about 20 metric tons
 

5507
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,709
about 20 metric tons
um so it's not an insignificant amount

5508
01:35:33,709 --> 01:35:33,719
um so it's not an insignificant amount
 

5509
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:36,470
um so it's not an insignificant amount
of weight so the idea is with staging is

5510
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:36,480
of weight so the idea is with staging is
 

5511
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,090
of weight so the idea is with staging is
you ditch anything you don't need more

5512
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:38,100
you ditch anything you don't need more
 

5513
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,510
you ditch anything you don't need more
or less so um and the you know Falcon 9

5514
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
or less so um and the you know Falcon 9
 

5515
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,830
or less so um and the you know Falcon 9
is a perfect rocket to think about this

5516
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:42,840
is a perfect rocket to think about this
 

5517
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,350
is a perfect rocket to think about this
because you have a upper stage and you

5518
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
because you have a upper stage and you
 

5519
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,970
because you have a upper stage and you
have a booster you know our first stage

5520
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:46,980
have a booster you know our first stage
 

5521
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,790
have a booster you know our first stage
and the first stage Burns through all

5522
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:49,800
and the first stage Burns through all
 

5523
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,530
and the first stage Burns through all
this fuel once it's out of fuel you let

5524
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:51,540
this fuel once it's out of fuel you let
 

5525
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,270
this fuel once it's out of fuel you let
go of the second stage and ta-da you

5526
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
go of the second stage and ta-da you
 

5527
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,310
go of the second stage and ta-da you
actually just basically started and lit

5528
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:55,320
actually just basically started and lit
 

5529
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,010
actually just basically started and lit
a brand new fresh rocket you know this

5530
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:58,020
a brand new fresh rocket you know this
 

5531
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,450
a brand new fresh rocket you know this
brand new fresh rocket now doesn't have

5532
01:35:59,450 --> 01:35:59,460
brand new fresh rocket now doesn't have
 

5533
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,030
brand new fresh rocket now doesn't have
all that that 20 tons attached to it so

5534
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:02,040
all that that 20 tons attached to it so
 

5535
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,590
all that that 20 tons attached to it so
it's a lot lighter it doesn't need you

5536
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
it's a lot lighter it doesn't need you
 

5537
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,450
it's a lot lighter it doesn't need you
know it's nearly as many engines to push

5538
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:05,460
know it's nearly as many engines to push
 

5539
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,310
know it's nearly as many engines to push
it around it needs just one instead of

5540
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:07,320
it around it needs just one instead of
 

5541
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,169
it around it needs just one instead of
nine

5542
01:36:08,169 --> 01:36:08,179
nine
 

5543
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:10,610
nine
its engine can be optimized for the

5544
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:10,620
its engine can be optimized for the
 

5545
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,229
its engine can be optimized for the
vacuum of space as opposed to having to

5546
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
vacuum of space as opposed to having to
 

5547
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,470
vacuum of space as opposed to having to
operate at sea level with all of our

5548
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:14,480
operate at sea level with all of our
 

5549
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,610
operate at sea level with all of our
actually pretty thick atmosphere you

5550
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:16,620
actually pretty thick atmosphere you
 

5551
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:20,330
actually pretty thick atmosphere you
know relatively so there's so staging is

5552
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:20,340
know relatively so there's so staging is
 

5553
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,129
know relatively so there's so staging is
basically the idea that you get rid of

5554
01:36:22,129 --> 01:36:22,139
basically the idea that you get rid of
 

5555
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:24,350
basically the idea that you get rid of
things you don't need on Earth again

5556
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:24,360
things you don't need on Earth again
 

5557
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,750
things you don't need on Earth again
kind of that whole like 10 harder 10

5558
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:26,760
kind of that whole like 10 harder 10
 

5559
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,390
kind of that whole like 10 harder 10
easier if it was 10 easier single stage

5560
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:29,400
easier if it was 10 easier single stage
 

5561
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,129
easier if it was 10 easier single stage
door would be no big deal and it

5562
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:31,139
door would be no big deal and it
 

5563
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:32,689
door would be no big deal and it
probably would have been like the the

5564
01:36:32,689 --> 01:36:32,699
probably would have been like the the
 

5565
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:35,030
probably would have been like the the
way to get to orbit by choice just

5566
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
way to get to orbit by choice just
 

5567
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,330
way to get to orbit by choice just
because like it's not that hard but with

5568
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:38,340
because like it's not that hard but with
 

5569
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,390
because like it's not that hard but with
our Earth as it is uh with physics as it

5570
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:41,400
our Earth as it is uh with physics as it
 

5571
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,590
our Earth as it is uh with physics as it
is it's just

5572
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:42,600
is it's just
 

5573
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,350
is it's just
it's doable and we've had

5574
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
it's doable and we've had
 

5575
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,270
it's doable and we've had
and you know we almost kind of actually

5576
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,280
and you know we almost kind of actually
 

5577
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,310
and you know we almost kind of actually
the first orbit to take humans or the

5578
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:49,320
the first orbit to take humans or the
 

5579
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,810
the first orbit to take humans or the
first rocket to take humans into orbit

5580
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:50,820
first rocket to take humans into orbit
 

5581
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,149
first rocket to take humans into orbit
uh for the from the United States

5582
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:53,159
uh for the from the United States
 

5583
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:54,890
uh for the from the United States
um which was the

5584
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:54,900
um which was the
 

5585
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,890
um which was the
Atlas rocket um was kind of a stage and

5586
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:57,900
Atlas rocket um was kind of a stage and
 

5587
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,050
Atlas rocket um was kind of a stage and
a half it actually only had like one big

5588
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:00,060
a half it actually only had like one big
 

5589
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,970
a half it actually only had like one big
fuel tank and what that is they actually

5590
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:01,980
fuel tank and what that is they actually
 

5591
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:04,490
fuel tank and what that is they actually
dropped off two of its three engines so

5592
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:04,500
dropped off two of its three engines so
 

5593
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,930
dropped off two of its three engines so
it just ditched some of the engines but

5594
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:05,940
it just ditched some of the engines but
 

5595
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:07,490
it just ditched some of the engines but
if it hadn't done that you know so kind

5596
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:07,500
if it hadn't done that you know so kind
 

5597
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,930
if it hadn't done that you know so kind
of people were like well that was single

5598
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:08,940
of people were like well that was single
 

5599
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,430
of people were like well that was single
stage it's like it still had a staging

5600
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:10,440
stage it's like it still had a staging
 

5601
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,050
stage it's like it still had a staging
event it still had a ditch mass in order

5602
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:12,060
event it still had a ditch mass in order
 

5603
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,370
event it still had a ditch mass in order
to even make it into orbit had it not

5604
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:13,380
to even make it into orbit had it not
 

5605
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:15,169
to even make it into orbit had it not
done that it would have not been able to

5606
01:37:15,169 --> 01:37:15,179
done that it would have not been able to
 

5607
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:17,390
done that it would have not been able to
get into orbit so yeah you pretty

5608
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:17,400
get into orbit so yeah you pretty
 

5609
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,189
get into orbit so yeah you pretty
quickly look at your trade and say okay

5610
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:19,199
quickly look at your trade and say okay
 

5611
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:21,290
quickly look at your trade and say okay
well if I want to stick to single stage

5612
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:21,300
well if I want to stick to single stage
 

5613
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,930
well if I want to stick to single stage
to orbit my payload Mass becomes

5614
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:23,940
to orbit my payload Mass becomes
 

5615
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:26,209
to orbit my payload Mass becomes
tiny you know like you might be able to

5616
01:37:26,209 --> 01:37:26,219
tiny you know like you might be able to
 

5617
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,310
tiny you know like you might be able to
put like you know a falcon 9 booster on

5618
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
put like you know a falcon 9 booster on
 

5619
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,750
put like you know a falcon 9 booster on
its own like if you just flew one of the

5620
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
its own like if you just flew one of the
 

5621
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,550
its own like if you just flew one of the
side core boosters of a falcon heavy

5622
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:31,560
side core boosters of a falcon heavy
 

5623
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,290
side core boosters of a falcon heavy
with a nose cone on and everything to

5624
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:33,300
with a nose cone on and everything to
 

5625
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,290
with a nose cone on and everything to
say I'm just gonna fly this on its own

5626
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:35,300
say I'm just gonna fly this on its own
 

5627
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:38,750
say I'm just gonna fly this on its own
you might be able to put like a you know

5628
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:38,760
you might be able to put like a you know
 

5629
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,209
you might be able to put like a you know
10 kilograms into space or something you

5630
01:37:41,209 --> 01:37:41,219
10 kilograms into space or something you
 

5631
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:43,430
10 kilograms into space or something you
know a very small amount we'll throw a

5632
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
know a very small amount we'll throw a
 

5633
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,629
know a very small amount we'll throw a
second stage on that thing and now you

5634
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
second stage on that thing and now you
 

5635
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,689
second stage on that thing and now you
can put uh you know 17

5636
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:47,699
can put uh you know 17
 

5637
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:50,090
can put uh you know 17
000 kilograms into space so it's just an

5638
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:50,100
000 kilograms into space so it's just an
 

5639
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:52,390
000 kilograms into space so it's just an
order you know orders of magnitude more

5640
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:52,400
order you know orders of magnitude more
 

5641
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,070
order you know orders of magnitude more
payload capacity because you did staging

5642
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:55,080
payload capacity because you did staging
 

5643
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,450
payload capacity because you did staging
because you ditched the vestigial weight

5644
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:56,460
because you ditched the vestigial weight
 

5645
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,129
because you ditched the vestigial weight
so

5646
01:37:58,129 --> 01:37:58,139
so
 

5647
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:01,430
so
um the other thing that's uh hard about

5648
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
um the other thing that's uh hard about
 

5649
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,830
um the other thing that's uh hard about
that too uh is that the engines again

5650
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
that too uh is that the engines again
 

5651
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,709
that too uh is that the engines again
that operate at sea level uh are often

5652
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
that operate at sea level uh are often
 

5653
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,810
that operate at sea level uh are often
not great in in space and vice versa

5654
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:08,820
not great in in space and vice versa
 

5655
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,209
not great in in space and vice versa
like you physically can't almost

5656
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:11,219
like you physically can't almost
 

5657
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,310
like you physically can't almost
optimize for space engines you can't

5658
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:13,320
optimize for space engines you can't
 

5659
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,810
optimize for space engines you can't
even operate at sea level they'll

5660
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:14,820
even operate at sea level they'll
 

5661
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,729
even operate at sea level they'll
destroy themselves due to something

5662
01:38:16,729 --> 01:38:16,739
destroy themselves due to something
 

5663
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:19,250
destroy themselves due to something
called flow separation so

5664
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:19,260
called flow separation so
 

5665
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,750
called flow separation so
um not only are you getting the benefit

5666
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:20,760
um not only are you getting the benefit
 

5667
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,129
um not only are you getting the benefit
of ditching all the weight but you're

5668
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:22,139
of ditching all the weight but you're
 

5669
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:23,930
of ditching all the weight but you're
also able to use a much more efficient

5670
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:23,940
also able to use a much more efficient
 

5671
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,910
also able to use a much more efficient
unless typically you know the much less

5672
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
unless typically you know the much less
 

5673
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,709
unless typically you know the much less
powerful engine in space so you

5674
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:27,719
powerful engine in space so you
 

5675
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:29,990
powerful engine in space so you
mentioned on uh

5676
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
mentioned on uh
 

5677
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,510
mentioned on uh
the multi-stage Rockets

5678
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:32,520
the multi-stage Rockets
 

5679
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,629
the multi-stage Rockets
uh that maybe the dream would be uh if

5680
01:38:35,629 --> 01:38:35,639
uh that maybe the dream would be uh if
 

5681
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,610
uh that maybe the dream would be uh if
we weren't living on Earth but maybe we

5682
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:37,620
we weren't living on Earth but maybe we
 

5683
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,129
we weren't living on Earth but maybe we
can on Earth uh to have a single stage

5684
01:38:40,129 --> 01:38:40,139
can on Earth uh to have a single stage
 

5685
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,590
can on Earth uh to have a single stage
uh to orbit rocket where it's all one

5686
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:42,600
uh to orbit rocket where it's all one
 

5687
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,370
uh to orbit rocket where it's all one
package reusable

5688
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:45,380
package reusable
 

5689
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,629
package reusable
reusable it's even harder it gets even

5690
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:47,639
reusable it's even harder it gets even
 

5691
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:50,390
reusable it's even harder it gets even
harder so first off what is uh just a

5692
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
harder so first off what is uh just a
 

5693
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,430
harder so first off what is uh just a
link on it what what is the single stage

5694
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:52,440
link on it what what is the single stage
 

5695
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,250
link on it what what is the single stage
to orbit rocket and why is it so hard to

5696
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:55,260
to orbit rocket and why is it so hard to
 

5697
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:57,350
to orbit rocket and why is it so hard to
achieve on Earth do you already kind of

5698
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:57,360
achieve on Earth do you already kind of
 

5699
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,390
achieve on Earth do you already kind of
explained it a little bit but just if we

5700
01:38:59,390 --> 01:38:59,400
explained it a little bit but just if we
 

5701
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,770
explained it a little bit but just if we
were to say like yeah that's your

5702
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:00,780
were to say like yeah that's your
 

5703
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:03,770
were to say like yeah that's your
assignment Yeah Tim you're supposed to

5704
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:03,780
assignment Yeah Tim you're supposed to
 

5705
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,810
assignment Yeah Tim you're supposed to
get together with Elon and other

5706
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:05,820
get together with Elon and other
 

5707
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,850
get together with Elon and other
brilliant people and like you have to do

5708
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:07,860
brilliant people and like you have to do
 

5709
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,229
brilliant people and like you have to do
this yeah

5710
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:09,239
this yeah
 

5711
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:12,350
this yeah
why is it so hard why is it so hard

5712
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:12,360
why is it so hard why is it so hard
 

5713
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,430
why is it so hard why is it so hard
um it your the the payload fraction of a

5714
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,440
um it your the the payload fraction of a
 

5715
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,870
um it your the the payload fraction of a
rocket is

5716
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:17,880
rocket is
 

5717
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,030
rocket is
like three to five or six or seven

5718
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:20,040
like three to five or six or seven
 

5719
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,430
like three to five or six or seven
percent would be like you know that's

5720
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
percent would be like you know that's
 

5721
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,990
percent would be like you know that's
the amount of payload compared to the

5722
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
the amount of payload compared to the
 

5723
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,250
the amount of payload compared to the
total mass of the rocket like you're

5724
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:25,260
total mass of the rocket like you're
 

5725
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,810
total mass of the rocket like you're
lucky to get into

5726
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:26,820
lucky to get into
 

5727
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,270
lucky to get into
Beyond five percent so if you're now

5728
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,280
Beyond five percent so if you're now
 

5729
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,010
Beyond five percent so if you're now
having to deal with the weight of the

5730
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:31,020
having to deal with the weight of the
 

5731
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,870
having to deal with the weight of the
rocket by the time you're in orbit like

5732
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
rocket by the time you're in orbit like
 

5733
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,450
rocket by the time you're in orbit like
your your payload fraction just you're

5734
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:35,460
your your payload fraction just you're
 

5735
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,550
your your payload fraction just you're
you're talking about like margins it's

5736
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:37,560
you're talking about like margins it's
 

5737
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,810
you're talking about like margins it's
such

5738
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:38,820
such
 

5739
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,990
such
it's so small amount of leftover if you

5740
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
it's so small amount of leftover if you
 

5741
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,790
it's so small amount of leftover if you
have to take all of it with you

5742
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:43,800
have to take all of it with you
 

5743
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,350
have to take all of it with you
so the sooner you can ditch weight the

5744
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:45,360
so the sooner you can ditch weight the
 

5745
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,910
so the sooner you can ditch weight the
better the sooner you can ditch weight

5746
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:46,920
better the sooner you can ditch weight
 

5747
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,229
better the sooner you can ditch weight
the better the sooner you can you know

5748
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:48,239
the better the sooner you can you know
 

5749
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,729
the better the sooner you can you know
and that's what you're doing a rocket

5750
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:49,739
and that's what you're doing a rocket
 

5751
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:50,810
and that's what you're doing a rocket
the whole time is actually ditching

5752
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:50,820
the whole time is actually ditching
 

5753
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,450
the whole time is actually ditching
weight all of that fuel and all that big

5754
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:53,460
weight all of that fuel and all that big
 

5755
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,790
weight all of that fuel and all that big
giant flamacy is literally Mass being

01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:55,800
giant flamacy is literally Mass being
 

5757
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,770
giant flamacy is literally Mass being
thrown out the back of the rocket but

5758
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:57,780
thrown out the back of the rocket but
 

5759
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:59,390
thrown out the back of the rocket but
what typically is an expended you know

5760
01:39:59,390 --> 01:39:59,400
what typically is an expended you know
 

5761
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,129
what typically is an expended you know
at least during nominal operations

5762
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:01,139
at least during nominal operations
 

5763
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:02,930
at least during nominal operations
you're not seeing the engines being you

5764
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:02,940
you're not seeing the engines being you
 

5765
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,729
you're not seeing the engines being you
know expelled out the thing until you

5766
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:04,739
know expelled out the thing until you
 

5767
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:06,169
know expelled out the thing until you
get to staging of course and that's

5768
01:40:06,169 --> 01:40:06,179
get to staging of course and that's
 

5769
01:40:06,179 --> 01:40:07,610
get to staging of course and that's
where you know you're ditching all that

5770
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:07,620
where you know you're ditching all that
 

5771
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:10,070
where you know you're ditching all that
dead weight so single stage to orbit

5772
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
dead weight so single stage to orbit
 

5773
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,709
dead weight so single stage to orbit
your margins just become so small that

5774
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
your margins just become so small that
 

5775
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,890
your margins just become so small that
it it's border it's not impossible but

5776
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:15,900
it it's border it's not impossible but
 

5777
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,390
it it's border it's not impossible but
it's just at the end of the day like

5778
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:17,400
it's just at the end of the day like
 

5779
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,649
it's just at the end of the day like
almost no matter who you are you end up

5780
01:40:18,649 --> 01:40:18,659
almost no matter who you are you end up
 

5781
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,209
almost no matter who you are you end up
saying it's just simply not worth it

5782
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:20,219
saying it's just simply not worth it
 

5783
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:22,610
saying it's just simply not worth it
like it'd be if you have two rockets

5784
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:22,620
like it'd be if you have two rockets
 

5785
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:23,810
like it'd be if you have two rockets
that are using the same amount of

5786
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:23,820
that are using the same amount of
 

5787
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,310
that are using the same amount of
propellant you know they're the same

5788
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:25,320
propellant you know they're the same
 

5789
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,169
propellant you know they're the same
physical sizes and one of them is

5790
01:40:27,169 --> 01:40:27,179
physical sizes and one of them is
 

5791
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:28,850
physical sizes and one of them is
cutting you know on a third and has

5792
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:28,860
cutting you know on a third and has
 

5793
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:31,010
cutting you know on a third and has
another little engine it'll have a

5794
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:31,020
another little engine it'll have a
 

5795
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,629
another little engine it'll have a
hundred or a thousand times more payload

5796
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639
hundred or a thousand times more payload
 

5797
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,550
hundred or a thousand times more payload
capacity than the one sitting right next

5798
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:34,560
capacity than the one sitting right next
 

5799
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,830
capacity than the one sitting right next
to it and now so there's tricks you can

5800
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:36,840
to it and now so there's tricks you can
 

5801
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,570
to it and now so there's tricks you can
do to like try to offset that things

5802
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:38,580
do to like try to offset that things
 

5803
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:41,570
do to like try to offset that things
like aerospike engines which operate at

5804
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:41,580
like aerospike engines which operate at
 

5805
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,390
like aerospike engines which operate at
uh as efficiently at sea level at a kind

5806
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
uh as efficiently at sea level at a kind
 

5807
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,550
uh as efficiently at sea level at a kind
of optimized efficiency at sea level and

5808
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
of optimized efficiency at sea level and
 

5809
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,070
of optimized efficiency at sea level and
just by their uh by the way their design

5810
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:49,080
just by their uh by the way their design
 

5811
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,450
just by their uh by the way their design
the physics of them they're also

5812
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,460
the physics of them they're also
 

5813
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,850
the physics of them they're also
efficient in a vacuum too

5814
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:52,860
efficient in a vacuum too
 

5815
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,610
efficient in a vacuum too
um you can do things like that and at

5816
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:55,620
um you can do things like that and at
 

5817
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,290
um you can do things like that and at
the end of the day though you just end

5818
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:57,300
the end of the day though you just end
 

5819
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,209
the end of the day though you just end
up with a worse rocket than if you had

5820
01:40:59,209 --> 01:40:59,219
up with a worse rocket than if you had
 

5821
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,010
up with a worse rocket than if you had
just done stage like no matter what and

5822
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:01,020
just done stage like no matter what and
 

5823
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,270
just done stage like no matter what and
and people say like well what if you

5824
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:02,280
and people say like well what if you
 

5825
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,530
and people say like well what if you
developed the new technologies like okay

5826
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:03,540
developed the new technologies like okay
 

5827
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,270
developed the new technologies like okay
apply that technology to a multi-stage

5828
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
apply that technology to a multi-stage
 

5829
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,970
apply that technology to a multi-stage
rocket and it's gonna do better you know

5830
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:07,980
rocket and it's gonna do better you know
 

5831
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,189
rocket and it's gonna do better you know
like no matter where you end up it's

5832
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:10,199
like no matter where you end up it's
 

5833
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:11,689
like no matter where you end up it's
just always better to ditch that weight

5834
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:11,699
just always better to ditch that weight
 

5835
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:13,250
just always better to ditch that weight
you know is there a cost to having

5836
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:13,260
you know is there a cost to having
 

5837
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,530
you know is there a cost to having
multi-stage because you can still reuse

5838
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:15,540
multi-stage because you can still reuse
 

5839
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,570
multi-stage because you can still reuse
the different stages that's the the

5840
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:17,580
the different stages that's the the
 

5841
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,310
the different stages that's the the
dream is you know becomes easier to

5842
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:19,320
dream is you know becomes easier to
 

5843
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,890
dream is you know becomes easier to
reuse multiple stages because now you

5844
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:21,900
reuse multiple stages because now you
 

5845
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,270
reuse multiple stages because now you
know like the booster doesn't have to

5846
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:23,280
know like the booster doesn't have to
 

5847
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,030
know like the booster doesn't have to
survive orbital re-entry temperatures

5848
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:26,040
survive orbital re-entry temperatures
 

5849
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,669
survive orbital re-entry temperatures
and extreme environments and you only

5850
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:28,679
and extreme environments and you only
 

5851
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:30,530
and extreme environments and you only
have to you know make survival the upper

5852
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:30,540
have to you know make survival the upper
 

5853
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,729
have to you know make survival the upper
stage you only have to put a big heat

5854
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:31,739
stage you only have to put a big heat
 

5855
01:41:31,739 --> 01:41:32,930
stage you only have to put a big heat
shield I mean starship's the perfect

5856
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:32,940
shield I mean starship's the perfect
 

5857
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:35,330
shield I mean starship's the perfect
perfect thing of this the upper stage

5858
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:35,340
perfect thing of this the upper stage
 

5859
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,250
perfect thing of this the upper stage
has a big giant heat shield the booster

5860
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:37,260
has a big giant heat shield the booster
 

5861
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,270
has a big giant heat shield the booster
doesn't need it because it's not going

5862
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:38,280
doesn't need it because it's not going
 

5863
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,590
doesn't need it because it's not going
the booster is not going to orbit it's

5864
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:39,600
the booster is not going to orbit it's
 

5865
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,930
the booster is not going to orbit it's
only going A fifth or a quarter of

5866
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:41,940
only going A fifth or a quarter of
 

5867
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:44,209
only going A fifth or a quarter of
orbital velocity so it's heat that it

5868
01:41:44,209 --> 01:41:44,219
orbital velocity so it's heat that it
 

5869
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:46,310
orbital velocity so it's heat that it
experiences is survivable just by the

5870
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
experiences is survivable just by the
 

5871
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,050
experiences is survivable just by the
stainless steel you don't need an

5872
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:48,060
stainless steel you don't need an
 

5873
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,850
stainless steel you don't need an
additional heat shield

5874
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:49,860
additional heat shield
 

5875
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,410
additional heat shield
um so all of a sudden if you're trying

5876
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:51,420
um so all of a sudden if you're trying
 

5877
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:53,149
um so all of a sudden if you're trying
to reuse pretend that you just welded

5878
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:53,159
to reuse pretend that you just welded
 

5879
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:54,590
to reuse pretend that you just welded
the two stages of Starship together

5880
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:54,600
the two stages of Starship together
 

5881
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,870
the two stages of Starship together
remove those engines on Starship that

5882
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:56,880
remove those engines on Starship that
 

5883
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:57,890
remove those engines on Starship that
whole vehicle if you're trying to reuse

5884
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:57,900
whole vehicle if you're trying to reuse
 

5885
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,050
whole vehicle if you're trying to reuse
it the whole vehicle now has to have a

5886
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:00,060
it the whole vehicle now has to have a
 

5887
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,030
it the whole vehicle now has to have a
heat shield on one side of it the whole

5888
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:02,040
heat shield on one side of it the whole
 

5889
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,350
heat shield on one side of it the whole
thing has to have these big heavy Wings

5890
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,360
thing has to have these big heavy Wings
 

5891
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,209
thing has to have these big heavy Wings
by the time you come down to it there's

5892
01:42:05,209 --> 01:42:05,219
by the time you come down to it there's
 

5893
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:07,790
by the time you come down to it there's
probably just zero payload capacity you

5894
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:07,800
probably just zero payload capacity you
 

5895
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,290
probably just zero payload capacity you
basically put your fuel tank in space

5896
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:09,300
basically put your fuel tank in space
 

5897
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,050
basically put your fuel tank in space
you know good job so the the dream of a

5898
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:12,060
you know good job so the the dream of a
 

5899
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,770
you know good job so the the dream of a
single stage to orbit a rocket is is

5900
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:15,780
single stage to orbit a rocket is is
 

5901
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:18,590
single stage to orbit a rocket is is
that just even the wrong dream on Earth

5902
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:18,600
that just even the wrong dream on Earth
 

5903
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,470
that just even the wrong dream on Earth
that's what most convention tells you

5904
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:21,480
that's what most convention tells you
 

5905
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,510
that's what most convention tells you
you know by the time if if you're you're

5906
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:23,520
you know by the time if if you're you're
 

5907
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,450
you know by the time if if you're you're
if your goal is cheap then you're going

5908
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:26,460
if your goal is cheap then you're going
 

5909
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,530
if your goal is cheap then you're going
to spend you're going to have a

5910
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:27,540
to spend you're going to have a
 

5911
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,390
to spend you're going to have a
physically larger rocket that has more

5912
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:29,400
physically larger rocket that has more
 

5913
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,850
physically larger rocket that has more
engines that has more propellant blah

5914
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:31,860
engines that has more propellant blah
 

5915
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:32,990
engines that has more propellant blah
blah to put the same amount of thing

5916
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:33,000
blah to put the same amount of thing
 

5917
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,490
blah to put the same amount of thing
here same amount of mass into orbit

5918
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:34,500
here same amount of mass into orbit
 

5919
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,570
here same amount of mass into orbit
compared to something else you know

5920
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:35,580
compared to something else you know
 

5921
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,490
compared to something else you know
we're talking like rocket Labs electron

5922
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:37,500
we're talking like rocket Labs electron
 

5923
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,010
we're talking like rocket Labs electron
a really small rocket it's like I think

5924
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:40,020
a really small rocket it's like I think
 

5925
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,229
a really small rocket it's like I think
1.3 meters wide and something like you

5926
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:42,239
1.3 meters wide and something like you
 

5927
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,510
1.3 meters wide and something like you
know 18 meters taller I mean it's it's a

5928
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:44,520
know 18 meters taller I mean it's it's a
 

5929
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:45,830
know 18 meters taller I mean it's it's a
small rocket

5930
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
small rocket
 

5931
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,229
small rocket
if you were to you know the and it can

5932
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
if you were to you know the and it can
 

5933
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,570
if you were to you know the and it can
put something like 300 and or so

5934
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:50,580
put something like 300 and or so
 

5935
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,910
put something like 300 and or so
kilograms into orbit

5936
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:52,920
kilograms into orbit
 

5937
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,290
kilograms into orbit
you can either launch something that

5938
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:54,300
you can either launch something that
 

5939
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,750
you can either launch something that
size or again like a full like big old

5940
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:56,760
size or again like a full like big old
 

5941
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:01,189
size or again like a full like big old
Falcon 9 booster the huge huge thing and

5942
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:01,199
Falcon 9 booster the huge huge thing and
 

5943
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,229
Falcon 9 booster the huge huge thing and
that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms

5944
01:43:03,229 --> 01:43:03,239
that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms
 

5945
01:43:03,239 --> 01:43:04,910
that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms
into orbit you know so it's like which

5946
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:04,920
into orbit you know so it's like which
 

5947
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,890
into orbit you know so it's like which
one's gonna be cheaper to build you know

5948
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:06,900
one's gonna be cheaper to build you know
 

5949
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,229
one's gonna be cheaper to build you know
ship around all this stuff and then you

5950
01:43:09,229 --> 01:43:09,239
ship around all this stuff and then you
 

5951
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:11,330
ship around all this stuff and then you
also look at you have fixed costs like

5952
01:43:11,330 --> 01:43:11,340
also look at you have fixed costs like
 

5953
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:14,870
also look at you have fixed costs like
the idea of flying a but this this uh

5954
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:14,880
the idea of flying a but this this uh
 

5955
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,250
the idea of flying a but this this uh
again everything in rocket science is a

5956
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:16,260
again everything in rocket science is a
 

5957
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,870
again everything in rocket science is a
compromise because now you have things

5958
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:17,880
compromise because now you have things
 

5959
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,970
compromise because now you have things
like um people on Console time all the

5960
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:19,980
like um people on Console time all the
 

5961
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,950
like um people on Console time all the
people that are you know on comms and

5962
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:21,960
people that are you know on comms and
 

5963
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,870
people that are you know on comms and
working on the rocket going down to the

5964
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:23,880
working on the rocket going down to the
 

5965
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,850
working on the rocket going down to the
pad you know filing paperwork doing

5966
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:25,860
pad you know filing paperwork doing
 

5967
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:27,410
pad you know filing paperwork doing
range control making sure there's not

5968
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:27,420
range control making sure there's not
 

5969
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,689

01:43:29,689 --> 01:43:29,699
planes and boats in the way uh flight
 

5971
01:43:29,699 --> 01:43:31,250

termination people you have all these

5972
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:31,260
termination people you have all these
 

5973
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,050
termination people you have all these
fixed costs for any launch I don't care

5974
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:33,060
fixed costs for any launch I don't care
 

5975
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,910
fixed costs for any launch I don't care
how big the rocket is there's a

5976
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:34,920
how big the rocket is there's a
 

5977
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:37,550
how big the rocket is there's a
relatively fixed cost so now you say

5978
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:37,560
relatively fixed cost so now you say
 

5979
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,709
relatively fixed cost so now you say
like okay I'm gonna be paying well let's

5980
01:43:39,709 --> 01:43:39,719
like okay I'm gonna be paying well let's
 

5981
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:40,910
like okay I'm gonna be paying well let's
just make one hour I'm gonna pay five

5982
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:40,920
just make one hour I'm gonna pay five
 

5983
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,790
just make one hour I'm gonna pay five
million dollars to fly a rocket between

5984
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:43,800
million dollars to fly a rocket between
 

5985
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,830
million dollars to fly a rocket between
all the people going on site all the

if your fixed cost is five million

5990
01:43:50,209 --> 01:43:50,219
if your fixed cost is five million
 

5991
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:52,129
if your fixed cost is five million
dollars and you can put 300 kilograms in

dollars and you can put 300 kilograms in
 

5993
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:53,930
dollars and you can put 300 kilograms in
Space versus you have a five million

5994
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:53,940
Space versus you have a five million
 

5995
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,270
Space versus you have a five million
dollar cost of operation and you can put

dollar cost of operation and you can put
 

5997
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,149
dollar cost of operation and you can put
5 000 kilograms into space like it it's

5998
01:43:59,149 --> 01:43:59,159
5 000 kilograms into space like it it's
 

5999
01:43:59,159 --> 01:44:01,910
5 000 kilograms into space like it it's
it's the business case is going to send

6000
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
it's the business case is going to send
 

6001
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,890
it's the business case is going to send
you in One Direction pretty quickly so

6002
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:03,900
you in One Direction pretty quickly so
 

6003
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,169
you in One Direction pretty quickly so
you mentioned aerospike engines

6004
01:44:06,169 --> 01:44:06,179
you mentioned aerospike engines
 

6005
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:09,590
you mentioned aerospike engines
I think uh the internet uh informed me

6006
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
I think uh the internet uh informed me
 

6007
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,510
I think uh the internet uh informed me
of your love affair with the house by

6008
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
of your love affair with the house by
 

6009
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,750
of your love affair with the house by
gotcha find somebody that looks at you

6010
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:14,760
gotcha find somebody that looks at you
 

6011
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:19,930
gotcha find somebody that looks at you
the way Tim not looks at Eros package

6012
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:19,940

 

6013
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:24,050

can you explain uh what these are how do

6014
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:24,060
can you explain uh what these are how do
 

6015
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,250
can you explain uh what these are how do
they work

6016
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:25,260
they work
 

6017
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,750
they work
um what's beautiful to them what how

6018
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:26,760
um what's beautiful to them what how
 

6019
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,430
um what's beautiful to them what how
practical are they why don't we use them

6020
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:28,440
practical are they why don't we use them
 

6021
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,649
practical are they why don't we use them
oh my God uh does it just boil down to

6022
01:44:30,649 --> 01:44:30,659
oh my God uh does it just boil down to
 

6023
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:33,229
oh my God uh does it just boil down to
the design of the nozzle uh so maybe can

6024
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:33,239
the design of the nozzle uh so maybe can
 

6025
01:44:33,239 --> 01:44:34,490
the design of the nozzle uh so maybe can
you explain how is it possible to

6026
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:34,500
you explain how is it possible to
 

6027
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,830
you explain how is it possible to
achieve this thing for an engine to be

6028
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:36,840
achieve this thing for an engine to be
 

6029
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,709
achieve this thing for an engine to be
as efficient at uh in a vacuum on sea

6030
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:39,719
as efficient at uh in a vacuum on sea
 

6031
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:41,270
as efficient at uh in a vacuum on sea
level and in all different conditions

6032
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
level and in all different conditions
 

6033
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,010
level and in all different conditions
you know what I love about this is like

6034
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,020
you know what I love about this is like
 

6035
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,510
you know what I love about this is like
every question you've asked me is like a

6036
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:44,520
every question you've asked me is like a
 

6037
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,209
every question you've asked me is like a
one hour video

6038
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:46,219
one hour video
 

6039
01:44:46,219 --> 01:44:50,169
one hour video
now boil it down to 45 seconds

6040
01:44:50,169 --> 01:44:50,179
now boil it down to 45 seconds
 

6041
01:44:50,179 --> 01:44:53,750
now boil it down to 45 seconds
so the aerospike engine basically

6042
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:53,760
so the aerospike engine basically
 

6043
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,790
so the aerospike engine basically
um is an inside out engine more or less

6044
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:55,800
um is an inside out engine more or less
 

6045
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,530
um is an inside out engine more or less
so with a traditional engine you know

6046
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:57,540
so with a traditional engine you know
 

6047
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,609
so with a traditional engine you know
we've talked about the combustion

6048
01:44:58,609 --> 01:44:58,619
we've talked about the combustion
 

6049
01:44:58,619 --> 01:44:59,990
we've talked about the combustion
chamber and the throat and then it

6050
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:00,000
chamber and the throat and then it
 

6051
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,330
chamber and the throat and then it
expands out into the nozzle those walls

6052
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:02,340
expands out into the nozzle those walls
 

6053
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,149
expands out into the nozzle those walls
are containing the pressure right

6054
01:45:05,149 --> 01:45:05,159
are containing the pressure right
 

6055
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:07,129
are containing the pressure right
airspike is the opposite it's basically

6056
01:45:07,129 --> 01:45:07,139
airspike is the opposite it's basically
 

6057
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:09,050
airspike is the opposite it's basically
the pressure of the engine is on the

6058
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,060
the pressure of the engine is on the
 

6059
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,270
the pressure of the engine is on the
outside of it and it's pushing inward

6060
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,280
outside of it and it's pushing inward
 

6061
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,129
outside of it and it's pushing inward
against a spike

6062
01:45:13,129 --> 01:45:13,139
against a spike
 

6063
01:45:13,139 --> 01:45:16,370
against a spike
so it's it's almost like it's like like

6064
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:16,380
so it's it's almost like it's like like
 

6065
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,770
so it's it's almost like it's like like
the difference of if you were let me

6066
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:18,780
the difference of if you were let me
 

6067
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,910
the difference of if you were let me
think about this if you were standing in

6068
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:19,920
think about this if you were standing in
 

6069
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,970
think about this if you were standing in
like a a tent or a TP right and you put

6070
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:22,980
like a a tent or a TP right and you put
 

6071
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:24,709
like a a tent or a TP right and you put
your arms at the top and you pushed your

6072
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
your arms at the top and you pushed your
 

6073
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,510
your arms at the top and you pushed your
arms out like into an iron cross or

6074
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:26,520
arms out like into an iron cross or
 

6075
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:27,709
arms out like into an iron cross or
something you know you could physically

6076
01:45:27,709 --> 01:45:27,719
something you know you could physically
 

6077
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:29,629
something you know you could physically
lift the tent just by pushing outwards

6078
01:45:29,629 --> 01:45:29,639
lift the tent just by pushing outwards
 

6079
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:32,629
lift the tent just by pushing outwards
on the tent walls right well that would

6080
01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
on the tent walls right well that would
 

6081
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:33,890
on the tent walls right well that would
be like a traditional nozzle now

6082
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:33,900
be like a traditional nozzle now
 

6083
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,330
be like a traditional nozzle now
aerospike would be almost like squeezing

6084
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:35,340
aerospike would be almost like squeezing
 

6085
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,010
aerospike would be almost like squeezing
an ice cube you know if you squeeze an

6086
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:37,020
an ice cube you know if you squeeze an
 

6087
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:38,570
an ice cube you know if you squeeze an
ice cube you can push in on it and kind

6088
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:38,580
ice cube you can push in on it and kind
 

6089
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,669
ice cube you can push in on it and kind
of that wedge force will shoot that ice

6090
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:40,679
of that wedge force will shoot that ice
 

6091
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:42,649
of that wedge force will shoot that ice
cube so that's kind of what is happening

6092
01:45:42,649 --> 01:45:42,659
cube so that's kind of what is happening
 

6093
01:45:42,659 --> 01:45:44,330
cube so that's kind of what is happening
we have the high pressure gases on the

6094
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:44,340
we have the high pressure gases on the
 

6095
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,490
we have the high pressure gases on the
outside of the spike squeezing in on

6096
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:46,500
outside of the spike squeezing in on
 

6097
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,810
outside of the spike squeezing in on
that Spike and that's and then that's

6098
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:47,820
that Spike and that's and then that's
 

6099
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:50,030
that Spike and that's and then that's
pushing up against the you know because

6100
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:50,040
pushing up against the you know because
 

6101
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,250
pushing up against the you know because
it's equal on both sides against like

6102
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:52,260
it's equal on both sides against like
 

6103
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,229
it's equal on both sides against like
kind of the ramp is pushing up against

6104
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:54,239
kind of the ramp is pushing up against
 

6105
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:56,149
kind of the ramp is pushing up against
the rocket so that's where that Force

6106
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159
the rocket so that's where that Force
 

6107
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,470
the rocket so that's where that Force
comes in it's against the nozzle against

6108
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:57,480
comes in it's against the nozzle against
 

6109
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,689
comes in it's against the nozzle against
the chambers the hard part with an

6110
01:45:59,689 --> 01:45:59,699
the chambers the hard part with an
 

6111
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:01,430
the chambers the hard part with an
aerospike so the cool okay I guess the

6112
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:01,440
aerospike so the cool okay I guess the
 

6113
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,890
aerospike so the cool okay I guess the
cool thing about an aerospike is

6114
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:03,900
cool thing about an aerospike is
 

6115
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,649
cool thing about an aerospike is
that it can operate

6116
01:46:06,649 --> 01:46:06,659
that it can operate
 

6117
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,870
that it can operate
um in space you can have what's known as

6118
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:08,880
um in space you can have what's known as
 

6119
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,729
um in space you can have what's known as
a really big expansion ratio so that's

6120
01:46:10,729 --> 01:46:10,739
a really big expansion ratio so that's
 

6121
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,709
a really big expansion ratio so that's
your ratio between the throat the area

6122
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
your ratio between the throat the area
 

6123
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,169
your ratio between the throat the area
of the throat versus the area of the

6124
01:46:15,169 --> 01:46:15,179
of the throat versus the area of the
 

6125
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:18,109
of the throat versus the area of the
nozzle exit and remember how the bigger

6126
01:46:18,109 --> 01:46:18,119
nozzle exit and remember how the bigger
 

6127
01:46:18,119 --> 01:46:20,930
nozzle exit and remember how the bigger
the nozzle is the it's con continually

6128
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:20,940
the nozzle is the it's con continually
 

6129
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,490
the nozzle is the it's con continually
just converting more and more is

6130
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:22,500
just converting more and more is
 

6131
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:25,310
just converting more and more is
converting that high energy hot high

6132
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:25,320
converting that high energy hot high
 

6133
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,470
converting that high energy hot high
pressure gas into a cooler

6134
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:27,480
pressure gas into a cooler
 

6135
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:30,590
pressure gas into a cooler
and cooler lower pressure and faster gas

6136
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:30,600
and cooler lower pressure and faster gas
 

6137
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,750
and cooler lower pressure and faster gas
so each little millimeter along that

6138
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:32,760
so each little millimeter along that
 

6139
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,090
so each little millimeter along that
nozzle is just getting it lower pressure

6140
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:35,100
nozzle is just getting it lower pressure
 

6141
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:37,189
nozzle is just getting it lower pressure
and cooler but faster

6142
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199
and cooler but faster
 

6143
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,050
and cooler but faster
now if you take a big nozzle on Earth

6144
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:39,060
now if you take a big nozzle on Earth
 

6145
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,510
now if you take a big nozzle on Earth
and you at sea level and you fire it you

6146
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520
and you at sea level and you fire it you
 

6147
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,890
and you at sea level and you fire it you
can actually get even though we're going

6148
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:42,900
can actually get even though we're going
 

6149
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,350
can actually get even though we're going
from say 300 bar the Raptor engine

6150
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:45,360
from say 300 bar the Raptor engine
 

6151
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,490
from say 300 bar the Raptor engine
um you know our atmosphere at sea level

6152
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:46,500
um you know our atmosphere at sea level
 

6153
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,990
um you know our atmosphere at sea level
is about one bar it's pretty much

6154
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
is about one bar it's pretty much
 

6155
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,669
is about one bar it's pretty much
exactly one bar

6156
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
exactly one bar
 

6157
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:52,310
exactly one bar
um depending on conditions but you can

6158
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
um depending on conditions but you can
 

6159
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,490
um depending on conditions but you can
actually get a nozzle to get way below

6160
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:55,500
actually get a nozzle to get way below
 

6161
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,790
actually get a nozzle to get way below
one bar of pressure so every little you

6162
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
one bar of pressure so every little you
 

6163
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,370
one bar of pressure so every little you
know you can go from 300 bar in just two

6164
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:01,380
know you can go from 300 bar in just two
 

6165
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:04,129
know you can go from 300 bar in just two
meters down to one bar or below one bar

6166
01:47:04,129 --> 01:47:04,139
meters down to one bar or below one bar
 

6167
01:47:04,139 --> 01:47:05,810
meters down to one bar or below one bar
there's actually a limit you can

6168
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:05,820
there's actually a limit you can
 

6169
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:08,629
there's actually a limit you can
actually only expand it below you know

6170
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
actually only expand it below you know
 

6171
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,970
actually only expand it below you know
we'll say something like 70 so you can

6172
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:10,980
we'll say something like 70 so you can
 

6173
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:13,490
we'll say something like 70 so you can
get down to like point seven bar at

6174
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:13,500
get down to like point seven bar at
 

6175
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,649
get down to like point seven bar at
nozzle exit before the pressure of the

6176
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:15,659
nozzle exit before the pressure of the
 

6177
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:17,689
nozzle exit before the pressure of the
atmosphere is actually squeezing in on

6178
01:47:17,689 --> 01:47:17,699
atmosphere is actually squeezing in on
 

6179
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:20,090
atmosphere is actually squeezing in on
that exhaust and tearing it away from

6180
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:20,100
that exhaust and tearing it away from
 

6181
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,729
that exhaust and tearing it away from
the walls of the engine the walls of the

6182
01:47:22,729 --> 01:47:22,739
the walls of the engine the walls of the
 

6183
01:47:22,739 --> 01:47:24,770
the walls of the engine the walls of the
nozzle exit and what happens is it's

6184
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:24,780
nozzle exit and what happens is it's
 

6185
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,450
nozzle exit and what happens is it's
it's kind of unpredictable you get these

6186
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:26,460
it's kind of unpredictable you get these
 

6187
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,370
it's kind of unpredictable you get these
Pockets these oscillations and they'll

6188
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:28,380
Pockets these oscillations and they'll
 

6189
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,050
Pockets these oscillations and they'll
be so extreme that they'll end up just

6190
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:30,060
be so extreme that they'll end up just
 

6191
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,750
be so extreme that they'll end up just
destroying the nozzle so you can't lower

6192
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:32,760
destroying the nozzle so you can't lower
 

6193
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,149
destroying the nozzle so you can't lower
you can't have a bigger expansion ratio

6194
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:35,159
you can't have a bigger expansion ratio
 

6195
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:37,129
you can't have a bigger expansion ratio
then again relatively speaking some

6196
01:47:37,129 --> 01:47:37,139
then again relatively speaking some
 

6197
01:47:37,139 --> 01:47:39,229
then again relatively speaking some
something like 0.7 like you can't go

6198
01:47:39,229 --> 01:47:39,239
something like 0.7 like you can't go
 

6199
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:41,810
something like 0.7 like you can't go
below you can't get that pressure exit

6200
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:41,820
below you can't get that pressure exit
 

6201
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,729
below you can't get that pressure exit
too much below ambient air pressure

6202
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:43,739
too much below ambient air pressure
 

6203
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:45,770
too much below ambient air pressure
before flow separation can destroy the

6204
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:45,780
before flow separation can destroy the
 

6205
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:48,950
before flow separation can destroy the
engine so how come this engine can do so

6206
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:48,960
engine so how come this engine can do so
 

6207
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,350
engine so how come this engine can do so
well in in different pressure conditions

6208
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:51,360
well in in different pressure conditions
 

6209
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,229
well in in different pressure conditions
so because it's inside out the ambient

6210
01:47:54,229 --> 01:47:54,239
so because it's inside out the ambient
 

6211
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:56,510
so because it's inside out the ambient
pressure is pushing the exhaust gas into

6212
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:56,520
pressure is pushing the exhaust gas into
 

6213
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,850
pressure is pushing the exhaust gas into
the wall as opposed to a conventional

6214
01:47:58,850 --> 01:47:58,860
the wall as opposed to a conventional
 

6215
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:00,709
the wall as opposed to a conventional
engine that exhaust get or the ambient

6216
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:00,719
engine that exhaust get or the ambient
 

6217
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,050
engine that exhaust get or the ambient
air is actually squeezing the exhaust

6218
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:03,060
air is actually squeezing the exhaust
 

6219
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,109
air is actually squeezing the exhaust
gas away from the walls of the engine

6220
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:05,119
gas away from the walls of the engine
 

6221
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,970
gas away from the walls of the engine
and that squeezing away from is what can

6222
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:07,980
and that squeezing away from is what can
 

6223
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,950
and that squeezing away from is what can
be destructive so that since the

6224
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:09,960
be destructive so that since the
 

6225
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,689
be destructive so that since the
instance is kind of inside out the

6226
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:11,699
instance is kind of inside out the
 

6227
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,250
instance is kind of inside out the
ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas

6228
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:13,260
ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas
 

6229
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,649
ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas
into the engine walls so you can't have

6230
01:48:15,649 --> 01:48:15,659
into the engine walls so you can't have
 

6231
01:48:15,659 --> 01:48:17,450
into the engine walls so you can't have
flow separation you won't have flow

6232
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:17,460
flow separation you won't have flow
 

6233
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:19,790
flow separation you won't have flow
separation now what happens is so you

6234
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:19,800
separation now what happens is so you
 

6235
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,129
separation now what happens is so you
can have this huge amazingly like

6236
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:22,139
can have this huge amazingly like
 

6237
01:48:22,139 --> 01:48:23,750
can have this huge amazingly like
efficient vacuum engine that's that's

6238
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
efficient vacuum engine that's that's
 

6239
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,090
efficient vacuum engine that's that's
has a we'll say a 200 to 1 expansion

6240
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:26,100
has a we'll say a 200 to 1 expansion
 

6241
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,530
has a we'll say a 200 to 1 expansion
ratio which is really big like a lot of

6242
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:27,540
ratio which is really big like a lot of
 

6243
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:31,010
ratio which is really big like a lot of
sea level engines are like 35 40 50 to 1

6244
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:31,020
sea level engines are like 35 40 50 to 1
 

6245
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,770
sea level engines are like 35 40 50 to 1
expansion ratios and then in space you

6246
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:33,780
expansion ratios and then in space you
 

6247
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:36,290
expansion ratios and then in space you
know it's common to use like 150 180 200

6248
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,300
know it's common to use like 150 180 200
 

6249
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,990
know it's common to use like 150 180 200
to 1 expansion ratios so an aerospike

6250
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,000
to 1 expansion ratios so an aerospike
 

6251
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,149
to 1 expansion ratios so an aerospike
can have something like 200 to one it's

6252
01:48:41,149 --> 01:48:41,159
can have something like 200 to one it's
 

6253
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,010
can have something like 200 to one it's
just at the at sea level it's kind of

6254
01:48:43,010 --> 01:48:43,020
just at the at sea level it's kind of
 

6255
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,090
just at the at sea level it's kind of
just getting pushed and it's kind of

6256
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:44,100
just getting pushed and it's kind of
 

6257
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,470
just getting pushed and it's kind of
getting cut off early almost but it

6258
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:45,480
getting cut off early almost but it
 

6259
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,850
getting cut off early almost but it
doesn't matter it's not like destructive

6260
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:46,860
doesn't matter it's not like destructive
 

6261
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,530
doesn't matter it's not like destructive
it's just not running at its maximum

6262
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:48,540
it's just not running at its maximum
 

6263
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,990
it's just not running at its maximum
efficiency as it climbs in altitude as

6264
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,000
efficiency as it climbs in altitude as
 

6265
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,729
efficiency as it climbs in altitude as
the ambient air gets thinner and thinner

6266
01:48:52,729 --> 01:48:52,739
the ambient air gets thinner and thinner
 

6267
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:54,830
the ambient air gets thinner and thinner
and thinner it just inherently is

6268
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:54,840
and thinner it just inherently is
 

6269
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,510
and thinner it just inherently is
pushing less and less and less against

6270
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:56,520
pushing less and less and less against
 

6271
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,930
pushing less and less and less against
the walls of that aerospike engine so it

6272
01:48:59,930 --> 01:48:59,940
the walls of that aerospike engine so it
 

6273
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:02,270
the walls of that aerospike engine so it
actually continually gets more efficient

6274
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:02,280
actually continually gets more efficient
 

6275
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:05,390
actually continually gets more efficient
at you know as it climbs in altitude as

6276
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:05,400
at you know as it climbs in altitude as
 

6277
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,649
at you know as it climbs in altitude as
as does the normal engine but the

6278
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:06,659
as does the normal engine but the
 

6279
01:49:06,659 --> 01:49:08,570
as does the normal engine but the
difference is that you can use that huge

6280
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:08,580
difference is that you can use that huge
 

6281
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,910
difference is that you can use that huge
expansion ratio at sea level and you

6282
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:10,920
expansion ratio at sea level and you
 

6283
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,669
expansion ratio at sea level and you
can't use a huge expansion ratio at sea

6284
01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
can't use a huge expansion ratio at sea
 

6285
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:15,109
can't use a huge expansion ratio at sea

01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:24,360
why not and would you like to see a

with air Spike engines it's just and I

6304
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:34,260
with air Spike engines it's just and I
 

6305
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,810
with air Spike engines it's just and I
said this in my video actually they're

6306
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:35,820
said this in my video actually they're
 

6307
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,870
said this in my video actually they're
outside before I came in here I saw an

6308
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:38,880
outside before I came in here I saw an
 

6309
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,510
outside before I came in here I saw an
RX7 on in the streets that I just love

and that uses a rotary engine on paper

6312
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:43,920
and that uses a rotary engine on paper
 

6313
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,129
and that uses a rotary engine on paper
the rotary engine is like more efficient

6314
01:49:46,129 --> 01:49:46,139
the rotary engine is like more efficient
 

6315
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:47,930
the rotary engine is like more efficient
does you know smaller more efficient all

6316
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:47,940
does you know smaller more efficient all
 

6317
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:49,310
does you know smaller more efficient all
these things but in practice it's like

6318
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:49,320
these things but in practice it's like
 

6319
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,570
these things but in practice it's like
the thing is actually just like

6320
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:50,580
the thing is actually just like
 

6321
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,629
the thing is actually just like
unreliable hot and it you know it it

6322
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:53,639
unreliable hot and it you know it it

of the same thing with the aerospike

6326
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:56,760
of the same thing with the aerospike
 

6327
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,370
of the same thing with the aerospike
engine like yes on paper it's more

engine like yes on paper it's more
 

6329
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,830
engine like yes on paper it's more
efficient but now you have a lot more

01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:00,840
efficient but now you have a lot more
 

6331
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,250
efficient but now you have a lot more
surface area of your your your your

01:50:08,689 --> 01:50:08,699
have uh the the throat of the rocket
 

6337
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:09,830
have uh the the throat of the rocket
engine is always where it's the hottest

you know it's the hardest thing to cool

6340
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:10,920
you know it's the hardest thing to cool
 

6341
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,430
you know it's the hardest thing to cool
and with a narrow Spike if you know if

6342
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:13,440
and with a narrow Spike if you know if
 

6343
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,609
and with a narrow Spike if you know if
it's inside out now your throat is no

6344
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:16,619
it's inside out now your throat is no
 

6345
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:18,770
it's inside out now your throat is no
matter what like way bigger you know

6346
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:18,780
matter what like way bigger you know
 

6347
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,450
matter what like way bigger you know
it's almost like the size of the nozzle

6348
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:20,460
it's almost like the size of the nozzle
 

6349
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,250
it's almost like the size of the nozzle
exit normally but now it's your hardest

01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:22,260
exit normally but now it's your hardest
 

6351
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,870
exit normally but now it's your hardest
thing to cool and you have a ton of it

6352
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:23,880
thing to cool and you have a ton of it
 

6353
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,209
thing to cool and you have a ton of it
and you also have two edges of it no

6354
01:50:26,209 --> 01:50:26,219
and you also have two edges of it no
 

6355
01:50:26,219 --> 01:50:27,709
and you also have two edges of it no
matter what so even if you have like a

6465
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:22,430
that mid 90s RX7 which you know
especially in Japan they had the the 20b

that is like the coolest engine ever to
 

6471
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,790
that is like the coolest engine ever to

it's just too darn cool honestly
 

6477
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,510
it's just too darn cool honestly
maybe uh there you go well what about

6478
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:38,520
maybe uh there you go well what about
 

6479
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,649
maybe uh there you go well what about
the mid 90s that makes it special

6480
01:52:41,649 --> 01:52:41,659
the mid 90s that makes it special
 

6481
01:52:41,659 --> 01:52:44,209
the mid 90s that makes it special
it's more that I love the engine and I

6482
01:52:44,209 --> 01:52:44,219
it's more that I love the engine and I
 

6483
01:52:44,219 --> 01:52:45,590
it's more that I love the engine and I
and I like the car it's attached to him

6484
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:45,600
and I like the car it's attached to him
 

6485
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,090
and I like the car it's attached to him
and I'm not actually a big fan of like

6486
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:47,100
and I'm not actually a big fan of like
 

6487
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,790
and I'm not actually a big fan of like
90s styling you know personally but just

6488
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:49,800
90s styling you know personally but just
 

6489
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:52,370
90s styling you know personally but just
that the 20b is just such a cool cool

6490
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:52,380
that the 20b is just such a cool cool
 

6491
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:54,169
that the 20b is just such a cool cool
engine and it's twin turbo sequential

6492
01:52:54,169 --> 01:52:54,179
engine and it's twin turbo sequential
 

6493
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:57,590
engine and it's twin turbo sequential
turbos so they used um they a bigger

6494
01:52:57,590 --> 01:52:57,600
turbos so they used um they a bigger
 

6495
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,149
turbos so they used um they a bigger
turbo it takes longer to spool up you

6496
01:52:59,149 --> 01:52:59,159
turbo it takes longer to spool up you
 

6497
01:52:59,159 --> 01:53:00,530
turbo it takes longer to spool up you
know it takes more it's using that same

6498
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:00,540
know it takes more it's using that same
 

6499
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:03,109
know it takes more it's using that same
like a turbine and a compressor and it

6500
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
like a turbine and a compressor and it
 

6501
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:05,270
like a turbine and a compressor and it
just if it's a large turbine it takes

6502
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
just if it's a large turbine it takes
 

6503
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,669
just if it's a large turbine it takes
more exhaust gas to get it split up so

6504
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
more exhaust gas to get it split up so
 

6505
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,229
more exhaust gas to get it split up so
if you have an engine that reps to 9000

6506
01:53:09,229 --> 01:53:09,239
if you have an engine that reps to 9000
 

6507
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:10,669
if you have an engine that reps to 9000
RPM and you want to get a lot of

6508
01:53:10,669 --> 01:53:10,679
RPM and you want to get a lot of
 

6509
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:12,770
RPM and you want to get a lot of
pressure out of that turbo you have a

6510
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:12,780
pressure out of that turbo you have a
 

6511
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:14,030
pressure out of that turbo you have a
big turbo it's going to take forever

6512
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:14,040
big turbo it's going to take forever
 

6513
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,229
big turbo it's going to take forever
like you're gonna have you know your

6514
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:15,239
like you're gonna have you know your
 

6515
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:17,330
like you're gonna have you know your
floor and then like right it's gonna

6516
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:17,340
floor and then like right it's gonna
 

6517
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:18,709
floor and then like right it's gonna
take a long time for that turbo to get

6518
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
take a long time for that turbo to get
 

6519
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,390
take a long time for that turbo to get
spooled up so they actually did a small

6520
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:20,400
spooled up so they actually did a small
 

6521
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,790
spooled up so they actually did a small
turbo on it and a big turbo so the small

6522
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
turbo on it and a big turbo so the small
 

6523
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,470
turbo on it and a big turbo so the small
turbo would spool up first get some

6524
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:24,480
turbo would spool up first get some
 

6525
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,850
turbo would spool up first get some
boost going through the engine get that

6526
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:25,860
boost going through the engine get that
 

6527
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,370
boost going through the engine get that
engine operating get it up to speed get

6528
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:28,380
engine operating get it up to speed get
 

6529
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,689
engine operating get it up to speed get
it you know get some power to the wheels

6530
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:29,699
it you know get some power to the wheels
 

6531
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:31,550
it you know get some power to the wheels
and then once that kind of reaches its

6532
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:31,560
and then once that kind of reaches its
 

6533
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,950
and then once that kind of reaches its
limit you'd flow it into the divert the

6534
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:33,960
limit you'd flow it into the divert the
 

6535
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,870
limit you'd flow it into the divert the
exhaust gas into the bigger turbo it's

6536
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:35,880
exhaust gas into the bigger turbo it's
 

6537
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:38,750
exhaust gas into the bigger turbo it's
this sequential turbo and then that now

6538
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:38,760
this sequential turbo and then that now
 

6539
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,370
this sequential turbo and then that now
can supplement and actually increase the

6540
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:40,380
can supplement and actually increase the
 

6541
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:42,109
can supplement and actually increase the
you know overall all performance of the

6542
01:53:42,109 --> 01:53:42,119
you know overall all performance of the
 

6543
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:44,090
you know overall all performance of the
of the vehicle by a lot and I just I

6544
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:44,100
of the vehicle by a lot and I just I
 

6545
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,830
of the vehicle by a lot and I just I
think that's just so cool it's just like

6546
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,840
think that's just so cool it's just like
 

6547
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,530
think that's just so cool it's just like
the ultimate like Brute Force out of the

6548
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:48,540
the ultimate like Brute Force out of the
 

6549
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:50,750
the ultimate like Brute Force out of the
box thinking and it actually made it

6550
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:50,760
box thinking and it actually made it
 

6551
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,910
box thinking and it actually made it
into production you know what I mean can

6552
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:52,920
into production you know what I mean can
 

6553
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,609
into production you know what I mean can
you uh what's it sound like can you tell

6554
01:53:55,609 --> 01:53:55,619
you uh what's it sound like can you tell
 

6555
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:57,709
you uh what's it sound like can you tell
an engine by sound it sounds like a

01:53:57,709 --> 01:53:57,719
an engine by sound it sounds like a
 

6557
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:02,090

01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:18,960
very inspired by cyber truck in my
 

6683
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,330
very inspired by cyber truck in my
opinion I mean it might not be it might

6684
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:20,340
opinion I mean it might not be it might
 

6685
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,770

be coincidental that we're all kind of

6686
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:21,780
be coincidental that we're all kind of
 

6687
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,709
be coincidental that we're all kind of
getting this retro feature Vibe but uh I

6688
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
getting this retro feature Vibe but uh I
 

6689
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,530
getting this retro feature Vibe but uh I
personally like the boxy so I never I

personally like the boxy so I never I
 

6691
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:31,129
personally like the boxy so I never I
just still haven't understood uh

6692
01:56:31,129 --> 01:56:31,139
just still haven't understood uh
 

6693
01:56:31,139 --> 01:56:35,030
just still haven't understood uh
Porsches Porsches I still can't quite

6694

understand the small size the elegant

6696
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:37,860
understand the small size the elegant
 

6697
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:41,149
understand the small size the elegant
the curves I don't I don't quite get it

6698
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:41,159
the curves I don't I don't quite get it
 

6699
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:43,310
the curves I don't I don't quite get it
like I said I don't love the look of the

6700
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:43,320
like I said I don't love the look of the
 

6701
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,470
like I said I don't love the look of the
RX7 I don't love it but I love it

6702
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:45,480
RX7 I don't love it but I love it
 

6703
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,450
RX7 I don't love it but I love it
because of the engineering I guess that

6704
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:47,460
because of the engineering I guess that
 

6705
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,490
because of the engineering I guess that
it represents you know what I mean yeah

6706
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:49,500
it represents you know what I mean yeah
 

6707
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,530
it represents you know what I mean yeah
it's it's uh it's not the surface stuff

6708
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:51,540
it's it's uh it's not the surface stuff
 

6709
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,830
it's it's uh it's not the surface stuff
it's the deep down stuff it's that 50 50

6710
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:54,840
it's the deep down stuff it's that 50 50
 

6711
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,649
it's the deep down stuff it's that 50 50
weight distribution that matters all

6712
01:56:57,649 --> 01:56:57,659
weight distribution that matters all
 

6713
01:56:57,659 --> 01:56:59,330
weight distribution that matters all
right let's uh let's talk about Starship

6714
01:56:59,330 --> 01:56:59,340
right let's uh let's talk about Starship
 

6715
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,189
right let's uh let's talk about Starship
a little bit we've been sneaking up uh

6716
01:57:01,189 --> 01:57:01,199
a little bit we've been sneaking up uh
 

6717
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:02,870
a little bit we've been sneaking up uh
to it and from a bunch of different

6718
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:02,880
to it and from a bunch of different
 

6719
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,010
to it and from a bunch of different
directions

6720
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:04,020
directions
 

6721
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:06,649
directions
can you just say

6722
01:57:06,649 --> 01:57:06,659
can you just say
 

6723
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:07,850
can you just say
um

6724
01:57:07,850 --> 01:57:07,860
um
 

6725
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:10,310
um
what is Starship and what is the most

6726
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:10,320
what is Starship and what is the most
 

6727
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,589
what is Starship and what is the most
impressive thing uh to your body I mean

6728
01:57:12,589 --> 01:57:12,599
impressive thing uh to your body I mean
 

6729
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:13,910
impressive thing uh to your body I mean
you've talked about the sort of the

6730
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
you've talked about the sort of the
 

6731
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,830
you've talked about the sort of the
engines involved maybe you haven't

6732
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:15,840
engines involved maybe you haven't
 

6733
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,470
engines involved maybe you haven't
really kind of like dancing around it

6734
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
really kind of like dancing around it
 

6735
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,890
really kind of like dancing around it
but because this is such a crucial

6736
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:21,900
but because this is such a crucial
 

6737
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:25,310
but because this is such a crucial
thing in terms of uh the next few years

6738
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:25,320
thing in terms of uh the next few years
 

6739
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,189
thing in terms of uh the next few years
in terms of your own life personally and

6740
01:57:28,189 --> 01:57:28,199
in terms of your own life personally and
 

6741
01:57:28,199 --> 01:57:31,070
in terms of your own life personally and
uh also just human civilization reaching

6742
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:31,080
uh also just human civilization reaching
 

6743
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,050
uh also just human civilization reaching
out to the Stars it seems like Starship

6744
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:33,060
out to the Stars it seems like Starship
 

6745
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:35,209
out to the Stars it seems like Starship
is a really important vehicle to making

6746
01:57:35,209 --> 01:57:35,219
is a really important vehicle to making
 

6747
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:37,189
is a really important vehicle to making
that happen so what is this thing that

6748
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
that happen so what is this thing that
 

6749
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:40,570
that happen so what is this thing that
we're talking about yeah so Starship is

6750
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:40,580
we're talking about yeah so Starship is
 

6751
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:44,149
we're talking about yeah so Starship is
uh currently in development the world's

6752
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:44,159
uh currently in development the world's
 

6753
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,669
uh currently in development the world's
largest most powerful rocket ever built

6754
01:57:46,669 --> 01:57:46,679
largest most powerful rocket ever built
 

6755
01:57:46,679 --> 01:57:49,370
largest most powerful rocket ever built
fully reusable rocket uh two-stage

6756
01:57:49,370 --> 01:57:49,380
fully reusable rocket uh two-stage
 

6757
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,209
fully reusable rocket uh two-stage
rocket so the booster is landed and you

6758
01:57:53,209 --> 01:57:53,219
rocket so the booster is landed and you
 

6759
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:54,649
rocket so the booster is landed and you
know all this is currently aspirational

6760
01:57:54,649 --> 01:57:54,659
know all this is currently aspirational
 

6761
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:57,649
know all this is currently aspirational
until it's working uh so I'll I'll say

6762
01:57:57,649 --> 01:57:57,659
until it's working uh so I'll I'll say
 

6763
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,810
until it's working uh so I'll I'll say
it's I'll say what it's aspiration is

6764
01:57:59,810 --> 01:57:59,820
it's I'll say what it's aspiration is
 

6765
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:01,010
it's I'll say what it's aspiration is
going to be yeah and obviously I have

6766
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:01,020
going to be yeah and obviously I have
 

6767
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,629
going to be yeah and obviously I have
faith that that will happen but just

6768
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
faith that that will happen but just
 

6769
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,089
faith that that will happen but just
factually so the booster will be reused

6770
01:58:05,089 --> 01:58:05,099
factually so the booster will be reused
 

6771
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:07,310
factually so the booster will be reused
landed and refueled and reused the upper

6772
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:07,320
landed and refueled and reused the upper
 

6773
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,830
landed and refueled and reused the upper
stage will be landed refueled and reused

6774
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
stage will be landed refueled and reused
 

6775
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,589
stage will be landed refueled and reused
and ideally rapidly in the in the sense

6776
01:58:12,589 --> 01:58:12,599
and ideally rapidly in the in the sense
 

6777
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:14,750
and ideally rapidly in the in the sense
not talking about months or weeks of

6778
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:14,760
not talking about months or weeks of
 

6779
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,250
not talking about months or weeks of
refurbishment but literally talking

6780
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:16,260
refurbishment but literally talking
 

6781
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:18,770
refurbishment but literally talking
about like mild inspections and ideally

6782
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:18,780
about like mild inspections and ideally
 

6783
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:21,530
about like mild inspections and ideally
like under 24 hour reuse you know where

6784
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:21,540
like under 24 hour reuse you know where
 

6785
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,970
like under 24 hour reuse you know where
you literally really land it and fly it

6786
01:58:22,970 --> 01:58:22,980
you literally really land it and fly it
 

6787
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:23,990
you literally really land it and fly it
like an airplane

6788
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:24,000
like an airplane
 

6789
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,870
like an airplane
so it utilizes liquid methane and liquid

6790
01:58:26,870 --> 01:58:26,880
so it utilizes liquid methane and liquid
 

6791
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,109
so it utilizes liquid methane and liquid
oxygen as it's as its propellants it

6792
01:58:30,109 --> 01:58:30,119
oxygen as it's as its propellants it
 

6793
01:58:30,119 --> 01:58:32,510
oxygen as it's as its propellants it
utilizes the current iterations of it

6794
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:32,520
utilizes the current iterations of it
 

6795
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,810
utilizes the current iterations of it
are 33 Raptor engines on the booster

6796
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:35,820
are 33 Raptor engines on the booster
 

6797
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:38,930
are 33 Raptor engines on the booster
engine or on the booster and six uh

6798
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:38,940
engine or on the booster and six uh
 

6799
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:40,490
engine or on the booster and six uh
Raptors on the second stage so there'll

6800
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:40,500
Raptors on the second stage so there'll
 

6801
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,649
Raptors on the second stage so there'll
be three that are vacuum optimized and

6802
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:42,659
be three that are vacuum optimized and
 

6803
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:44,209
be three that are vacuum optimized and
three that are sea level optimized on

6804
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:44,219
three that are sea level optimized on
 

6805
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:45,890
three that are sea level optimized on
the upper stage that are primarily

6806
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:45,900
the upper stage that are primarily
 

6807
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:47,270
the upper stage that are primarily
they'll be used I think at stage

6808
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:47,280
they'll be used I think at stage
 

6809
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,450
they'll be used I think at stage
separation anyway in space but um though

6810
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:50,460
separation anyway in space but um though
 

6811
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,890
separation anyway in space but um though
their main reason that they use them is

6812
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:51,900
their main reason that they use them is
 

6813
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:53,750
their main reason that they use them is
so they can use them for landing too the

6814
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:53,760
so they can use them for landing too the
 

6815
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,510
so they can use them for landing too the
the three sea level engines uh to be

6816
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:56,520
the three sea level engines uh to be
 

6817
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,070
the three sea level engines uh to be
able to propulsively land the upper

6818
01:58:58,070 --> 01:58:58,080
able to propulsively land the upper
 

6819
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,589
able to propulsively land the upper
stage as well so the three wrapped

6820
01:59:00,589 --> 01:59:00,599
stage as well so the three wrapped
 

6821
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:02,270
stage as well so the three wrapped
engines are the ones that generate the

6822
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:02,280
engines are the ones that generate the
 

6823
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,669
engines are the ones that generate the
thrust that makes it the most powerful

6824
01:59:04,669 --> 01:59:04,679
thrust that makes it the most powerful
 

6825
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:08,270
thrust that makes it the most powerful
rocket ever built by a almost double

6826
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:08,280
rocket ever built by a almost double
 

6827
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:10,310
rocket ever built by a almost double
compared to the Saturn fight really the

6828
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:10,320
compared to the Saturn fight really the
 

6829
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:13,070
compared to the Saturn fight really the
N1 had 45 Mega Newtons of thrust the

6830
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:13,080
N1 had 45 Mega Newtons of thrust the
 

6831
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,890
N1 had 45 Mega Newtons of thrust the
Saturn V had I think 35 or 40 Mega ninja

6832
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:15,900
Saturn V had I think 35 or 40 Mega ninja
 

6833
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,709
Saturn V had I think 35 or 40 Mega ninja
thrust and this has 75 Mega Newtons so

6834
01:59:18,709 --> 01:59:18,719
thrust and this has 75 Mega Newtons so
 

6835
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:23,709
thrust and this has 75 Mega Newtons so
we're talking almost double

6836
01:59:23,709 --> 01:59:23,719

 

6837
01:59:23,719 --> 01:59:28,609

it's a uh it's a lot of power

6838
01:59:28,609 --> 01:59:28,619
it's a uh it's a lot of power
 

6839
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:30,050
it's a uh it's a lot of power
um that could be the sexiest thing I've

6840
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:30,060
um that could be the sexiest thing I've
 

6841
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:33,410
um that could be the sexiest thing I've
ever heard okay uh so uh so what are the

6842
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:33,420
ever heard okay uh so uh so what are the
 

6843
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:34,669
ever heard okay uh so uh so what are the
different testing that's happening so

6844
01:59:34,669 --> 01:59:34,679
different testing that's happening so
 

6845
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:38,209
different testing that's happening so
like uh uh what's a static fire with

6846
01:59:38,209 --> 01:59:38,219
like uh uh what's a static fire with
 

6847
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:39,470
like uh uh what's a static fire with
some of these raptors look like and

6848
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:39,480
some of these raptors look like and
 

6849
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,089
some of these raptors look like and
where do we stand you would you're just

6850
01:59:41,089 --> 01:59:41,099
where do we stand you would you're just
 

6851
01:59:41,099 --> 01:59:43,189
where do we stand you would you're just
talking about offline like the thing

6852
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:43,199
talking about offline like the thing
 

6853
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:45,470
talking about offline like the thing
that happened uh yesterday it was

6854
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:45,480
that happened uh yesterday it was
 

6855
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,270
that happened uh yesterday it was
impressive you know everything in this

6856
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:47,280
impressive you know everything in this
 

6857
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,850
impressive you know everything in this
is kind of iterations and so

6858
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:49,860
is kind of iterations and so
 

6859
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:51,169
is kind of iterations and so
um you know the Milestones that we're

6860
01:59:51,169 --> 01:59:51,179
um you know the Milestones that we're
 

6861
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:52,570
um you know the Milestones that we're
seeing we actually have on

6862
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:52,580
seeing we actually have on
 

6863
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:54,169
seeing we actually have on
everydayastronaut.com we have a

6864
01:59:54,169 --> 01:59:54,179
everydayastronaut.com we have a
 

6865
01:59:54,179 --> 01:59:55,490
everydayastronaut.com we have a
milestone checklist of like all the

6866
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:55,500
milestone checklist of like all the
 

6867
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,169
milestone checklist of like all the
things we're hoping to see that we kind

6868
01:59:57,169 --> 01:59:57,179
things we're hoping to see that we kind
 

6869
01:59:57,179 --> 01:59:59,149
things we're hoping to see that we kind
of need to see before the first orbital

6870
01:59:59,149 --> 01:59:59,159
of need to see before the first orbital
 

6871
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,669
of need to see before the first orbital
flight of this rocket so um a big

6872
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
flight of this rocket so um a big
 

6873
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:02,930
flight of this rocket so um a big
milestone they got checked off yesterday

6874
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:02,940
milestone they got checked off yesterday
 

6875
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:05,149
milestone they got checked off yesterday
was a wet dress rehearsal so it's

6876
02:00:05,149 --> 02:00:05,159
was a wet dress rehearsal so it's
 

6877
02:00:05,159 --> 02:00:07,310
was a wet dress rehearsal so it's
literally like fueling the rocket up

6878
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:07,320
literally like fueling the rocket up
 

6879
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,830
literally like fueling the rocket up
getting ready to do everything but

6880
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
getting ready to do everything but
 

6881
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,330
getting ready to do everything but
lighting the engines basically so we're

6882
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:11,340
lighting the engines basically so we're
 

6883
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:12,589
lighting the engines basically so we're
talking about loading it with propellant

6884
02:00:12,589 --> 02:00:12,599
talking about loading it with propellant
 

6885
02:00:12,599 --> 02:00:14,390
talking about loading it with propellant
all the way uh this is the first time

6886
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:14,400
all the way uh this is the first time
 

6887
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:16,070
all the way uh this is the first time
yep right there where's the Milestones

6888
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:16,080
yep right there where's the Milestones
 

6889
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:17,930
yep right there where's the Milestones
right there at the top click that big

6890
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:17,940
right there at the top click that big
 

6891
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:20,450
right there at the top click that big
picture yep just anywhere that big

6892
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:20,460
picture yep just anywhere that big
 

6893
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,970
picture yep just anywhere that big
picture yep so the there's the what

6894
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:22,980
picture yep so the there's the what
 

6895
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,890
picture yep so the there's the what
dress rehearsal so what what's the what

6896
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:24,900
dress rehearsal so what what's the what
 

6897
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:27,169
dress rehearsal so what what's the what
dress rehearsal yep so that's where they

6898
02:00:27,169 --> 02:00:27,179
dress rehearsal yep so that's where they
 

6899
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:29,209
dress rehearsal yep so that's where they
uh for the first time they filled it

6900
02:00:29,209 --> 02:00:29,219
uh for the first time they filled it
 

6901
02:00:29,219 --> 02:00:31,310
uh for the first time they filled it
completely to the brim with both liquid

6902
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:31,320
completely to the brim with both liquid
 

6903
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:32,990
completely to the brim with both liquid
oxygen and liquid methane now they've

6904
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:33,000
oxygen and liquid methane now they've
 

6905
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,729
oxygen and liquid methane now they've
done component level testing where they

6906
02:00:34,729 --> 02:00:34,739
done component level testing where they
 

6907
02:00:34,739 --> 02:00:36,709
done component level testing where they
fill it with liquid nitrogen which is

6908
02:00:36,709 --> 02:00:36,719
fill it with liquid nitrogen which is
 

6909
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,750
fill it with liquid nitrogen which is
you know it's an inert gas so it's not

6910
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:38,760
you know it's an inert gas so it's not
 

6911
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,370
you know it's an inert gas so it's not
like say it leaks out it's not going to

6912
02:00:40,370 --> 02:00:40,380
like say it leaks out it's not going to
 

6913
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,589
like say it leaks out it's not going to
explode uh you can just have a big giant

6914
02:00:42,589 --> 02:00:42,599
explode uh you can just have a big giant
 

6915
02:00:42,599 --> 02:00:44,510
explode uh you can just have a big giant
pool of liquid nitrogen like flooding

6916
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:44,520
pool of liquid nitrogen like flooding
 

6917
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,430
pool of liquid nitrogen like flooding
the area but it's not going to be an

6918
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:46,440
the area but it's not going to be an
 

6919
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,470
the area but it's not going to be an
explosion so they've done that for cryo

6920
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,480
explosion so they've done that for cryo
 

6921
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:49,790
explosion so they've done that for cryo
testing to make sure all the components

6922
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:49,800
testing to make sure all the components
 

6923
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,770
testing to make sure all the components
and stuff can handle you know being at

6924
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:51,780
and stuff can handle you know being at
 

6925
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,450
and stuff can handle you know being at
cryogenic temperatures

6926
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:53,460
cryogenic temperatures
 

6927
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:55,129
cryogenic temperatures
um it's kind of a good analog before you

6928
02:00:55,129 --> 02:00:55,139
um it's kind of a good analog before you
 

6929
02:00:55,139 --> 02:00:56,750
um it's kind of a good analog before you
start putting your your fuel in your

6930
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:56,760
start putting your your fuel in your
 

6931
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:59,330
start putting your your fuel in your
oxidizer in there but now yeah as of uh

6932
02:00:59,330 --> 02:00:59,340
oxidizer in there but now yeah as of uh
 

6933
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:01,370
oxidizer in there but now yeah as of uh
yesterday they fall fully fueled the

6934
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:01,380
yesterday they fall fully fueled the
 

6935
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,950
yesterday they fall fully fueled the
rocket with propellant both stages the

6936
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:03,960
rocket with propellant both stages the
 

6937
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:05,209
rocket with propellant both stages the
first stage and the second stage while

6938
02:01:05,209 --> 02:01:05,219
first stage and the second stage while
 

6939
02:01:05,219 --> 02:01:06,950
first stage and the second stage while
fully stacked on the on the pad like

6940
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:06,960
fully stacked on the on the pad like
 

6941
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,689
fully stacked on the on the pad like
basically I mean it was the first sense

6942
02:01:08,689 --> 02:01:08,699
basically I mean it was the first sense
 

6943
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,070
basically I mean it was the first sense
we really got off like this is what it's

6944
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
we really got off like this is what it's
 

6945
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,270
we really got off like this is what it's
going to look like right before it takes

6946
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:11,280
going to look like right before it takes
 

6947
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:11,990
going to look like right before it takes
off

6948
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:12,000
off
 

6949
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,089
off
you know kind of breathing coming to

6950
02:01:14,089 --> 02:01:14,099
you know kind of breathing coming to
 

6951
02:01:14,099 --> 02:01:15,890
you know kind of breathing coming to
life for the first time what does the

6952
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:15,900
life for the first time what does the
 

6953
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:17,390
life for the first time what does the
pad look like so there's a few

6954
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:17,400
pad look like so there's a few
 

6955
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,250
pad look like so there's a few
interesting aspects of this what's up

6956
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:19,260
interesting aspects of this what's up
 

6957
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:21,290
interesting aspects of this what's up
with the Chopsticks and the uh all of

6958
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:21,300
with the Chopsticks and the uh all of
 

6959
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,010
with the Chopsticks and the uh all of
that yeah so the the launch pad is is is

6960
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:24,020
that yeah so the the launch pad is is is
 

6961
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:27,229
that yeah so the the launch pad is is is
unique I've never seen anything like it

6962
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:27,239
unique I've never seen anything like it
 

6963
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:29,990
unique I've never seen anything like it
um and the prior history of of space

6964
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
um and the prior history of of space
 

6965
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,629
um and the prior history of of space
flight but it's a really simple launch

6966
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:32,639
flight but it's a really simple launch
 

6967
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:33,890
flight but it's a really simple launch
stand they basically have like this

6968
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:33,900
stand they basically have like this
 

6969
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:36,229
stand they basically have like this
almost looks like a stool like a you

6970
02:01:36,229 --> 02:01:36,239
almost looks like a stool like a you
 

6971
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:38,149
almost looks like a stool like a you
know like a milking a cow stool thing

6972
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:38,159
know like a milking a cow stool thing
 

6973
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:40,609
know like a milking a cow stool thing
with a whole a big giant now I know

6974
02:01:40,609 --> 02:01:40,619
with a whole a big giant now I know
 

6975
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:42,550
with a whole a big giant now I know
you're from Iowa

6976
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:42,560
you're from Iowa
 

6977
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,810
you're from Iowa
yes we all know what that's doing oh

6978
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:44,820
yes we all know what that's doing oh
 

6979
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:46,550
yes we all know what that's doing oh
yeah we all been sitting on that stool

6980
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:46,560
yeah we all been sitting on that stool
 

6981
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,450
yeah we all been sitting on that stool
milking cow yeah

6982
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:49,460
milking cow yeah
 

6983
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:51,770
milking cow yeah
with a giant hole in the middle and that

6984
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:51,780
with a giant hole in the middle and that
 

6985
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,089
with a giant hole in the middle and that
hole in the middle of that stool is

6986
02:01:53,089 --> 02:01:53,099
hole in the middle of that stool is
 

6987
02:01:53,099 --> 02:01:54,649
hole in the middle of that stool is
where the rocket sits and it sits on

6988
02:01:54,649 --> 02:01:54,659
where the rocket sits and it sits on
 

6989
02:01:54,659 --> 02:01:56,750
where the rocket sits and it sits on
these you know launch clamps

6990
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:56,760
these you know launch clamps
 

6991
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:59,209
these you know launch clamps
um and then next to it is the so that's

6992
02:01:59,209 --> 02:01:59,219
um and then next to it is the so that's
 

6993
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:01,010
um and then next to it is the so that's
the orbital launch Mount and then next

6994
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:01,020
the orbital launch Mount and then next
 

6995
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,870
the orbital launch Mount and then next
to it there are the olm some people say

6996
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:02,880
to it there are the olm some people say
 

6997
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,970
to it there are the olm some people say
next to it is the orbital launch Tower

6998
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:04,980
next to it is the orbital launch Tower
 

6999
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:09,109
next to it is the orbital launch Tower
or the Olt and that is not only

7000
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
or the Olt and that is not only
 

7001
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,330
or the Olt and that is not only
um integral to fueling up the upper

7002
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:11,340
um integral to fueling up the upper
 

7003
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:12,950
um integral to fueling up the upper
stage you know upper stage has to have

7004
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:12,960
stage you know upper stage has to have
 

7005
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,350
stage you know upper stage has to have
propellant lines run to it so that they

7006
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:15,360
propellant lines run to it so that they
 

7007
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,149
propellant lines run to it so that they
can fill it with propellant and you know

7008
02:02:17,149 --> 02:02:17,159
can fill it with propellant and you know
 

7009
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:19,850
can fill it with propellant and you know
all that but it also uh they ended up

7010
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:19,860
all that but it also uh they ended up
 

7011
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:21,109
all that but it also uh they ended up
making it so instead of having a big

7012
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:21,119
making it so instead of having a big
 

7013
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:23,629
making it so instead of having a big
crane on site to stack the two on top of

7014
02:02:23,629 --> 02:02:23,639
crane on site to stack the two on top of
 

7015
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:24,950
crane on site to stack the two on top of
each other they literally just use that

7016
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
each other they literally just use that
 

7017
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,530
each other they literally just use that
Tower as a crane so the crane has these

7018
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:27,540
Tower as a crane so the crane has these
 

7019
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,030
Tower as a crane so the crane has these
giant arms lovingly called the

7020
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
giant arms lovingly called the
 

7021
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,410
giant arms lovingly called the
Chopsticks or the whole system can be

7022
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,420
Chopsticks or the whole system can be
 

7023
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:33,229
Chopsticks or the whole system can be
called mechazilla and that will grab

7024
02:02:33,229 --> 02:02:33,239
called mechazilla and that will grab
 

7025
02:02:33,239 --> 02:02:34,790
called mechazilla and that will grab
onto first it'll grab onto the booster

7026
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
onto first it'll grab onto the booster
 

7027
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,010
onto first it'll grab onto the booster
pick it up off of its off of its

7028
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:37,020
pick it up off of its off of its
 

7029
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,570
pick it up off of its off of its
transporter that transports it from the

7030
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:38,580
transporter that transports it from the
 

7031
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:41,149
transporter that transports it from the
production site lifts it up puts it down

7032
02:02:41,149 --> 02:02:41,159
production site lifts it up puts it down
 

7033
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,310
production site lifts it up puts it down
onto the launch Mount and then it will

7034
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,320
onto the launch Mount and then it will
 

7035
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,290
onto the launch Mount and then it will
pick up the second stage of the upper

7036
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:45,300
pick up the second stage of the upper
 

7037
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:47,990
pick up the second stage of the upper
stage Starship and plop it down on top

7038
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:48,000
stage Starship and plop it down on top
 

7039
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,810
stage Starship and plop it down on top
of the booster and they did that for the

7040
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:50,820
of the booster and they did that for the
 

7041
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:52,129
of the booster and they did that for the
first time last year actually I think it

7042
02:02:52,129 --> 02:02:52,139
first time last year actually I think it
 

7043
02:02:52,139 --> 02:02:53,570
first time last year actually I think it
was like Valentine's last year was the

7044
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:53,580
was like Valentine's last year was the
 

7045
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:54,890
was like Valentine's last year was the
first time they used the Chopsticks to

7046
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:54,900
first time they used the Chopsticks to
 

7047
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,930
first time they used the Chopsticks to
stack it and now they're doing it quite

7048
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:56,940
stack it and now they're doing it quite
 

7049
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,629
stack it and now they're doing it quite
frequently you know but ultimately those

7050
02:02:59,629 --> 02:02:59,639
frequently you know but ultimately those
 

7051
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:00,709
frequently you know but ultimately those
Chopsticks have to serve a second

7052
02:03:00,709 --> 02:03:00,719
Chopsticks have to serve a second
 

7053
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,089
Chopsticks have to serve a second
purpose they're actually going to

7054
02:03:02,089 --> 02:03:02,099
purpose they're actually going to
 

7055
02:03:02,099 --> 02:03:05,450
purpose they're actually going to
utilize if you say catch it's not so

7056
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:05,460
utilize if you say catch it's not so
 

7057
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:06,890
utilize if you say catch it's not so
much they're going to catch the booster

7058
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:06,900
much they're going to catch the booster
 

7059
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,149
much they're going to catch the booster
with these Chopsticks it's not like it's

7060
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
with these Chopsticks it's not like it's
 

7061
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,250
with these Chopsticks it's not like it's
you know a dad trying to catch a falling

7062
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:10,260
you know a dad trying to catch a falling
 

7063
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,709
you know a dad trying to catch a falling
child you know it's more that that the

7064
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:12,719
child you know it's more that that the
 

7065
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:14,209
child you know it's more that that the
the booster and the Starship will

7066
02:03:14,209 --> 02:03:14,219
the booster and the Starship will
 

7067
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:18,169
the booster and the Starship will
someday land on those arms yeah

7068
02:03:18,169 --> 02:03:18,179
someday land on those arms yeah
 

7069
02:03:18,179 --> 02:03:19,370
someday land on those arms yeah
so

7070
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:19,380
so
 

7071
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,990
so
um they're more or less stationary I'm

7072
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:21,000
um they're more or less stationary I'm
 

7073
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,669
um they're more or less stationary I'm
sure there's some bit of you know

7074
02:03:22,669 --> 02:03:22,679
sure there's some bit of you know
 

7075
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:24,109
sure there's some bit of you know
adjustment that the arms will do but

7076
02:03:24,109 --> 02:03:24,119
adjustment that the arms will do but
 

7077
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:25,250
adjustment that the arms will do but
more or less the Rocket's going to

7078
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:25,260
more or less the Rocket's going to
 

7079
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,709
more or less the Rocket's going to
propulsively land and get picked up by

7080
02:03:27,709 --> 02:03:27,719
propulsively land and get picked up by
 

7081
02:03:27,719 --> 02:03:30,649
propulsively land and get picked up by
like what's essentially like two like

7082
02:03:30,649 --> 02:03:30,659
like what's essentially like two like
 

7083
02:03:30,659 --> 02:03:33,050
like what's essentially like two like
relatively small ball joints that hold

7084
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:33,060
relatively small ball joints that hold
 

7085
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:36,290
relatively small ball joints that hold
the entire thing it has to land very

7086
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:36,300
the entire thing it has to land very
 

7087
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:39,169
the entire thing it has to land very
precisely on these these mountains then

7088
02:03:39,169 --> 02:03:39,179
precisely on these these mountains then
 

7089
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:41,030
precisely on these these mountains then
on onto the the launch Mount and that's

7090
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,040
on onto the the launch Mount and that's
 

7091
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:42,530
on onto the the launch Mount and that's
what's going to just place it back onto

7092
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:42,540
what's going to just place it back onto
 

7093
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,689
what's going to just place it back onto
the stand and allow it to be refueled

7094
02:03:44,689 --> 02:03:44,699
the stand and allow it to be refueled
 

7095
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:47,930
the stand and allow it to be refueled
and fly again what's the idea of using

7096
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:47,940
and fly again what's the idea of using
 

7097
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:50,270
and fly again what's the idea of using
the arms versus having uh launch pad to

7098
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,280
the arms versus having uh launch pad to
 

7099
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:53,209
the arms versus having uh launch pad to
land on what's what's the benefit you

7100
02:03:53,209 --> 02:03:53,219
land on what's what's the benefit you
 

7101
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:54,830
land on what's what's the benefit you
are basically moving the mass of what

7102
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:54,840
are basically moving the mass of what
 

7103
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,689
are basically moving the mass of what
would be heavy Landing legs and you're

7104
02:03:56,689 --> 02:03:56,699
would be heavy Landing legs and you're
 

7105
02:03:56,699 --> 02:03:58,189
would be heavy Landing legs and you're
putting kind of that Landing

7106
02:03:58,189 --> 02:03:58,199
putting kind of that Landing
 

7107
02:03:58,199 --> 02:03:59,750
putting kind of that Landing
infrastructure onto a ground system so

7108
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
infrastructure onto a ground system so
 

7109
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,070
infrastructure onto a ground system so
you're not having to carry those Landing

7110
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:01,080
you're not having to carry those Landing
 

7111
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:04,070
you're not having to carry those Landing
legs into orbit but it's also elevated

7112
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:04,080
legs into orbit but it's also elevated
 

7113
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:05,629
legs into orbit but it's also elevated
off the ground is there some aspect to

7114
02:04:05,629 --> 02:04:05,639
off the ground is there some aspect to
 

7115
02:04:05,639 --> 02:04:06,830
off the ground is there some aspect to
that where you don't have to balance the

7116
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:06,840
that where you don't have to balance the
 

7117
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,510
that where you don't have to balance the
thrust and all the

7118
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:08,520
thrust and all the
 

7119
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,910
thrust and all the
you you you can negate some of those

7120
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:10,920
you you you can negate some of those
 

7121
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,990
you you you can negate some of those
like there's like plume plume

7122
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:12,000
like there's like plume plume
 

7123
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,070
like there's like plume plume
interactions there's like you know the

7124
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:13,080
interactions there's like you know the
 

7125
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,050
interactions there's like you know the
exhaust hitting concrete and especially

7126
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:15,060
exhaust hitting concrete and especially
 

7127
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,490
exhaust hitting concrete and especially
with the rocket this big it's going to

7128
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:16,500
with the rocket this big it's going to
 

7129
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,890
with the rocket this big it's going to
you know use like three Raptor engines

7130
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:18,900
you know use like three Raptor engines
 

7131
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,689
you know use like three Raptor engines
firing if you know if you have them

7132
02:04:20,689 --> 02:04:20,699
firing if you know if you have them
 

7133
02:04:20,699 --> 02:04:22,370
firing if you know if you have them
firing really close to the ground you're

7134
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:22,380
firing really close to the ground you're
 

7135
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:23,570
firing really close to the ground you're
just going to absolutely destroy and

7136
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:23,580
just going to absolutely destroy and
 

7137
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:24,770
just going to absolutely destroy and
crater the ground and you're going to

7138
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:24,780
crater the ground and you're going to
 

7139
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:27,290
crater the ground and you're going to
refurbish the the ground and the landing

7140
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:27,300
refurbish the the ground and the landing
 

7141
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:30,169
refurbish the the ground and the landing
pad every time and you know or have huge

7142
02:04:30,169 --> 02:04:30,179
pad every time and you know or have huge
 

7143
02:04:30,179 --> 02:04:32,089
pad every time and you know or have huge
Landing legs that are super long and and

7144
02:04:32,089 --> 02:04:32,099
Landing legs that are super long and and
 

7145
02:04:32,099 --> 02:04:34,250
Landing legs that are super long and and
Tall you know to to make it so it's

7146
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:34,260
Tall you know to to make it so it's
 

7147
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,709
Tall you know to to make it so it's
elevated enough to not do that

7148
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
elevated enough to not do that
 

7149
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,149
elevated enough to not do that
um so yeah you're kind of you're

7150
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
um so yeah you're kind of you're
 

7151
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,850
um so yeah you're kind of you're
avoiding that whole mess by by catching

7152
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:40,860
avoiding that whole mess by by catching
 

7153
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:42,109
avoiding that whole mess by by catching
it high enough off the ground that you

7154
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:42,119
it high enough off the ground that you
 

7155
02:04:42,119 --> 02:04:43,669
it high enough off the ground that you
don't have to factor that in and it's

7156
02:04:43,669 --> 02:04:43,679
don't have to factor that in and it's
 

7157
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:45,470
don't have to factor that in and it's
that's how many engines are involved in

7158
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:45,480
that's how many engines are involved in
 

7159
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,149
that's how many engines are involved in
the landing as far as the three Raptor

7160
02:04:47,149 --> 02:04:47,159
the landing as far as the three Raptor
 

7161
02:04:47,159 --> 02:04:48,410
the landing as far as the three Raptor
engines well we haven't actually you

7162
02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:48,420
engines well we haven't actually you
 

7163
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:51,109
engines well we haven't actually you
know we haven't today seen the exact

7164
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
know we haven't today seen the exact
 

7165
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:53,089
know we haven't today seen the exact
Landing sequence so it might be

7166
02:04:53,089 --> 02:04:53,099
Landing sequence so it might be
 

7167
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:54,530
Landing sequence so it might be
something like at first they might light

7168
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:54,540
something like at first they might light
 

7169
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,990
something like at first they might light
up you know seven or something or nine

7170
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:57,000
up you know seven or something or nine
 

7171
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,850
up you know seven or something or nine
or something some number to to

7172
02:04:58,850 --> 02:04:58,860
or something some number to to
 

7173
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:01,070
or something some number to to
accelerate quickly or decelerate quickly

7174
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,080
accelerate quickly or decelerate quickly
 

7175
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:02,689
accelerate quickly or decelerate quickly
without the same thing

7176
02:05:02,689 --> 02:05:02,699
without the same thing
 

7177
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:05,330
without the same thing
um and and then shut it down to three or

7178
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:05,340
um and and then shut it down to three or
 

7179
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,589
um and and then shut it down to three or
something for a little bit more granular

7180
02:05:06,589 --> 02:05:06,599
something for a little bit more granular
 

7181
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:09,709
something for a little bit more granular
control because unlike Falcon 9 Starship

7182
02:05:09,709 --> 02:05:09,719
control because unlike Falcon 9 Starship
 

7183
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:11,689
control because unlike Falcon 9 Starship
has enough engines and variability to

7184
02:05:11,689 --> 02:05:11,699
has enough engines and variability to
 

7185
02:05:11,699 --> 02:05:13,250
has enough engines and variability to
actually if it needed to hover you know

7186
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:13,260
actually if it needed to hover you know
 

7187
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,810
actually if it needed to hover you know
to maybe more precisely align itself

7188
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:14,820
to maybe more precisely align itself
 

7189
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,550
to maybe more precisely align itself
with the pad it would have that

7190
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:16,560
with the pad it would have that
 

7191
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,410
with the pad it would have that
capability and especially having

7192
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:18,420
capability and especially having
 

7193
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,729
capability and especially having
multiple engines you know if you only

7194
02:05:19,729 --> 02:05:19,739
multiple engines you know if you only
 

7195
02:05:19,739 --> 02:05:21,649
multiple engines you know if you only
have a single engine running you can't

7196
02:05:21,649 --> 02:05:21,659
have a single engine running you can't
 

7197
02:05:21,659 --> 02:05:24,169
have a single engine running you can't
really roll you know your roll access

7198
02:05:24,169 --> 02:05:24,179
really roll you know your roll access
 

7199
02:05:24,179 --> 02:05:26,270
really roll you know your roll access
you can do pitch and yaw because the the

7200
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:26,280
you can do pitch and yaw because the the
 

7201
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:28,370
you can do pitch and yaw because the the
engine is kind of like a Rudder it it

7202
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:28,380
engine is kind of like a Rudder it it
 

7203
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:30,770
engine is kind of like a Rudder it it
can move in two axes so you can easily

7204
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:30,780
can move in two axes so you can easily
 

7205
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:32,750
can move in two axes so you can easily
pitch and yaw the vehicle but to

7206
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:32,760
pitch and yaw the vehicle but to
 

7207
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,490
pitch and yaw the vehicle but to
actually induce Roll Along its its

7208
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:34,500
actually induce Roll Along its its
 

7209
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,770
actually induce Roll Along its its
vertical axis you you would either need

7210
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:36,780
vertical axis you you would either need
 

7211
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:38,629
vertical axis you you would either need
like auxiliary engines to roll it or

7212
02:05:38,629 --> 02:05:38,639
like auxiliary engines to roll it or
 

7213
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:40,310
like auxiliary engines to roll it or
you'd need a pair of engines so they can

7214
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:40,320
you'd need a pair of engines so they can
 

7215
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:43,430
you'd need a pair of engines so they can
be opposed and induce rolls so by having

7216
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,440
be opposed and induce rolls so by having
 

7217
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,709
be opposed and induce rolls so by having
two or three running they have all three

7218
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:45,719
two or three running they have all three
 

7219
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:47,390
two or three running they have all three
axes of control that they would need

7220
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:47,400
axes of control that they would need
 

7221
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,310
axes of control that they would need
kind of like a broomstick you know and

7222
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:49,320
kind of like a broomstick you know and
 

7223
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,050
kind of like a broomstick you know and
uh bouncing a broomstick on your hand

7224
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,060
uh bouncing a broomstick on your hand
 

7225
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:52,550
uh bouncing a broomstick on your hand
they can just move it over and if they

7226
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:52,560
they can just move it over and if they
 

7227
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,250
they can just move it over and if they
need to align it to those Landing Nubs

7228
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:55,260
need to align it to those Landing Nubs
 

7229
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:56,450
need to align it to those Landing Nubs
you know on the landing arms and stuff

7230
02:05:56,450 --> 02:05:56,460
you know on the landing arms and stuff
 

7231
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:59,209
you know on the landing arms and stuff
like that then uh they can do that

7232
02:05:59,209 --> 02:05:59,219
like that then uh they can do that
 

7233
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:02,750
like that then uh they can do that
uh speaking of pitching yaw the thing uh

7234
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:02,760
uh speaking of pitching yaw the thing uh
 

7235
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:05,330
uh speaking of pitching yaw the thing uh
so Starship flips on its belly flops

7236
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:05,340
so Starship flips on its belly flops
 

7237
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:09,890
so Starship flips on its belly flops
there's a interesting kind of maneuver

7238
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:09,900
there's a interesting kind of maneuver
 

7239
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:12,589
there's a interesting kind of maneuver
uh on the way down to land uh can you

7240
02:06:12,589 --> 02:06:12,599
uh on the way down to land uh can you
 

7241
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:14,030
uh on the way down to land uh can you
describe that maneuver what's involved

7242
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:14,040
describe that maneuver what's involved
 

7243
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,830
describe that maneuver what's involved
with that yeah so this is definitely a

7244
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
with that yeah so this is definitely a
 

7245
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,510
with that yeah so this is definitely a
first I don't think anything's tried

7246
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,520
first I don't think anything's tried
 

7247
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:20,450
first I don't think anything's tried
Landing like this before but the idea is

7248
02:06:20,450 --> 02:06:20,460
Landing like this before but the idea is
 

7249
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,649
Landing like this before but the idea is
when you're falling through the

7250
02:06:21,649 --> 02:06:21,659
when you're falling through the
 

7251
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:22,850
when you're falling through the
atmosphere the atmosphere could actually

7252
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:22,860
atmosphere the atmosphere could actually
 

7253
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,589
atmosphere the atmosphere could actually
do a lot of work for you you know you're

7254
02:06:24,589 --> 02:06:24,599
do a lot of work for you you know you're
 

7255
02:06:24,599 --> 02:06:26,750
do a lot of work for you you know you're
moving quickly something is falling from

7256
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:26,760
moving quickly something is falling from
 

7257
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,089
moving quickly something is falling from
space there's a lot of energy involved

7258
02:06:29,089 --> 02:06:29,099
space there's a lot of energy involved
 

7259
02:06:29,099 --> 02:06:30,649
space there's a lot of energy involved
you have a really good video on this as

7260
02:06:30,649 --> 02:06:30,659
you have a really good video on this as
 

7261
02:06:30,659 --> 02:06:32,089
you have a really good video on this as
well

7262
02:06:32,089 --> 02:06:32,099
well
 

7263
02:06:32,099 --> 02:06:34,189
well
and uh thank you

7264
02:06:34,189 --> 02:06:34,199
and uh thank you
 

7265
02:06:34,199 --> 02:06:36,950
and uh thank you
um the uh as it's falling you know you

7266
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:36,960
um the uh as it's falling you know you
 

7267
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,689
um the uh as it's falling you know you
can you let the you want to let the

7268
02:06:38,689 --> 02:06:38,699
can you let the you want to let the
 

7269
02:06:38,699 --> 02:06:40,550
can you let the you want to let the
atmosphere do as much work as it can

7270
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:40,560
atmosphere do as much work as it can
 

7271
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,930
atmosphere do as much work as it can
and so

7272
02:06:41,930 --> 02:06:41,940
and so
 

7273
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:44,570
and so
um if you have a uh unsymmetric you know

7274
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:44,580
um if you have a uh unsymmetric you know
 

7275
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:46,550
um if you have a uh unsymmetric you know
it's not a ball that's falling this is

7276
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:46,560
it's not a ball that's falling this is
 

7277
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,070
it's not a ball that's falling this is
some kind of object with with shape some

7278
02:06:49,070 --> 02:06:49,080
some kind of object with with shape some
 

7279
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,229
some kind of object with with shape some
you know at one face of it is going to

7280
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:51,239
you know at one face of it is going to
 

7281
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:52,550
you know at one face of it is going to
have more surface area than the other

7282
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:52,560
have more surface area than the other
 

7283
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,950
have more surface area than the other
face so you know in the shape of like a

7284
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:54,960
face so you know in the shape of like a
 

7285
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,530
face so you know in the shape of like a
cylinder if you're falling you know like

7286
02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:57,540
cylinder if you're falling you know like
 

7287
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,810
cylinder if you're falling you know like
a soda can if you're falling top or

7288
02:06:59,810 --> 02:06:59,820
a soda can if you're falling top or
 

7289
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:01,970
a soda can if you're falling top or
bottom first it's a certain amount of

7290
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:01,980
bottom first it's a certain amount of
 

7291
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:03,709
bottom first it's a certain amount of
surface area if you flip that on its

7292
02:07:03,709 --> 02:07:03,719
surface area if you flip that on its
 

7293
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:04,729
surface area if you flip that on its
side you actually have a lot more

7294
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:04,739
side you actually have a lot more
 

7295
02:07:04,739 --> 02:07:07,129
side you actually have a lot more
surface area so with the same exact

7296
02:07:07,129 --> 02:07:07,139
surface area so with the same exact
 

7297
02:07:07,139 --> 02:07:08,930
surface area so with the same exact
vehicle you can actually have a lot more

7298
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:08,940
vehicle you can actually have a lot more
 

7299
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:11,089
vehicle you can actually have a lot more
drag you can actually slow it down a lot

7300
02:07:11,089 --> 02:07:11,099
drag you can actually slow it down a lot
 

7301
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:13,189
drag you can actually slow it down a lot
more using the exact same like same

7302
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
more using the exact same like same
 

7303
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:15,890
more using the exact same like same
atmosphere same same vehicle just by

7304
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:15,900
atmosphere same same vehicle just by
 

7305
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:18,050
atmosphere same same vehicle just by
turning at 90 degrees you can slow it

7306
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:18,060
turning at 90 degrees you can slow it
 

7307
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:20,030
turning at 90 degrees you can slow it
down substantially like three or four

7308
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:20,040
down substantially like three or four
 

7309
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,350
down substantially like three or four
times slower

7310
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
times slower
 

7311
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,330
times slower
so that's energy that you don't have to

7312
02:07:23,330 --> 02:07:23,340
so that's energy that you don't have to
 

7313
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,189
so that's energy that you don't have to
use anywhere else you don't have to use

7314
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:25,199
use anywhere else you don't have to use
 

7315
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:26,390
use anywhere else you don't have to use
an engine to slow you down you don't

7316
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
an engine to slow you down you don't
 

7317
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,709
an engine to slow you down you don't
have to do anything else so SpaceX

7318
02:07:27,709 --> 02:07:27,719
have to do anything else so SpaceX
 

7319
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:29,030
have to do anything else so SpaceX
realized okay if we flip this thing on

7320
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
realized okay if we flip this thing on
 

7321
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,010
realized okay if we flip this thing on
its side and let it fall like a skydiver

7322
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:31,020
its side and let it fall like a skydiver
 

7323
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:32,149
its side and let it fall like a skydiver
almost you know instead of like pencil

7324
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
almost you know instead of like pencil
 

7325
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,350
almost you know instead of like pencil
diving into the pool you're belly

7326
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
diving into the pool you're belly
 

7327
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,550
diving into the pool you're belly
flopping

7328
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
flopping
 

7329
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,709
flopping
you're maximizing the amount of surface

7330
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:36,719
you're maximizing the amount of surface
 

7331
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:38,750
you're maximizing the amount of surface
area that's in the Windstream that's

7332
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:38,760
area that's in the Windstream that's
 

7333
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,570
area that's in the Windstream that's
being slowed down but obviously like in

7334
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:41,580
being slowed down but obviously like in
 

7335
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:43,550
being slowed down but obviously like in
order to land especially if you're

7336
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:43,560
order to land especially if you're
 

7337
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:45,950

SpaceX and you know elon's obsessed with

7338
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:45,960
SpaceX and you know elon's obsessed with
 

7339
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:48,530
SpaceX and you know elon's obsessed with
like not having different parts you know

7340
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:48,540
like not having different parts you know
 

7341
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:51,290
like not having different parts you know
he wants the best part is no part so if

7342
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:51,300
he wants the best part is no part so if
 

7343
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,729
he wants the best part is no part so if
you're going to land with the engines

7344
02:07:52,729 --> 02:07:52,739
you're going to land with the engines
 

7345
02:07:52,739 --> 02:07:55,189
you're going to land with the engines
you might as well use engines that

7346
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:55,199
you might as well use engines that
 

7347
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:57,109
you might as well use engines that
you've already have the engines that are

7348
02:07:57,109 --> 02:07:57,119
you've already have the engines that are
 

7349
02:07:57,119 --> 02:07:58,729
you've already have the engines that are
you know used for the other portions of

7350
02:07:58,729 --> 02:07:58,739
you know used for the other portions of
 

7351
02:07:58,739 --> 02:08:01,010
you know used for the other portions of
flight so you kick those on and you use

7352
02:08:01,010 --> 02:08:01,020
flight so you kick those on and you use
 

7353
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,629
flight so you kick those on and you use
those engines to actually turn it 90

7354
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:02,639
those engines to actually turn it 90
 

7355
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,310
those engines to actually turn it 90
degrees from belly flopping to feet

7356
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
degrees from belly flopping to feet
 

7357
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,450
degrees from belly flopping to feet
first

7358
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:05,460
first
 

7359
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:08,209
first
and that way you can use those same

7360
02:08:08,209 --> 02:08:08,219
and that way you can use those same
 

7361
02:08:08,219 --> 02:08:09,709
and that way you can use those same
engines to land and you don't have to

7362
02:08:09,709 --> 02:08:09,719
engines to land and you don't have to
 

7363
02:08:09,719 --> 02:08:11,870
engines to land and you don't have to
have like auxiliary Landing engines you

7364
02:08:11,870 --> 02:08:11,880
have like auxiliary Landing engines you
 

7365
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:13,550
have like auxiliary Landing engines you
don't have to have forces you know even

7366
02:08:13,550 --> 02:08:13,560
don't have to have forces you know even
 

7367
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,350
don't have to have forces you know even
if you were to land like on its belly

7368
02:08:15,350 --> 02:08:15,360
if you were to land like on its belly
 

7369
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,390
if you were to land like on its belly
with a separate set of engines Not only

7370
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:17,400
with a separate set of engines Not only
 

7371
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,250
with a separate set of engines Not only
would those engines weigh a lot you know

7372
02:08:19,250 --> 02:08:19,260
would those engines weigh a lot you know
 

7373
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:22,010
would those engines weigh a lot you know
and be extra complexity etc etc but you

7374
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:22,020
and be extra complexity etc etc but you
 

7375
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:23,629
and be extra complexity etc etc but you
also don't have to make the ship be able

7376
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:23,639
also don't have to make the ship be able
 

7377
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:25,850
also don't have to make the ship be able
to handle Landing you know like on its

7378
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:25,860
to handle Landing you know like on its
 

7379
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:27,470
to handle Landing you know like on its
belly as opposed to having the forces be

7380
02:08:27,470 --> 02:08:27,480
belly as opposed to having the forces be
 

7381
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,109
belly as opposed to having the forces be
vertical through it but it's a giant

7382
02:08:30,109 --> 02:08:30,119
vertical through it but it's a giant
 

7383
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:34,129
vertical through it but it's a giant
thing you have to rotate in the air huge

7384
02:08:34,129 --> 02:08:34,139
thing you have to rotate in the air huge
 

7385
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:36,410
thing you have to rotate in the air huge
and uh as you also highlight you know

7386
02:08:36,410 --> 02:08:36,420
and uh as you also highlight you know
 

7387
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:39,950
and uh as you also highlight you know
there's liquid fuel slushing around in

7388
02:08:39,950 --> 02:08:39,960
there's liquid fuel slushing around in
 

7389
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:43,729
there's liquid fuel slushing around in
the tank so like you can't uh I guess

7390
02:08:43,729 --> 02:08:43,739
the tank so like you can't uh I guess
 

7391
02:08:43,739 --> 02:08:45,350
the tank so like you can't uh I guess
use that fuel directly you have to have

7392
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:45,360
use that fuel directly you have to have
 

7393
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,149
use that fuel directly you have to have
another kind of fuel like there's just

7394
02:08:47,149 --> 02:08:47,159
another kind of fuel like there's just
 

7395
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:49,430
another kind of fuel like there's just
complexities there yeah that involve uh

7396
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:49,440
complexities there yeah that involve uh
 

7397
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:53,270
complexities there yeah that involve uh
plus the actual maneuver is difficult

7398
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,280
plus the actual maneuver is difficult
 

7399
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,189
plus the actual maneuver is difficult
from the like like what are the

7400
02:08:55,189 --> 02:08:55,199
from the like like what are the
 

7401
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:56,990
from the like like what are the
thrusters that actually make that um

7402
02:08:56,990 --> 02:08:57,000
thrusters that actually make that um
 

7403
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,970
thrusters that actually make that um
make all that happen you're you're

7404
02:08:58,970 --> 02:08:58,980
make all that happen you're you're
 

7405
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:00,430
make all that happen you're you're
adding a lot of

7406
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:00,440
adding a lot of
 

7407
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:04,010
adding a lot of
complexity uh not a lot but your

7408
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:04,020
complexity uh not a lot but your
 

7409
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:06,410
complexity uh not a lot but your
complexity to the maneuver and

7410
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:06,420
complexity to the maneuver and
 

7411
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:08,169
complexity to the maneuver and
possibility where failure Could Happen

7412
02:09:08,169 --> 02:09:08,179
possibility where failure Could Happen
 

7413
02:09:08,179 --> 02:09:11,390
possibility where failure Could Happen
uh in order to sort of save in order for

7414
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:11,400
uh in order to sort of save in order for
 

7415
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:14,629
uh in order to sort of save in order for
the air to do uh some of the work so

7416
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:14,639
the air to do uh some of the work so
 

7417
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:17,089
the air to do uh some of the work so
what is some of that complexity just you

7418
02:09:17,089 --> 02:09:17,099
what is some of that complexity just you
 

7419
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:19,129
what is some of that complexity just you
can Linger on it you know if you if you

7420
02:09:19,129 --> 02:09:19,139
can Linger on it you know if you if you
 

7421
02:09:19,139 --> 02:09:20,209
can Linger on it you know if you if you
think about what it's going to take to

7422
02:09:20,209 --> 02:09:20,219
think about what it's going to take to
 

7423
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:23,330
think about what it's going to take to
go from horizontal to Vertical

7424
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,340
go from horizontal to Vertical
 

7425
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,770
go from horizontal to Vertical
um this rocket in particular that

7426
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:24,780
um this rocket in particular that
 

7427
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,750
um this rocket in particular that
Starship has these big flaps

7428
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:26,760
Starship has these big flaps
 

7429
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,729
Starship has these big flaps
um so it has kind of two nose flaps and

7430
02:09:28,729 --> 02:09:28,739
um so it has kind of two nose flaps and
 

7431
02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:31,550
um so it has kind of two nose flaps and
two uh rearward flaps the river flaps

7432
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:31,560
two uh rearward flaps the river flaps
 

7433
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,050
two uh rearward flaps the river flaps
are a lot bigger because the majority of

7434
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:33,060
are a lot bigger because the majority of
 

7435
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,609
are a lot bigger because the majority of
the the mass the engines and stuff are

7436
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:34,619
the the mass the engines and stuff are
 

7437
02:09:34,619 --> 02:09:36,290
the the mass the engines and stuff are
in the back of the the vehicle so in

7438
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:36,300
in the back of the the vehicle so in
 

7439
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:38,570
in the back of the the vehicle so in
order to kind of be stable and they just

7440
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:38,580
order to kind of be stable and they just
 

7441
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:41,209
order to kind of be stable and they just
fold themselves inwards like on their

7442
02:09:41,209 --> 02:09:41,219
fold themselves inwards like on their
 

7443
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:43,729
fold themselves inwards like on their
dihedral angle at a dihedra angle in

7444
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:43,739
dihedral angle at a dihedra angle in
 

7445
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:44,589
dihedral angle at a dihedra angle in
order to

7446
02:09:44,589 --> 02:09:44,599
order to
 

7447
02:09:44,599 --> 02:09:47,149
order to
increase or decrease the drag so you can

7448
02:09:47,149 --> 02:09:47,159
increase or decrease the drag so you can
 

7449
02:09:47,159 --> 02:09:49,310
increase or decrease the drag so you can
control its all three axes of control

7450
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:49,320
control its all three axes of control
 

7451
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,010
control its all three axes of control
while it's falling uh you know on its

7452
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:52,020
while it's falling uh you know on its
 

7453
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:53,810
while it's falling uh you know on its
belly you can control it that way using

7454
02:09:53,810 --> 02:09:53,820
belly you can control it that way using
 

7455
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:56,149
belly you can control it that way using
these four different fins so you have

7456
02:09:56,149 --> 02:09:56,159
these four different fins so you have
 

7457
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:58,330
these four different fins so you have
these giant moving surfaces that take

7458
02:09:58,330 --> 02:09:58,340
these giant moving surfaces that take
 

7459
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:00,649
these giant moving surfaces that take
thousands of of horsepower or just

7460
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:00,659
thousands of of horsepower or just
 

7461
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:02,209
thousands of of horsepower or just
insane amount of torque in order to move

7462
02:10:02,209 --> 02:10:02,219
insane amount of torque in order to move
 

7463
02:10:02,219 --> 02:10:03,890
insane amount of torque in order to move
these quickly enough to be a valid

7464
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:03,900
these quickly enough to be a valid
 

7465
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:06,229
these quickly enough to be a valid
control surface so that's a huge

7466
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:06,239
control surface so that's a huge
 

7467
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:07,790
control surface so that's a huge
complication is moving these fins and

7468
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:07,800
complication is moving these fins and
 

7469
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,830
complication is moving these fins and
developing that that Landing algorithm

7470
02:10:09,830 --> 02:10:09,840
developing that that Landing algorithm
 

7471
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,830
developing that that Landing algorithm
and the you know the control for a huge

7472
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:12,840
and the you know the control for a huge
 

7473
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,629
and the you know the control for a huge
vehicle with flaps going like you know

7474
02:10:14,629 --> 02:10:14,639
vehicle with flaps going like you know
 

7475
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:16,550
vehicle with flaps going like you know
in and out in and out in and out to stay

7476
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:16,560
in and out in and out in and out to stay
 

7477
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,129
in and out in and out in and out to stay
stable then right as you light the

7478
02:10:19,129 --> 02:10:19,139
stable then right as you light the
 

7479
02:10:19,139 --> 02:10:20,990
stable then right as you light the
engines now all of a sudden you want the

7480
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:21,000
engines now all of a sudden you want the
 

7481
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,209
engines now all of a sudden you want the
top you know you want to flip the rocket

7482
02:10:23,209 --> 02:10:23,219
top you know you want to flip the rocket
 

7483
02:10:23,219 --> 02:10:25,189
top you know you want to flip the rocket
90 degrees so the rear wood flaps the

7484
02:10:25,189 --> 02:10:25,199
90 degrees so the rear wood flaps the
 

7485
02:10:25,199 --> 02:10:27,109
90 degrees so the rear wood flaps the
bottom flaps fold in they tuck all the

7486
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:27,119
bottom flaps fold in they tuck all the
 

7487
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:28,729
bottom flaps fold in they tuck all the
way into minimize drag that's going to

7488
02:10:28,729 --> 02:10:28,739
way into minimize drag that's going to
 

7489
02:10:28,739 --> 02:10:30,830
way into minimize drag that's going to
make it want to you know swing down you

7490
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:30,840
make it want to you know swing down you
 

7491
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,330
make it want to you know swing down you
extend the upper flaps that makes it so

7492
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:32,340
extend the upper flaps that makes it so
 

7493
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,609
extend the upper flaps that makes it so
the nose wants to pitch up you kick on

7494
02:10:34,609 --> 02:10:34,619
the nose wants to pitch up you kick on
 

7495
02:10:34,619 --> 02:10:36,109
the nose wants to pitch up you kick on
the engines

7496
02:10:36,109 --> 02:10:36,119
the engines
 

7497
02:10:36,119 --> 02:10:37,370
the engines
um they're now lighting all three

7498
02:10:37,370 --> 02:10:37,380
um they're now lighting all three
 

7499
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:39,410
um they're now lighting all three
engines at least as of the last like

7500
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:39,420
engines at least as of the last like
 

7501
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,910
engines at least as of the last like
successful attempts they like all three

7502
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:40,920
successful attempts they like all three
 

7503
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,350
successful attempts they like all three
of the sea level Raptor engines and

7504
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:42,360
of the sea level Raptor engines and
 

7505
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,209
of the sea level Raptor engines and
they're pitched all the way like you

7506
02:10:44,209 --> 02:10:44,219
they're pitched all the way like you
 

7507
02:10:44,219 --> 02:10:46,189
they're pitched all the way like you
know 10 or 15 degrees or whatever the

7508
02:10:46,189 --> 02:10:46,199
know 10 or 15 degrees or whatever the
 

7509
02:10:46,199 --> 02:10:48,770
know 10 or 15 degrees or whatever the
maximum pitches on them and that induces

7510
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:48,780
maximum pitches on them and that induces
 

7511
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:51,350
maximum pitches on them and that induces
a you know it does that kick maneuver to

7512
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,360
a you know it does that kick maneuver to
 

7513
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,750
a you know it does that kick maneuver to
kick it over from horizontal to vertical

7514
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:53,760
kick it over from horizontal to vertical
 

7515
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,669
kick it over from horizontal to vertical
now the problem is you lit your engines

7516
02:10:55,669 --> 02:10:55,679
now the problem is you lit your engines
 

7517
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:59,149
now the problem is you lit your engines
while you're horizontal so they put some

7518
02:10:59,149 --> 02:10:59,159
while you're horizontal so they put some
 

7519
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:00,770
while you're horizontal so they put some
horizontal velocity into the rocket they

7520
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:00,780
horizontal velocity into the rocket they
 

7521
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:02,750
horizontal velocity into the rocket they
push the rocket you know at the time the

7522
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:02,760
push the rocket you know at the time the
 

7523
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:04,250
push the rocket you know at the time the
nose is at the time of lighting those

7524
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:04,260
nose is at the time of lighting those
 

7525
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:06,290
nose is at the time of lighting those
engines the nose is facing the Horizon

7526
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:06,300
engines the nose is facing the Horizon
 

7527
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:08,089
engines the nose is facing the Horizon
and the engines are facing the opposite

7528
02:11:08,089 --> 02:11:08,099
and the engines are facing the opposite
 

7529
02:11:08,099 --> 02:11:10,850
and the engines are facing the opposite
Horizon yeah see now shot at a decent

7530
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:10,860
Horizon yeah see now shot at a decent
 

7531
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:13,490
Horizon yeah see now shot at a decent
amount and often you know the direction

7532
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:13,500
amount and often you know the direction
 

7533
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,890
amount and often you know the direction
that you're not falling you know

7534
02:11:15,890 --> 02:11:15,900
that you're not falling you know
 

7535
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:18,290
that you're not falling you know
um so you have to factor that in to

7536
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:18,300
um so you have to factor that in to
 

7537
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,310
um so you have to factor that in to
where you're Landing because you're

7538
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:19,320
where you're Landing because you're
 

7539
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:20,570
where you're Landing because you're
going to land on this precise in this

7540
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:20,580
going to land on this precise in this
 

7541
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:21,770
going to land on this precise in this
case you're going to land on the inside

7542
02:11:21,770 --> 02:11:21,780
case you're going to land on the inside
 

7543
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:23,330
case you're going to land on the inside
of the arm the loving arms of the

7544
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:23,340
of the arm the loving arms of the

7547
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:27,290
Chopsticks you know the Creed Arms Wide
Open you know try to land inside this

7548
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:27,300
Open you know try to land inside this
 

7549
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:28,550

02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,050
exactly the song they'll be playing
through my head as I watch this now

7552
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,060
through my head as I watch this now
 

7553
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:33,470
through my head as I watch this now
thank you thank you for forever joining

7554
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:33,480
thank you thank you for forever joining
 

7555
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:37,070
thank you thank you for forever joining
those two I appreciate this and you have

7556
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:37,080
those two I appreciate this and you have
 

7557
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:38,629
those two I appreciate this and you have
to very precisely control so what you

7558
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:38,639
to very precisely control so what you
 

7559
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:40,010
to very precisely control so what you
have to do is now that it's done that

7560
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:40,020
have to do is now that it's done that
 

7561
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:41,750
have to do is now that it's done that
kick you also have to cancel out that

7562
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:41,760
kick you also have to cancel out that
 

7563
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,490
kick you also have to cancel out that
horizontal velocity so it's actually

7564
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:43,500
horizontal velocity so it's actually
 

7565
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:46,669
horizontal velocity so it's actually
going to rotate Beyond 90 degrees to

7566
02:11:46,669 --> 02:11:46,679
going to rotate Beyond 90 degrees to
 

7567
02:11:46,679 --> 02:11:49,010
going to rotate Beyond 90 degrees to
cancel out that horizontal velocity

7568
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:49,020
cancel out that horizontal velocity
 

7569
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:51,830
cancel out that horizontal velocity
and then modulate the engines to make it

7570
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:51,840
and then modulate the engines to make it
 

7571
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:54,050
and then modulate the engines to make it
so the thrust you know is is perfect

7572
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:54,060
so the thrust you know is is perfect
 

7573
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:56,209
so the thrust you know is is perfect
so that it can control itself into a

7574
02:11:56,209 --> 02:11:56,219
so that it can control itself into a
 

7575
02:11:56,219 --> 02:11:58,129
so that it can control itself into a
controlled landing and all this is done

7576
02:11:58,129 --> 02:11:58,139
controlled landing and all this is done
 

7577
02:11:58,139 --> 02:12:01,250
controlled landing and all this is done
in like 500 meters like 1500 feet you

7578
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:01,260
in like 500 meters like 1500 feet you
 

7579
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:03,250
in like 500 meters like 1500 feet you
know you're doing all of those things

7580
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:03,260
know you're doing all of those things
 

7581
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:05,570
know you're doing all of those things
stupidly close to the ground it looks

7582
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:05,580
stupidly close to the ground it looks
 

7583
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:07,490
stupidly close to the ground it looks
absurd so far they've done five of these

7584
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:07,500
absurd so far they've done five of these
 

7585
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:11,270
absurd so far they've done five of these
tests all um the first four all blew up

7586
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:11,280
tests all um the first four all blew up
 

7587
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,850
tests all um the first four all blew up
you know um they're all coming in from

7588
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:13,860
you know um they're all coming in from
 

7589
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:16,669
you know um they're all coming in from
about 10 kilometers or 33 000 feet

7590
02:12:16,669 --> 02:12:16,679
about 10 kilometers or 33 000 feet
 

7591
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:19,010
about 10 kilometers or 33 000 feet
um falling flipping you know again this

7592
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:19,020
um falling flipping you know again this
 

7593
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:20,750
um falling flipping you know again this
thing is huge that just the booster or

7594
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:20,760
thing is huge that just the booster or
 

7595
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:22,370
thing is huge that just the booster or
just the upper stage of this

7596
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:22,380
just the upper stage of this
 

7597
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:24,890
just the upper stage of this
um is is like 50 meters tall you know so

7598
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:24,900
um is is like 50 meters tall you know so
 

7599
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:27,410
um is is like 50 meters tall you know so
it's 150 well it's like 45 meter about

7600
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:27,420
it's 150 well it's like 45 meter about
 

7601
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:30,530
it's 150 well it's like 45 meter about
50 meters tall about 165 feet tall

7602
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:30,540
50 meters tall about 165 feet tall
 

7603
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:32,570
50 meters tall about 165 feet tall
um nine meters wide so 30 feet wide it

7604
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:32,580
um nine meters wide so 30 feet wide it
 

7605
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:34,609
um nine meters wide so 30 feet wide it
weighs you know something like God I

7606
02:12:34,609 --> 02:12:34,619
weighs you know something like God I
 

7607
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:35,750
weighs you know something like God I
don't remember if it's something like

7608
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:35,760
don't remember if it's something like
 

7609
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:38,930
don't remember if it's something like
120 metric tons so 120 000 kilograms you

7610
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:38,940
120 metric tons so 120 000 kilograms you
 

7611
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:40,970
120 metric tons so 120 000 kilograms you
know two quarter of a million pounds

7612
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:40,980
know two quarter of a million pounds
 

7613
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:43,370
know two quarter of a million pounds
empty and it's doing this flip maneuver

7614
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:43,380
empty and it's doing this flip maneuver
 

7615
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:45,770
empty and it's doing this flip maneuver
and it has to do all this perfectly so

7616
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:45,780
and it has to do all this perfectly so
 

7617
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:47,149
and it has to do all this perfectly so
the first four four attempts of this

7618
02:12:47,149 --> 02:12:47,159
the first four four attempts of this
 

7619
02:12:47,159 --> 02:12:49,669
the first four four attempts of this
were pretty spectacular failures so just

7620
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
were pretty spectacular failures so just
 

7621
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,350
were pretty spectacular failures so just
to clarify which stage is doing this

7622
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:51,360
to clarify which stage is doing this
 

7623
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:52,970
to clarify which stage is doing this
maneuver it's the upper stage it's doing

7624
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:52,980
maneuver it's the upper stage it's doing
 

7625
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:55,250
maneuver it's the upper stage it's doing
this belly flop maneuver yep uh so this

7626
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:55,260
this belly flop maneuver yep uh so this
 

7627
02:12:55,260 --> 02:13:00,350
this belly flop maneuver yep uh so this
is the the stage that would presumably

7628
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:00,360
is the the stage that would presumably
 

7629
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:02,450
is the the stage that would presumably
um have humans on board if it were to

7630
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:02,460
um have humans on board if it were to
 

7631
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:03,290
um have humans on board if it were to
use

7632
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:03,300
use
 

7633
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:05,689
use
um uh if things continue to play now

7634
02:13:05,689 --> 02:13:05,699
um uh if things continue to play now
 

7635
02:13:05,699 --> 02:13:07,729
um uh if things continue to play now
here's here's something I would love to

7636
02:13:07,729 --> 02:13:07,739
here's here's something I would love to
 

7637
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:10,370
here's here's something I would love to
see yeah just saying this yeah if you

7638
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:10,380
see yeah just saying this yeah if you
 

7639
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:12,410
see yeah just saying this yeah if you
already have these big Arrow surfaces

7640
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:12,420
already have these big Arrow surfaces
 

7641
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:14,990
already have these big Arrow surfaces
the flaps they also have to move they're

7642
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:15,000
the flaps they also have to move they're
 

7643
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,030
the flaps they also have to move they're
on heavy Motors and hinges and flaps and

7644
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
on heavy Motors and hinges and flaps and
 

7645
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,069
on heavy Motors and hinges and flaps and
all that stuff I'm actually surprised

7646
02:13:19,069 --> 02:13:19,079
all that stuff I'm actually surprised
 

7647
02:13:19,079 --> 02:13:20,569
all that stuff I'm actually surprised
that for Earth

7648
02:13:20,569 --> 02:13:20,579
that for Earth
 

7649
02:13:20,579 --> 02:13:22,129
that for Earth
they aren't just looking at Landing it

7650
02:13:22,129 --> 02:13:22,139
they aren't just looking at Landing it
 

7651
02:13:22,139 --> 02:13:23,510
they aren't just looking at Landing it
horizontally on a Runway like the space

7652
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
horizontally on a Runway like the space
 

7653
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:24,709
horizontally on a Runway like the space
shuttle

7654
02:13:24,709 --> 02:13:24,719
shuttle
 

7655
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:25,850
shuttle
oh

7656
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:25,860
oh
 

7657
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:28,129
oh
I mean interesting that worked the brand

7658
02:13:28,129 --> 02:13:28,139
I mean interesting that worked the brand
 

7659
02:13:28,139 --> 02:13:29,750
I mean interesting that worked the brand
did it you know the Soviet Union's put

7660
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:29,760
did it you know the Soviet Union's put
 

7661
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,530
did it you know the Soviet Union's put
on I rolled my arm real hard there sorry

7662
02:13:32,530 --> 02:13:32,540
on I rolled my arm real hard there sorry
 

7663
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:36,490
on I rolled my arm real hard there sorry
wow wow really good I'm very impressed

7664
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:36,500
wow wow really good I'm very impressed
 

7665
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,990
wow wow really good I'm very impressed
and uh you know the Branded it do we

7666
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:39,000
and uh you know the Branded it do we
 

7667
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,750
and uh you know the Branded it do we
have other space planes like the x37b we

7668
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:41,760
have other space planes like the x37b we
 

7669
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,250
have other space planes like the x37b we
have the upcoming Sierra Nevada's Dream

7670
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:43,260
have the upcoming Sierra Nevada's Dream
 

7671
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:46,129
have the upcoming Sierra Nevada's Dream
Chaser uh it's yeah you have some extra

7672
02:13:46,129 --> 02:13:46,139
Chaser uh it's yeah you have some extra
 

7673
02:13:46,139 --> 02:13:48,050
Chaser uh it's yeah you have some extra
mass in the wings but so does Starship

7674
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:48,060
mass in the wings but so does Starship
 

7675
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,550
mass in the wings but so does Starship
Starship has the extra mass of those

7676
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:49,560
Starship has the extra mass of those
 

7677
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:52,970
Starship has the extra mass of those
flaps and you know the the motors and

7678
02:13:52,970 --> 02:13:52,980
flaps and you know the the motors and
 

7679
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:54,770
flaps and you know the the motors and
the hinges and all that stuff I I would

7680
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:54,780
the hinges and all that stuff I I would
 

7681
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:56,569
the hinges and all that stuff I I would
like to see the trade on like is it

7682
02:13:56,569 --> 02:13:56,579
like to see the trade on like is it
 

7683
02:13:56,579 --> 02:13:58,790
like to see the trade on like is it
actually lighter weight

7684
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:58,800
actually lighter weight
 

7685
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:01,669
actually lighter weight
to do that versus doing what SpaceX is

7686
02:14:01,669 --> 02:14:01,679
to do that versus doing what SpaceX is
 

7687
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:02,750
to do that versus doing what SpaceX is
doing

7688
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:02,760
doing
 

7689
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:04,669
doing
so yeah I mean that's that's the funny

7690
02:14:04,669 --> 02:14:04,679
so yeah I mean that's that's the funny
 

7691
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:06,470
so yeah I mean that's that's the funny
thing I think realistically if Elon

7692
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,480
thing I think realistically if Elon
 

7693
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,390
thing I think realistically if Elon
walks in the door tomorrow and says guys

7694
02:14:08,390 --> 02:14:08,400
walks in the door tomorrow and says guys
 

7695
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,890
walks in the door tomorrow and says guys
we did some simulations and actually

7696
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:09,900
we did some simulations and actually
 

7697
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,109
we did some simulations and actually
it's like we can get another 5 000

7698
02:14:12,109 --> 02:14:12,119
it's like we can get another 5 000
 

7699
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:14,089
it's like we can get another 5 000
kilograms into space if we just land it

7700
02:14:14,089 --> 02:14:14,099
kilograms into space if we just land it
 

7701
02:14:14,099 --> 02:14:15,410
kilograms into space if we just land it
horizontal if we kind of give up on our

7702
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:15,420
horizontal if we kind of give up on our
 

7703
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:17,330
horizontal if we kind of give up on our
ego and land horizontally at least on

7704
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:17,340
ego and land horizontally at least on
 

7705
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,050
ego and land horizontally at least on
Earth

7706
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,060
Earth
 

7707
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,810
Earth
then you know I think they could be

7708
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:20,820
then you know I think they could be
 

7709
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:21,950
then you know I think they could be
doing that pretty quickly because that's

7710
02:14:21,950 --> 02:14:21,960
doing that pretty quickly because that's
 

7711
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:24,290
doing that pretty quickly because that's
the thing is uh this ultimate thing has

7712
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:24,300
the thing is uh this ultimate thing has
 

7713
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,209
the thing is uh this ultimate thing has
been to land on Mars and you know other

7714
02:14:26,209 --> 02:14:26,219
been to land on Mars and you know other
 

7715
02:14:26,219 --> 02:14:27,890
been to land on Mars and you know other
planets and Mars doesn't have a Runway

7716
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:27,900
planets and Mars doesn't have a Runway
 

7717
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,589
planets and Mars doesn't have a Runway
doesn't have a you know thick enough

7718
02:14:30,589 --> 02:14:30,599
doesn't have a you know thick enough
 

7719
02:14:30,599 --> 02:14:32,450
doesn't have a you know thick enough
atmosphere to utilize aerodynamic flight

7720
02:14:32,450 --> 02:14:32,460
atmosphere to utilize aerodynamic flight
 

7721
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:34,310
atmosphere to utilize aerodynamic flight
like that so you have to do propulsive

7722
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:34,320
like that so you have to do propulsive
 

7723
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,930
like that so you have to do propulsive
Landing for Mars

7724
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:35,940
Landing for Mars
 

7725
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:37,490
Landing for Mars
um you're going to land on an unprepared

7726
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:37,500
um you're going to land on an unprepared
 

7727
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,830
um you're going to land on an unprepared
surface you know so it has to be able to

7728
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:39,840
surface you know so it has to be able to
 

7729
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:42,649
surface you know so it has to be able to
do this at some point the ultimate it

7730
02:14:42,649 --> 02:14:42,659
do this at some point the ultimate it
 

7731
02:14:42,659 --> 02:14:45,350
do this at some point the ultimate it
sounds ridiculous and it is but the

7732
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:45,360
sounds ridiculous and it is but the
 

7733
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:47,209
sounds ridiculous and it is but the
ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars

7734
02:14:47,209 --> 02:14:47,219
ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars
 

7735
02:14:47,219 --> 02:14:48,950
ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars
there's not much of an atmosphere to

7736
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
there's not much of an atmosphere to
 

7737
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,490
there's not much of an atmosphere to
like to help you with the for the belly

7738
02:14:52,490 --> 02:14:52,500
like to help you with the for the belly
 

7739
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,990
like to help you with the for the belly
fat to be useful there's only one

7740
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:54,000
fat to be useful there's only one
 

7741
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,790
fat to be useful there's only one
percent the atmosphere on Mars as there

7742
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:55,800
percent the atmosphere on Mars as there
 

7743
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,530
percent the atmosphere on Mars as there
is on Earth but you still want to

7744
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:57,540
is on Earth but you still want to
 

7745
02:14:57,540 --> 02:14:59,149
is on Earth but you still want to
utilize as much of that atmosphere as

7746
02:14:59,149 --> 02:14:59,159
utilize as much of that atmosphere as
 

7747
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:01,310
utilize as much of that atmosphere as
possible so in the upper atmosphere it's

7748
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:01,320
possible so in the upper atmosphere it's
 

7749
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,350
possible so in the upper atmosphere it's
still going to be coming in more or less

7750
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,360
still going to be coming in more or less
 

7751
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,629
still going to be coming in more or less
uh kind of perpendicular to the

7752
02:15:05,629 --> 02:15:05,639
uh kind of perpendicular to the
 

7753
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:07,129
uh kind of perpendicular to the
Airstream I guess it's probably more

7754
02:15:07,129 --> 02:15:07,139
Airstream I guess it's probably more
 

7755
02:15:07,139 --> 02:15:10,250
Airstream I guess it's probably more
like you know 60 degrees 70 degrees to

7756
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:10,260
like you know 60 degrees 70 degrees to
 

7757
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,870
like you know 60 degrees 70 degrees to
the Airstream like where it's belly

7758
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:11,880
the Airstream like where it's belly
 

7759
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,790
the Airstream like where it's belly
flopping and it's going to especially do

7760
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:13,800
flopping and it's going to especially do
 

7761
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,950
flopping and it's going to especially do
that on Mars it's going to need to you

7762
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:15,960
that on Mars it's going to need to you
 

7763
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:18,709
that on Mars it's going to need to you
know use up as let the little bit of

7764
02:15:18,709 --> 02:15:18,719
know use up as let the little bit of
 

7765
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:19,790
know use up as let the little bit of
atmosphere there is you know you're

7766
02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:19,800
atmosphere there is you know you're
 

7767
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:22,250
atmosphere there is you know you're
coming in at insane velocities and so

7768
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:22,260
coming in at insane velocities and so
 

7769
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:23,930
coming in at insane velocities and so
even that one percent thin atmosphere is

7770
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:23,940
even that one percent thin atmosphere is
 

7771
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:26,689
even that one percent thin atmosphere is
still going to do a lot of work now on

7772
02:15:26,689 --> 02:15:26,699
still going to do a lot of work now on
 

7773
02:15:26,699 --> 02:15:29,569
still going to do a lot of work now on
Mars that there's only 38 of Earth's

7774
02:15:29,569 --> 02:15:29,579
Mars that there's only 38 of Earth's
 

7775
02:15:29,579 --> 02:15:31,970
Mars that there's only 38 of Earth's
gravity on Mars so the belly flop

7776
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:31,980
gravity on Mars so the belly flop
 

7777
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,589
gravity on Mars so the belly flop
maneuver is a lot it could be a lot more

7778
02:15:33,589 --> 02:15:33,599
maneuver is a lot it could be a lot more
 

7779
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:36,109
maneuver is a lot it could be a lot more
conservative you could do that at like 5

7780
02:15:36,109 --> 02:15:36,119
conservative you could do that at like 5
 

7781
02:15:36,119 --> 02:15:38,629
conservative you could do that at like 5
000 feet up and it just wouldn't matter

7782
02:15:38,629 --> 02:15:38,639
000 feet up and it just wouldn't matter
 

7783
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:39,890
000 feet up and it just wouldn't matter
as much because there's not as much

7784
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:39,900
as much because there's not as much
 

7785
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:41,750
as much because there's not as much
gravity loss or gravity drag so you can

7786
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:41,760
gravity loss or gravity drag so you can
 

7787
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:43,910
gravity loss or gravity drag so you can
kind of just more more slowly gently you

7788
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920
kind of just more more slowly gently you
 

7789
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,189
kind of just more more slowly gently you
know you don't have to do this crazy

7790
02:15:45,189 --> 02:15:45,199
know you don't have to do this crazy
 

7791
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:47,990
know you don't have to do this crazy
extravagant like belly flop you know

7792
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:48,000
extravagant like belly flop you know
 

7793
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,390
extravagant like belly flop you know
flip maneuver but it would still

7794
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:50,400
flip maneuver but it would still
 

7795
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:51,530
flip maneuver but it would still
something at some point you would

7796
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:51,540
something at some point you would
 

7797
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:53,089
something at some point you would
transition from more or less

7798
02:15:53,089 --> 02:15:53,099
transition from more or less
 

7799
02:15:53,099 --> 02:15:55,010
transition from more or less
perpendicular to the Airstream to you

7800
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:55,020
perpendicular to the Airstream to you
 

7801
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:58,189
perpendicular to the Airstream to you
know horizontal to Landing vertically I

7802
02:15:58,189 --> 02:15:58,199
know horizontal to Landing vertically I
 

7803
02:15:58,199 --> 02:16:00,050
know horizontal to Landing vertically I
like how we're having this old boring

7804
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,060
like how we're having this old boring
 

7805
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:02,149
like how we're having this old boring
conversation about the differences of

7806
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
conversation about the differences of
 

7807
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:04,569
conversation about the differences of
landing on Earth versus on Mars

7808
02:16:04,569 --> 02:16:04,579
landing on Earth versus on Mars
 

7809
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:08,750
landing on Earth versus on Mars
uh this is surreal that this is actually

7810
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:08,760
uh this is surreal that this is actually
 

7811
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:10,609
uh this is surreal that this is actually
a real conversation

7812
02:16:10,609 --> 02:16:10,619
a real conversation
 

7813
02:16:10,619 --> 02:16:12,709
a real conversation
but this is something that we're

7814
02:16:12,709 --> 02:16:12,719
but this is something that we're
 

7815
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,990
but this is something that we're
discussing yeah because it has to do

7816
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:15,000
discussing yeah because it has to do
 

7817
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,069
discussing yeah because it has to do
both yeah but in my opinion yes I think

7818
02:16:19,069 --> 02:16:19,079
both yeah but in my opinion yes I think
 

7819
02:16:19,079 --> 02:16:20,750
both yeah but in my opinion yes I think
we'll pretty quickly see an evolution of

7820
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:20,760
we'll pretty quickly see an evolution of
 

7821
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:22,910
we'll pretty quickly see an evolution of
Starship that's like dedicated versions

7822
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:22,920
Starship that's like dedicated versions
 

7823
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:25,430
Starship that's like dedicated versions
for certain tasks sure and at the end of

7824
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:25,440
for certain tasks sure and at the end of
 

7825
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:28,430
for certain tasks sure and at the end of
the day again if if it's if someone runs

7826
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:28,440
the day again if if it's if someone runs
 

7827
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,109
the day again if if it's if someone runs
the simulation says it's actually more

7828
02:16:30,109 --> 02:16:30,119
the simulation says it's actually more
 

7829
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:32,209
the simulation says it's actually more
efficient and it's better just to land

7830
02:16:32,209 --> 02:16:32,219
efficient and it's better just to land
 

7831
02:16:32,219 --> 02:16:34,849
efficient and it's better just to land
horizontally on a Runway then that's

7832
02:16:34,849 --> 02:16:34,859
horizontally on a Runway then that's
 

7833
02:16:34,859 --> 02:16:36,770
horizontally on a Runway then that's
what's gonna happen you know it it

7834
02:16:36,770 --> 02:16:36,780
what's gonna happen you know it it
 

7835
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:38,810
what's gonna happen you know it it
doesn't matter but they still will

7836
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:38,820
doesn't matter but they still will
 

7837
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:40,549
doesn't matter but they still will
develop you know if the ultimate goal is

7838
02:16:40,549 --> 02:16:40,559
develop you know if the ultimate goal is
 

7839
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:41,690
develop you know if the ultimate goal is
to land on Mars and they'll have a

7840
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:41,700
to land on Mars and they'll have a
 

7841
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:44,209
to land on Mars and they'll have a
dedicated Mars variant you know which

7842
02:16:44,209 --> 02:16:44,219
dedicated Mars variant you know which
 

7843
02:16:44,219 --> 02:16:46,129
dedicated Mars variant you know which
will likely look different than the

7844
02:16:46,129 --> 02:16:46,139
will likely look different than the
 

7845
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:47,690
will likely look different than the
earth variant you know and they'll still

7846
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:47,700
earth variant you know and they'll still
 

7847
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,910
earth variant you know and they'll still
probably be launched on the same booster

7848
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
probably be launched on the same booster
 

7849
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,770
probably be launched on the same booster
you know what I mean so there's Oh you

7850
02:16:51,770 --> 02:16:51,780
you know what I mean so there's Oh you
 

7851
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:53,810
you know what I mean so there's Oh you
mean like that particular vehicle will

7852
02:16:53,810 --> 02:16:53,820
mean like that particular vehicle will
 

7853
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:55,549
mean like that particular vehicle will
not be returning back to Earth it'll

7854
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:55,559
not be returning back to Earth it'll
 

7855
02:16:55,559 --> 02:16:58,129
not be returning back to Earth it'll
need to be modified because uh because

7856
02:16:58,129 --> 02:16:58,139
need to be modified because uh because
 

7857
02:16:58,139 --> 02:16:59,570
need to be modified because uh because
the ultimate is to have one Starship

7858
02:16:59,570 --> 02:16:59,580
the ultimate is to have one Starship
 

7859
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:01,370
the ultimate is to have one Starship
that goes to Mars lands on Mars and

7860
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:01,380
that goes to Mars lands on Mars and
 

7861
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:03,469
that goes to Mars lands on Mars and
takes off of Mars lands back on Earth

7862
02:17:03,469 --> 02:17:03,479
takes off of Mars lands back on Earth
 

7863
02:17:03,479 --> 02:17:05,750
takes off of Mars lands back on Earth
and is reused again yeah over and over

7864
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:05,760
and is reused again yeah over and over
 

7865
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,129
and is reused again yeah over and over
and over and there's a chance that you

7866
02:17:07,129 --> 02:17:07,139
and over and there's a chance that you
 

7867
02:17:07,139 --> 02:17:10,129
and over and there's a chance that you
you know you have just a cycler just a

7868
02:17:10,129 --> 02:17:10,139
you know you have just a cycler just a
 

7869
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:12,410
you know you have just a cycler just a
you know if you're if you at the end of

7870
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:12,420
you know if you're if you at the end of
 

7871
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:13,549
you know if you're if you at the end of
the day you're just really trying to see

7872
02:17:13,549 --> 02:17:13,559
the day you're just really trying to see
 

7873
02:17:13,559 --> 02:17:14,990
the day you're just really trying to see
what is most feasible what's the most

7874
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:15,000
what is most feasible what's the most
 

7875
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,730
what is most feasible what's the most
efficient you literally have a vehicle

7876
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:16,740
efficient you literally have a vehicle
 

7877
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:18,589
efficient you literally have a vehicle
dedicated to Mars Mars it's easy to do a

7878
02:17:18,589 --> 02:17:18,599
dedicated to Mars Mars it's easy to do a
 

7879
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:20,690
dedicated to Mars Mars it's easy to do a
single stage to orbit it's a lot lower

7880
02:17:20,690 --> 02:17:20,700
single stage to orbit it's a lot lower
 

7881
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:22,790
single stage to orbit it's a lot lower
gravity a lot thinner atmosphere you can

7882
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:22,800
gravity a lot thinner atmosphere you can
 

7883
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,169
gravity a lot thinner atmosphere you can
easily do a single stage orbit you get

7884
02:17:24,169 --> 02:17:24,179
easily do a single stage orbit you get
 

7885
02:17:24,179 --> 02:17:27,230
easily do a single stage orbit you get
into orbit you park to a dedicated you

7886
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,240
into orbit you park to a dedicated you
 

7887
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,730
into orbit you park to a dedicated you
know transfer vehicle that goes between

7888
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:28,740
know transfer vehicle that goes between
 

7889
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:30,290
know transfer vehicle that goes between
Earth and Mars it only stays in space

7890
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:30,300
Earth and Mars it only stays in space
 

7891
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:31,429
Earth and Mars it only stays in space
you don't have heat shields you don't

7892
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:31,439
you don't have heat shields you don't
 

7893
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:33,349
you don't have heat shields you don't
have Landing Lakes you don't have all

7894
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
have Landing Lakes you don't have all
 

7895
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:34,790
have Landing Lakes you don't have all
these things that you need and ideally

7896
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:34,800
these things that you need and ideally
 

7897
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,349
these things that you need and ideally
it's nuclear powered so it's super

7898
02:17:36,349 --> 02:17:36,359
it's nuclear powered so it's super
 

7899
02:17:36,359 --> 02:17:38,570
it's nuclear powered so it's super
efficient that gets you back to earth

7900
02:17:38,570 --> 02:17:38,580
efficient that gets you back to earth
 

7901
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:40,250
efficient that gets you back to earth
once you're at Earth you Rendezvous

7902
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:40,260
once you're at Earth you Rendezvous
 

7903
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:42,770
once you're at Earth you Rendezvous
again with another Landing Starship and

7904
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:42,780
again with another Landing Starship and
 

7905
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:45,349
again with another Landing Starship and
that Starship might be horizontal Runway

7906
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:45,359
that Starship might be horizontal Runway
 

7907
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:47,810
that Starship might be horizontal Runway
Starship you know like yeah there's no I

7908
02:17:47,810 --> 02:17:47,820
Starship you know like yeah there's no I
 

7909
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:49,910
Starship you know like yeah there's no I
I don't see the and I think ultimately

7910
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:49,920
I don't see the and I think ultimately
 

7911
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:51,830
I don't see the and I think ultimately
it'll win out where we don't have a one

7912
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
it'll win out where we don't have a one
 

7913
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,110
it'll win out where we don't have a one
size fits all I think that's that's the

7914
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:54,120
size fits all I think that's that's the
 

7915
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,490
size fits all I think that's that's the
flaw of the Space Shuttle really is that

7916
02:17:55,490 --> 02:17:55,500
flaw of the Space Shuttle really is that
 

7917
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:57,469
flaw of the Space Shuttle really is that
it was trying to do everything and ended

7918
02:17:57,469 --> 02:17:57,479
it was trying to do everything and ended
 

7919
02:17:57,479 --> 02:17:59,509
it was trying to do everything and ended
up kind of doing nothing well but that's

7920
02:17:59,509 --> 02:17:59,519
up kind of doing nothing well but that's
 

7921
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:01,370
up kind of doing nothing well but that's
I think what SpaceX has proven I mean

7922
02:18:01,370 --> 02:18:01,380
I think what SpaceX has proven I mean
 

7923
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:02,629
I think what SpaceX has proven I mean

as the old like uh Lucy K joke with like

7952
02:18:31,009 --> 02:18:31,019
as the old like uh Lucy K joke with like
 

7953
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:33,889
as the old like uh Lucy K joke with like
where you're flying on a chair through

7954
02:18:33,889 --> 02:18:33,899
where you're flying on a chair through
 

7955
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:36,830
where you're flying on a chair through
the air it's incredible you didn't even

7956
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:36,840
the air it's incredible you didn't even
 

7957
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,270
the air it's incredible you didn't even
know this existed and now you're

7958
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:38,280
know this existed and now you're
 

7959
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:40,370
know this existed and now you're
complaining about it oh that's great

7960
02:18:40,370 --> 02:18:40,380
complaining about it oh that's great
 

7961
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:43,190

exactly uh so you yeah you tweeted fun

7962
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,200
exactly uh so you yeah you tweeted fun
 

7963
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:46,669

fact about Starship by doing the flip

7964
02:18:46,669 --> 02:18:46,679
fact about Starship by doing the flip
 

7965
02:18:46,679 --> 02:18:48,830
fact about Starship by doing the flip
around 500 meters versus higher up like

7966
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:48,840
around 500 meters versus higher up like
 

7967
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,990
around 500 meters versus higher up like
two two thousand meters the difference

7968
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:51,000
two two thousand meters the difference
 

7969
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,610
two two thousand meters the difference
in Delta V is 500 meters per second

7970
02:18:55,610 --> 02:18:55,620
in Delta V is 500 meters per second
 

7971
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:58,730
in Delta V is 500 meters per second
that's a 20 ton fuel saving which means

7972
02:18:58,730 --> 02:18:58,740
that's a 20 ton fuel saving which means
 

7973
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:00,830
that's a 20 ton fuel saving which means
basically 20 tons more you can put into

7974
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:00,840
basically 20 tons more you can put into
 

7975
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:03,709
basically 20 tons more you can put into
orbit that's more than uh Falcon 9 has

7976
02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:03,719
orbit that's more than uh Falcon 9 has
 

7977
02:19:03,719 --> 02:19:06,410
orbit that's more than uh Falcon 9 has
ever launched just by flipping later

7978
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,420
ever launched just by flipping later
 

7979
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:08,690
ever launched just by flipping later
that's really interesting so there that

7980
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:08,700
that's really interesting so there that
 

7981
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,669
that's really interesting so there that
that was a decision too to flip close to

7982
02:19:10,669 --> 02:19:10,679
that was a decision too to flip close to
 

7983
02:19:10,679 --> 02:19:12,770
that was a decision too to flip close to
the ground yeah yeah be closer to the

7984
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:12,780
the ground yeah yeah be closer to the
 

7985
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:14,270
the ground yeah yeah be closer to the
ground the better the more again the

7986
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:14,280
ground the better the more again the
 

7987
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:17,330
ground the better the more again the
more the atmosphere is doing work and uh

7988
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:17,340
more the atmosphere is doing work and uh
 

7989
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:18,950
more the atmosphere is doing work and uh
you know we get into that video really

7990
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:18,960
you know we get into that video really
 

7991
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,629
you know we get into that video really
dives into like gravity losses and

7992
02:19:20,629 --> 02:19:20,639
dives into like gravity losses and
 

7993
02:19:20,639 --> 02:19:22,190
dives into like gravity losses and
gravity drag the more time you're spent

7994
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:22,200
gravity drag the more time you're spent
 

7995
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,230
gravity drag the more time you're spent
every every second that your rocket

7996
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:24,240
every every second that your rocket
 

7997
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,810
every every second that your rocket
engine is running Earth is stealing 9.8

7998
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:26,820
engine is running Earth is stealing 9.8
 

7999
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:28,250
engine is running Earth is stealing 9.8
meters per second of acceleration

8000
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:28,260
meters per second of acceleration
 

8001
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,650
meters per second of acceleration
against you there's just inherently 9.8

8002
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:30,660
against you there's just inherently 9.8
 

8003
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,790
against you there's just inherently 9.8
meters per second squared of

8004
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:31,800
meters per second squared of
 

8005
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:34,070
meters per second squared of
acceleration so every second that engine

8006
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,080
acceleration so every second that engine
 

8007
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:35,150
acceleration so every second that engine
is running

8008
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:35,160
is running
 

8009
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:38,270
is running
the first a big majority of your thrust

8010
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:38,280
the first a big majority of your thrust
 

8011
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:40,009
the first a big majority of your thrust
is actually being just stolen by Earth's

8012
02:19:40,009 --> 02:19:40,019
is actually being just stolen by Earth's
 

8013
02:19:40,019 --> 02:19:40,969
is actually being just stolen by Earth's
gravity well

8014
02:19:40,969 --> 02:19:40,979
gravity well
 

8015
02:19:40,979 --> 02:19:42,950
gravity well
so if you're the longer you're fighting

8016
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:42,960
so if you're the longer you're fighting
 

8017
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,530
so if you're the longer you're fighting
that the more inefficient it is so ID I

8018
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:45,540
that the more inefficient it is so ID I
 

8019
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:47,990
that the more inefficient it is so ID I
mean the best thing would be you flip at

8020
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:48,000
mean the best thing would be you flip at
 

8021
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,030
mean the best thing would be you flip at
you know 100 meters off the ground you

8022
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:50,040
you know 100 meters off the ground you
 

8023
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:51,830
you know 100 meters off the ground you
light all your engines to maximum thrust

8024
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:51,840
light all your engines to maximum thrust
 

8025
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,950
light all your engines to maximum thrust
you pull 50 G's you know you land on a

8026
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:54,960
you pull 50 G's you know you land on a
 

8027
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,690
you pull 50 G's you know you land on a
dime basically obviously there's no

8028
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:56,700
dime basically obviously there's no
 

8029
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,370
dime basically obviously there's no
margin there there's you know and

8030
02:19:58,370 --> 02:19:58,380
margin there there's you know and
 

8031
02:19:58,380 --> 02:19:59,990
margin there there's you know and
there's diminishing returns on that that

8032
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,000
there's diminishing returns on that that
 

8033
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,550
there's diminishing returns on that that
gravity loss thing in your high thrust

8034
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:01,560
gravity loss thing in your high thrust
 

8035
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:04,010
gravity loss thing in your high thrust
weight ratios so that's a pretty good

8036
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:04,020
weight ratios so that's a pretty good
 

8037
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:05,570
weight ratios so that's a pretty good
compromise like yes it looks scary but

8038
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:05,580
compromise like yes it looks scary but
 

8039
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,010
compromise like yes it looks scary but
they could be a lot more aggressive with

8040
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:07,020
they could be a lot more aggressive with
 

8041
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:08,510
they could be a lot more aggressive with
that yeah and squeeze out even a little

8042
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:08,520
that yeah and squeeze out even a little
 

8043
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:10,250
that yeah and squeeze out even a little
bit better performance but there are

8044
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:10,260
bit better performance but there are
 

8045
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:11,630
bit better performance but there are
diminishing returns so that's kind of

8046
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:11,640
diminishing returns so that's kind of
 

8047
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:13,730
diminishing returns so that's kind of
the magic number we've seen so far today

8048
02:20:13,730 --> 02:20:13,740
the magic number we've seen so far today
 

8049
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:16,010
the magic number we've seen so far today
but we'll likely see that you know be

8050
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:16,020
but we'll likely see that you know be
 

8051
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:17,270
but we'll likely see that you know be
played with

8052
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:17,280
played with
 

8053
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,550
played with
you've attended uh some of these what

8054
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:19,560
you've attended uh some of these what
 

8055
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,050
you've attended uh some of these what
does it feel like to see Starship in

8056
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:21,060
does it feel like to see Starship in
 

8057
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:22,849
does it feel like to see Starship in
person first of all when it's just uh

8058
02:20:22,849 --> 02:20:22,859
person first of all when it's just uh
 

8059
02:20:22,859 --> 02:20:25,070
person first of all when it's just uh
sitting there stacked and second of all

8060
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:25,080
sitting there stacked and second of all
 

8061
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:28,130
sitting there stacked and second of all
one is doing some of these tests some of

8062
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:28,140
one is doing some of these tests some of
 

8063
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:29,330
one is doing some of these tests some of
these maneuvers

8064
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:29,340
these maneuvers
 

8065
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:31,610
these maneuvers
well first off if you have the freedom

8066
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:31,620
well first off if you have the freedom
 

8067
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:34,190
well first off if you have the freedom
of traveling and happen to live within a

8068
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:34,200
of traveling and happen to live within a
 

8069
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:37,670
of traveling and happen to live within a
reasonable either by plane or car it's

8070
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:37,680
reasonable either by plane or car it's
 

8071
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:40,010
reasonable either by plane or car it's
worth going down to South Texas it's so

8072
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:40,020
worth going down to South Texas it's so
 

8073
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:42,110
worth going down to South Texas it's so
Starbase is right on the border of

8074
02:20:42,110 --> 02:20:42,120
Starbase is right on the border of
 

8075
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,910
Starbase is right on the border of
Mexico and the United States and very

8076
02:20:43,910 --> 02:20:43,920
Mexico and the United States and very
 

8077
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,830
Mexico and the United States and very
southern tip of Texas right along the

8078
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:45,840
southern tip of Texas right along the
 

8079
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:46,969
southern tip of Texas right along the
Rio Grande

8080
02:20:46,969 --> 02:20:46,979
Rio Grande
 

8081
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:50,030
Rio Grande
and uh it's it's insane because it's

8082
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:50,040
and uh it's it's insane because it's
 

8083
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:52,250
and uh it's it's insane because it's
right along a public Highway you can

8084
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:52,260
right along a public Highway you can
 

8085
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:53,870
right along a public Highway you can
literally anyone can drive down this

8086
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:53,880
literally anyone can drive down this
 

8087
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:55,309
literally anyone can drive down this
assuming it's not closed for testing

8088
02:20:55,309 --> 02:20:55,319
assuming it's not closed for testing
 

8089
02:20:55,319 --> 02:20:56,809
assuming it's not closed for testing
because they do close the highways

8090
02:20:56,809 --> 02:20:56,819
because they do close the highways
 

8091
02:20:56,819 --> 02:20:58,490
because they do close the highways
during the week a decent amount while

8092
02:20:58,490 --> 02:20:58,500
during the week a decent amount while
 

8093
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:01,670
during the week a decent amount while
they're doing tests but Sands any of

8094
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:01,680
they're doing tests but Sands any of
 

8095
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:03,950
they're doing tests but Sands any of
those days anyone can just drive down

8096
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:03,960
those days anyone can just drive down
 

8097
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,389
those days anyone can just drive down
and see these things up close and

8098
02:21:05,389 --> 02:21:05,399
and see these things up close and
 

8099
02:21:05,399 --> 02:21:06,590
and see these things up close and
personal with their own eyes like we're

8100
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:06,600
personal with their own eyes like we're
 

8101
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:08,750
personal with their own eyes like we're
talking you know from

8102
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:08,760
talking you know from
 

8103
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,450
talking you know from
100 200 meters away you know so two

8104
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:11,460
100 200 meters away you know so two
 

8105
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:12,710
100 200 meters away you know so two
football fields away from the world's

8106
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:12,720
football fields away from the world's
 

8107
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,510
football fields away from the world's
biggest most powerful rocket imagine

8108
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:14,520
biggest most powerful rocket imagine
 

8109
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,730
biggest most powerful rocket imagine
being able to do that during the you

8110
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:16,740
being able to do that during the you
 

8111
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:18,590
being able to do that during the you
know Soviet Union and you know during

8112
02:21:18,590 --> 02:21:18,600
know Soviet Union and you know during
 

8113
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:21,469
know Soviet Union and you know during
the N1 and the Saturn V you know imagine

8114
02:21:21,469 --> 02:21:21,479
the N1 and the Saturn V you know imagine
 

8115
02:21:21,479 --> 02:21:22,910
the N1 and the Saturn V you know imagine
just being able to drive up right next

8116
02:21:22,910 --> 02:21:22,920
just being able to drive up right next
 

8117
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:26,030
just being able to drive up right next
to the launch pad there's no way you

8118
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:26,040
to the launch pad there's no way you
 

8119
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:27,349
to the launch pad there's no way you
know and so

8120
02:21:27,349 --> 02:21:27,359
know and so
 

8121
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:29,330
know and so
to have this kind of access to to this

8122
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:29,340
to have this kind of access to to this
 

8123
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:32,090
to have this kind of access to to this
program is so incredible the craziest

8124
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:32,100
program is so incredible the craziest
 

8125
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:33,590
program is so incredible the craziest
thing is when you when you're driving

8126
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:33,600
thing is when you when you're driving
 

8127
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,410
thing is when you when you're driving
out on the on Highway 4 it's

8128
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:36,420
out on the on Highway 4 it's
 

8129
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:38,450
out on the on Highway 4 it's
bumpy it's it's you know riddled with

8130
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:38,460
bumpy it's it's you know riddled with
 

8131
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:40,670
bumpy it's it's you know riddled with
potholes now because of all the insane

8132
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:40,680
potholes now because of all the insane
 

8133
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:41,929
potholes now because of all the insane
amount of trucks having to go out there

8134
02:21:41,929 --> 02:21:41,939
amount of trucks having to go out there
 

8135
02:21:41,939 --> 02:21:43,849
amount of trucks having to go out there
and traffic and you're going through

8136
02:21:43,849 --> 02:21:43,859
and traffic and you're going through
 

8137
02:21:43,859 --> 02:21:45,410
and traffic and you're going through
this it's just this weird you're like

this it's just this weird you're like
where am I you occasionally you're

8140
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:46,800
where am I you occasionally you're
 

8141
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,710
where am I you occasionally you're
seeing like you can kind of see that I

8142
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:48,720
seeing like you can kind of see that I
 

8143
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:49,969
seeing like you can kind of see that I
mean you can see Mexico out your right

8144
02:21:49,969 --> 02:21:49,979
mean you can see Mexico out your right
 

8145
02:21:49,979 --> 02:21:51,230
mean you can see Mexico out your right
window as you're driving down this

8146
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:51,240
window as you're driving down this
 

8147
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,309
window as you're driving down this
highway you know you're just sitting

8148
02:21:52,309 --> 02:21:52,319
highway you know you're just sitting
 

8149
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:53,809
highway you know you're just sitting
there like where am I and then all of a

8150
02:21:53,809 --> 02:21:53,819
there like where am I and then all of a
 

8151
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:55,730
there like where am I and then all of a
sudden you kind of turn this corner and

8152
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:55,740
sudden you kind of turn this corner and
 

8153
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,050
sudden you kind of turn this corner and
the trees and the brush kind of clear

8154
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:57,060
the trees and the brush kind of clear
 

8155
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:58,370
the trees and the brush kind of clear
out and obviously you get a sense of

8156
02:21:58,370 --> 02:21:58,380
out and obviously you get a sense of
 

8157
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:00,290
out and obviously you get a sense of
everything on the horizon at that point

8158
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:00,300
everything on the horizon at that point
 

8159
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:02,030
everything on the horizon at that point
you're pretty much five miles on the

8160
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:02,040
you're pretty much five miles on the
 

8161
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:04,610
you're pretty much five miles on the
nose or eight kilometers away and from

8162
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:04,620
nose or eight kilometers away and from
 

8163
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:06,530
nose or eight kilometers away and from
there you can just see through the the

8164
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:06,540
there you can just see through the the
 

8165
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,990
there you can just see through the the
heat Haze through the you know the

8166
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:09,000
heat Haze through the you know the
 

8167
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,450
heat Haze through the you know the
atmospheric Distortion and you just see

8168
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:11,460
atmospheric Distortion and you just see
 

8169
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:13,490
atmospheric Distortion and you just see
this weird like it looks like a city

8170
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:13,500
this weird like it looks like a city
 

8171
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,950
this weird like it looks like a city
almost on the horizon you know there's

8172
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:15,960
almost on the horizon you know there's
 

8173
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:18,530
almost on the horizon you know there's
tons of these tall buildings there's a

8174
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:18,540
tons of these tall buildings there's a
 

8175
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:21,230
tons of these tall buildings there's a
weird ominous launch Tower thing With

8176
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:21,240
weird ominous launch Tower thing With
 

8177
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:24,889
weird ominous launch Tower thing With
Arms Wide Open and sometimes and you

8178
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:24,899
Arms Wide Open and sometimes and you
 

8179
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:27,650
Arms Wide Open and sometimes and you
know a giant metal rocket and it just

8180
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:27,660
know a giant metal rocket and it just
 

8181
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:33,110
know a giant metal rocket and it just
looks so so weird I mean it is it's the

02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:55,130
you just go what is this and and also I
mean there is a there's a kind of

8200
02:22:55,130 --> 02:22:55,140
mean there is a there's a kind of
 

8201
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:57,710
mean there is a there's a kind of
magical aspect to the the this is the

8202
02:22:57,710 --> 02:22:57,720
magical aspect to the the this is the
 

8203
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,510
magical aspect to the the this is the
place where over the next few years

8204
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
place where over the next few years
 

8205
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:00,889
place where over the next few years
we'll start

8206
02:23:00,889 --> 02:23:00,899
we'll start
 

8207
02:23:00,899 --> 02:23:04,070
we'll start
as a human species reaching out there

8208
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:04,080
as a human species reaching out there
 

8209
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,469
as a human species reaching out there
that's traveling out there we'll for

8210
02:23:06,469 --> 02:23:06,479
that's traveling out there we'll for
 

8211
02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:09,050
that's traveling out there we'll for
sure see the development of the rockets

8212
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:09,060
sure see the development of the rockets
 

8213
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:10,309
sure see the development of the rockets
that I think will take us further than

8214
02:23:10,309 --> 02:23:10,319
that I think will take us further than
 

8215
02:23:10,319 --> 02:23:11,450
that I think will take us further than
ever before

8216
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:11,460
ever before
 

8217
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:14,570
ever before
be born right there what's it like to

8218
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:14,580
be born right there what's it like to
 

8219
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:17,450
be born right there what's it like to
witness the actual testing of of

8220
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:17,460
witness the actual testing of of
 

8221
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:19,550
witness the actual testing of of
Starship

8222
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:19,560
Starship
 

8223
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:22,730
Starship
so far it's been high stakes

8224
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:22,740
so far it's been high stakes
 

8225
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:25,309
so far it's been high stakes
like it's it's been insane because those

8226
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:25,319
like it's it's been insane because those
 

8227
02:23:25,319 --> 02:23:26,809
like it's it's been insane because those
the the first I kind of mentioned

8228
02:23:26,809 --> 02:23:26,819
the the first I kind of mentioned
 

8229
02:23:26,819 --> 02:23:29,030
the the first I kind of mentioned
earlier there's been sn8 9 10 11 and 15

8230
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:29,040
earlier there's been sn8 9 10 11 and 15
 

8231
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:31,010
earlier there's been sn8 9 10 11 and 15
that have all done these suborbital hops

8232
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:31,020
that have all done these suborbital hops
 

8233
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:33,349
that have all done these suborbital hops
the highest one went 12.5 kilometers and

8234
02:23:33,349 --> 02:23:33,359
the highest one went 12.5 kilometers and
 

8235
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:35,389
the highest one went 12.5 kilometers and
the rest of the four went 10 kilometers

8236
02:23:35,389 --> 02:23:35,399
the rest of the four went 10 kilometers
 

8237
02:23:35,399 --> 02:23:37,550
the rest of the four went 10 kilometers
in altitude and then turned off the

8238
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:37,560
in altitude and then turned off the
 

8239
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:39,650
in altitude and then turned off the
engines and just fell now the cool thing

8240
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:39,660
engines and just fell now the cool thing
 

8241
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:41,870
engines and just fell now the cool thing
about that is the general public could

8242
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:41,880
about that is the general public could
 

8243
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,030
about that is the general public could
be about five five miles away so again

8244
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:44,040
be about five five miles away so again
 

8245
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:45,469
be about five five miles away so again
like eight kilometers away

8246
02:23:45,469 --> 02:23:45,479
like eight kilometers away
 

8247
02:23:45,479 --> 02:23:47,770
like eight kilometers away
and the weird thing is this Rocket's

8248
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:47,780
and the weird thing is this Rocket's
 

8249
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:50,929
and the weird thing is this Rocket's
slowly accelerating they didn't want to

8250
02:23:50,929 --> 02:23:50,939
slowly accelerating they didn't want to
 

8251
02:23:50,939 --> 02:23:52,490
slowly accelerating they didn't want to
exceed a certain speed so they didn't

8252
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:52,500
exceed a certain speed so they didn't
 

8253
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:53,690
exceed a certain speed so they didn't
have to worry about the aerodynamics of

8254
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:53,700
have to worry about the aerodynamics of
 

8255
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,309
have to worry about the aerodynamics of
it you know they just slowly climbed and

8256
02:23:55,309 --> 02:23:55,319
it you know they just slowly climbed and
 

8257
02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:57,050
it you know they just slowly climbed and
it probably also to appease the FAA

8258
02:23:57,050 --> 02:23:57,060
it probably also to appease the FAA
 

8259
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:58,849
it probably also to appease the FAA
they're like here we'll just limit the

8260
02:23:58,849 --> 02:23:58,859
they're like here we'll just limit the
 

8261
02:23:58,859 --> 02:24:00,889
they're like here we'll just limit the
thrust away ratio and just you know make

8262
02:24:00,889 --> 02:24:00,899
thrust away ratio and just you know make
 

8263
02:24:00,899 --> 02:24:02,690
thrust away ratio and just you know make
make it so it's slow and controlled no

8264
02:24:02,690 --> 02:24:02,700
make it so it's slow and controlled no
 

8265
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,590
make it so it's slow and controlled no
big deal

8266
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,600
big deal
 

8267
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,969
big deal
so it's basically more or less like

8268
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:04,979
so it's basically more or less like
 

8269
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:07,250
so it's basically more or less like
slightly above a hover just climbing

8270
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:07,260
slightly above a hover just climbing
 

8271
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,889
slightly above a hover just climbing
forever for minutes for like four or

8272
02:24:09,889 --> 02:24:09,899
forever for minutes for like four or
 

8273
02:24:09,899 --> 02:24:11,929
forever for minutes for like four or
five minutes you just hear and feel the

8274
02:24:11,929 --> 02:24:11,939
five minutes you just hear and feel the
 

8275
02:24:11,939 --> 02:24:13,910
five minutes you just hear and feel the
Roar of this thing normal Rockets like

8276
02:24:13,910 --> 02:24:13,920
Roar of this thing normal Rockets like
 

8277
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:16,550
Roar of this thing normal Rockets like
after the first 30 seconds or minute you

8278
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:16,560
after the first 30 seconds or minute you
 

8279
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:19,010
after the first 30 seconds or minute you
know they're so far away that you're

8280
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:19,020
know they're so far away that you're
 

8281
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,450
know they're so far away that you're
just diminishing you know it's just it's

8282
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:20,460
just diminishing you know it's just it's
 

8283
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:21,950
just diminishing you know it's just it's
just fading fading fading fading you

8284
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:21,960
just fading fading fading fading you

just fading fading fading fading you
still get that Rumble that that sense

8286
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:23,340
still get that Rumble that that sense
 

8287
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:25,849
still get that Rumble that that sense
but but those first five flights uh the

8288
02:24:25,849 --> 02:24:25,859
but but those first five flights uh the
 

8289
02:24:25,859 --> 02:24:28,849
but but those first five flights uh the
suborbital Hops were just I'll cherish

8290
02:24:28,849 --> 02:24:28,859
suborbital Hops were just I'll cherish
 

8291
02:24:28,859 --> 02:24:30,230
suborbital Hops were just I'll cherish
them forever because you just you're

8292
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
them forever because you just you're
 

8293
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,210
them forever because you just you're
watching this thing that you've driven

8294
02:24:32,210 --> 02:24:32,220
watching this thing that you've driven
 

8295
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:34,429
watching this thing that you've driven
up next to you've seen it with your own

8296
02:24:34,429 --> 02:24:34,439
up next to you've seen it with your own
 

8297
02:24:34,439 --> 02:24:37,010
up next to you've seen it with your own
eyes that's bigger than most buildings

8298
02:24:37,010 --> 02:24:37,020
eyes that's bigger than most buildings
 

8299
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:39,530
eyes that's bigger than most buildings
in a you know fairly dense urban area

8300
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:39,540
in a you know fairly dense urban area
 

8301
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:42,050
in a you know fairly dense urban area
you know it's this massive thing you

8302
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:42,060
you know it's this massive thing you
 

8303
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:43,490
you know it's this massive thing you
stay in the you stood there you look at

8304
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:43,500
stay in the you stood there you look at
 

8305
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,050
stay in the you stood there you look at
it you're like wow that's crazy you've

8306
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:45,060
it you're like wow that's crazy you've
 

8307
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:46,309
it you're like wow that's crazy you've
seen people working on it they're little

8308
02:24:46,309 --> 02:24:46,319
seen people working on it they're little
 

8309
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:48,590
seen people working on it they're little
ants compared to it then you drive away

8310
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:48,600
ants compared to it then you drive away
 

8311
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:50,210
ants compared to it then you drive away
and you see it on the horizon and all of

8312
02:24:50,210 --> 02:24:50,220
and you see it on the horizon and all of
 

8313
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,889
and you see it on the horizon and all of
a sudden that thing leaves it starts

8314
02:24:51,889 --> 02:24:51,899
a sudden that thing leaves it starts
 

8315
02:24:51,899 --> 02:24:54,830
a sudden that thing leaves it starts
moving hovering hovering essentially and

8316
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:54,840
moving hovering hovering essentially and
 

8317
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:56,929
moving hovering hovering essentially and
the first time I mean

8318
02:24:56,929 --> 02:24:56,939
the first time I mean
 

8319
02:24:56,939 --> 02:24:59,510
the first time I mean
you know you put for me at least I put

8320
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
you know you put for me at least I put
 

8321
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:02,030
you know you put for me at least I put
my hands on my head when I I just I

8322
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:02,040
my hands on my head when I I just I
 

8323
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:03,950
my hands on my head when I I just I
can't help it I'm not it's not so I

8324
02:25:03,950 --> 02:25:03,960
can't help it I'm not it's not so I
 

8325
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,809
can't help it I'm not it's not so I
don't know like you said

8326
02:25:05,809 --> 02:25:05,819
don't know like you said
 

8327
02:25:05,819 --> 02:25:07,790
don't know like you said
I don't know what in human nature

8328
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:07,800
I don't know what in human nature
 

8329
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:09,349
I don't know what in human nature
decides this is what to do when you

8330
02:25:09,349 --> 02:25:09,359
decides this is what to do when you
 

8331
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:11,030
decides this is what to do when you
can't believe something but that's what

8332
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040
can't believe something but that's what
 

8333
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,070
can't believe something but that's what
happens and when that thing first took

8334
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:13,080
happens and when that thing first took
 

8335
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,950
happens and when that thing first took
off it was just like my brain couldn't

8336
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:15,960
off it was just like my brain couldn't
 

8337
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,450
off it was just like my brain couldn't
process

8338
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:17,460
process
 

8339
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:19,490
process
seeing you know because I had spent so

8340
02:25:19,490 --> 02:25:19,500
seeing you know because I had spent so
 

8341
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:20,990
seeing you know because I had spent so
much time driving around and seeing it

8342
02:25:20,990 --> 02:25:21,000
much time driving around and seeing it
 

8343
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,010
much time driving around and seeing it
and all of a sudden you're watching it

8344
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,020
and all of a sudden you're watching it
 

8345
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,750
and all of a sudden you're watching it
just take off and you're like it's

8346
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:23,760
just take off and you're like it's
 

8347
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:26,090
just take off and you're like it's
moving and all these you know the most

8348
02:25:26,090 --> 02:25:26,100
moving and all these you know the most
 

8349
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:27,770
moving and all these you know the most
complicated rocket engines ever made are

8350
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:27,780
complicated rocket engines ever made are
 

8351
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,050
complicated rocket engines ever made are
all firing simultaneously and it didn't

8352
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:30,060
all firing simultaneously and it didn't
 

8353
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:31,969
all firing simultaneously and it didn't
blow up on the launch pad and slowly

8354
02:25:31,969 --> 02:25:31,979
blow up on the launch pad and slowly
 

8355
02:25:31,979 --> 02:25:32,990
blow up on the launch pad and slowly
increasing

8356
02:25:32,990 --> 02:25:33,000
increasing
 

8357
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:36,170
increasing
and it's just crazy and the sound the

8358
02:25:36,170 --> 02:25:36,180
and it's just crazy and the sound the
 

8359
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:38,090
and it's just crazy and the sound the
everything about it and so by the time

8360
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:38,100
everything about it and so by the time
 

8361
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,849
everything about it and so by the time
the first one is specifically it was it

8362
02:25:40,849 --> 02:25:40,859
the first one is specifically it was it
 

8363
02:25:40,859 --> 02:25:46,250
the first one is specifically it was it
was December 2020 was the first uh sn8

8364
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:46,260
was December 2020 was the first uh sn8
 

8365
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:49,670
was December 2020 was the first uh sn8
it went up and I actually we all lost it

8366
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
it went up and I actually we all lost it
 

8367
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,710
it went up and I actually we all lost it
in the sky we couldn't quite see it but

8368
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:51,720
in the sky we couldn't quite see it but
 

8369
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:54,230
in the sky we couldn't quite see it but
our we had telescopes and and you know

8370
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,240
our we had telescopes and and you know
 

8371
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,929
our we had telescopes and and you know
High telephoto lenses tracking it and

8372
02:25:56,929 --> 02:25:56,939
High telephoto lenses tracking it and
 

8373
02:25:56,939 --> 02:25:58,670
High telephoto lenses tracking it and
what's funny is there's a pretty strong

8374
02:25:58,670 --> 02:25:58,680
what's funny is there's a pretty strong
 

8375
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:00,889
what's funny is there's a pretty strong
wind up there at altitude

8376
02:26:00,889 --> 02:26:00,899
wind up there at altitude
 

8377
02:26:00,899 --> 02:26:03,429
wind up there at altitude
and it was moving there's a lot of um

8378
02:26:03,429 --> 02:26:03,439
and it was moving there's a lot of um
 

8379
02:26:03,439 --> 02:26:05,870
and it was moving there's a lot of um
gaseous oxygen being vented out of the

8380
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:05,880
gaseous oxygen being vented out of the
 

8381
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,910
gaseous oxygen being vented out of the
rocket and it's you know being blown by

8382
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:07,920
rocket and it's you know being blown by
 

8383
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,130
rocket and it's you know being blown by
this air so it looks like it's moving

8384
02:26:10,130 --> 02:26:10,140
this air so it looks like it's moving
 

8385
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:13,010
this air so it looks like it's moving
actually quite quickly like away from us

8386
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:13,020
actually quite quickly like away from us
 

8387
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:15,410
actually quite quickly like away from us
like a strafing to one side so I'm

8388
02:26:15,410 --> 02:26:15,420
like a strafing to one side so I'm
 

8389
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:17,150
like a strafing to one side so I'm
watching the monitor I'm going oh my God

8390
02:26:17,150 --> 02:26:17,160
watching the monitor I'm going oh my God
 

8391
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,730
watching the monitor I'm going oh my God
they're moving it like over Brownsville

8392
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:19,740
they're moving it like over Brownsville
 

8393
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:22,550
they're moving it like over Brownsville
and we're all all of us everyone on this

8394
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
and we're all all of us everyone on this
 

8395
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,370
and we're all all of us everyone on this
this hotel balcony is looking out down

8396
02:26:25,370 --> 02:26:25,380
this hotel balcony is looking out down
 

8397
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:28,070
this hotel balcony is looking out down
like way out over you know and we can't

8398
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
like way out over you know and we can't
 

8399
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,110
like way out over you know and we can't
find it we're like where did they lose

8400
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:30,120
find it we're like where did they lose
 

8401
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:32,030
find it we're like where did they lose
it like we're thinking like oh my God

8402
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:32,040
it like we're thinking like oh my God
 

8403
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:34,150
it like we're thinking like oh my God
this is gonna crash down in Brownsville

8404
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:34,160
this is gonna crash down in Brownsville
 

8405
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:37,309
this is gonna crash down in Brownsville
and and finally they shut the engines

8406
02:26:37,309 --> 02:26:37,319
and and finally they shut the engines
 

8407
02:26:37,319 --> 02:26:38,450
and and finally they shut the engines
off and were watching it fall and again

8408
02:26:38,450 --> 02:26:38,460
off and were watching it fall and again
 

8409
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:40,190
off and were watching it fall and again
we're tracking it we know it's falling

8410
02:26:40,190 --> 02:26:40,200
we're tracking it we know it's falling
 

8411
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,050
we're tracking it we know it's falling
and it's falling falling it's falling

8412
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:42,060
and it's falling falling it's falling
 

8413
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:43,429
and it's falling falling it's falling
super controlled and we're like oh my

8414
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:43,439
super controlled and we're like oh my
 

8415
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:44,750
super controlled and we're like oh my
God this is perfect

8416
02:26:44,750 --> 02:26:44,760
God this is perfect
 

8417
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,730
God this is perfect
and all of a sudden it clicked and I see

8418
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:46,740
and all of a sudden it clicked and I see
 

8419
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:48,650
and all of a sudden it clicked and I see
it with my you know my eyes I finally

8420
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:48,660
it with my you know my eyes I finally
 

8421
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:50,570
it with my you know my eyes I finally
like track and it's it's straight out

8422
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:50,580
like track and it's it's straight out
 

8423
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:52,370
like track and it's it's straight out
like straight in front of us and it

8424
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:52,380
like straight in front of us and it
 

8425
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:54,349
like straight in front of us and it
looks like it looks like it was a blimp

8426
02:26:54,349 --> 02:26:54,359
looks like it looks like it was a blimp
 

8427
02:26:54,359 --> 02:26:56,750
looks like it looks like it was a blimp
just barely moving now because it is

8428
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:56,760
just barely moving now because it is
 

8429
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:59,929
just barely moving now because it is
Falling Slowly thanks to all of its drag

8430
02:26:59,929 --> 02:26:59,939
Falling Slowly thanks to all of its drag
 

8431
02:26:59,939 --> 02:27:01,969
Falling Slowly thanks to all of its drag
and again that's one of those moments

8432
02:27:01,969 --> 02:27:01,979
and again that's one of those moments
 

8433
02:27:01,979 --> 02:27:04,910
and again that's one of those moments
I'm like it's falling so slow you know

8434
02:27:04,910 --> 02:27:04,920
I'm like it's falling so slow you know
 

8435
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:06,710
I'm like it's falling so slow you know
because it's so big it's so massive it's

8436
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:06,720
because it's so big it's so massive it's
 

8437
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:08,809
because it's so big it's so massive it's
falling sideways you know I've seen

8438
02:27:08,809 --> 02:27:08,819
falling sideways you know I've seen
 

8439
02:27:08,819 --> 02:27:10,610
falling sideways you know I've seen
Falcon 9 boosters and Falcon heavy

8440
02:27:10,610 --> 02:27:10,620
Falcon 9 boosters and Falcon heavy
 

8441
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:13,190
Falcon 9 boosters and Falcon heavy
boosters and they scream they come in so

8442
02:27:13,190 --> 02:27:13,200
boosters and they scream they come in so
 

8443
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:15,530
boosters and they scream they come in so
fast and you can barely even see we can

8444
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:15,540
fast and you can barely even see we can
 

8445
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:16,550
fast and you can barely even see we can
just barely track them almost they light

8446
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,560
just barely track them almost they light
 

8447
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,230
just barely track them almost they light
their engines and they they decelerate

8448
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
their engines and they they decelerate
 

8449
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,730
their engines and they they decelerate
so quickly this was like the opposite it

8450
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:19,740
so quickly this was like the opposite it
 

8451
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:20,630
so quickly this was like the opposite it
was like

8452
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:20,640
was like
 

8453
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:23,030
was like
is that thing ever coming down it was

8454
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,040
is that thing ever coming down it was
 

8455
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,250
is that thing ever coming down it was
just falling so slowly and so right

8456
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:25,260
just falling so slowly and so right
 

8457
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:27,349
just falling so slowly and so right
there just felt like it was so close and

8458
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
there just felt like it was so close and
 

8459
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:28,849
there just felt like it was so close and
so when it finally lit its engine and it

8460
02:27:28,849 --> 02:27:28,859
so when it finally lit its engine and it
 

8461
02:27:28,859 --> 02:27:31,250
so when it finally lit its engine and it
flipped I was losing my mind because I'm

8462
02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:31,260
flipped I was losing my mind because I'm
 

8463
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:33,290
flipped I was losing my mind because I'm
like it's working you know this crazy

8464
02:27:33,290 --> 02:27:33,300
like it's working you know this crazy
 

8465
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:36,349
like it's working you know this crazy
plan this huge massive thing is doing

8466
02:27:36,349 --> 02:27:36,359
plan this huge massive thing is doing
 

8467
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:39,110
plan this huge massive thing is doing
this absurd feat and the first one well

8468
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
this absurd feat and the first one well
 

8469
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,969
this absurd feat and the first one well
the first four again didn't work out as

8470
02:27:40,969 --> 02:27:40,979
the first four again didn't work out as
 

8471
02:27:40,979 --> 02:27:42,770
the first four again didn't work out as
planned but getting to that point

8472
02:27:42,770 --> 02:27:42,780
planned but getting to that point
 

8473
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:44,150
planned but getting to that point
already getting to that flip maneuver

8474
02:27:44,150 --> 02:27:44,160
already getting to that flip maneuver
 

8475
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:46,429
already getting to that flip maneuver
was a huge milestone and it was so

8476
02:27:46,429 --> 02:27:46,439
was a huge milestone and it was so
 

8477
02:27:46,439 --> 02:27:48,530
was a huge milestone and it was so
exciting just going through those those

8478
02:27:48,530 --> 02:27:48,540
exciting just going through those those
 

8479
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:50,990
exciting just going through those those
firsts were amazing and I think you know

8480
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:51,000
firsts were amazing and I think you know
 

8481
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,969
firsts were amazing and I think you know
we're coming up now on them doing the

8482
02:27:52,969 --> 02:27:52,979
we're coming up now on them doing the
 

8483
02:27:52,979 --> 02:27:54,770
we're coming up now on them doing the
full stacks of the booster and the upper

8484
02:27:54,770 --> 02:27:54,780
full stacks of the booster and the upper
 

8485
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:55,790
full stacks of the booster and the upper
stage

8486
02:27:55,790 --> 02:27:55,800
stage
 

8487
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,830
stage
I think when we see that fly when that

8488
02:27:57,830 --> 02:27:57,840
I think when we see that fly when that
 

8489
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:00,710
I think when we see that fly when that
leaves Earth for the first time it'll be

8490
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:00,720
leaves Earth for the first time it'll be
 

8491
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,849
leaves Earth for the first time it'll be
like I said almost twice the amount of

8492
02:28:01,849 --> 02:28:01,859
like I said almost twice the amount of
 

8493
02:28:01,859 --> 02:28:03,110
like I said almost twice the amount of
thrust as anything else it'll be the

8494
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,120
thrust as anything else it'll be the
 

8495
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:05,270
thrust as anything else it'll be the
biggest heaviest largest thing to ever

8496
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,280
biggest heaviest largest thing to ever
 

8497
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:09,770
biggest heaviest largest thing to ever
fly it's going to shake everything I

8498
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:09,780
fly it's going to shake everything I
 

8499
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:13,309
fly it's going to shake everything I
can't wait to have all 33 Raptor engines

8500
02:28:13,309 --> 02:28:13,319
can't wait to have all 33 Raptor engines
 

8501
02:28:13,319 --> 02:28:16,070
can't wait to have all 33 Raptor engines
uh been active at once have they tested

8502
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:16,080
uh been active at once have they tested
 

8503
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:18,290
uh been active at once have they tested
that no that's coming up that's kind of

8504
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:18,300
that no that's coming up that's kind of
 

8505
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:19,910
that no that's coming up that's kind of
the next Milestone um I don't know you

8506
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:19,920
the next Milestone um I don't know you
 

8507
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,110
the next Milestone um I don't know you
know when this will come out but we're

8508
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,120
know when this will come out but we're
 

8509
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,510
know when this will come out but we're
that's like the next just a few days

8510
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
that's like the next just a few days
 

8511
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,030
that's like the next just a few days
very quickly here it then but if people

8512
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:26,040
very quickly here it then but if people
 

8513
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:27,230
very quickly here it then but if people
listen to this if they're listening to

8514
02:28:27,230 --> 02:28:27,240
listen to this if they're listening to
 

8515
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:28,969
listen to this if they're listening to
it early on they'll likely be able to

8516
02:28:28,969 --> 02:28:28,979
it early on they'll likely be able to
 

8517
02:28:28,979 --> 02:28:30,530
it early on they'll likely be able to
catch you know I think at this point it

8518
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:30,540
catch you know I think at this point it
 

8519
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,450
catch you know I think at this point it
seems like next week so step one would

8520
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:32,460
seems like next week so step one would
 

8521
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:35,389
seems like next week so step one would
be static fire yep holding onto the

8522
02:28:35,389 --> 02:28:35,399
be static fire yep holding onto the
 

8523
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:37,790
be static fire yep holding onto the
rocket and lighting up the engines and

8524
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:37,800
rocket and lighting up the engines and
 

8525
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:39,710
rocket and lighting up the engines and
so so far they've lit at most they kind

8526
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:39,720
so so far they've lit at most they kind
 

8527
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:41,990
so so far they've lit at most they kind
of they went for like a more than 14

8528
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:42,000
of they went for like a more than 14
 

8529
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,030
of they went for like a more than 14
engine static fired I don't recall if it

8530
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,040
engine static fired I don't recall if it
 

8531
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:45,410
engine static fired I don't recall if it
was like you know 16 or something

8532
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:45,420
was like you know 16 or something
 

8533
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:48,530
was like you know 16 or something
engines lit at once and they ended up

8534
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:48,540
engines lit at once and they ended up
 

8535
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:50,809
engines lit at once and they ended up
going down to 14 engines that's the most

8536
02:28:50,809 --> 02:28:50,819
going down to 14 engines that's the most
 

8537
02:28:50,819 --> 02:28:53,330
going down to 14 engines that's the most
engines they've ever lit

8538
02:28:53,330 --> 02:28:53,340
engines they've ever lit
 

8539
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:55,250
engines they've ever lit
um so the next step and the final kind

8540
02:28:55,250 --> 02:28:55,260
um so the next step and the final kind
 

8541
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:56,510
um so the next step and the final kind
of Step before they they fly this thing

8542
02:28:56,510 --> 02:28:56,520
of Step before they they fly this thing
 

8543
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:57,590
of Step before they they fly this thing
is they're actually going to light all

8544
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
is they're actually going to light all
 

8545
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:01,309
is they're actually going to light all
33 engines simultaneously and although

8546
02:29:01,309 --> 02:29:01,319
33 engines simultaneously and although
 

8547
02:29:01,319 --> 02:29:03,349
33 engines simultaneously and although
that sounds scary let's not forget the

8548
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
that sounds scary let's not forget the
 

8549
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:05,330
that sounds scary let's not forget the
Falcon heavy that's now flown five times

8550
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:05,340
Falcon heavy that's now flown five times
 

8551
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:07,849
Falcon heavy that's now flown five times
completely flawlessly

8552
02:29:07,849 --> 02:29:07,859
completely flawlessly
 

8553
02:29:07,859 --> 02:29:09,650
completely flawlessly
um has has 27 engines running

8554
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:09,660
um has has 27 engines running
 

8555
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,630
um has has 27 engines running
simultaneously so they definitely have

8556
02:29:11,630 --> 02:29:11,640
simultaneously so they definitely have
 

8557
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:13,849
simultaneously so they definitely have
you know SpaceX has experience with high

8558
02:29:13,849 --> 02:29:13,859
you know SpaceX has experience with high
 

8559
02:29:13,859 --> 02:29:16,010
you know SpaceX has experience with high
number of engines running at the same

8560
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:16,020
number of engines running at the same
 

8561
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:18,650
number of engines running at the same
time but it is still like this is going

8562
02:29:18,650 --> 02:29:18,660
time but it is still like this is going
 

8563
02:29:18,660 --> 02:29:21,590
time but it is still like this is going
to be a lot of moving parts and a lot of

8564
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:21,600
to be a lot of moving parts and a lot of
 

8565
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,570
to be a lot of moving parts and a lot of
potential and a lot just a lot of

8566
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:23,580
potential and a lot just a lot of
 

8567
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:26,750
potential and a lot just a lot of
everything uh what are the upcoming

8568
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:26,760
everything uh what are the upcoming
 

8569
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:30,830
everything uh what are the upcoming
uh Milestones expected milestones and I

8570
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:30,840
uh Milestones expected milestones and I
 

8571
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:32,690
uh Milestones expected milestones and I
think um there's one in particular I'd

8572
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:32,700
think um there's one in particular I'd
 

8573
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:33,950
think um there's one in particular I'd
like to talk to you more about but

8574
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:33,960
like to talk to you more about but
 

8575
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:36,290
like to talk to you more about but
leading up to that of course is like

8576
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,300
leading up to that of course is like
 

8577
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:37,730
leading up to that of course is like
what what are some of the tests here on

8578
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:37,740
what what are some of the tests here on
 

8579
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:41,090
what what are some of the tests here on
the way so this is the static fire uh

8580
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:41,100
the way so this is the static fire uh
 

8581
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:43,309
the way so this is the static fire uh
the the the fully stacked with the two

8582
02:29:43,309 --> 02:29:43,319
the the the fully stacked with the two
 

8583
02:29:43,319 --> 02:29:44,230
the the the fully stacked with the two
stages

8584
02:29:44,230 --> 02:29:44,240
stages
 

8585
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:48,290
stages
uh will there be uh and then all that

8586
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:48,300
uh will there be uh and then all that
 

8587
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:50,030
uh will there be uh and then all that
leading to an orbital

8588
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:50,040
leading to an orbital
 

8589
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:54,170
leading to an orbital
launch test uh what so what other things

8590
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:54,180
launch test uh what so what other things
 

8591
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:55,429
launch test uh what so what other things
you should know about and what do you

8592
02:29:55,429 --> 02:29:55,439
you should know about and what do you
 

8593
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:57,349
you should know about and what do you
think like what what do you think the

8594
02:29:57,349 --> 02:29:57,359
think like what what do you think the
 

8595
02:29:57,359 --> 02:29:59,090
think like what what do you think the
timeline will be with like the orbital

8596
02:29:59,090 --> 02:29:59,100
timeline will be with like the orbital
 

8597
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:02,330
timeline will be with like the orbital
test timeline uh the reason we have this

8598
02:30:02,330 --> 02:30:02,340
test timeline uh the reason we have this
 

8599
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:03,770
test timeline uh the reason we have this
website the expected Milestones is

8600
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:03,780
website the expected Milestones is
 

8601
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:05,150
website the expected Milestones is
because I always tell people to ignore

8602
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:05,160
because I always tell people to ignore
 

8603
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:07,250
because I always tell people to ignore
any time you ever hear for any of this

8604
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,260
any time you ever hear for any of this
 

8605
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:08,690
any time you ever hear for any of this
stuff yeah just pay attention to

8606
02:30:08,690 --> 02:30:08,700
stuff yeah just pay attention to
 

8607
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:10,670
stuff yeah just pay attention to
Milestones because when you're doing

8608
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:10,680
Milestones because when you're doing
 

8609
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:12,290
Milestones because when you're doing
stuff for the first time you know you

8610
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:12,300
stuff for the first time you know you
 

8611
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:14,630
stuff for the first time you know you
just have no idea so just to understand

8612
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:14,640
just have no idea so just to understand
 

8613
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:16,849
just have no idea so just to understand
the expected Milestones here the First

8614
02:30:16,849 --> 02:30:16,859
the expected Milestones here the First
 

8615
02:30:16,859 --> 02:30:19,190
the expected Milestones here the First
Column is the event the the second

02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:19,200
Column is the event the the second
 

8617
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,490
Column is the event the the second
columns the date and Status TBD complete

8618
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:22,500
columns the date and Status TBD complete
 

8619
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:25,190
columns the date and Status TBD complete
green means what green means it's been

8620
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,200
green means what green means it's been
 

8621
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,570
green means what green means it's been
completed and it shows the completion

8622
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:26,580
completed and it shows the completion
 

8623
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:28,309
completed and it shows the completion
date there and the completion date yeah

8624
02:30:28,309 --> 02:30:28,319
date there and the completion date yeah
 

8625
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:29,870
date there and the completion date yeah
and then the others

8626
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:29,880
and then the others
 

8627
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:33,290
and then the others
maybe maybe more maybe not the full full

8628
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:33,300
maybe maybe more maybe not the full full
 

8629
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,690
maybe maybe more maybe not the full full
stack testing the d-stack and the

8630
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:35,700
stack testing the d-stack and the
 

8631
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:38,630
stack testing the d-stack and the
there's a 33 engine so so realistically

8632
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:38,640
there's a 33 engine so so realistically
 

8633
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,190
there's a 33 engine so so realistically
we're expecting them to de-stack and

8634
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:40,200
we're expecting them to de-stack and
 

8635
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:41,570
we're expecting them to de-stack and
SpaceX I think just tweeted that

8636
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:41,580
SpaceX I think just tweeted that
 

8637
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:44,030
SpaceX I think just tweeted that
actually they're going to be de-stacking

8638
02:30:44,030 --> 02:30:44,040
actually they're going to be de-stacking
 

8639
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:45,889
actually they're going to be de-stacking
um the second stage from the first stage

8640
02:30:45,889 --> 02:30:45,899
um the second stage from the first stage
 

8641
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:48,110
um the second stage from the first stage
kind of get the ship safe while they

8642
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:48,120
kind of get the ship safe while they
 

8643
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,730
kind of get the ship safe while they
test because they don't want to you know

8644
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:49,740
test because they don't want to you know
 

8645
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:52,010
test because they don't want to you know
33 engines is pretty high risk if they

8646
02:30:52,010 --> 02:30:52,020
33 engines is pretty high risk if they
 

8647
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:54,650
33 engines is pretty high risk if they
do blow up the rocket when they test it

8648
02:30:54,650 --> 02:30:54,660
do blow up the rocket when they test it
 

8649
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:55,910
do blow up the rocket when they test it
for the first time it's not going to be

8650
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:55,920
for the first time it's not going to be
 

8651
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:58,010
for the first time it's not going to be
fully fueled I don't think at least but

8652
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:58,020
fully fueled I don't think at least but
 

8653
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:00,290
fully fueled I don't think at least but
there is a limit to how they do have to

8654
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:00,300
there is a limit to how they do have to
 

8655
02:31:00,300 --> 02:31:01,610
there is a limit to how they do have to
have it weighed down enough that the

8656
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:01,620
have it weighed down enough that the
 

8657
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:03,290
have it weighed down enough that the
launch clamps can hold on to it because

8658
02:31:03,290 --> 02:31:03,300
launch clamps can hold on to it because
 

8659
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:05,210
launch clamps can hold on to it because
if you think about it like normally the

8660
02:31:05,210 --> 02:31:05,220
if you think about it like normally the
 

8661
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:07,130
if you think about it like normally the
launch clamps are holding on to an

8662
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:07,140
launch clamps are holding on to an
 

8663
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:09,910
launch clamps are holding on to an
entire rocket weighing 5 million

8664
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:09,920
entire rocket weighing 5 million
 

8665
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,190
entire rocket weighing 5 million
kilograms 5 million I get you know it's

8666
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:13,200
kilograms 5 million I get you know it's
 

8667
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,690
kilograms 5 million I get you know it's
weighing an insane amount so those

8668
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:14,700
weighing an insane amount so those
 

8669
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:16,969
weighing an insane amount so those
clamps don't actually have to hold 75

8670
02:31:16,969 --> 02:31:16,979
clamps don't actually have to hold 75
 

8671
02:31:16,979 --> 02:31:18,650
clamps don't actually have to hold 75
Mega Newtons of thrust they really want

8672
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:18,660
Mega Newtons of thrust they really want
 

8673
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:20,809
Mega Newtons of thrust they really want
to have to hold down 25 Mega Newtons of

8674
02:31:20,809 --> 02:31:20,819
to have to hold down 25 Mega Newtons of
 

8675
02:31:20,819 --> 02:31:22,370
to have to hold down 25 Mega Newtons of
thrust you know what I mean they're not

8676
02:31:22,370 --> 02:31:22,380
thrust you know what I mean they're not
 

8677
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:25,429
thrust you know what I mean they're not
designed to hold down all 75. so they do

8678
02:31:25,429 --> 02:31:25,439
designed to hold down all 75. so they do
 

8679
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,170
designed to hold down all 75. so they do
have to have enough weight on the rocket

8680
02:31:27,170 --> 02:31:27,180
have to have enough weight on the rocket
 

8681
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:28,550
have to have enough weight on the rocket
so that so even when they do these the

8682
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,560
so that so even when they do these the
 

8683
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,710
so that so even when they do these the
testing of the 33 engines it'll have to

8684
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:30,720
testing of the 33 engines it'll have to
 

8685
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,670
testing of the 33 engines it'll have to
have enough propellant in there that

8686
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:31,680
have enough propellant in there that
 

8687
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:33,230
have enough propellant in there that
they don't exceed the clamping and the

8688
02:31:33,230 --> 02:31:33,240
they don't exceed the clamping and the
 

8689
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:34,730
they don't exceed the clamping and the
holding force of the stand otherwise

8690
02:31:34,730 --> 02:31:34,740
holding force of the stand otherwise
 

8691
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,889
holding force of the stand otherwise
it'll break free from the launch stand

8692
02:31:36,889 --> 02:31:36,899
it'll break free from the launch stand
 

8693
02:31:36,899 --> 02:31:38,090
it'll break free from the launch stand
and that booster will go flying off

8694
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:38,100
and that booster will go flying off
 

8695
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:40,130
and that booster will go flying off
uncontrolled so it's a difficult thing

8696
02:31:40,130 --> 02:31:40,140
uncontrolled so it's a difficult thing
 

8697
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:43,190
uncontrolled so it's a difficult thing
to figure out in the test how many uh

8698
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,200
to figure out in the test how many uh
 

8699
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,650
to figure out in the test how many uh
simultaneous things you test right so

8700
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:45,660
simultaneous things you test right so
 

8701
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:47,270
simultaneous things you test right so
they're kind of mitigating risks which

8702
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280
they're kind of mitigating risks which
 

8703
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,830
they're kind of mitigating risks which
is why like they're d-stack you know

8704
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:48,840
is why like they're d-stack you know
 

8705
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:49,969
is why like they're d-stack you know
they don't want to have although the

8706
02:31:49,969 --> 02:31:49,979
they don't want to have although the
 

8707
02:31:49,979 --> 02:31:51,530
they don't want to have although the
ship could be on top of it to help weigh

8708
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:51,540
ship could be on top of it to help weigh
 

8709
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:53,570
ship could be on top of it to help weigh
it down and simulate the you know the

8710
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:53,580
it down and simulate the you know the
 

8711
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:55,670
it down and simulate the you know the
launch environment better at some point

8712
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:55,680
launch environment better at some point
 

8713
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:57,290
launch environment better at some point
that's a risk they're just going to take

8714
02:31:57,290 --> 02:31:57,300
that's a risk they're just going to take
 

8715
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:59,210
that's a risk they're just going to take
when they go for launch and so for now

8716
02:31:59,210 --> 02:31:59,220
when they go for launch and so for now
 

8717
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:00,710
when they go for launch and so for now
they're taking the ship off in case

8718
02:32:00,710 --> 02:32:00,720
they're taking the ship off in case
 

8719
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:02,030
they're taking the ship off in case
something goes wrong during the 33

8720
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:02,040
something goes wrong during the 33
 

8721
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:04,490
something goes wrong during the 33
engine test and then once we see if the

8722
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:04,500
engine test and then once we see if the
 

8723
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:06,349
engine test and then once we see if the
33 engine test goes well hopefully we

8724
02:32:06,349 --> 02:32:06,359
33 engine test goes well hopefully we
 

8725
02:32:06,359 --> 02:32:08,090
33 engine test goes well hopefully we
see the the second stage get stacked

8726
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:08,100
see the the second stage get stacked
 

8727
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:10,910
see the the second stage get stacked
back on it we'll see him get closer like

8728
02:32:10,910 --> 02:32:10,920
back on it we'll see him get closer like
 

8729
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:12,710
back on it we'll see him get closer like
closing out all the items and hope the

8730
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:12,720
closing out all the items and hope the
 

8731
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:14,389
closing out all the items and hope the
big one too is the FAA launch license

8732
02:32:14,389 --> 02:32:14,399
big one too is the FAA launch license
 

8733
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:16,969
big one too is the FAA launch license
there that's a that'll be publicly filed

8734
02:32:16,969 --> 02:32:16,979
there that's a that'll be publicly filed
 

8735
02:32:16,979 --> 02:32:19,730
there that's a that'll be publicly filed
we'll see that you know in the system uh

8736
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:19,740
we'll see that you know in the system uh
 

8737
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:22,309
we'll see that you know in the system uh
having a launch license and I I have no

8738
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:22,319
having a launch license and I I have no
 

8739
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:23,330
having a launch license and I I have no
sense in that type of thing you know

8740
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:23,340
sense in that type of thing you know
 

8741
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:25,429
sense in that type of thing you know
that's outside of but that's but that is

8742
02:32:25,429 --> 02:32:25,439
that's outside of but that's but that is
 

8743
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:26,570
that's outside of but that's but that is
a big milestone and it might be

8744
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:26,580
a big milestone and it might be
 

8745
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:28,010
a big milestone and it might be
something that could potentially hinder

8746
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:28,020
something that could potentially hinder
 

8747
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:30,050
something that could potentially hinder
uh you know hold up the launch date

8748
02:32:30,050 --> 02:32:30,060
uh you know hold up the launch date
 

8749
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:31,250
uh you know hold up the launch date
would just be waiting for a launch

8750
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:31,260
would just be waiting for a launch
 

8751
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:32,210
would just be waiting for a launch
license

8752
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:32,220
license
 

8753
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:34,010
license
yeah I'm sure there's a lot of

8754
02:32:34,010 --> 02:32:34,020
yeah I'm sure there's a lot of
 

8755
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:36,530
yeah I'm sure there's a lot of
fascinating bureaucracy and politics and

8756
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:36,540
fascinating bureaucracy and politics and
 

8757
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:37,730
fascinating bureaucracy and politics and
uh

8758
02:32:37,730 --> 02:32:37,740
uh
 

8759
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:39,650
uh
legal stuff and all that kind of

8760
02:32:39,650 --> 02:32:39,660
legal stuff and all that kind of
 

8761
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,510
legal stuff and all that kind of
beautiful magical thing when you live in

8762
02:32:41,510 --> 02:32:41,520
beautiful magical thing when you live in
 

8763
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:44,210
beautiful magical thing when you live in
reality uh because it is I mean it is a

8764
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:44,220
reality uh because it is I mean it is a
 

8765
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:45,250
reality uh because it is I mean it is a
big

8766
02:32:45,250 --> 02:32:45,260
big
 

8767
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:49,730
big
uh rocket yeah one the biggest thing

8768
02:32:49,730 --> 02:32:49,740
uh rocket yeah one the biggest thing
 

8769
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:51,050
uh rocket yeah one the biggest thing
it's not so much the fa doesn't

8770
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:51,060
it's not so much the fa doesn't
 

8771
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:52,969
it's not so much the fa doesn't
necessarily care about the success of

8772
02:32:52,969 --> 02:32:52,979
necessarily care about the success of
 

8773
02:32:52,979 --> 02:32:54,590
necessarily care about the success of
the rocket they just really just care

8774
02:32:54,590 --> 02:32:54,600
the rocket they just really just care
 

8775
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:56,870
the rocket they just really just care
about the safety of public and public

8776
02:32:56,870 --> 02:32:56,880
about the safety of public and public
 

8777
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:59,450
about the safety of public and public
property you know so it's it's it's a

8778
02:32:59,450 --> 02:32:59,460
property you know so it's it's it's a
 

8779
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,730
property you know so it's it's it's a
matter of being convinced and having the

8780
02:33:01,730 --> 02:33:01,740
matter of being convinced and having the
 

8781
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:04,370
matter of being convinced and having the
the data to prove okay if this thing

8782
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:04,380
the data to prove okay if this thing
 

8783
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:06,950
the data to prove okay if this thing
blows up we have a control of how and

8784
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:06,960
blows up we have a control of how and
 

8785
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:09,290
blows up we have a control of how and
when it blows up we have control of you

8786
02:33:09,290 --> 02:33:09,300
when it blows up we have control of you
 

8787
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:10,969
when it blows up we have control of you
know X Y and Z here's the potential

8788
02:33:10,969 --> 02:33:10,979
know X Y and Z here's the potential
 

8789
02:33:10,979 --> 02:33:13,130
know X Y and Z here's the potential
damage here's the blast radius you know

8790
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:13,140
damage here's the blast radius you know
 

8791
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:16,790
damage here's the blast radius you know
this again is over twice as powerful and

8792
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:16,800
this again is over twice as powerful and
 

8793
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,830
this again is over twice as powerful and
twice as much potential actually it's

8794
02:33:18,830 --> 02:33:18,840
twice as much potential actually it's
 

8795
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:21,110
twice as much potential actually it's
it's a lot more potential for uh an

8796
02:33:21,110 --> 02:33:21,120
it's a lot more potential for uh an
 

8797
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:23,330
it's a lot more potential for uh an
explosive energy if it you know where it

8798
02:33:23,330 --> 02:33:23,340
explosive energy if it you know where it
 

8799
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,849
explosive energy if it you know where it
happened to well let me walk back a

8800
02:33:25,849 --> 02:33:25,859
happened to well let me walk back a
 

8801
02:33:25,859 --> 02:33:27,290
happened to well let me walk back a
little because in order to have a real

8802
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:27,300
little because in order to have a real
 

8803
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:28,370
little because in order to have a real
detonation you have to have a perfect

8804
02:33:28,370 --> 02:33:28,380
detonation you have to have a perfect
 

8805
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:31,429
detonation you have to have a perfect
mixture ratio of your fuel and oxidizer

8806
02:33:31,429 --> 02:33:31,439
mixture ratio of your fuel and oxidizer
 

8807
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:32,990
mixture ratio of your fuel and oxidizer
um if when a rocket blows up typically

8808
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:33,000
um if when a rocket blows up typically
 

8809
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,910
um if when a rocket blows up typically
you know it kind of unzips and some of

8810
02:33:34,910 --> 02:33:34,920
you know it kind of unzips and some of
 

8811
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,230
you know it kind of unzips and some of
the fuel will mix into some of the

8812
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:36,240
the fuel will mix into some of the
 

8813
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,730
the fuel will mix into some of the
oxidizer and you could have some

8814
02:33:37,730 --> 02:33:37,740
oxidizer and you could have some
 

8815
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:39,650
oxidizer and you could have some
explosive energy but a lot of it's

8816
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:39,660
explosive energy but a lot of it's
 

8817
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,690
explosive energy but a lot of it's
actually just a deflagration it's just

8818
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:41,700
actually just a deflagration it's just
 

8819
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:44,330
actually just a deflagration it's just
you know flames and and yeah there will

8820
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:44,340
you know flames and and yeah there will
 

8821
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:46,429
you know flames and and yeah there will
there would be explosive energy but it's

8822
02:33:46,429 --> 02:33:46,439
there would be explosive energy but it's
 

8823
02:33:46,439 --> 02:33:47,929
there would be explosive energy but it's
not like you're lighting all of it

8824
02:33:47,929 --> 02:33:47,939
not like you're lighting all of it
 

8825
02:33:47,939 --> 02:33:50,510
not like you're lighting all of it
simultaneously it's this giant bomb it's

8826
02:33:50,510 --> 02:33:50,520
simultaneously it's this giant bomb it's
 

8827
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:52,910
simultaneously it's this giant bomb it's
just really not so that's good but at

8828
02:33:52,910 --> 02:33:52,920
just really not so that's good but at
 

8829
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,410
just really not so that's good but at
the same time even in those

8830
02:33:54,410 --> 02:33:54,420
the same time even in those
 

8831
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,690
the same time even in those
circumstances the amount of energy is

8832
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:56,700
circumstances the amount of energy is
 

8833
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:58,550
circumstances the amount of energy is
still absurd enough to likely blow out

8834
02:33:58,550 --> 02:33:58,560
still absurd enough to likely blow out
 

8835
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:01,190
still absurd enough to likely blow out
windows you know for miles and miles and

8836
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:01,200
windows you know for miles and miles and
 

8837
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:05,090
windows you know for miles and miles and
miles including my studio space

8838
02:34:05,090 --> 02:34:05,100
miles including my studio space
 

8839
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:09,770
miles including my studio space
uh well if the cameras hold up it would

8840
02:34:09,770 --> 02:34:09,780
uh well if the cameras hold up it would
 

8841
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:11,929
uh well if the cameras hold up it would
be one heck of a show hopefully of

8842
02:34:11,929 --> 02:34:11,939
be one heck of a show hopefully of
 

8843
02:34:11,939 --> 02:34:13,849
be one heck of a show hopefully of
course would not uh would not happen so

8844
02:34:13,849 --> 02:34:13,859
course would not uh would not happen so
 

8845
02:34:13,859 --> 02:34:15,469
course would not uh would not happen so
how does that take us to an orbital

8846
02:34:15,469 --> 02:34:15,479
how does that take us to an orbital
 

8847
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:16,550
how does that take us to an orbital
launch when do you think that would

8848
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:16,560
launch when do you think that would
 

8849
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,450
launch when do you think that would
happen

8850
02:34:17,450 --> 02:34:17,460
happen
 

8851
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:20,750
happen
in in my opinion uh this is a very fluid

8852
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:20,760
in in my opinion uh this is a very fluid
 

8853
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:22,130
in in my opinion uh this is a very fluid
and this will change literally by the

8854
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:22,140
and this will change literally by the
 

8855
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:23,929
and this will change literally by the
hour so you really think that it's very

8856
02:34:23,929 --> 02:34:23,939
hour so you really think that it's very
 

8857
02:34:23,939 --> 02:34:25,969
hour so you really think that it's very
difficult to really say like even even

8858
02:34:25,969 --> 02:34:25,979
difficult to really say like even even
 

8859
02:34:25,979 --> 02:34:27,590
difficult to really say like even even
for something that could very well

8860
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
for something that could very well
 

8861
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,870
for something that could very well
happen this year even just a few months

8862
02:34:29,870 --> 02:34:29,880
happen this year even just a few months
 

8863
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:31,190
happen this year even just a few months
away

8864
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:31,200
away
 

8865
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:34,429
away
um making a prediction uh by the way you

8866
02:34:34,429 --> 02:34:34,439
um making a prediction uh by the way you
 

8867
02:34:34,439 --> 02:34:35,929
um making a prediction uh by the way you
like superstitious on this kind of stuff

8868
02:34:35,929 --> 02:34:35,939
like superstitious on this kind of stuff
 

8869
02:34:35,939 --> 02:34:37,309
like superstitious on this kind of stuff
a little bit like you don't you're

8870
02:34:37,309 --> 02:34:37,319
a little bit like you don't you're
 

8871
02:34:37,319 --> 02:34:38,870
a little bit like you don't you're
worried about jinxing it and that kind

8872
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:38,880
worried about jinxing it and that kind
 

8873
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:40,490
worried about jinxing it and that kind
of stuff no

8874
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:40,500
of stuff no
 

8875
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:41,990
of stuff no
um because I would imagine you would be

8876
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:42,000
um because I would imagine you would be
 

8877
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,690
um because I would imagine you would be
like waiting for all of these launches

8878
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:44,700
like waiting for all of these launches
 

8879
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:46,670
like waiting for all of these launches
that keep getting delayed or you start

8880
02:34:46,670 --> 02:34:46,680
that keep getting delayed or you start
 

8881
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:48,410
that keep getting delayed or you start
thinking that there's certain things you

8882
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:48,420
thinking that there's certain things you
 

8883
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:51,230
thinking that there's certain things you
do will control the weather my socks I'm

8884
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:51,240
do will control the weather my socks I'm
 

8885
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,610
do will control the weather my socks I'm
wearing these socks I just scrubbed

8886
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:52,620
wearing these socks I just scrubbed
 

8887
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:54,170
wearing these socks I just scrubbed
again you know like yeah you're lucky

8888
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:54,180
again you know like yeah you're lucky
 

8889
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:55,969
again you know like yeah you're lucky
you have to wear the same lucky socks

8890
02:34:55,969 --> 02:34:55,979
you have to wear the same lucky socks
 

8891
02:34:55,979 --> 02:34:57,469
you have to wear the same lucky socks
otherwise it's going to there's going to

8892
02:34:57,469 --> 02:34:57,479
otherwise it's going to there's going to
 

8893
02:34:57,479 --> 02:35:00,050
otherwise it's going to there's going to
be bad weather yeah so the reason that I

8894
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:00,060
be bad weather yeah so the reason that I
 

8895
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,610
be bad weather yeah so the reason that I
say this and why it's so difficult is

8896
02:35:01,610 --> 02:35:01,620
say this and why it's so difficult is
 

8897
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:04,849
say this and why it's so difficult is
they did a first full stack test in July

8898
02:35:04,849 --> 02:35:04,859
they did a first full stack test in July
 

8899
02:35:04,859 --> 02:35:07,309
they did a first full stack test in July
of 2021 and the expectation was we're a

8900
02:35:07,309 --> 02:35:07,319
of 2021 and the expectation was we're a
 

8901
02:35:07,319 --> 02:35:09,950
of 2021 and the expectation was we're a
month or two away from a launch yeah so

8902
02:35:09,950 --> 02:35:09,960
month or two away from a launch yeah so
 

8903
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,990
month or two away from a launch yeah so
like realistically for 18 months I've

8904
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:12,000
like realistically for 18 months I've
 

8905
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,670
like realistically for 18 months I've
been in a Purgatory thinking that we're

8906
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:13,680
been in a Purgatory thinking that we're
 

8907
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,530
been in a Purgatory thinking that we're
a month or two away of an orbital launch

8908
02:35:15,530 --> 02:35:15,540
a month or two away of an orbital launch
 

8909
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:18,590
a month or two away of an orbital launch
now I did say for the record heard when

8910
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:18,600
now I did say for the record heard when
 

8911
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:20,030
now I did say for the record heard when
that thing stacked and when a lot of

8912
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:20,040
that thing stacked and when a lot of
 

8913
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:22,130
that thing stacked and when a lot of
speculation was saying you know a month

8914
02:35:22,130 --> 02:35:22,140
speculation was saying you know a month
 

8915
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:23,389
speculation was saying you know a month
or two I was saying I don't expect it to

8916
02:35:23,389 --> 02:35:23,399
or two I was saying I don't expect it to
 

8917
02:35:23,399 --> 02:35:26,630
or two I was saying I don't expect it to
fly in 2021. you know and I've been just

8918
02:35:26,630 --> 02:35:26,640
fly in 2021. you know and I've been just
 

8919
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,429
fly in 2021. you know and I've been just
say I just saw the amount of work that

8920
02:35:28,429 --> 02:35:28,439
say I just saw the amount of work that
 

8921
02:35:28,439 --> 02:35:29,450
say I just saw the amount of work that
still needed to be done like on the

8922
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:29,460
still needed to be done like on the
 

8923
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:31,670
still needed to be done like on the
ground systems the tanks the the launch

8924
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
ground systems the tanks the the launch
 

8925
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:32,870
ground systems the tanks the the launch
Mount all the stuff I'm sitting there

8926
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:32,880
Mount all the stuff I'm sitting there
 

8927
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:34,070
Mount all the stuff I'm sitting there
like there's still a lot of stuff

8928
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:34,080
like there's still a lot of stuff
 

8929
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:35,030
like there's still a lot of stuff
they're gonna have to validate it

8930
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:35,040
they're gonna have to validate it
 

8931
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,929
they're gonna have to validate it
they're gonna have to test everything

8932
02:35:35,929 --> 02:35:35,939
they're gonna have to test everything
 

8933
02:35:35,939 --> 02:35:38,090
they're gonna have to test everything
every component and you know people were

8934
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:38,100
every component and you know people were
 

8935
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:40,250
every component and you know people were
like how dare you say that even Gwen

8936
02:35:40,250 --> 02:35:40,260
like how dare you say that even Gwen
 

8937
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:42,410
like how dare you say that even Gwen
Shotwell the president of SpaceX is

8938
02:35:42,410 --> 02:35:42,420
Shotwell the president of SpaceX is
 

8939
02:35:42,420 --> 02:35:45,530
Shotwell the president of SpaceX is
saying Q3 of 2021 I'm like okay but like

8940
02:35:45,530 --> 02:35:45,540
saying Q3 of 2021 I'm like okay but like
 

8941
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:47,450
saying Q3 of 2021 I'm like okay but like
I'm just I'm not gonna be surprised if

8942
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:47,460
I'm just I'm not gonna be surprised if
 

8943
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,969
I'm just I'm not gonna be surprised if
it slips into 2022. and here we are the

8944
02:35:49,969 --> 02:35:49,979
it slips into 2022. and here we are the
 

8945
02:35:49,979 --> 02:35:52,910
it slips into 2022. and here we are the
beginning of 2023 and I I think we're

8946
02:35:52,910 --> 02:35:52,920
beginning of 2023 and I I think we're
 

8947
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,950
beginning of 2023 and I I think we're
finally within like two months

8948
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:54,960
finally within like two months
 

8949
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:57,230
finally within like two months
I I'm expecting like I'm trying to keep

8950
02:35:57,230 --> 02:35:57,240
I I'm expecting like I'm trying to keep
 

8951
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:59,809
I I'm expecting like I'm trying to keep
my March in April as free as I can

8952
02:35:59,809 --> 02:35:59,819
my March in April as free as I can
 

8953
02:35:59,819 --> 02:36:01,670
my March in April as free as I can
we'll put it that way

8954
02:36:01,670 --> 02:36:01,680
we'll put it that way
 

8955
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:04,429
we'll put it that way
I love it uh actually just in a small

8956
02:36:04,429 --> 02:36:04,439
I love it uh actually just in a small
 

8957
02:36:04,439 --> 02:36:08,270
I love it uh actually just in a small
tangent on uh going like what what do

8958
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:08,280
tangent on uh going like what what do
 

8959
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:10,910
tangent on uh going like what what do
you uh uh from everything I know she's

8960
02:36:10,910 --> 02:36:10,920
you uh uh from everything I know she's

02:38:20,929 --> 02:38:20,939
the hiring and this is the matter I
 

9083
02:38:20,939 --> 02:38:22,190
the hiring and this is the matter I
think it's a lot of it's honestly even

9084
02:38:22,190 --> 02:38:22,200
think it's a lot of it's honestly even
 

9085
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:23,750
think it's a lot of it's honestly even
just the business making sure the

9086
02:38:23,750 --> 02:38:23,760
just the business making sure the
 

9087
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:26,389
just the business making sure the
money's flowing in a positive trend more

9088
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:26,399
money's flowing in a positive trend more
 

9089
02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:28,190
money's flowing in a positive trend more
or less you know that yes elon's

9090
02:38:28,190 --> 02:38:28,200
or less you know that yes elon's
 

9091
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:30,290
or less you know that yes elon's
obviously a money guy but he thinks he's

9092
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:30,300
obviously a money guy but he thinks he's
 

9093
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:32,809
obviously a money guy but he thinks he's
so I think Elon is so risky you know he

9094
02:38:32,809 --> 02:38:32,819
so I think Elon is so risky you know he
 

9095
02:38:32,819 --> 02:38:34,610
so I think Elon is so risky you know he
just loves to throw it all in

9096
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:34,620
just loves to throw it all in
 

9097
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:37,250
just loves to throw it all in
that he leaves little margin for error

9098
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:37,260
that he leaves little margin for error
 

9099
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,230
that he leaves little margin for error
you know he's he's been really lucky

9100
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:39,240
you know he's he's been really lucky
 

9101
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:40,490
you know he's he's been really lucky
with rolling his dice you know

9102
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:40,500
with rolling his dice you know
 

9103
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:42,290
with rolling his dice you know
especially like when he started SpaceX

9104
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:42,300
especially like when he started SpaceX
 

9105
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:44,450
especially like when he started SpaceX
and Tesla that was the ultimate role of

9106
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:44,460
and Tesla that was the ultimate role of
 

9107
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:47,030
and Tesla that was the ultimate role of
the dice but I think she's a healthy

9108
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:47,040
the dice but I think she's a healthy
 

9109
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,730
the dice but I think she's a healthy
balance to be like well here's our you

9110
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:49,740
balance to be like well here's our you
 

9111
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:52,550
balance to be like well here's our you
know operations and now we can continue

9112
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:52,560
know operations and now we can continue
 

9113
02:38:52,560 --> 02:38:54,050
know operations and now we can continue
to do this without risking everything

9114
02:38:54,050 --> 02:38:54,060
to do this without risking everything
 

9115
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:56,150
to do this without risking everything
you know and starship's close let me be

9116
02:38:56,150 --> 02:38:56,160
you know and starship's close let me be
 

9117
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:59,090
you know and starship's close let me be
clear Starship is close to risking

9118
02:38:59,090 --> 02:38:59,100
clear Starship is close to risking
 

9119
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:01,030
clear Starship is close to risking
everything already it's just such a big

9120
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:01,040
everything already it's just such a big
 

9121
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,230
everything already it's just such a big
fast-moving high-risk developmental

9122
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:03,240
fast-moving high-risk developmental
 

9123
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:05,030
fast-moving high-risk developmental
program that like

9124
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:05,040
program that like
 

9125
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,130
program that like
I I personally think you know SpaceX

9126
02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:07,140
I I personally think you know SpaceX
 

9127
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:08,630
I I personally think you know SpaceX
would probably be fine if they shut the

9128
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:08,640
would probably be fine if they shut the
 

9129
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:10,670
would probably be fine if they shut the
doors on Starship and just flew Falcon 9

9130
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:10,680
doors on Starship and just flew Falcon 9
 

9131
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:12,170
doors on Starship and just flew Falcon 9
and Falcon heavy for the next 10 years

9132
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:12,180
and Falcon heavy for the next 10 years
 

9133
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:13,730
and Falcon heavy for the next 10 years
they would still be commercially valid

9134
02:39:13,730 --> 02:39:13,740
they would still be commercially valid
 

9135
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:15,590
they would still be commercially valid
they could not spend another dollar on

9136
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:15,600
they could not spend another dollar on
 

9137
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,790
they could not spend another dollar on
research and development they could fire

9138
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:16,800
research and development they could fire
 

9139
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:18,889
research and development they could fire
I don't want them to fire everyone

9140
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:18,899
I don't want them to fire everyone
 

9141
02:39:18,899 --> 02:39:20,150
I don't want them to fire everyone
involved in anything research

9142
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:20,160
involved in anything research
 

9143
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,650
involved in anything research
involvement and just ran operations on

9144
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:21,660
involvement and just ran operations on
 

9145
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:23,510
involvement and just ran operations on
Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy and they would

9146
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:23,520
Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy and they would
 

9147
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,429
Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy and they would
still be dominant for 10 years and they

9148
02:39:25,429 --> 02:39:25,439
still be dominant for 10 years and they
 

9149
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:26,570
still be dominant for 10 years and they
would still have a business case and

9150
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:26,580
would still have a business case and
 

9151
02:39:26,580 --> 02:39:27,830
would still have a business case and
they'd still be fine

9152
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:27,840
they'd still be fine
 

9153
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:29,510
they'd still be fine
but

9154
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,520
but
 

9155
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:31,790
but
um they're all in like all chips are

9156
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:31,800
um they're all in like all chips are
 

9157
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:33,170
um they're all in like all chips are
pretty much as many chips as possible

9158
02:39:33,170 --> 02:39:33,180
pretty much as many chips as possible
 

9159
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:34,670
pretty much as many chips as possible
are in

9160
02:39:34,670 --> 02:39:34,680
are in
 

9161
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:38,030
are in
I don't know

9162
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:38,040
I don't know
 

9163
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:41,150
I don't know
what else I could say is there's not

9164
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:41,160
what else I could say is there's not
 

9165
02:39:41,160 --> 02:39:44,750
what else I could say is there's not
I've talked to a lot of uh great leaders

9166
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:44,760
I've talked to a lot of uh great leaders
 

9167
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:46,790
I've talked to a lot of uh great leaders
there's just not many people like Elon

9168
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:46,800
there's just not many people like Elon
 

9169
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,710
there's just not many people like Elon
that would push for Starship

9170
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:48,720
that would push for Starship
 

9171
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:51,170
that would push for Starship
when they're already when it's already

9172
02:39:51,170 --> 02:39:51,180
when they're already when it's already
 

9173
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:54,110
when they're already when it's already
had a very successful company yeah uh

9174
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:54,120
had a very successful company yeah uh
 

9175
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:56,389
had a very successful company yeah uh
sort of everyone doubted that it could

9176
02:39:56,389 --> 02:39:56,399
sort of everyone doubted that it could
 

9177
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:58,429
sort of everyone doubted that it could
be a successful company it was so close

9178
02:39:58,429 --> 02:39:58,439
be a successful company it was so close
 

9179
02:39:58,439 --> 02:40:00,950
be a successful company it was so close
to bankruptcy and failing and then to

9180
02:40:00,950 --> 02:40:00,960
to bankruptcy and failing and then to
 

9181
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,050
to bankruptcy and failing and then to
take it into a financially viable

9182
02:40:03,050 --> 02:40:03,060
take it into a financially viable
 

9183
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:06,830
take it into a financially viable
successful company and just when you do

9184
02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:06,840
successful company and just when you do
 

9185
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:09,410
successful company and just when you do
you take on a project that again risks

9186
02:40:09,410 --> 02:40:09,420
you take on a project that again risks
 

9187
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:10,910
you take on a project that again risks
everything

9188
02:40:10,910 --> 02:40:10,920
everything
 

9189
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:12,770
everything
when he already did this with Falcon 1

9190
02:40:12,770 --> 02:40:12,780
when he already did this with Falcon 1
 

9191
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:14,690
when he already did this with Falcon 1
to Falcon 9. like literally people were

9192
02:40:14,690 --> 02:40:14,700
to Falcon 9. like literally people were
 

9193
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:17,330
to Falcon 9. like literally people were
like what are you doing they basically

9194
02:40:17,330 --> 02:40:17,340
like what are you doing they basically
 

9195
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:19,370
like what are you doing they basically
signed over and were fully ramping up

9196
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:19,380
signed over and were fully ramping up
 

9197
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:21,650
signed over and were fully ramping up
Falcon 9 by the time they finally had

9198
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:21,660
Falcon 9 by the time they finally had
 

9199
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:23,809
Falcon 9 by the time they finally had
their first Falcon one success they had

9200
02:40:23,809 --> 02:40:23,819
their first Falcon one success they had
 

9201
02:40:23,819 --> 02:40:25,790
their first Falcon one success they had
one more flight they only flew [\h__\h]

9202
02:40:25,790 --> 02:40:25,800
one more flight they only flew [\h__\h]
 

9203
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:27,230
one more flight they only flew [\h__\h]
one successfully twice they flew five

9204
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:27,240
one successfully twice they flew five
 

9205
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:28,370
one successfully twice they flew five
times all together the fourth one was

9206
02:40:28,370 --> 02:40:28,380
times all together the fourth one was
 

9207
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:29,590
times all together the fourth one was
successful and they flew one more time

9208
02:40:29,590 --> 02:40:29,600
successful and they flew one more time
 

9209
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:32,690
successful and they flew one more time
and the anyone else out there would have

9210
02:40:32,690 --> 02:40:32,700
and the anyone else out there would have
 

9211
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:34,730
and the anyone else out there would have
been like let's keep flying the Falcon

9212
02:40:34,730 --> 02:40:34,740
been like let's keep flying the Falcon
 

9213
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:37,130
been like let's keep flying the Falcon
one we have a working rocket we can

9214
02:40:37,130 --> 02:40:37,140
one we have a working rocket we can
 

9215
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:38,809
one we have a working rocket we can
start you know making money and

9216
02:40:38,809 --> 02:40:38,819
start you know making money and
 

9217
02:40:38,819 --> 02:40:41,809
start you know making money and
profiting and already he was risking it

9218
02:40:41,809 --> 02:40:41,819
profiting and already he was risking it
 

9219
02:40:41,819 --> 02:40:43,429
profiting and already he was risking it
all and saying nope we're going from

9220
02:40:43,429 --> 02:40:43,439
all and saying nope we're going from
 

9221
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:46,130
all and saying nope we're going from
Falcon one to Falcon 9 it was a huge

9222
02:40:46,130 --> 02:40:46,140
Falcon one to Falcon 9 it was a huge
 

9223
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:48,950
Falcon one to Falcon 9 it was a huge
huge leap you know it was that I think

9224
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:48,960
huge leap you know it was that I think
 

9225
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:50,570
huge leap you know it was that I think
it's at least as big as a leap from

9226
02:40:50,570 --> 02:40:50,580
it's at least as big as a leap from
 

9227
02:40:50,580 --> 02:40:52,190
it's at least as big as a leap from
Falcon one to nine as it is from Falcon

9228
02:40:52,190 --> 02:40:52,200
Falcon one to nine as it is from Falcon
 

9229
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:54,349
Falcon one to nine as it is from Falcon
9 to Starship or around relatively a

9230
02:40:54,349 --> 02:40:54,359
9 to Starship or around relatively a
 

9231
02:40:54,359 --> 02:40:56,450
9 to Starship or around relatively a
similar leap so it's just that same

9232
02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:56,460
similar leap so it's just that same
 

9233
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:58,309
similar leap so it's just that same
thing again people are going why are you

9234
02:40:58,309 --> 02:40:58,319
thing again people are going why are you
 

9235
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:01,429
thing again people are going why are you
leaping into this insane program and

9236
02:41:01,429 --> 02:41:01,439
leaping into this insane program and
 

9237
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:04,490
leaping into this insane program and
system and risk when you have such a you

9238
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:04,500
system and risk when you have such a you
 

9239
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:06,349
system and risk when you have such a you
know you finally have this Workhorse of

9240
02:41:06,349 --> 02:41:06,359
know you finally have this Workhorse of
 

9241
02:41:06,359 --> 02:41:08,090
know you finally have this Workhorse of
a rocket that's so dominant in the

9242
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:08,100
a rocket that's so dominant in the
 

9243
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:08,990
a rocket that's so dominant in the
industry

9244
02:41:08,990 --> 02:41:09,000
industry
 

9245
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,910
industry
yet they're going

9246
02:41:10,910 --> 02:41:10,920
yet they're going
 

9247
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:12,530
yet they're going
10x you know

9248
02:41:12,530 --> 02:41:12,540
10x you know
 

9249
02:41:12,540 --> 02:41:15,710
10x you know
it so happens that you've been selected

9250
02:41:15,710 --> 02:41:15,720
it so happens that you've been selected
 

9251
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:18,170
it so happens that you've been selected
for the dear moon mission that will fly

9252
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:18,180
for the dear moon mission that will fly
 

9253
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:21,230
for the dear moon mission that will fly
Starship once around the Moon with nine

be a part of it
 

9267
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:40,849
be a part of it
so tell me about the objective of this

9268

so tell me about the objective of this
 

9269
02:41:40,859 --> 02:41:43,429
so tell me about the objective of this
Mission and um how does it feel to be a

plus to be able to fly on soyuz so as
 

9887
02:52:57,300 --> 02:52:59,210
plus to be able to fly on soyuz so as
far as like it's good to know for me

9888
02:52:59,210 --> 02:52:59,220
far as like it's good to know for me
 

9889
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:00,769
far as like it's good to know for me
that I have someone

9890
02:53:00,769 --> 02:53:00,779
that I have someone
 

9891
02:53:00,779 --> 02:53:02,750
that I have someone
on the crew that has experience with

9892
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:02,760
on the crew that has experience with
 

9893
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:04,070
on the crew that has experience with
space flight

9894
02:53:04,070 --> 02:53:04,080
space flight
 

9895
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:06,110
space flight
um has trained and has some knowledge on

9896
02:53:06,110 --> 02:53:06,120
um has trained and has some knowledge on
 

9897
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:07,190
um has trained and has some knowledge on
space flight as well you know that's

9898
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,200
space flight as well you know that's
 

9899
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:09,230
space flight as well you know that's
that is an important aspect for sure so

9900
02:53:09,230 --> 02:53:09,240
that is an important aspect for sure so
 

9901
02:53:09,240 --> 02:53:11,030
that is an important aspect for sure so
you made a excellent video about flying

9902
02:53:11,030 --> 02:53:11,040
you made a excellent video about flying
 

9903
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,550
you made a excellent video about flying
in the fighter jet uh that I think you

9904
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:13,560
in the fighter jet uh that I think you
 

9905
02:53:13,560 --> 02:53:16,130
in the fighter jet uh that I think you
mentioned may be relevant uh to the

9906
02:53:16,130 --> 02:53:16,140
mentioned may be relevant uh to the
 

9907
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:18,170
mentioned may be relevant uh to the
training is there some high level

9908
02:53:18,170 --> 02:53:18,180
training is there some high level
 

9909
02:53:18,180 --> 02:53:20,330
training is there some high level
aspects to training that you anticipate

9910
02:53:20,330 --> 02:53:20,340
aspects to training that you anticipate
 

9911
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:22,670
aspects to training that you anticipate
that you might be able to speak to yeah

9912
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:22,680
that you might be able to speak to yeah
 

9913
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:24,590
that you might be able to speak to yeah
so you know so far I think we can really

9914
02:53:24,590 --> 02:53:24,600
so you know so far I think we can really
 

9915
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:27,590
so you know so far I think we can really
lean on what has happened with the other

9916
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:27,600
lean on what has happened with the other
 

9917
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:29,929
lean on what has happened with the other
um you know commercial crew missions and

9918
02:53:29,929 --> 02:53:29,939
um you know commercial crew missions and
 

9919
02:53:29,939 --> 02:53:31,790
um you know commercial crew missions and
in in private missions like the

9920
02:53:31,790 --> 02:53:31,800
in in private missions like the
 

9921
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,950
in in private missions like the
inspiration form Mission or Axiom uh

9922
02:53:33,950 --> 02:53:33,960
inspiration form Mission or Axiom uh
 

9923
02:53:33,960 --> 02:53:35,510
inspiration form Mission or Axiom uh
where SpaceX flew individually they

9924
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:35,520
where SpaceX flew individually they
 

9925
02:53:35,520 --> 02:53:37,910
where SpaceX flew individually they
trained for about six months a lot of

9926
02:53:37,910 --> 02:53:37,920
trained for about six months a lot of
 

9927
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:40,130
trained for about six months a lot of
like reading manuals and learning the

9928
02:53:40,130 --> 02:53:40,140
like reading manuals and learning the
 

9929
02:53:40,140 --> 02:53:42,590
like reading manuals and learning the
spacecraft are you gonna do like a Rocky

9930
02:53:42,590 --> 02:53:42,600
spacecraft are you gonna do like a Rocky
 

9931
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:46,330
spacecraft are you gonna do like a Rocky
4 Montage or

9932
02:53:46,330 --> 02:53:46,340

 

9933
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:48,769

a lot of physical training and they're

9934
02:53:48,769 --> 02:53:48,779
a lot of physical training and they're
 

9935
02:53:48,779 --> 02:53:50,750
a lot of physical training and they're
like we didn't tell them to do it he's

9936
02:53:50,750 --> 02:53:50,760
like we didn't tell them to do it he's
 

9937
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:52,730
like we didn't tell them to do it he's
just seems to want to film himself

9938
02:53:52,730 --> 02:53:52,740
just seems to want to film himself
 

9939
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:55,730
just seems to want to film himself
shirtless in the snow it doesn't make

9940
02:53:55,730 --> 02:53:55,740
shirtless in the snow it doesn't make
 

9941
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:58,670
shirtless in the snow it doesn't make
any houses always doing this I can't get

9942
02:53:58,670 --> 02:53:58,680
any houses always doing this I can't get
 

9943
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:00,830
any houses always doing this I can't get
him to stop punching me

9944
02:54:00,830 --> 02:54:00,840
him to stop punching me
 

9945
02:54:00,840 --> 02:54:03,349
him to stop punching me
um so yeah hopefully uh

9946
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:03,359
um so yeah hopefully uh
 

9947
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:06,790
um so yeah hopefully uh
realistically

9948
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:06,800

 

9949
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:09,650

I like it but there's there's a physical

9950
02:54:09,650 --> 02:54:09,660
I like it but there's there's a physical
 

9951
02:54:09,660 --> 02:54:11,269
I like it but there's there's a physical
component to all of this and that's

9952
02:54:11,269 --> 02:54:11,279
component to all of this and that's
 

9953
02:54:11,279 --> 02:54:12,950
component to all of this and that's
that's really I mean that that's

9954
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:12,960
that's really I mean that that's
 

9955
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:15,050
that's really I mean that that's
fascinating it's also inspired in the

9956
02:54:15,050 --> 02:54:15,060
fascinating it's also inspired in the
 

9957
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:16,610
fascinating it's also inspired in the
sort of civilians

9958
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:16,620
sort of civilians
 

9959
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:18,230
sort of civilians
can do this that's that's really

9960
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:18,240
can do this that's that's really
 

9961
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:20,990
can do this that's that's really
interesting yeah I mean this is and to

9962
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:21,000
interesting yeah I mean this is and to
 

9963
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,330
interesting yeah I mean this is and to
me this represents this and the other

9964
02:54:23,330 --> 02:54:23,340
me this represents this and the other
 

9965
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:25,250
me this represents this and the other
commercial space you know uh private

9966
02:54:25,250 --> 02:54:25,260
commercial space you know uh private
 

9967
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:26,150
commercial space you know uh private
space flight missions like this

9968
02:54:26,150 --> 02:54:26,160
space flight missions like this
 

9969
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:28,250
space flight missions like this
represent really a turning point like

9970
02:54:28,250 --> 02:54:28,260
represent really a turning point like
 

9971
02:54:28,260 --> 02:54:30,110
represent really a turning point like
truly an inflection and again it's easy

9972
02:54:30,110 --> 02:54:30,120
truly an inflection and again it's easy
 

9973
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:31,849
truly an inflection and again it's easy
for people to be cynical that

9974
02:54:31,849 --> 02:54:31,859
for people to be cynical that
 

9975
02:54:31,859 --> 02:54:34,370
for people to be cynical that
oh you know why are people wasting all

9976
02:54:34,370 --> 02:54:34,380
oh you know why are people wasting all
 

9977
02:54:34,380 --> 02:54:35,870
oh you know why are people wasting all
this money doing space flight stuff it's

9978
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:35,880
this money doing space flight stuff it's
 

9979
02:54:35,880 --> 02:54:37,849
this money doing space flight stuff it's
like well I'm sure some people were

9980
02:54:37,849 --> 02:54:37,859
like well I'm sure some people were
 

9981
02:54:37,859 --> 02:54:39,410
like well I'm sure some people were
saying that same thing about you know

9982
02:54:39,410 --> 02:54:39,420
saying that same thing about you know
 

9983
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:42,230
saying that same thing about you know
airplanes and and early Aviation going

9984
02:54:42,230 --> 02:54:42,240
airplanes and and early Aviation going
 

9985
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:44,269
airplanes and and early Aviation going
like why are we I can't believe those

9986
02:54:44,269 --> 02:54:44,279
like why are we I can't believe those
 

9987
02:54:44,279 --> 02:54:45,769
like why are we I can't believe those
people are wasting the government's you

9988
02:54:45,769 --> 02:54:45,779
people are wasting the government's you
 

9989
02:54:45,779 --> 02:54:47,990
people are wasting the government's you
know funding these stupid planes and

9990
02:54:47,990 --> 02:54:48,000
know funding these stupid planes and
 

9991
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:49,010
know funding these stupid planes and
stuff how's this ever going to benefit

9992
02:54:49,010 --> 02:54:49,020
stuff how's this ever going to benefit
 

9993
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:50,750
stuff how's this ever going to benefit
me and nowadays like imagine if all the

9994
02:54:50,750 --> 02:54:50,760
me and nowadays like imagine if all the
 

9995
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:53,150
me and nowadays like imagine if all the
planes just stopped working like would

9996
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:53,160
planes just stopped working like would
 

9997
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:54,590
planes just stopped working like would
freak out like our economy would

9998
02:54:54,590 --> 02:54:54,600
freak out like our economy would
 

9999
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:57,230
freak out like our economy would
collapse yeah it would suck you know and

10000
02:54:57,230 --> 02:54:57,240
collapse yeah it would suck you know and
 

10001
02:54:57,240 --> 02:54:58,790
collapse yeah it would suck you know and
I you know might be a long time before

10002
02:54:58,790 --> 02:54:58,800
I you know might be a long time before
 

10003
02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:00,530
I you know might be a long time before
we get to that reality with space fight

10004
02:55:00,530 --> 02:55:00,540
we get to that reality with space fight
 

10005
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:02,929
we get to that reality with space fight
well I know if if spaceflight halted

10006
02:55:02,929 --> 02:55:02,939
well I know if if spaceflight halted
 

10007
02:55:02,939 --> 02:55:05,690
well I know if if spaceflight halted
today you know space assets uh all of

10008
02:55:05,690 --> 02:55:05,700
today you know space assets uh all of
 

10009
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:08,030
today you know space assets uh all of
our you know on-orbit assets our life

10010
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:08,040
our you know on-orbit assets our life
 

10011
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:09,710
our you know on-orbit assets our life
would be crippled and I don't think

10012
02:55:09,710 --> 02:55:09,720
would be crippled and I don't think
 

10013
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:11,809
would be crippled and I don't think
people realize that yeah so it's already

10014
02:55:11,809 --> 02:55:11,819
people realize that yeah so it's already
 

10015
02:55:11,819 --> 02:55:13,550
people realize that yeah so it's already
we're already reliant on it but now

10016
02:55:13,550 --> 02:55:13,560
we're already reliant on it but now
 

10017
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:14,570
we're already reliant on it but now
we're getting to the point where it's

10018
02:55:14,570 --> 02:55:14,580
we're getting to the point where it's
 

10019
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:16,309
we're getting to the point where it's
we're really turning that corner where

10020
02:55:16,309 --> 02:55:16,319
we're really turning that corner where
 

10021
02:55:16,319 --> 02:55:19,429
we're really turning that corner where
it's the average person alive today you

10022
02:55:19,429 --> 02:55:19,439
it's the average person alive today you
 

10023
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:21,710
it's the average person alive today you
know if you're born uh you know now or

10024
02:55:21,710 --> 02:55:21,720
know if you're born uh you know now or
 

10025
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:23,510
know if you're born uh you know now or
from now on I think there's a real

10026
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:23,520
from now on I think there's a real
 

10027
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,730
from now on I think there's a real
decent chance that by the time you pass

10028
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:25,740
decent chance that by the time you pass
 

10029
02:55:25,740 --> 02:55:27,590
decent chance that by the time you pass
There's an opportunity to have flown in

10030
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:27,600
There's an opportunity to have flown in
 

10031
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:28,670
There's an opportunity to have flown in
space

10032
02:55:28,670 --> 02:55:28,680
space
 

10033
02:55:28,680 --> 02:55:31,790
space
yeah I mean I if I'm being honest I

10034
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:31,800
yeah I mean I if I'm being honest I
 

10035
02:55:31,800 --> 02:55:33,769
yeah I mean I if I'm being honest I
still haven't lost the the feeling of

10036
02:55:33,769 --> 02:55:33,779
still haven't lost the the feeling of
 

10037
02:55:33,779 --> 02:55:36,290
still haven't lost the the feeling of
magic of flying in an airplane I often

10038
02:55:36,290 --> 02:55:36,300
magic of flying in an airplane I often
 

10039
02:55:36,300 --> 02:55:38,450
magic of flying in an airplane I often
catch myself thinking like how is this

10040
02:55:38,450 --> 02:55:38,460
catch myself thinking like how is this
 

10041
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:39,830
catch myself thinking like how is this
real

10042
02:55:39,830 --> 02:55:39,840
real
 

10043
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:42,349
real
how is it and like

10044
02:55:42,349 --> 02:55:42,359
how is it and like
 

10045
02:55:42,359 --> 02:55:45,110
how is it and like
the contrast of this incredible thing

10046
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:45,120
the contrast of this incredible thing
 

10047
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:48,230
the contrast of this incredible thing
that's incredibly safe flying through

10048
02:55:48,230 --> 02:55:48,240
that's incredibly safe flying through
 

10049
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:50,570
that's incredibly safe flying through
the air taking off and Landing while

10050
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:50,580
the air taking off and Landing while
 

10051
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:53,590
the air taking off and Landing while
everyone else just looks bored

10052
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:53,600
everyone else just looks bored
 

10053
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:56,750
everyone else just looks bored
watching like I don't know uh some

10054
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:56,760
watching like I don't know uh some
 

10055
02:55:56,760 --> 02:56:00,590
watching like I don't know uh some
romantic comedy on their phone with

10056
02:56:00,590 --> 02:56:00,600
romantic comedy on their phone with
 

10057
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:04,610
romantic comedy on their phone with
Wi-Fi yeah so yeah it's just it's like

10058
02:56:04,610 --> 02:56:04,620
Wi-Fi yeah so yeah it's just it's like
 

10059
02:56:04,620 --> 02:56:08,150
Wi-Fi yeah so yeah it's just it's like
the contrast of that is like wow we're

10060
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:08,160
the contrast of that is like wow we're
 

10061
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:10,790
the contrast of that is like wow we're
we're incredible we're incredible as a

10062
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:10,800
we're incredible we're incredible as a
 

10063
02:56:10,800 --> 02:56:14,090
we're incredible we're incredible as a
society and it's like we we develop some

10064
02:56:14,090 --> 02:56:14,100
society and it's like we we develop some
 

10065
02:56:14,100 --> 02:56:17,870
society and it's like we we develop some
amazing technology that improves almost

10066
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:17,880
amazing technology that improves almost
 

10067
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:19,969
amazing technology that improves almost
the measurably our quality of life and

10068
02:56:19,969 --> 02:56:19,979
the measurably our quality of life and
 

10069
02:56:19,979 --> 02:56:21,889
the measurably our quality of life and
then we take it for granted and now

10070
02:56:21,889 --> 02:56:21,899
then we take it for granted and now
 

10071
02:56:21,899 --> 02:56:24,170
then we take it for granted and now
still reach for the next thing and the

10072
02:56:24,170 --> 02:56:24,180
still reach for the next thing and the
 

10073
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:26,210
still reach for the next thing and the
next thing and life becomes more

10074
02:56:26,210 --> 02:56:26,220
next thing and life becomes more
 

10075
02:56:26,220 --> 02:56:27,950
next thing and life becomes more
beautiful and complex and interesting

10076
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:27,960
beautiful and complex and interesting
 

10077
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:30,590
beautiful and complex and interesting
and yeah it's just the same stuff will

10078
02:56:30,590 --> 02:56:30,600
and yeah it's just the same stuff will
 

10079
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:33,950
and yeah it's just the same stuff will
be uh happening oh yeah uh with space

10080
02:56:33,950 --> 02:56:33,960
be uh happening oh yeah uh with space
 

10081
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:35,750
be uh happening oh yeah uh with space
travel oh it'll become mundane and

10082
02:56:35,750 --> 02:56:35,760
travel oh it'll become mundane and
 

10083
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:37,969
travel oh it'll become mundane and
boring at some point the tough thing

10084
02:56:37,969 --> 02:56:37,979
boring at some point the tough thing
 

10085
02:56:37,979 --> 02:56:39,769
boring at some point the tough thing
about space travel of course

10086
02:56:39,769 --> 02:56:39,779
about space travel of course
 

10087
02:56:39,779 --> 02:56:42,710
about space travel of course
uh you know I don't even know if it's

10088
02:56:42,710 --> 02:56:42,720
uh you know I don't even know if it's
 

10089
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:44,630
uh you know I don't even know if it's
such a giant leap over airplanes because

10090
02:56:44,630 --> 02:56:44,640
such a giant leap over airplanes because
 

10091
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:48,170
such a giant leap over airplanes because
airplanes are already incredible but uh

10092
02:56:48,170 --> 02:56:48,180
airplanes are already incredible but uh
 

10093
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:49,790
airplanes are already incredible but uh
the tough thing with space travel is the

10094
02:56:49,790 --> 02:56:49,800
the tough thing with space travel is the
 

10095
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:52,849
the tough thing with space travel is the
destination right is the is the is the

10096
02:56:52,849 --> 02:56:52,859
destination right is the is the is the
 

10097
02:56:52,859 --> 02:56:54,530
destination right is the is the is the
landing on a whole lot of the worlds

10098
02:56:54,530 --> 02:56:54,540
landing on a whole lot of the worlds
 

10099
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:56,929
landing on a whole lot of the worlds
well there's docking with with different

10100
02:56:56,929 --> 02:56:56,939
well there's docking with with different
 

10101
02:56:56,939 --> 02:56:58,910
well there's docking with with different
transport vehicles or the space station

10102
02:56:58,910 --> 02:56:58,920
transport vehicles or the space station
 

10103
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:01,250
transport vehicles or the space station
or it's Landing elsewhere I mean it's

10104
02:57:01,250 --> 02:57:01,260
or it's Landing elsewhere I mean it's
 

10105
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:03,710
or it's Landing elsewhere I mean it's
it's it it really really is incredible I

10106
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:03,720
it's it it really really is incredible I
 

10107
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:05,950
it's it it really really is incredible I
I think you mentioned since there's uh

10108
02:57:05,950 --> 02:57:05,960
I think you mentioned since there's uh
 

10109
02:57:05,960 --> 02:57:08,510
I think you mentioned since there's uh
there's artists there's filmmakers and

10110
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:08,520
there's artists there's filmmakers and
 

10111
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:09,650
there's artists there's filmmakers and
so on

10112
02:57:09,650 --> 02:57:09,660
so on
 

10113
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:12,230
so on
and you're all of those

10114
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:12,240
and you're all of those
 

10115
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:15,170
and you're all of those
on top of being a great athlete I don't

10116
02:57:15,170 --> 02:57:15,180
on top of being a great athlete I don't
 

10117
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:16,670
on top of being a great athlete I don't
know I'll just stop the running joke at

10118
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:16,680
know I'll just stop the running joke at
 

10119
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:20,030
know I'll just stop the running joke at
this point uh but is there have you uh

10120
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,040
this point uh but is there have you uh
 

10121
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:21,530
this point uh but is there have you uh
thought about

10122
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:21,540
thought about
 

10123
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:23,450
thought about
um just just in general like we've

10124
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:23,460
um just just in general like we've
 

10125
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:25,250
um just just in general like we've
offline talked about microphones and

10126
02:57:25,250 --> 02:57:25,260
offline talked about microphones and
 

10127
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:27,710
offline talked about microphones and
like all the different ways to film

10128
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:27,720
like all the different ways to film
 

10129
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:30,590
like all the different ways to film
space launch uh for the rocket launches

10130
02:57:30,590 --> 02:57:30,600
space launch uh for the rocket launches
 

10131
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:32,389
space launch uh for the rocket launches
uh have you thought about the different

10132
02:57:32,389 --> 02:57:32,399
uh have you thought about the different
 

10133
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:35,210
uh have you thought about the different
options of like how to capture

10134
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:35,220
options of like how to capture
 

10135
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:38,330
options of like how to capture
how to capture this uh uh have you have

10136
02:57:38,330 --> 02:57:38,340
how to capture this uh uh have you have
 

10137
02:57:38,340 --> 02:57:39,950
how to capture this uh uh have you have
the team have been like brainstorming

10138
02:57:39,950 --> 02:57:39,960
the team have been like brainstorming
 

10139
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:41,570
the team have been like brainstorming
and thinking about this do you

10140
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:41,580
and thinking about this do you
 

10141
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:43,250
and thinking about this do you
anticipate it being super challenging

10142
02:57:43,250 --> 02:57:43,260
anticipate it being super challenging
 

10143
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:45,110
anticipate it being super challenging
because there's so many opportunities to

10144
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:45,120
because there's so many opportunities to
 

10145
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:48,230
because there's so many opportunities to
sort of think of how to do this so one

10146
02:57:48,230 --> 02:57:48,240
sort of think of how to do this so one
 

10147
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:50,389
sort of think of how to do this so one
of the fun things to remember is that

10148
02:57:50,389 --> 02:57:50,399
of the fun things to remember is that
 

10149
02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:53,090
of the fun things to remember is that
Starship is huge like its internal

10150
02:57:53,090 --> 02:57:53,100
Starship is huge like its internal
 

10151
02:57:53,100 --> 02:57:55,429
Starship is huge like its internal
volume is uh the pressurized volume on

10152
02:57:55,429 --> 02:57:55,439
volume is uh the pressurized volume on
 

10153
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:57,830
volume is uh the pressurized volume on
Starship is is bigger than a 747s

10154
02:57:57,830 --> 02:57:57,840
Starship is is bigger than a 747s
 

10155
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:59,929
Starship is is bigger than a 747s
pressurized volume and it can take a

10156
02:57:59,929 --> 02:57:59,939
pressurized volume and it can take a
 

10157
02:57:59,939 --> 02:58:02,570
pressurized volume and it can take a
hundred metric tons to anywhere with

10158
02:58:02,570 --> 02:58:02,580
hundred metric tons to anywhere with
 

10159
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:05,750
hundred metric tons to anywhere with
enough refueling 100 so we have in

10160
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:05,760
enough refueling 100 so we have in
 

10161
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,849
enough refueling 100 so we have in
theory very little mass and volume

10162

flight missions ever you you think

10166
02:58:13,070 --> 02:58:13,080
flight missions ever you you think
 

10167
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:15,710
flight missions ever you you think
you're counting you know grams down to

10168
02:58:15,710 --> 02:58:15,720
you're counting you know grams down to
 

10169
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:18,530
you're counting you know grams down to
you know and just really can't risk you

10170
02:58:18,530 --> 02:58:18,540
you know and just really can't risk you
 

10171
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:21,769
you know and just really can't risk you
know you have very defined parameters on

10172
02:58:21,769 --> 02:58:21,779
know you have very defined parameters on
 

10173
02:58:21,779 --> 02:58:23,389
know you have very defined parameters on
on what you can and cannot do

10174
02:58:23,389 --> 02:58:23,399
on what you can and cannot do
 

10175
02:58:23,399 --> 02:58:25,910
on what you can and cannot do
we're going to likely have the luxury of

10176
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:25,920
we're going to likely have the luxury of
 

10177
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:27,469
we're going to likely have the luxury of
being able to film and capture this in a

10178
02:58:27,469 --> 02:58:27,479
being able to film and capture this in a
 

10179
02:58:27,479 --> 02:58:28,490
being able to film and capture this in a
way that's just never been done before

10180
02:58:28,490 --> 02:58:28,500
way that's just never been done before
 

10181
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:32,269
way that's just never been done before
you know we won't be inhibited by mass

10182
02:58:32,269 --> 02:58:32,279
you know we won't be inhibited by mass
 

10183
02:58:32,279 --> 02:58:34,849
you know we won't be inhibited by mass
and volume constraints like prior yeah

10184
02:58:34,849 --> 02:58:34,859
and volume constraints like prior yeah
 

10185
02:58:34,859 --> 02:58:35,929
and volume constraints like prior yeah
so

10186
02:58:35,929 --> 02:58:35,939
so
 

10187
02:58:35,939 --> 02:58:38,630
so
all that said and done I'm hoping that

10188
02:58:38,630 --> 02:58:38,640
all that said and done I'm hoping that
 

10189
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:40,610
all that said and done I'm hoping that
we'll be able to just arm ourselves to

10190
02:58:40,610 --> 02:58:40,620
we'll be able to just arm ourselves to
 

10191
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:42,710
we'll be able to just arm ourselves to
the teeth with the absolute best cameras

10192
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:42,720
the teeth with the absolute best cameras
 

10193
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:45,170
the teeth with the absolute best cameras

know it's being built from the ground up
 

10205
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:58,250
know it's being built from the ground up
there's no reason why they can't

10206
02:58:58,250 --> 02:58:58,260
there's no reason why they can't
 

10207
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:00,170
there's no reason why they can't
put infrastructure in for cameras that

put infrastructure in for cameras that
 

10209
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:02,630
put infrastructure in for cameras that
are just housed in the vehicle you know

10210
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:02,640
are just housed in the vehicle you know
 

10211
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,190
are just housed in the vehicle you know
um these are talks that I'm excited to

things I'd love to do I'm going to be
 

10217
02:59:08,580 --> 02:59:10,250
things I'd love to do I'm going to be
pushing really hard to actually try live

10223
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:17,030
from inside during the launch
during the launch live stream from the

10224
02:59:17,030 --> 02:59:17,040
during the launch live stream from the
 

10225
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,370
during the launch live stream from the
inside that would be incredible wouldn't

10226
02:59:19,370 --> 02:59:19,380
inside that would be incredible wouldn't
 

10227
02:59:19,380 --> 02:59:20,809

it's possible to pull off that's really

10230
02:59:23,150 --> 02:59:23,160
it's possible to pull off that's really
 

10231

really incredible now there is the magic
 

10233
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:26,690
really incredible now there is the magic
to the live stream because like that's

10234
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:26,700
to the live stream because like that's
 

10235
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:29,090
to the live stream because like that's
real that's right there that would the

10236
02:59:29,090 --> 02:59:29,100
real that's right there that would the
 

10237
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:30,769
real that's right there that would the
world would tune in that would be truly

10238
02:59:30,769 --> 02:59:30,779
world would tune in that would be truly
 

10239
02:59:30,779 --> 02:59:33,290

aren't doing it of course NASA and other
 

10245
02:59:37,319 --> 02:59:39,349

um it's it's obviously I will have to
see a lot of successful launches and

have to have a lot of
 

10331
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:17,030
have to have a lot of
confidence and in the engineering the

of the rocket in milliseconds and pull
 

10357
03:01:41,819 --> 03:01:43,190
of the rocket in milliseconds and pull
it safely away get it far enough away

that it can pull the parachutes and
 

10361
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:47,030
that it can pull the parachutes and

um Starship by all iterations I've ever

10364
03:01:49,910 --> 03:01:49,920
um Starship by all iterations I've ever
 

10365
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,490
um Starship by all iterations I've ever
seen does not have that the space

seen does not have that the space
 

10367
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:53,990

shuttle also did not have that so it's

10368
03:01:53,990 --> 03:01:54,000
shuttle also did not have that so it's
 

10369
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,330
shuttle also did not have that so it's
not absurd to not have an abort system

10370
03:01:56,330 --> 03:01:56,340
not absurd to not have an abort system

I've probably done things that are a lot

10390
03:02:21,830 --> 03:02:21,840
I've probably done things that are a lot

I've probably done things that are a lot
riskier I have race motorcycles drag

10392
03:02:23,870 --> 03:02:23,880
riskier I have race motorcycles drag
 

10393
03:02:23,880 --> 03:02:25,610
riskier I have race motorcycles drag
race motorcycles and you know ridden

10394
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:25,620
race motorcycles and you know ridden
 

10395
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:27,290
race motorcycles and you know ridden
like an absolute jerk on the streets on

03:02:27,290 --> 03:02:27,300
like an absolute jerk on the streets on
 

10397
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:28,730
like an absolute jerk on the streets on
a motorcycle I'm sure I've had a higher

10398
03:02:28,730 --> 03:02:28,740
a motorcycle I'm sure I've had a higher
 

10399
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:32,150
a motorcycle I'm sure I've had a higher
than a 98.5 percent survival rate or

10400
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:32,160
than a 98.5 percent survival rate or
 

10401
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:34,550
than a 98.5 percent survival rate or
lower than that I mean at some point

10402
03:02:34,550 --> 03:02:34,560
lower than that I mean at some point
 

10403
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:35,630
lower than that I mean at some point
um

10404
03:02:35,630 --> 03:02:35,640
um
 

10405
03:02:35,640 --> 03:02:38,090
um
so it's a you know yes it's it's risky

10406
03:02:38,090 --> 03:02:38,100
so it's a you know yes it's it's risky
 

10407
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:39,710
so it's a you know yes it's it's risky
it's scary

10408
03:02:39,710 --> 03:02:39,720
it's scary
 

10409
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:41,450
it's scary
and um

10410
03:02:41,450 --> 03:02:41,460
and um
 

10411
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:43,610
and um
I think about it a lot a lot it

10412
03:02:43,610 --> 03:02:43,620
I think about it a lot a lot it
 

10413
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:45,530
I think about it a lot a lot it
definitely is one of those things that I

10414
03:02:45,530 --> 03:02:45,540
definitely is one of those things that I
 

10415
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:48,170
definitely is one of those things that I
you know I I will have to see and I'm

10416
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:48,180
you know I I will have to see and I'm
 

10417
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:50,090
you know I I will have to see and I'm
I'm in no hurry for this to happen

10418
03:02:50,090 --> 03:02:50,100
I'm in no hurry for this to happen
 

10419
03:02:50,100 --> 03:02:51,889
I'm in no hurry for this to happen
either you know personally I'm in no

10420
03:02:51,889 --> 03:02:51,899
either you know personally I'm in no
 

10421
03:02:51,899 --> 03:02:53,929
either you know personally I'm in no
hurry because it's like I would rather

10422
03:02:53,929 --> 03:02:53,939
hurry because it's like I would rather
 

10423
03:02:53,939 --> 03:02:56,030
hurry because it's like I would rather
see this thing be developed and iterated

10424
03:02:56,030 --> 03:02:56,040
see this thing be developed and iterated
 

10425
03:02:56,040 --> 03:02:59,269
see this thing be developed and iterated
and see 10 you know or I was gonna say

10426
03:02:59,269 --> 03:02:59,279
and see 10 you know or I was gonna say
 

10427
03:02:59,279 --> 03:03:01,250
and see 10 you know or I was gonna say
ten dozen but I'd be happy with a dozen

10428
03:03:01,250 --> 03:03:01,260
ten dozen but I'd be happy with a dozen
 

10429
03:03:01,260 --> 03:03:03,530
ten dozen but I'd be happy with a dozen
fully successful like oh we've got this

10430
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:03,540
fully successful like oh we've got this
 

10431
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:05,809
fully successful like oh we've got this
thing totally nailed down uh you know

10432
03:03:05,809 --> 03:03:05,819
thing totally nailed down uh you know
 

10433
03:03:05,819 --> 03:03:07,550
thing totally nailed down uh you know
before I get on it

10434
03:03:07,550 --> 03:03:07,560
before I get on it
 

10435
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:10,010
before I get on it
but and that that likely is the reality

10436
03:03:10,010 --> 03:03:10,020
but and that that likely is the reality
 

10437
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:11,750
but and that that likely is the reality
there will likely be a dozen or two or

10438
03:03:11,750 --> 03:03:11,760
there will likely be a dozen or two or
 

10439
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:13,610
there will likely be a dozen or two or
three launches because just even to get

10440
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:13,620
three launches because just even to get
 

10441
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:14,929
three launches because just even to get
to the moon on Starship they have to

10442
03:03:14,929 --> 03:03:14,939
to the moon on Starship they have to
 

10443
03:03:14,939 --> 03:03:17,269
to the moon on Starship they have to
refuel it in orbit

10444
03:03:17,269 --> 03:03:17,279
refuel it in orbit
 

10445
03:03:17,279 --> 03:03:19,309
refuel it in orbit
um so it will arrive get to Earth orbit

10446
03:03:19,309 --> 03:03:19,319
um so it will arrive get to Earth orbit
 

10447
03:03:19,319 --> 03:03:20,990
um so it will arrive get to Earth orbit
basically empty and out of fuel so I'll

10448
03:03:20,990 --> 03:03:21,000
basically empty and out of fuel so I'll
 

10449
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,530
basically empty and out of fuel so I'll
have to dock with a fuel Depot

10450
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:23,540
have to dock with a fuel Depot
 

10451
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:25,670
have to dock with a fuel Depot
and then go to the Moon

10452
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:25,680
and then go to the Moon
 

10453
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:27,050
and then go to the Moon
so

10454
03:03:27,050 --> 03:03:27,060
so
 

10455
03:03:27,060 --> 03:03:28,790
so
just even get that full you know we're

10456
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:28,800
just even get that full you know we're
 

10457
03:03:28,800 --> 03:03:31,130
just even get that full you know we're
already talking about you know a handful

10458
03:03:31,130 --> 03:03:31,140
already talking about you know a handful
 

10459
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:32,990
already talking about you know a handful
of launches so there will be a lot of

10460
03:03:32,990 --> 03:03:33,000
of launches so there will be a lot of
 

10461
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,809
of launches so there will be a lot of
launches before we fly would they do a

10462
03:03:35,809 --> 03:03:35,819
launches before we fly would they do a
 

10463
03:03:35,819 --> 03:03:39,349
launches before we fly would they do a
test flight without humans on board that

10464
03:03:39,349 --> 03:03:39,359
test flight without humans on board that
 

10465
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:41,929
test flight without humans on board that
goes to the moon or no I'm not sure I'm

10466
03:03:41,929 --> 03:03:41,939
goes to the moon or no I'm not sure I'm
 

10467
03:03:41,939 --> 03:03:43,190
goes to the moon or no I'm not sure I'm
not sure if they'll do that exact flight

10468
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
not sure if they'll do that exact flight
 

10469
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,750
not sure if they'll do that exact flight
profile but by then they will have

10470
03:03:44,750 --> 03:03:44,760
profile but by then they will have
 

10471
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:47,690
profile but by then they will have
already flown most likely the Artemis 3

10472
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:47,700
already flown most likely the Artemis 3
 

10473
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:50,389
already flown most likely the Artemis 3
program will have flown a Starship

10474
03:03:50,389 --> 03:03:50,399
program will have flown a Starship
 

10475
03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:52,670
program will have flown a Starship
variant to the Moon that lands on the

10476
03:03:52,670 --> 03:03:52,680
variant to the Moon that lands on the
 

10477
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:53,990
variant to the Moon that lands on the
moon

10478
03:03:53,990 --> 03:03:54,000
moon
 

10479
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:54,889
moon
um

10480
03:03:54,889 --> 03:03:54,899
um
 

10481
03:03:54,899 --> 03:03:56,929
um
so doing at that point you're pretty

10482
03:03:56,929 --> 03:03:56,939
so doing at that point you're pretty
 

10483
03:03:56,939 --> 03:03:58,670
so doing at that point you're pretty
much I would like them to test the heat

10484
03:03:58,670 --> 03:03:58,680
much I would like them to test the heat
 

10485
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:00,110
much I would like them to test the heat
shield of that entry velocity though

10486
03:04:00,110 --> 03:04:00,120
shield of that entry velocity though
 

10487
03:04:00,120 --> 03:04:02,450
shield of that entry velocity though
because it is uh you know it takes

10488
03:04:02,450 --> 03:04:02,460
because it is uh you know it takes
 

10489
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:06,469
because it is uh you know it takes
another it's about 30 percent faster to

10490
03:04:06,469 --> 03:04:06,479
another it's about 30 percent faster to
 

10491
03:04:06,479 --> 03:04:08,030
another it's about 30 percent faster to
get like if you go 30 faster than the

10492
03:04:08,030 --> 03:04:08,040
get like if you go 30 faster than the
 

10493
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:09,590
get like if you go 30 faster than the
lower third to get out to a translunar

10494
03:04:09,590 --> 03:04:09,600
lower third to get out to a translunar
 

10495
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:11,150
lower third to get out to a translunar
injection and although that only sounds

10496
03:04:11,150 --> 03:04:11,160
injection and although that only sounds
 

10497
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:14,510
injection and although that only sounds
like oh 30 faster it's you know the the

10498
03:04:14,510 --> 03:04:14,520
like oh 30 faster it's you know the the
 

10499
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:16,429
like oh 30 faster it's you know the the
re-entry heating experienced by a

10500
03:04:16,429 --> 03:04:16,439
re-entry heating experienced by a
 

10501
03:04:16,439 --> 03:04:19,730
re-entry heating experienced by a
vehicle goes up by velocity uh cubed not

10502
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:19,740
vehicle goes up by velocity uh cubed not
 

10503
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:21,830
vehicle goes up by velocity uh cubed not
squared so and not even not linear so

10504
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:21,840
squared so and not even not linear so
 

10505
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:22,790
squared so and not even not linear so
it's not like if you go twice as fast

10506
03:04:22,790 --> 03:04:22,800
it's not like if you go twice as fast
 

10507
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:24,590
it's not like if you go twice as fast
you get you see twice as much you know

10508
03:04:24,590 --> 03:04:24,600
you get you see twice as much you know
 

10509
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:27,469
you get you see twice as much you know
30 faster 30 more heat it's and it's not

10510
03:04:27,469 --> 03:04:27,479
30 faster 30 more heat it's and it's not
 

10511
03:04:27,479 --> 03:04:29,450
30 faster 30 more heat it's and it's not
squared it's not go twice as fast get

10512
03:04:29,450 --> 03:04:29,460
squared it's not go twice as fast get
 

10513
03:04:29,460 --> 03:04:30,950
squared it's not go twice as fast get
four times as much heat let's go twice

10514
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:30,960
four times as much heat let's go twice
 

10515
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:34,010
four times as much heat let's go twice
as fast get eight times as much heat on

10516
03:04:34,010 --> 03:04:34,020
as fast get eight times as much heat on
 

10517
03:04:34,020 --> 03:04:37,130
as fast get eight times as much heat on
re-entry so 30 faster on re-entry is

10518
03:04:37,130 --> 03:04:37,140
re-entry so 30 faster on re-entry is
 

10519
03:04:37,140 --> 03:04:40,010
re-entry so 30 faster on re-entry is
actually a really really big deal

10520
03:04:40,010 --> 03:04:40,020
actually a really really big deal
 

10521
03:04:40,020 --> 03:04:42,170
actually a really really big deal
so I would love to see that because you

10522
03:04:42,170 --> 03:04:42,180
so I would love to see that because you
 

10523
03:04:42,180 --> 03:04:43,010
so I would love to see that because you
know there's certain things that I would

10524
03:04:43,010 --> 03:04:43,020
know there's certain things that I would
 

10525
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:44,269
know there's certain things that I would
love to see Milestones that I would love

10526
03:04:44,269 --> 03:04:44,279
love to see Milestones that I would love
 

10527
03:04:44,279 --> 03:04:46,429
love to see Milestones that I would love
to see tested out and proven

10528
03:04:46,429 --> 03:04:46,439
to see tested out and proven
 

10529
03:04:46,439 --> 03:04:48,170
to see tested out and proven
um before I get on board but

10530
03:04:48,170 --> 03:04:48,180
um before I get on board but
 

10531
03:04:48,180 --> 03:04:49,429
um before I get on board but
at the end of the day I really do

10532
03:04:49,429 --> 03:04:49,439
at the end of the day I really do
 

10533
03:04:49,439 --> 03:04:52,250
at the end of the day I really do
believe that um just like Falcon 9 and

10534
03:04:52,250 --> 03:04:52,260
believe that um just like Falcon 9 and
 

10535
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:53,570
believe that um just like Falcon 9 and
the success of that that they're going

10536
03:04:53,570 --> 03:04:53,580
the success of that that they're going
 

10537
03:04:53,580 --> 03:04:56,750
the success of that that they're going
to push it and get all the The Kinks out

10538
03:04:56,750 --> 03:04:56,760
to push it and get all the The Kinks out
 

10539
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:58,490
to push it and get all the The Kinks out
well before anyone's on top of it

10540
03:04:58,490 --> 03:04:58,500
well before anyone's on top of it
 

10541
03:04:58,500 --> 03:05:00,710
well before anyone's on top of it
nowadays Falcon 9 and dragon is you know

10542
03:05:00,710 --> 03:05:00,720
nowadays Falcon 9 and dragon is you know
 

10543
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:02,090
nowadays Falcon 9 and dragon is you know
arguably the

10544

03:05:17,330 --> 03:05:17,340
gotten a chance to think about death is
 

10557
03:05:17,340 --> 03:05:18,650
gotten a chance to think about death is
one of the

10558

most of my adult life had dreams of
 

10581
03:05:44,100 --> 03:05:47,330
most of my adult life had dreams of
falling and hitting the ground and it

10582
03:05:47,330 --> 03:05:47,340
falling and hitting the ground and it
 

10583
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:48,769
falling and hitting the ground and it
just all you get a ring in your ears it

just all you get a ring in your ears it
 

10585
03:05:48,779 --> 03:05:50,210
just all you get a ring in your ears it
all goes black and in my head I go oh

10586
03:05:50,210 --> 03:05:50,220
all goes black and in my head I go oh
 

10587
03:05:50,220 --> 03:05:52,190
all goes black and in my head I go oh
[\h__\h] that was it have you seen a

10588
03:05:52,190 --> 03:05:52,200
[\h__\h] that was it have you seen a
 

10589

[\h__\h] that was it have you seen a
therapist about this or no I wonder what

10590
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:54,960
therapist about this or no I wonder what
 

10591
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:57,349
therapist about this or no I wonder what
it means

10592
03:05:57,349 --> 03:05:57,359

 

10593
03:05:57,359 --> 03:05:59,150

I'm sure there's a Freudian

10594
03:05:59,150 --> 03:05:59,160
I'm sure there's a Freudian
 

10595
03:05:59,160 --> 03:06:00,730
I'm sure there's a Freudian
interpretation

10596
03:06:00,730 --> 03:06:00,740
interpretation
 

10597
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:03,230
interpretation
but that I'm going to also apply to my

10598
03:06:03,230 --> 03:06:03,240
but that I'm going to also apply to my
 

10599
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:06,110
but that I'm going to also apply to my
dating life no the joke is it's the

10600
03:06:06,110 --> 03:06:06,120
dating life no the joke is it's the
 

10601
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:09,110
dating life no the joke is it's the
running joke continues okay so um I mean

10602
03:06:09,110 --> 03:06:09,120
running joke continues okay so um I mean
 

10603
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:10,190
running joke continues okay so um I mean
it's

10604
03:06:10,190 --> 03:06:10,200
it's
 

10605
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:13,190
it's
um it's fascinating in general as I hope

10606
03:06:13,190 --> 03:06:13,200
um it's fascinating in general as I hope
 

10607
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:14,630
um it's fascinating in general as I hope
we'll talk about in the early days of

10608
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:14,640
we'll talk about in the early days of
 

10609
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:17,690
we'll talk about in the early days of
space flight that there is there is a

10610
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:17,700
space flight that there is there is a
 

10611
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:20,450
space flight that there is there is a
the task of reaching out to the stars is

10612
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:20,460
the task of reaching out to the stars is
 

10613
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:22,730
the task of reaching out to the stars is
a fundamentally risky one you have to

10614
03:06:22,730 --> 03:06:22,740
a fundamentally risky one you have to
 

10615
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:24,530
a fundamentally risky one you have to
take risk and of course there's really

10616
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:24,540
take risk and of course there's really
 

10617
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:26,690
take risk and of course there's really
rigorous safety precautions and so on

10618
03:06:26,690 --> 03:06:26,700
rigorous safety precautions and so on
 

10619
03:06:26,700 --> 03:06:28,670
rigorous safety precautions and so on
but it still is still a risk well and I

10620
03:06:28,670 --> 03:06:28,680
but it still is still a risk well and I
 

10621
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:31,250
but it still is still a risk well and I
think like most people that that for me

10622
03:06:31,250 --> 03:06:31,260
think like most people that that for me
 

10623
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:33,530
think like most people that that for me
the idea of dying isn't so much about

10624
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:33,540
the idea of dying isn't so much about
 

10625

whole journey with these camera thing
I'm trying to figure stuff out is like

10926
03:12:09,769 --> 03:12:09,779
I'm trying to figure stuff out is like
 

10927
03:12:09,779 --> 03:12:12,469

03:12:14,330 --> 03:12:14,340
problem is it's like a fixed Zoom thing
 

10931
03:12:14,340 --> 03:12:16,130
problem is it's like a fixed Zoom thing
yep it's like why

10932
03:12:16,130 --> 03:12:16,140
yep it's like why
 

10933
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:17,929
yep it's like why
because I remember I was going to like

10934

Ukraine
 

10937
03:12:19,560 --> 03:12:22,730
Ukraine
and thinking it's similar like uh

10938
03:12:22,730 --> 03:12:22,740
and thinking it's similar like uh
 

10939
03:12:22,740 --> 03:12:24,769
and thinking it's similar like uh
um yeah very similar to space flight but

10940
03:12:24,769 --> 03:12:24,779
um yeah very similar to space flight but
 

10941
03:12:24,779 --> 03:12:26,510
um yeah very similar to space flight but
you're very constrained because you're

10942
03:12:26,510 --> 03:12:26,520
you're very constrained because you're

figure out like how do you film this
what's what's robust

10956
03:12:39,110 --> 03:12:39,120
what's what's robust
 

10957
03:12:39,120 --> 03:12:40,910
what's what's robust
um what gives you like a good image

10958

um what gives you like a good image
versus a flexibility versus the weight

10960
03:12:42,950 --> 03:12:42,960
versus a flexibility versus the weight
 

10961
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:44,870
versus a flexibility versus the weight
his weight is important there you have

10962
03:12:44,870 --> 03:12:44,880
his weight is important there you have
 

10963
03:12:44,880 --> 03:12:46,910
his weight is important there you have
to think about like can you really bring

there's a nice thing just because we've
 

10981
03:13:03,779 --> 03:13:05,210
there's a nice thing just because we've
been talking about with The Beginner's

10982
03:13:05,210 --> 03:13:05,220
been talking about with The Beginner's
 

10983

you can get so much equipment and I've
interacted it because I've been trying

11004

both your exposure but also your depth
 

11103
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:21,590
both your exposure but also your depth
of field higher shutter speed affects

11104

both your exposure your depth of field
 

11107
03:15:23,220 --> 03:15:25,550
both your exposure your depth of field
how the you know of medium format camera

11108
03:15:25,550 --> 03:15:25,560
how the you know of medium format camera

11864
03:28:03,469 --> 03:28:03,479
um my interface for stuff that I've
 

11865
03:28:03,479 --> 03:28:05,690
um my interface for stuff that I've
created because I just see it having a

11866
03:28:05,690 --> 03:28:05,700
created because I just see it having a
 

11867

created because I just see it having a
negative effect on your mind but even

03:28:07,550 --> 03:28:07,560
negative effect on your mind but even
 

11869

the the history of Soviet Rockets comes
to mind and we'll talk about that in a

11876
03:28:19,729 --> 03:28:19,739
to mind and we'll talk about that in a
 

11877
03:28:19,739 --> 03:28:21,650
to mind and we'll talk about that in a
second but uh it's called people should

11878

check it out uh the entire Soviet rocket
engine family tree so that's something

11882
03:28:26,150 --> 03:28:26,160
engine family tree so that's something
 

11883
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:28,969
engine family tree so that's something
you've researched for two years yeah

11884
03:28:28,969 --> 03:28:28,979
you've researched for two years yeah

11891
03:28:34,319 --> 03:28:35,570
a lot there's a long journey it's in I
think about like an hour and a half

11892
03:28:35,570 --> 03:28:35,580
think about like an hour and a half
 

11893
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:38,269
think about like an hour and a half
video

11894
03:28:38,269 --> 03:28:38,279

 

11895
03:28:38,279 --> 03:28:40,790

is there like
 

11899
03:28:43,140 --> 03:28:45,410
is there like
how difficult is that to put so much of

11900
03:28:45,410 --> 03:28:45,420
how difficult is that to put so much of
 

11901
03:28:45,420 --> 03:28:47,870
how difficult is that to put so much of
yourself into a video and it maybe not

11902
03:28:47,870 --> 03:28:47,880
yourself into a video and it maybe not
 

11903
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:52,190
yourself into a video and it maybe not
do so well yeah that that's the that's

11904
03:28:52,190 --> 03:28:52,200
do so well yeah that that's the that's
 

11905
03:28:52,200 --> 03:28:53,750
do so well yeah that that's the that's
the struggle for sure honestly

11906
03:28:53,750 --> 03:28:53,760
the struggle for sure honestly
 

11907
03:28:53,760 --> 03:28:57,110
the struggle for sure honestly
especially as like as we grow I I try to

make better and better videos which
 

11911
03:28:58,500 --> 03:29:00,530
make better and better videos which
means hiring more and more people to do

11912
03:29:00,530 --> 03:29:00,540
means hiring more and more people to do
 

11913
03:29:00,540 --> 03:29:02,330
means hiring more and more people to do
you know higher end animations and spend

11914
03:29:02,330 --> 03:29:02,340
you know higher end animations and spend
 

11915
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:04,370
you know higher end animations and spend
more time editing and shooting and

11916
03:29:04,370 --> 03:29:04,380
more time editing and shooting and
 

11917
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:05,929
more time editing and shooting and
scripting and just

11918
03:29:05,929 --> 03:29:05,939
scripting and just
 

11919
03:29:05,939 --> 03:29:07,490
scripting and just
at but at the end of the day like it

11920
03:29:07,490 --> 03:29:07,500
at but at the end of the day like it
 

11921
03:29:07,500 --> 03:29:10,550
at but at the end of the day like it
still can't be just losing money and I

11922
03:29:10,550 --> 03:29:10,560
still can't be just losing money and I
 

11923
03:29:10,560 --> 03:29:12,830
still can't be just losing money and I
have videos that definitely lose a lot

11924
03:29:12,830 --> 03:29:12,840
have videos that definitely lose a lot
 

11925
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:15,349
have videos that definitely lose a lot
of money because I you know hire 3D

11926
03:29:15,349 --> 03:29:15,359
of money because I you know hire 3D
 

11927
03:29:15,359 --> 03:29:17,389
of money because I you know hire 3D
artists and stuff and

11928
03:29:17,389 --> 03:29:17,399
artists and stuff and
 

11929
03:29:17,399 --> 03:29:20,809
artists and stuff and
um and I I was so certain the the Soviet

11930
03:29:20,809 --> 03:29:20,819
um and I I was so certain the the Soviet
 

11931
03:29:20,819 --> 03:29:22,370
um and I I was so certain the the Soviet
rocket engine video I thought was just

11932
03:29:22,370 --> 03:29:22,380
rocket engine video I thought was just
 

11933
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:24,349
rocket engine video I thought was just
purely going to be a passion project I

11934
03:29:24,349 --> 03:29:24,359
purely going to be a passion project I
 

11935
03:29:24,359 --> 03:29:25,969
purely going to be a passion project I
did I honestly was like if it ever

11936
03:29:25,969 --> 03:29:25,979
did I honestly was like if it ever
 

11937
03:29:25,979 --> 03:29:27,830
did I honestly was like if it ever
crosses a million I it's a home run

11938
03:29:27,830 --> 03:29:27,840
crosses a million I it's a home run
 

11939
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:31,070
crosses a million I it's a home run
because it cost like a couple million I

11940
03:29:31,070 --> 03:29:31,080
because it cost like a couple million I
 

11941
03:29:31,080 --> 03:29:33,110
because it cost like a couple million I
think it's a little over two wow which

03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:12,229
like can I continue to do it at this
quality and at this level if it's losing

12154
03:33:12,229 --> 03:33:12,239
quality and at this level if it's losing
 

12155
03:33:12,239 --> 03:33:14,210
quality and at this level if it's losing
money you know what I mean so it's there

is a trade-off and I am kind of having
to navigate that but but you have sort

12160
03:33:19,130 --> 03:33:19,140
to navigate that but but you have sort
 

12161
03:33:19,140 --> 03:33:20,510
to navigate that but but you have sort
of the depth

12162
03:33:20,510 --> 03:33:20,520
of the depth
 

12163
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:23,330
of the depth
uh of the impact you have

12164
03:33:23,330 --> 03:33:23,340
uh of the impact you have
 

12165
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:25,910
uh of the impact you have
is uh is a is the thing that YouTube

12166
03:33:25,910 --> 03:33:25,920
is uh is a is the thing that YouTube
 

12167
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:28,370
is uh is a is the thing that YouTube
can't give you numbers on but it's it's

12168
03:33:28,370 --> 03:33:28,380
can't give you numbers on but it's it's
 

12169
03:33:28,380 --> 03:33:29,929
can't give you numbers on but it's it's
a really important thing to sort of

12170
03:33:29,929 --> 03:33:29,939
a really important thing to sort of
 

12171
03:33:29,939 --> 03:33:32,030
a really important thing to sort of
remember that it's really not just about

12172
03:33:32,030 --> 03:33:32,040
remember that it's really not just about
 

12173
03:33:32,040 --> 03:33:34,849
remember that it's really not just about
the YouTube numbers or it's off for for

12174
03:33:34,849 --> 03:33:34,859
the YouTube numbers or it's off for for
 

12175
03:33:34,859 --> 03:33:37,929
the YouTube numbers or it's off for for
people like you they're basically

12176
03:33:37,929 --> 03:33:37,939
people like you they're basically
 

12177
03:33:37,939 --> 03:33:41,269
people like you they're basically
educating and revealing the Brilliance

12178
03:33:41,269 --> 03:33:41,279
educating and revealing the Brilliance
 

12179
03:33:41,279 --> 03:33:46,550
educating and revealing the Brilliance
in a technology that uh will make humans

12180
03:33:46,550 --> 03:33:46,560
in a technology that uh will make humans
 

12181
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:48,469
in a technology that uh will make humans
and multi-planetary species and give

12182
03:33:48,469 --> 03:33:48,479
and multi-planetary species and give
 

12183
03:33:48,479 --> 03:33:51,710
and multi-planetary species and give
hope to millions of young minds that

12184
03:33:51,710 --> 03:33:51,720
hope to millions of young minds that
 

12185
03:33:51,720 --> 03:33:53,630
hope to millions of young minds that
will build that future I mean that's

12186
03:33:53,630 --> 03:33:53,640
will build that future I mean that's
 

12187
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:57,250
will build that future I mean that's
immeasurable that's not just the views

12188
03:33:57,250 --> 03:33:57,260
immeasurable that's not just the views
 

12189
03:33:57,260 --> 03:34:00,410
immeasurable that's not just the views
but you know it's um that's really

12190
03:34:00,410 --> 03:34:00,420
but you know it's um that's really
 

12191
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:02,389
but you know it's um that's really
important to sort of remember

12192
03:34:02,389 --> 03:34:02,399
important to sort of remember
 

12193
03:34:02,399 --> 03:34:04,309
important to sort of remember
as you're creating it that's something I

12194
03:34:04,309 --> 03:34:04,319
as you're creating it that's something I
 

12195
03:34:04,319 --> 03:34:06,650
as you're creating it that's something I
understand I I I try to think about it

12196
03:34:06,650 --> 03:34:06,660
understand I I I try to think about it
 

12197
03:34:06,660 --> 03:34:08,450
understand I I I try to think about it
as well so like views

12198
03:34:08,450 --> 03:34:08,460
as well so like views
 

12199
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:10,910
as well so like views
um yeah and that and that becomes more

12200
03:34:10,910 --> 03:34:10,920
um yeah and that and that becomes more
 

12201
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:13,610
um yeah and that and that becomes more
don't matter I realize that more and

12202
03:34:13,610 --> 03:34:13,620
don't matter I realize that more and
 

12203
03:34:13,620 --> 03:34:15,229
don't matter I realize that more and
more like every day you know the the

12204
03:34:15,229 --> 03:34:15,239
more like every day you know the the
 

12205
03:34:15,239 --> 03:34:17,630
more like every day you know the the
more the channel matures the more I

12206
03:34:17,630 --> 03:34:17,640
more the channel matures the more I
 

12207
03:34:17,640 --> 03:34:19,490
more the channel matures the more I
realize the importance of it as an

12208
03:34:19,490 --> 03:34:19,500
realize the importance of it as an
 

12209
03:34:19,500 --> 03:34:21,650
realize the importance of it as an
overall mission as opposed to like you

12210
03:34:21,650 --> 03:34:21,660
overall mission as opposed to like you
 

12211
03:34:21,660 --> 03:34:22,969
overall mission as opposed to like you
know in the first year or two it's a rat

12212
03:34:22,969 --> 03:34:22,979
know in the first year or two it's a rat
 

12213
03:34:22,979 --> 03:34:26,150
know in the first year or two it's a rat
race of of growth and of popularity and

12214
03:34:26,150 --> 03:34:26,160
race of of growth and of popularity and
 

12215
03:34:26,160 --> 03:34:27,349
race of of growth and of popularity and
all that kind of stuff you know and you

12216
03:34:27,349 --> 03:34:27,359
all that kind of stuff you know and you
 

12217
03:34:27,359 --> 03:34:29,030
all that kind of stuff you know and you
feel that you feel that it's a driving

12218
03:34:29,030 --> 03:34:29,040
feel that you feel that it's a driving
 

12219
03:34:29,040 --> 03:34:31,070
feel that you feel that it's a driving
force these days not so much just

12220
03:34:31,070 --> 03:34:31,080
force these days not so much just
 

12221
03:34:31,080 --> 03:34:32,929
force these days not so much just
because that will wear you out very

12222
03:34:32,929 --> 03:34:32,939
because that will wear you out very
 

12223
03:34:32,939 --> 03:34:36,710
because that will wear you out very
quickly so back to the Soviet rocket the

12224
03:34:36,710 --> 03:34:36,720
quickly so back to the Soviet rocket the
 

12225
03:34:36,720 --> 03:34:38,990
quickly so back to the Soviet rocket the
epic video probably the most epically

12226
03:34:38,990 --> 03:34:39,000
epic video probably the most epically
 

12227
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:41,330
epic video probably the most epically
researched video you've done I mean it's

12228
03:34:41,330 --> 03:34:41,340
researched video you've done I mean it's
 

12229
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:43,969
researched video you've done I mean it's
like is it it's true it's truly an epic

12230
03:34:43,969 --> 03:34:43,979
like is it it's true it's truly an epic
 

12231
03:34:43,979 --> 03:34:48,050
like is it it's true it's truly an epic
video uh so what uh again called the

12232
03:34:48,050 --> 03:34:48,060
video uh so what uh again called the
 

12233
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:50,650
video uh so what uh again called the
entire Soviet rocket engine family tree

12234
03:34:50,650 --> 03:34:50,660
entire Soviet rocket engine family tree
 

12235
03:34:50,660 --> 03:34:53,870
entire Soviet rocket engine family tree
took you two years to research what are

12236
03:34:53,870 --> 03:34:53,880
took you two years to research what are
 

12237
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:55,670
took you two years to research what are
some fascinating things you've learned

12238
03:34:55,670 --> 03:34:55,680
some fascinating things you've learned
 

12239
03:34:55,680 --> 03:34:58,929
some fascinating things you've learned
about the history of Rocket engines

12240
03:34:58,929 --> 03:34:58,939
about the history of Rocket engines
 

12241
03:34:58,939 --> 03:35:02,150
about the history of Rocket engines
in the Soviet Union and in general

12242
03:35:02,150 --> 03:35:02,160
in the Soviet Union and in general
 

12243
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:03,469
in the Soviet Union and in general
um through a process of making that

12244
03:35:03,469 --> 03:35:03,479
um through a process of making that
 

12245
03:35:03,479 --> 03:35:05,090
um through a process of making that
video

12246
03:35:05,090 --> 03:35:05,100
video
 

12247
03:35:05,100 --> 03:35:08,210
video
the the coolest thing to me is

12248
03:35:08,210 --> 03:35:08,220
the the coolest thing to me is
 

12249
03:35:08,220 --> 03:35:11,750
the the coolest thing to me is
how it's this weird blend for the Soviet

12250
03:35:11,750 --> 03:35:11,760
how it's this weird blend for the Soviet
 

12251
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:13,670
how it's this weird blend for the Soviet
Union went through a

12252
03:35:13,670 --> 03:35:13,680
Union went through a
 

12253
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:16,910
Union went through a
an insane iteration process and made so

12254
03:35:16,910 --> 03:35:16,920
an insane iteration process and made so
 

12255
03:35:16,920 --> 03:35:18,889
an insane iteration process and made so
many engines like I didn't even touch

12256
03:35:18,889 --> 03:35:18,899
many engines like I didn't even touch
 

12257
03:35:18,899 --> 03:35:21,590
many engines like I didn't even touch
you know any like maneuvering thrusters

12258
03:35:21,590 --> 03:35:21,600
you know any like maneuvering thrusters
 

12259
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:23,269
you know any like maneuvering thrusters
or missile engines like I only really

12260
03:35:23,269 --> 03:35:23,279
or missile engines like I only really
 

12261
03:35:23,279 --> 03:35:25,130
or missile engines like I only really
dealt with main propulsion engines on

12262
03:35:25,130 --> 03:35:25,140
dealt with main propulsion engines on
 

12263
03:35:25,140 --> 03:35:27,110
dealt with main propulsion engines on
orbital rockets and they're still way

12264
03:35:27,110 --> 03:35:27,120
orbital rockets and they're still way
 

12265
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:28,429
orbital rockets and they're still way
too many to talk about I mean it's still

12266
03:35:28,429 --> 03:35:28,439
too many to talk about I mean it's still
 

12267
03:35:28,439 --> 03:35:30,290
too many to talk about I mean it's still
dozens and dozens of engines

12268
03:35:30,290 --> 03:35:30,300
dozens and dozens of engines
 

12269
03:35:30,300 --> 03:35:32,510
dozens and dozens of engines
and I I could have gone deeper into this

12270
03:35:32,510 --> 03:35:32,520
and I I could have gone deeper into this
 

12271
03:35:32,520 --> 03:35:34,309
and I I could have gone deeper into this
which is hilarious

12272
03:35:34,309 --> 03:35:34,319
which is hilarious
 

12273
03:35:34,319 --> 03:35:36,650
which is hilarious
um they iterated so much made a new

12274
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:36,660
um they iterated so much made a new
 

12275
03:35:36,660 --> 03:35:39,889
um they iterated so much made a new
engine for just at the drop of a hat

12276
03:35:39,889 --> 03:35:39,899
engine for just at the drop of a hat
 

12277
03:35:39,899 --> 03:35:42,530
engine for just at the drop of a hat
yet they still also like did Super

12278
03:35:42,530 --> 03:35:42,540
yet they still also like did Super
 

12279
03:35:42,540 --> 03:35:44,450
yet they still also like did Super
primitive things you know they they

12280
03:35:44,450 --> 03:35:44,460
primitive things you know they they
 

12281
03:35:44,460 --> 03:35:46,969
primitive things you know they they
physically are still today lighting the

12282
03:35:46,969 --> 03:35:46,979
physically are still today lighting the
 

12283
03:35:46,979 --> 03:35:48,530
physically are still today lighting the
main combustion chambers of the soyuz

12284
03:35:48,530 --> 03:35:48,540
main combustion chambers of the soyuz
 

12285
03:35:48,540 --> 03:35:50,929
main combustion chambers of the soyuz
engines of the rd-107 already 108 with

12286
03:35:50,929 --> 03:35:50,939
engines of the rd-107 already 108 with
 

12287
03:35:50,939 --> 03:35:52,550
engines of the rd-107 already 108 with
essentially matchsticks like they

12288
03:35:52,550 --> 03:35:52,560
essentially matchsticks like they
 

12289
03:35:52,560 --> 03:35:55,429
essentially matchsticks like they
literally stick a t-shaped thing up into

12290
03:35:55,429 --> 03:35:55,439
literally stick a t-shaped thing up into
 

12291
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:57,650
literally stick a t-shaped thing up into
the chamber and have a pyrotechnic in

12292
03:35:57,650 --> 03:35:57,660
the chamber and have a pyrotechnic in
 

12293
03:35:57,660 --> 03:36:00,410
the chamber and have a pyrotechnic in
the in it that ignites the actual

12294
03:36:00,410 --> 03:36:00,420
the in it that ignites the actual
 

12295
03:36:00,420 --> 03:36:02,030
the in it that ignites the actual
propellants in the combustion chamber

12296
03:36:02,030 --> 03:36:02,040
propellants in the combustion chamber
 

12297
03:36:02,040 --> 03:36:03,769
propellants in the combustion chamber
it's not the most elegant solution in

12298
03:36:03,769 --> 03:36:03,779
it's not the most elegant solution in
 

12299
03:36:03,779 --> 03:36:05,570
it's not the most elegant solution in
the world yeah they're still using that

12300
03:36:05,570 --> 03:36:05,580
the world yeah they're still using that
 

12301
03:36:05,580 --> 03:36:07,010
the world yeah they're still using that
so they went from like

12302
03:36:07,010 --> 03:36:07,020
so they went from like
 

12303
03:36:07,020 --> 03:36:09,590
so they went from like
the whole spectrum of like it's a

12304
03:36:09,590 --> 03:36:09,600
the whole spectrum of like it's a
 

12305
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:11,269
the whole spectrum of like it's a
mixture of like make it better faster

12306
03:36:11,269 --> 03:36:11,279
mixture of like make it better faster
 

12307
03:36:11,279 --> 03:36:13,309
mixture of like make it better faster
harder stronger gooder all the way

12308
03:36:13,309 --> 03:36:13,319
harder stronger gooder all the way
 

12309
03:36:13,319 --> 03:36:15,110
harder stronger gooder all the way
around to also if it ain't broke don't

12310
03:36:15,110 --> 03:36:15,120
around to also if it ain't broke don't
 

12311
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:18,229
around to also if it ain't broke don't
fix it it's like it employs all of the

12312
03:36:18,229 --> 03:36:18,239
fix it it's like it employs all of the
 

12313
03:36:18,239 --> 03:36:21,050
fix it it's like it employs all of the
above so it's like it's uh a lot of

12314
03:36:21,050 --> 03:36:21,060
above so it's like it's uh a lot of
 

12315
03:36:21,060 --> 03:36:22,790
above so it's like it's uh a lot of
innovation but also they use duct tape

12316
03:36:22,790 --> 03:36:22,800
innovation but also they use duct tape
 

12317
03:36:22,800 --> 03:36:25,370
innovation but also they use duct tape
but it's like all of it together yes

12318
03:36:25,370 --> 03:36:25,380
but it's like all of it together yes
 

12319
03:36:25,380 --> 03:36:28,070
but it's like all of it together yes
that's exactly like that's exactly the

12320
03:36:28,070 --> 03:36:28,080
that's exactly like that's exactly the
 

12321
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:29,809
that's exactly like that's exactly the
way to put it and and they did things

12322
03:36:29,809 --> 03:36:29,819
way to put it and and they did things
 

12323
03:36:29,819 --> 03:36:32,150
way to put it and and they did things
that are insane they developed a full

12324
03:36:32,150 --> 03:36:32,160
that are insane they developed a full
 

12325
03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:33,650
that are insane they developed a full
flow stage combustion cycle engine this

12326
03:36:33,650 --> 03:36:33,660
flow stage combustion cycle engine this
 

12327
03:36:33,660 --> 03:36:36,050
flow stage combustion cycle engine this
engine had been used I mean it would

12328
03:36:36,050 --> 03:36:36,060
engine had been used I mean it would
 

12329
03:36:36,060 --> 03:36:38,690
engine had been used I mean it would
have put the F it was same relative size

12330
03:36:38,690 --> 03:36:38,700
have put the F it was same relative size
 

12331
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:40,790
have put the F it was same relative size
as the F1 engine on the Saturn V like in

12332
03:36:40,790 --> 03:36:40,800
as the F1 engine on the Saturn V like in
 

12333
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:42,889
as the F1 engine on the Saturn V like in
that same category way up there of like

12334
03:36:42,889 --> 03:36:42,899
that same category way up there of like
 

12335
03:36:42,899 --> 03:36:45,530
that same category way up there of like
you know 6.7 uh like Mega Newtons of

12336
03:36:45,530 --> 03:36:45,540
you know 6.7 uh like Mega Newtons of
 

12337
03:36:45,540 --> 03:36:47,450
you know 6.7 uh like Mega Newtons of
thrust or something around and then the

12338
03:36:47,450 --> 03:36:47,460
thrust or something around and then the
 

12339
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:48,950
thrust or something around and then the
F1 is like seven or something it's it's

12340
03:36:48,950 --> 03:36:48,960
F1 is like seven or something it's it's
 

12341
03:36:48,960 --> 03:36:50,690
F1 is like seven or something it's it's
huge

12342
03:36:50,690 --> 03:36:50,700
huge
 

12343
03:36:50,700 --> 03:36:53,389
huge
yet way more complicated way more

12344
03:36:53,389 --> 03:36:53,399
yet way more complicated way more
 

12345
03:36:53,399 --> 03:36:56,150
yet way more complicated way more
efficient way just better engine in that

12346
03:36:56,150 --> 03:36:56,160
efficient way just better engine in that
 

12347
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:58,190
efficient way just better engine in that
sense as far as far as performance goes

12348
03:36:58,190 --> 03:36:58,200
sense as far as far as performance goes
 

12349
03:36:58,200 --> 03:37:00,830
sense as far as far as performance goes
yet it never flew it never left the

12350
03:37:00,830 --> 03:37:00,840
yet it never flew it never left the
 

12351
03:37:00,840 --> 03:37:02,630
yet it never flew it never left the
stand you know they they never built the

12352
03:37:02,630 --> 03:37:02,640
stand you know they they never built the
 

12353
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:04,969
stand you know they they never built the
rocket around it the N1 which was the

12354
03:37:04,969 --> 03:37:04,979
rocket around it the N1 which was the
 

12355
03:37:04,979 --> 03:37:07,250
rocket around it the N1 which was the
pre you know the most powerful rocket to

12356
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:07,260
pre you know the most powerful rocket to
 

12357
03:37:07,260 --> 03:37:09,590
pre you know the most powerful rocket to
have flown so far to date

12358
03:37:09,590 --> 03:37:09,600
have flown so far to date
 

12359
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:11,809
have flown so far to date
um like it never made it through its

12360
03:37:11,809 --> 03:37:11,819
um like it never made it through its
 

12361
03:37:11,819 --> 03:37:14,690
um like it never made it through its
first stage burn it all four attempts

12362
03:37:14,690 --> 03:37:14,700
first stage burn it all four attempts
 

12363
03:37:14,700 --> 03:37:17,210
first stage burn it all four attempts
failed spectacularly and yet it had so

12364
03:37:17,210 --> 03:37:17,220
failed spectacularly and yet it had so
 

12365
03:37:17,220 --> 03:37:19,370
failed spectacularly and yet it had so
much technology on it that was still

12366
03:37:19,370 --> 03:37:19,380
much technology on it that was still
 

12367
03:37:19,380 --> 03:37:21,530
much technology on it that was still
unrivaled today almost like finally now

12368
03:37:21,530 --> 03:37:21,540
unrivaled today almost like finally now
 

12369
03:37:21,540 --> 03:37:23,929
unrivaled today almost like finally now
we're beating it the nk-33s that they

12370
03:37:23,929 --> 03:37:23,939
we're beating it the nk-33s that they
 

12371
03:37:23,939 --> 03:37:25,670
we're beating it the nk-33s that they
developed for that rocket like finally

12372
03:37:25,670 --> 03:37:25,680
developed for that rocket like finally
 

12373
03:37:25,680 --> 03:37:28,130
developed for that rocket like finally
today we're to the point of like having

12374
03:37:28,130 --> 03:37:28,140
today we're to the point of like having
 

12375
03:37:28,140 --> 03:37:29,809
today we're to the point of like having
better engines than they built in the

12376
03:37:29,809 --> 03:37:29,819
better engines than they built in the
 

12377
03:37:29,819 --> 03:37:32,750
better engines than they built in the
60s yeah what stands out to you uh from

12378
03:37:32,750 --> 03:37:32,760
60s yeah what stands out to you uh from
 

12379
03:37:32,760 --> 03:37:35,570
60s yeah what stands out to you uh from
the N1 family of rocket engine

12380
03:37:35,570 --> 03:37:35,580
the N1 family of rocket engine
 

12381
03:37:35,580 --> 03:37:38,389
the N1 family of rocket engine
well it's interesting because the N1 uh

12382
03:37:38,389 --> 03:37:38,399
well it's interesting because the N1 uh
 

12383
03:37:38,399 --> 03:37:40,190
well it's interesting because the N1 uh
was the connect could snetsov design

12384
03:37:40,190 --> 03:37:40,200
was the connect could snetsov design
 

12385
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:42,050
was the connect could snetsov design
Bureau and he was actually an aircraft

12386
03:37:42,050 --> 03:37:42,060
Bureau and he was actually an aircraft
 

12387
03:37:42,060 --> 03:37:43,429
Bureau and he was actually an aircraft
manufacturer so he was one of the first

12388
03:37:43,429 --> 03:37:43,439
manufacturer so he was one of the first
 

12389
03:37:43,439 --> 03:37:45,590
manufacturer so he was one of the first
people outside of kind of the the

12390
03:37:45,590 --> 03:37:45,600
people outside of kind of the the
 

12391
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,389
people outside of kind of the the
missile and rocket program you know you

12392
03:37:47,389 --> 03:37:47,399
missile and rocket program you know you
 

12393
03:37:47,399 --> 03:37:49,429
missile and rocket program you know you
had all these other uh Big Wigs kind of

12394
03:37:49,429 --> 03:37:49,439
had all these other uh Big Wigs kind of
 

12395
03:37:49,439 --> 03:37:51,590
had all these other uh Big Wigs kind of
in the other okbs that were developing

12396
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:51,600
in the other okbs that were developing
 

12397
03:37:51,600 --> 03:37:53,090
in the other okbs that were developing
missiles and Rockets and then all of a

12398
03:37:53,090 --> 03:37:53,100
missiles and Rockets and then all of a
 

12399
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:55,130
missiles and Rockets and then all of a
sudden here comes uh Nikolai kuznetsov

12400
03:37:55,130 --> 03:37:55,140
sudden here comes uh Nikolai kuznetsov
 

12401
03:37:55,140 --> 03:37:56,450
sudden here comes uh Nikolai kuznetsov
who

12402
03:37:56,450 --> 03:37:56,460
who
 

12403
03:37:56,460 --> 03:37:58,309
who
um had never developed a rocket engine

12404
03:37:58,309 --> 03:37:58,319
um had never developed a rocket engine
 

12405
03:37:58,319 --> 03:38:00,410
um had never developed a rocket engine
and so his first attempt at Rocket

12406
03:38:00,410 --> 03:38:00,420
and so his first attempt at Rocket
 

12407
03:38:00,420 --> 03:38:02,990
and so his first attempt at Rocket
engines was the NK series nk-15 and k-33

12408
03:38:02,990 --> 03:38:03,000
engines was the NK series nk-15 and k-33
 

12409
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,210
engines was the NK series nk-15 and k-33
and they were amazing they were

12410
03:38:05,210 --> 03:38:05,220
and they were amazing they were
 

12411
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:06,830
and they were amazing they were
brilliant they were these wonderful

12412
03:38:06,830 --> 03:38:06,840
brilliant they were these wonderful
 

12413
03:38:06,840 --> 03:38:09,530
brilliant they were these wonderful
closed cycle oxygen-rich engines

12414
03:38:09,530 --> 03:38:09,540
closed cycle oxygen-rich engines
 

12415
03:38:09,540 --> 03:38:11,570
closed cycle oxygen-rich engines
um that were that were awesome there

12416
03:38:11,570 --> 03:38:11,580
um that were that were awesome there
 

12417
03:38:11,580 --> 03:38:14,030
um that were that were awesome there
were awesome engines and that were you

12418
03:38:14,030 --> 03:38:14,040
were awesome engines and that were you
 

12419
03:38:14,040 --> 03:38:15,469
were awesome engines and that were you
know because

12420
03:38:15,469 --> 03:38:15,479
know because
 

12421
03:38:15,479 --> 03:38:18,410
know because
I love that because he his direct

12422
03:38:18,410 --> 03:38:18,420
I love that because he his direct
 

12423
03:38:18,420 --> 03:38:20,690
I love that because he his direct
um boss he since he wasn't necessarily

12424
03:38:20,690 --> 03:38:20,700
um boss he since he wasn't necessarily
 

12425
03:38:20,700 --> 03:38:22,490
um boss he since he wasn't necessarily
in the in the Aerospace you know or in

12426
03:38:22,490 --> 03:38:22,500
in the in the Aerospace you know or in
 

12427
03:38:22,500 --> 03:38:24,410
in the in the Aerospace you know or in
the I guess the rocket missile defense

12428
03:38:24,410 --> 03:38:24,420
the I guess the rocket missile defense
 

12429
03:38:24,420 --> 03:38:25,429

World

12430
03:38:25,429 --> 03:38:25,439
World
 

12431
03:38:25,439 --> 03:38:28,490
World
um he didn't have to uh at the fall of

12432
03:38:28,490 --> 03:38:28,500
um he didn't have to uh at the fall of
 

12433
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:29,929
um he didn't have to uh at the fall of
the Soviet Union he didn't have to give

12434
03:38:29,929 --> 03:38:29,939
the Soviet Union he didn't have to give
 

12435
03:38:29,939 --> 03:38:31,670
the Soviet Union he didn't have to give
away all of his things to the same

12436
03:38:31,670 --> 03:38:31,680
away all of his things to the same
 

12437
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:34,729
away all of his things to the same
people as the other people so he hid you

12438
03:38:34,729 --> 03:38:34,739
people as the other people so he hid you
 

12439
03:38:34,739 --> 03:38:38,030
people as the other people so he hid you
know like 80 of his engines in a hangar

12440
03:38:38,030 --> 03:38:38,040
know like 80 of his engines in a hangar
 

12441
03:38:38,040 --> 03:38:40,790
know like 80 of his engines in a hangar
and uh and then we still literally used

12442
03:38:40,790 --> 03:38:40,800
and uh and then we still literally used
 

12443
03:38:40,800 --> 03:38:43,429
and uh and then we still literally used
them in the United States we used ulti I

12444
03:38:43,429 --> 03:38:43,439
them in the United States we used ulti I
 

12445
03:38:43,439 --> 03:38:45,769
them in the United States we used ulti I
think it was like eight or ten of them

12446
03:38:45,769 --> 03:38:45,779
think it was like eight or ten of them
 

12447
03:38:45,779 --> 03:38:48,050
think it was like eight or ten of them
um repurposed them as they're called AJ

12448
03:38:48,050 --> 03:38:48,060
um repurposed them as they're called AJ
 

12449
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:49,670
um repurposed them as they're called AJ
26s in the United States but like we

12450
03:38:49,670 --> 03:38:49,680
26s in the United States but like we
 

12451
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:51,530
26s in the United States but like we
still were flying Soviet rocket engines

12452
03:38:51,530 --> 03:38:51,540
still were flying Soviet rocket engines
 

12453
03:38:51,540 --> 03:38:54,889
still were flying Soviet rocket engines
in the 2000s because they were better

12454
03:38:54,889 --> 03:38:54,899
in the 2000s because they were better
 

12455
03:38:54,899 --> 03:38:57,889
in the 2000s because they were better
than engines we are building today like

12456
03:38:57,889 --> 03:38:57,899
than engines we are building today like
 

12457
03:38:57,899 --> 03:39:00,769
than engines we are building today like
that's to me that's my favorite fact

12458
03:39:00,769 --> 03:39:00,779
that's to me that's my favorite fact
 

12459
03:39:00,779 --> 03:39:02,990
that's to me that's my favorite fact
about the N1 I'm not gonna sit there

12460
03:39:02,990 --> 03:39:03,000
about the N1 I'm not gonna sit there
 

12461
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,510
about the N1 I'm not gonna sit there
still that good that that they were the

12462
03:39:05,510 --> 03:39:05,520
still that good that that they were the
 

12463
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:07,550
still that good that that they were the
the best choice for at the time uh

12464
03:39:07,550 --> 03:39:07,560
the best choice for at the time uh
 

12465
03:39:07,560 --> 03:39:09,530
the best choice for at the time uh
orbital Sciences some of the culture

12466
03:39:09,530 --> 03:39:09,540
orbital Sciences some of the culture
 

12467
03:39:09,540 --> 03:39:11,050
orbital Sciences some of the culture
that

12468
03:39:11,050 --> 03:39:11,060
that
 

12469
03:39:11,060 --> 03:39:13,610
that
engineering has led to these things that

12470
03:39:13,610 --> 03:39:13,620
engineering has led to these things that
 

12471
03:39:13,620 --> 03:39:16,070
engineering has led to these things that
still work it's incredible yeah um you

12472
03:39:16,070 --> 03:39:16,080
still work it's incredible yeah um you
 

12473
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:18,349
still work it's incredible yeah um you
said that the rd171 is one of the

12474
03:39:18,349 --> 03:39:18,359
said that the rd171 is one of the
 

12475
03:39:18,359 --> 03:39:20,330
said that the rd171 is one of the
coolest engines ever made why is that

12476
03:39:20,330 --> 03:39:20,340
coolest engines ever made why is that
 

12477
03:39:20,340 --> 03:39:23,990
coolest engines ever made why is that
yeah so one of the fun things about the

12478
03:39:23,990 --> 03:39:24,000
yeah so one of the fun things about the
 

12479
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:26,030
yeah so one of the fun things about the
Soviet engines is it'll look like a lot

12480
03:39:26,030 --> 03:39:26,040
Soviet engines is it'll look like a lot
 

12481
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:27,229
Soviet engines is it'll look like a lot
of their engines look like multiple

12482
03:39:27,229 --> 03:39:27,239
of their engines look like multiple
 

12483
03:39:27,239 --> 03:39:29,150
of their engines look like multiple
engines because you see multiple nozzles

12484
03:39:29,150 --> 03:39:29,160
engines because you see multiple nozzles
 

12485
03:39:29,160 --> 03:39:30,710
engines because you see multiple nozzles
you see multiple combustion Chambers and

12486
03:39:30,710 --> 03:39:30,720
you see multiple combustion Chambers and
 

12487
03:39:30,720 --> 03:39:32,990
you see multiple combustion Chambers and
you would think well obviously you know

12488
03:39:32,990 --> 03:39:33,000
you would think well obviously you know
 

12489
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:36,650
you would think well obviously you know
the nozzle is the engine right but what

12490
03:39:36,650 --> 03:39:36,660
the nozzle is the engine right but what
 

12491
03:39:36,660 --> 03:39:38,570
the nozzle is the engine right but what
they actually would do the the real the

12492
03:39:38,570 --> 03:39:38,580
they actually would do the the real the
 

12493
03:39:38,580 --> 03:39:41,690
they actually would do the the real the
real heart and the real power of the

12494
03:39:41,690 --> 03:39:41,700
real heart and the real power of the
 

12495
03:39:41,700 --> 03:39:42,830
real heart and the real power of the
rocket engine actually comes from the

12496
03:39:42,830 --> 03:39:42,840
rocket engine actually comes from the
 

12497
03:39:42,840 --> 03:39:44,450
rocket engine actually comes from the
turbo pumps comes from the pumps

12498
03:39:44,450 --> 03:39:44,460
turbo pumps comes from the pumps
 

12499
03:39:44,460 --> 03:39:46,429
turbo pumps comes from the pumps
themselves and you know as we talked

12500
03:39:46,429 --> 03:39:46,439
themselves and you know as we talked
 

12501
03:39:46,439 --> 03:39:47,870
themselves and you know as we talked
about earlier that that includes the

12502
03:39:47,870 --> 03:39:47,880
about earlier that that includes the
 

12503
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:49,969
about earlier that that includes the
turbine and the actual

12504
03:39:49,969 --> 03:39:49,979
turbine and the actual
 

12505
03:39:49,979 --> 03:39:51,889
turbine and the actual
um pumps that flow the propellant into

12506
03:39:51,889 --> 03:39:51,899
um pumps that flow the propellant into
 

12507
03:39:51,899 --> 03:39:55,190
um pumps that flow the propellant into
the into the chambers and so the Soviet

12508
03:39:55,190 --> 03:39:55,200
the into the chambers and so the Soviet
 

12509
03:39:55,200 --> 03:39:58,070
the into the chambers and so the Soviet
Union was incredible at developing these

12510
03:39:58,070 --> 03:39:58,080
Union was incredible at developing these
 

12511
03:39:58,080 --> 03:40:00,110
Union was incredible at developing these
closed cycle high-powered turbo pumps

12512
03:40:00,110 --> 03:40:00,120
closed cycle high-powered turbo pumps
 

12513
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:02,510
closed cycle high-powered turbo pumps
but if you try to scale the combustion

12514
03:40:02,510 --> 03:40:02,520
but if you try to scale the combustion
 

12515
03:40:02,520 --> 03:40:04,010
but if you try to scale the combustion
chamber too big

12516
03:40:04,010 --> 03:40:04,020
chamber too big
 

12517
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:05,630
chamber too big
um you end up with what's called

12518
03:40:05,630 --> 03:40:05,640
um you end up with what's called
 

12519
03:40:05,640 --> 03:40:08,030
um you end up with what's called
um combustion instability you're you're

12520
03:40:08,030 --> 03:40:08,040
um combustion instability you're you're
 

12521
03:40:08,040 --> 03:40:10,250
um combustion instability you're you're
having you have such a large surface

12522
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:10,260
having you have such a large surface
 

12523
03:40:10,260 --> 03:40:13,729
having you have such a large surface
area of crazy flames you know and and

12524
03:40:13,729 --> 03:40:13,739
area of crazy flames you know and and
 

12525
03:40:13,739 --> 03:40:15,530
area of crazy flames you know and and
combustion happening they can get these

12526
03:40:15,530 --> 03:40:15,540
combustion happening they can get these
 

12527
03:40:15,540 --> 03:40:17,150
combustion happening they can get these
weird pockets and oscillations and

12528
03:40:17,150 --> 03:40:17,160
weird pockets and oscillations and
 

12529
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:19,130
weird pockets and oscillations and
frequencies and and they just couldn't

12530
03:40:19,130 --> 03:40:19,140
frequencies and and they just couldn't
 

12531
03:40:19,140 --> 03:40:20,929
frequencies and and they just couldn't
make big combustion Chambers they never

12532
03:40:20,929 --> 03:40:20,939
make big combustion Chambers they never
 

12533
03:40:20,939 --> 03:40:22,309
make big combustion Chambers they never
figured it out they never quite well

12534
03:40:22,309 --> 03:40:22,319
figured it out they never quite well
 

12535
03:40:22,319 --> 03:40:23,750
figured it out they never quite well
they did actually kind of figure it out

12536
03:40:23,750 --> 03:40:23,760
they did actually kind of figure it out
 

12537
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:26,030
they did actually kind of figure it out
but they they didn't like it so they

12538
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:26,040
but they they didn't like it so they
 

12539
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:28,490
but they they didn't like it so they
ended up just shrinking down and having

12540
03:40:28,490 --> 03:40:28,500
ended up just shrinking down and having
 

12541
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:30,229
ended up just shrinking down and having
small combustion Chambers and just

12542
03:40:30,229 --> 03:40:30,239
small combustion Chambers and just
 

12543
03:40:30,239 --> 03:40:32,090
small combustion Chambers and just
sending splitting the pipes basically

12544
03:40:32,090 --> 03:40:32,100
sending splitting the pipes basically
 

12545
03:40:32,100 --> 03:40:34,790
sending splitting the pipes basically
instead of one fuel pump going into or

12546
03:40:34,790 --> 03:40:34,800
instead of one fuel pump going into or
 

12547
03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:36,710
instead of one fuel pump going into or
one pipe going into one combustion

12548
03:40:36,710 --> 03:40:36,720
one pipe going into one combustion
 

12549
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:38,630
one pipe going into one combustion
chamber and one oxidizer pipe going into

12550
03:40:38,630 --> 03:40:38,640
chamber and one oxidizer pipe going into
 

12551
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:40,969
chamber and one oxidizer pipe going into
one combustion chamber they'd split it

12552
03:40:40,969 --> 03:40:40,979
one combustion chamber they'd split it
 

12553
03:40:40,979 --> 03:40:43,190
one combustion chamber they'd split it
off into two or four engine into two or

12554
03:40:43,190 --> 03:40:43,200
off into two or four engine into two or
 

12555
03:40:43,200 --> 03:40:45,410
off into two or four engine into two or
four combustion Chambers and kind of

12556
03:40:45,410 --> 03:40:45,420
four combustion Chambers and kind of
 

12557
03:40:45,420 --> 03:40:47,150
four combustion Chambers and kind of
spread that work around so they didn't

12558
03:40:47,150 --> 03:40:47,160
spread that work around so they didn't
 

12559
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:49,250
spread that work around so they didn't
experience this combustion instability

12560
03:40:49,250 --> 03:40:49,260
experience this combustion instability
 

12561
03:40:49,260 --> 03:40:52,550
experience this combustion instability
so the rd171 is like still to date the

12562
03:40:52,550 --> 03:40:52,560
so the rd171 is like still to date the
 

12563
03:40:52,560 --> 03:40:55,070
so the rd171 is like still to date the
most powerful rocket engine ever built

12564
03:40:55,070 --> 03:40:55,080
most powerful rocket engine ever built
 

12565
03:40:55,080 --> 03:40:57,110
most powerful rocket engine ever built
the turbo pump is insane I don't even

12566
03:40:57,110 --> 03:40:57,120
the turbo pump is insane I don't even
 

12567
03:40:57,120 --> 03:40:59,389
the turbo pump is insane I don't even
remember how many you know like 200 000

12568
03:40:59,389 --> 03:40:59,399
remember how many you know like 200 000
 

12569
03:40:59,399 --> 03:41:00,590
remember how many you know like 200 000
horsepower or something comes out of

12570
03:41:00,590 --> 03:41:00,600
horsepower or something comes out of
 

12571
03:41:00,600 --> 03:41:01,729
horsepower or something comes out of
that turbo pump

12572
03:41:01,729 --> 03:41:01,739
that turbo pump
 

12573
03:41:01,739 --> 03:41:03,469
that turbo pump
in order to flow the amount of

12574
03:41:03,469 --> 03:41:03,479
in order to flow the amount of
 

12575
03:41:03,479 --> 03:41:05,450
in order to flow the amount of
propellant necessary at those rates and

12576
03:41:05,450 --> 03:41:05,460
propellant necessary at those rates and
 

12577
03:41:05,460 --> 03:41:06,710
propellant necessary at those rates and
at those pressures into the combustion

12578
03:41:06,710 --> 03:41:06,720
at those pressures into the combustion
 

12579
03:41:06,720 --> 03:41:08,330
at those pressures into the combustion
chamber so it has four chambers

12580
03:41:08,330 --> 03:41:08,340
chamber so it has four chambers
 

12581
03:41:08,340 --> 03:41:10,250
chamber so it has four chambers
and it's just it's just an absolute

03:41:10,250 --> 03:41:10,260
and it's just it's just an absolute
 

12583

and it's just it's just an absolute
Marvel of engineering and

12584
03:41:12,950 --> 03:41:12,960
Marvel of engineering and
 

12585
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:14,330
Marvel of engineering and
yeah and then the cool thing too is

12586
03:41:14,330 --> 03:41:14,340
yeah and then the cool thing too is
 

12587
03:41:14,340 --> 03:41:18,170
yeah and then the cool thing too is
specifically the rd171 it's engine all

12588
03:41:18,170 --> 03:41:18,180
specifically the rd171 it's engine all

specifically the rd171 it's engine all
four of those nozzles can actually pivot

12590
03:41:20,330 --> 03:41:20,340
four of those nozzles can actually pivot
 

12591
03:41:20,340 --> 03:41:23,929
four of those nozzles can actually pivot
and and rotate and I just now as I'm

12592
03:41:23,929 --> 03:41:23,939
and and rotate and I just now as I'm
 

12593
03:41:23,939 --> 03:41:26,450
and and rotate and I just now as I'm
explaining this realized that has to

12594
03:41:26,450 --> 03:41:26,460
explaining this realized that has to
 

12595
03:41:26,460 --> 03:41:28,370
explaining this realized that has to
mean that they have

12596
03:41:28,370 --> 03:41:28,380
mean that they have
 

12597
03:41:28,380 --> 03:41:32,269
mean that they have
joints like flexible joints in the high

12598
03:41:32,269 --> 03:41:32,279
joints like flexible joints in the high
 

12599
03:41:32,279 --> 03:41:35,389
joints like flexible joints in the high
pressure pump lines in order to like I

12600
03:41:35,389 --> 03:41:35,399
pressure pump lines in order to like I
 

12601
03:41:35,399 --> 03:41:37,130
pressure pump lines in order to like I
never I'm this is the realization I'm

12602
03:41:37,130 --> 03:41:37,140
never I'm this is the realization I'm
 

12603
03:41:37,140 --> 03:41:38,570
never I'm this is the realization I'm
having right now because normally you

12604
03:41:38,570 --> 03:41:38,580
having right now because normally you
 

12605
03:41:38,580 --> 03:41:41,269
having right now because normally you
put the gimbal above the turbo pump like

12606
03:41:41,269 --> 03:41:41,279
put the gimbal above the turbo pump like
 

12607
03:41:41,279 --> 03:41:43,250
put the gimbal above the turbo pump like
the the mount where the engine swivels

12608
03:41:43,250 --> 03:41:43,260
the the mount where the engine swivels
 

12609
03:41:43,260 --> 03:41:45,229
the the mount where the engine swivels
so that you have low pressure coming

12610
03:41:45,229 --> 03:41:45,239
so that you have low pressure coming
 

12611
03:41:45,239 --> 03:41:47,570
so that you have low pressure coming
from the tanks into the pumps and then

12612
03:41:47,570 --> 03:41:47,580
from the tanks into the pumps and then
 

12613
03:41:47,580 --> 03:41:49,309
from the tanks into the pumps and then
you just have a straight you know fixed

12614
03:41:49,309 --> 03:41:49,319
you just have a straight you know fixed
 

12615
03:41:49,319 --> 03:41:51,349
you just have a straight you know fixed
pipe flowing into the engine so you'd

12616
03:41:51,349 --> 03:41:51,359
pipe flowing into the engine so you'd
 

12617
03:41:51,359 --> 03:41:52,670
pipe flowing into the engine so you'd
have to bend that pipe and have it be

12618
03:41:52,670 --> 03:41:52,680
have to bend that pipe and have it be
 

12619
03:41:52,680 --> 03:41:55,010
have to bend that pipe and have it be
dynamic if they had the four chambers

12620
03:41:55,010 --> 03:41:55,020
dynamic if they had the four chambers
 

12621
03:41:55,020 --> 03:41:57,290
dynamic if they had the four chambers
moving independently from each other

12622
03:41:57,290 --> 03:41:57,300
moving independently from each other
 

12623
03:41:57,300 --> 03:41:59,330
moving independently from each other
that means those four chambers all had

12624
03:41:59,330 --> 03:41:59,340
that means those four chambers all had
 

12625
03:41:59,340 --> 03:42:02,150
that means those four chambers all had
to have a flexible high pressure pipe

12626
03:42:02,150 --> 03:42:02,160
to have a flexible high pressure pipe
 

12627
03:42:02,160 --> 03:42:04,190
to have a flexible high pressure pipe
going which I don't even I don't know if

12628
03:42:04,190 --> 03:42:04,200
going which I don't even I don't know if
 

12629
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:06,229
going which I don't even I don't know if
that's why am I just now realizing this

12630
03:42:06,229 --> 03:42:06,239
that's why am I just now realizing this
 

12631
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:08,330
that's why am I just now realizing this
yeah so there's engineering challenges

12632
03:42:08,330 --> 03:42:08,340
yeah so there's engineering challenges
 

12633
03:42:08,340 --> 03:42:11,510
yeah so there's engineering challenges
with that I never even thought that was

12634
03:42:11,510 --> 03:42:11,520
with that I never even thought that was
 

12635
03:42:11,520 --> 03:42:13,550
with that I never even thought that was
a thing you would ever could do honestly

12636
03:42:13,550 --> 03:42:13,560
a thing you would ever could do honestly
 

12637
03:42:13,560 --> 03:42:15,830
a thing you would ever could do honestly
I would I gotta look into why and how

12638
03:42:15,830 --> 03:42:15,840
I would I gotta look into why and how
 

12639
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:17,570
I would I gotta look into why and how
and what yeah I wonder why that the

12640
03:42:17,570 --> 03:42:17,580
and what yeah I wonder why that the
 

12641
03:42:17,580 --> 03:42:20,030
and what yeah I wonder why that the
design decision was made so the easier

12642
03:42:20,030 --> 03:42:20,040
design decision was made so the easier
 

12643
03:42:20,040 --> 03:42:21,650
design decision was made so the easier
thing to do normally is you would keep

12644
03:42:21,650 --> 03:42:21,660
thing to do normally is you would keep
 

12645
03:42:21,660 --> 03:42:23,690
thing to do normally is you would keep
those nozzles fixed and then then a fix

12646
03:42:23,690 --> 03:42:23,700
those nozzles fixed and then then a fix
 

12647
03:42:23,700 --> 03:42:26,210
those nozzles fixed and then then a fix
like say the the soyuz engine the rd-107

12648
03:42:26,210 --> 03:42:26,220
like say the the soyuz engine the rd-107
 

12649
03:42:26,220 --> 03:42:27,889
like say the the soyuz engine the rd-107
and 108 they have a fixed main

12650
03:42:27,889 --> 03:42:27,899
and 108 they have a fixed main
 

12651
03:42:27,899 --> 03:42:29,630
and 108 they have a fixed main
combustion Chambers and they and they

12652
03:42:29,630 --> 03:42:29,640
combustion Chambers and they and they
 

12653
03:42:29,640 --> 03:42:31,910
combustion Chambers and they and they
use these little Vernier or some people

12654
03:42:31,910 --> 03:42:31,920
use these little Vernier or some people
 

12655
03:42:31,920 --> 03:42:33,590
use these little Vernier or some people
got mad at me for saying Vernier and

12656
03:42:33,590 --> 03:42:33,600
got mad at me for saying Vernier and
 

12657
03:42:33,600 --> 03:42:35,870
got mad at me for saying Vernier and
Werner engines that swivel themselves

12658
03:42:35,870 --> 03:42:35,880
Werner engines that swivel themselves
 

12659
03:42:35,880 --> 03:42:37,490
Werner engines that swivel themselves
and those provide your your Control

12660
03:42:37,490 --> 03:42:37,500
and those provide your your Control
 

12661
03:42:37,500 --> 03:42:39,830
and those provide your your Control
Authority so the main Chambers stay

12662
03:42:39,830 --> 03:42:39,840
Authority so the main Chambers stay
 

12663
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:41,389
Authority so the main Chambers stay
fixed and then you get your your roll

12664
03:42:41,389 --> 03:42:41,399
fixed and then you get your your roll
 

12665
03:42:41,399 --> 03:42:42,530
fixed and then you get your your roll
and you're pitch and your yaw out of

12666
03:42:42,530 --> 03:42:42,540
and you're pitch and your yaw out of
 

12667
03:42:42,540 --> 03:42:45,229
and you're pitch and your yaw out of
auxiliary thrusters uh by the way did

12668
03:42:45,229 --> 03:42:45,239
auxiliary thrusters uh by the way did
 

12669
03:42:45,239 --> 03:42:46,729
auxiliary thrusters uh by the way did
did you get anything wrong in that video

12670
03:42:46,729 --> 03:42:46,739
did you get anything wrong in that video
 

12671
03:42:46,739 --> 03:42:49,610
did you get anything wrong in that video
that people told you about yeah a few

12672
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:49,620
that people told you about yeah a few
 

12673
03:42:49,620 --> 03:42:51,110
that people told you about yeah a few
things yep

12674
03:42:51,110 --> 03:42:51,120
things yep
 

12675
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:52,910
things yep
um first off we had a graphic error

12676
03:42:52,910 --> 03:42:52,920
um first off we had a graphic error
 

12677
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:54,469
um first off we had a graphic error
where we actually you know we copied and

12678
03:42:54,469 --> 03:42:54,479
where we actually you know we copied and
 

12679
03:42:54,479 --> 03:42:55,790
where we actually you know we copied and
pasted a lot of our like after effects

12680
03:42:55,790 --> 03:42:55,800
pasted a lot of our like after effects
 

12681
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:58,370
pasted a lot of our like after effects
projects so our nuclear engines one of

12682
03:42:58,370 --> 03:42:58,380
projects so our nuclear engines one of
 

12683
03:42:58,380 --> 03:43:00,710
projects so our nuclear engines one of
them on screen says that it runs on rp1

12684
03:43:00,710 --> 03:43:00,720
them on screen says that it runs on rp1
 

12685
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:02,090
them on screen says that it runs on rp1
it does not it has basically all the

12686
03:43:02,090 --> 03:43:02,100
it does not it has basically all the
 

12687
03:43:02,100 --> 03:43:03,950
it does not it has basically all the
wrong stats we just didn't catch it in

12688
03:43:03,950 --> 03:43:03,960
wrong stats we just didn't catch it in
 

12689
03:43:03,960 --> 03:43:05,630
wrong stats we just didn't catch it in
the edit you know that we literally copy

12690
03:43:05,630 --> 03:43:05,640
the edit you know that we literally copy
 

12691
03:43:05,640 --> 03:43:07,729
the edit you know that we literally copy
and pasted and I say it right on screen

12692
03:43:07,729 --> 03:43:07,739
and pasted and I say it right on screen
 

12693
03:43:07,739 --> 03:43:10,190
and pasted and I say it right on screen
but the like in the voiceover but on

12694
03:43:10,190 --> 03:43:10,200
but the like in the voiceover but on
 

12695
03:43:10,200 --> 03:43:11,990
but the like in the voiceover but on
screen it's wrong the other thing I'm

12696
03:43:11,990 --> 03:43:12,000
screen it's wrong the other thing I'm
 

12697
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:14,269
screen it's wrong the other thing I'm
excited to ask you about this oh I

12698
03:43:14,269 --> 03:43:14,279
excited to ask you about this oh I
 

12699
03:43:14,279 --> 03:43:16,309
excited to ask you about this oh I
watched and and I spoke with a lot of uh

12700
03:43:16,309 --> 03:43:16,319
watched and and I spoke with a lot of uh
 

12701
03:43:16,319 --> 03:43:17,809
watched and and I spoke with a lot of uh
Russian speaking individuals we had a

12702
03:43:17,809 --> 03:43:17,819
Russian speaking individuals we had a
 

12703
03:43:17,819 --> 03:43:19,250
Russian speaking individuals we had a
lot of research assistants that were

12704
03:43:19,250 --> 03:43:19,260
lot of research assistants that were
 

12705
03:43:19,260 --> 03:43:21,410
lot of research assistants that were
reading and blah blah I tried really

12706
03:43:21,410 --> 03:43:21,420
reading and blah blah I tried really
 

12707
03:43:21,420 --> 03:43:24,610
reading and blah blah I tried really
hard to learn how to pronounce Sergey

12708
03:43:24,610 --> 03:43:24,620
hard to learn how to pronounce Sergey
 

12709
03:43:24,620 --> 03:43:26,830
hard to learn how to pronounce Sergey
corellios name

12710
03:43:26,830 --> 03:43:26,840
corellios name
 

12711
03:43:26,840 --> 03:43:28,969
corellios name
and I'm still going to say it wrong no

12712
03:43:28,969 --> 03:43:28,979
and I'm still going to say it wrong no
 

12713
03:43:28,979 --> 03:43:31,790
and I'm still going to say it wrong no
matter what but my understanding yes and

12714
03:43:31,790 --> 03:43:31,800
matter what but my understanding yes and
 

12715
03:43:31,800 --> 03:43:33,530
matter what but my understanding yes and
from listening to native speakers it's

12716
03:43:33,530 --> 03:43:33,540
from listening to native speakers it's
 

12717
03:43:33,540 --> 03:43:37,010
from listening to native speakers it's
closer to krellyoff than it is coralev

12718
03:43:37,010 --> 03:43:37,020
closer to krellyoff than it is coralev
 

12719
03:43:37,020 --> 03:43:40,550
closer to krellyoff than it is coralev
yeah definitely said gay probably

12720
03:43:40,550 --> 03:43:40,560
yeah definitely said gay probably
 

12721
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:42,349
yeah definitely said gay probably
see I will never say it that perfectly

12722
03:43:42,349 --> 03:43:42,359
see I will never say it that perfectly
 

12723
03:43:42,359 --> 03:43:44,630
see I will never say it that perfectly
but I I know it's not just corlev I mean

12724
03:43:44,630 --> 03:43:44,640
but I I know it's not just corlev I mean
 

12725
03:43:44,640 --> 03:43:47,750
but I I know it's not just corlev I mean
again the the English translation of it

12726
03:43:47,750 --> 03:43:47,760
again the the English translation of it
 

12727
03:43:47,760 --> 03:43:49,370
again the the English translation of it
likely I should have just said core 11

12728
03:43:49,370 --> 03:43:49,380
likely I should have just said core 11
 

12729
03:43:49,380 --> 03:43:52,070
likely I should have just said core 11
said I'm saying it the dumb America way

12730
03:43:52,070 --> 03:43:52,080
said I'm saying it the dumb America way
 

12731
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:55,030
said I'm saying it the dumb America way
but but you rolled your heart

12732
03:43:55,030 --> 03:43:55,040
but but you rolled your heart
 

12733
03:43:55,040 --> 03:43:57,729
but but you rolled your heart
comrade

12734
03:43:57,729 --> 03:43:57,739
comrade
 

12735
03:43:57,739 --> 03:44:00,349
comrade
excellent so uh

12736
03:44:00,349 --> 03:44:00,359
excellent so uh
 

12737
03:44:00,359 --> 03:44:02,030
excellent so uh
oh let me just ask you in the difference

12738
03:44:02,030 --> 03:44:02,040
oh let me just ask you in the difference
 

12739
03:44:02,040 --> 03:44:03,830
oh let me just ask you in the difference
in in the culture because you've reached

12740
03:44:03,830 --> 03:44:03,840
in in the culture because you've reached
 

12741
03:44:03,840 --> 03:44:05,570
in in the culture because you've reached
there's so many Rockets from so many

12742
03:44:05,570 --> 03:44:05,580
there's so many Rockets from so many
 

12743
03:44:05,580 --> 03:44:07,610
there's so many Rockets from so many
different areas the Saturn five and just

12744
03:44:07,610 --> 03:44:07,620
different areas the Saturn five and just
 

12745
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:10,010
different areas the Saturn five and just
everything you're seeing now are there

12746
03:44:10,010 --> 03:44:10,020
everything you're seeing now are there
 

12747
03:44:10,020 --> 03:44:11,929
everything you're seeing now are there
some interesting differences especially

12748
03:44:11,929 --> 03:44:11,939
some interesting differences especially
 

12749
03:44:11,939 --> 03:44:14,690
some interesting differences especially
when you look at the space race between

12750
03:44:14,690 --> 03:44:14,700
when you look at the space race between
 

12751
03:44:14,700 --> 03:44:16,790
when you look at the space race between
um the Soviet

12752
03:44:16,790 --> 03:44:16,800
um the Soviet
 

12753
03:44:16,800 --> 03:44:20,030
um the Soviet
rocket engineers and efforts versus the

12754
03:44:20,030 --> 03:44:20,040
rocket engineers and efforts versus the
 

12755
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:23,690
rocket engineers and efforts versus the
American

12756
03:44:23,690 --> 03:44:23,700

 

12757
03:44:23,700 --> 03:44:25,610

yeah there's I mean there's definitely

12758
03:44:25,610 --> 03:44:25,620
yeah there's I mean there's definitely
 

12759
03:44:25,620 --> 03:44:28,190
yeah there's I mean there's definitely
huge huge cultural changes and the fun

12760
03:44:28,190 --> 03:44:28,200
huge huge cultural changes and the fun
 

12761
03:44:28,200 --> 03:44:30,710
huge huge cultural changes and the fun
thing is that they kind of spawned from

12762
03:44:30,710 --> 03:44:30,720
thing is that they kind of spawned from
 

12763
03:44:30,720 --> 03:44:32,389
thing is that they kind of spawned from
the same they have the same starting

12764
03:44:32,389 --> 03:44:32,399
the same they have the same starting
 

12765
03:44:32,399 --> 03:44:34,790
the same they have the same starting
Place both you know the Soviet rocket

12766
03:44:34,790 --> 03:44:34,800
Place both you know the Soviet rocket
 

12767
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:37,370
Place both you know the Soviet rocket
engines and Americans all came from the

12768
03:44:37,370 --> 03:44:37,380
engines and Americans all came from the
 

12769
03:44:37,380 --> 03:44:39,790
engines and Americans all came from the
Nazi V2 rocket and the A4 engine

12770
03:44:39,790 --> 03:44:39,800
Nazi V2 rocket and the A4 engine
 

12771
03:44:39,800 --> 03:44:42,110
Nazi V2 rocket and the A4 engine
literally physically spawned from that

12772
03:44:42,110 --> 03:44:42,120
literally physically spawned from that
 

12773
03:44:42,120 --> 03:44:43,729
literally physically spawned from that
because at the fall of you know at the

12774
03:44:43,729 --> 03:44:43,739
because at the fall of you know at the
 

12775
03:44:43,739 --> 03:44:46,070
because at the fall of you know at the
end of World War II we took a handful of

12776
03:44:46,070 --> 03:44:46,080
end of World War II we took a handful of
 

12777
03:44:46,080 --> 03:44:47,870
end of World War II we took a handful of
German scientists and the Soviets took a

12778
03:44:47,870 --> 03:44:47,880
German scientists and the Soviets took a
 

12779
03:44:47,880 --> 03:44:49,670
German scientists and the Soviets took a
handful of German scientists and they

12780
03:44:49,670 --> 03:44:49,680
handful of German scientists and they
 

12781
03:44:49,680 --> 03:44:51,769
handful of German scientists and they
both got their own a little bit some

12782
03:44:51,769 --> 03:44:51,779
both got their own a little bit some
 

12783
03:44:51,779 --> 03:44:53,389
both got their own a little bit some
blueprints here and there and the others

12784
03:44:53,389 --> 03:44:53,399
blueprints here and there and the others
 

12785
03:44:53,399 --> 03:44:54,769
blueprints here and there and the others
got some blue so we literally have the

12786
03:44:54,769 --> 03:44:54,779
got some blue so we literally have the
 

12787
03:44:54,779 --> 03:44:56,330
got some blue so we literally have the
same it's a weird thing where we're

12788
03:44:56,330 --> 03:44:56,340
same it's a weird thing where we're
 

12789
03:44:56,340 --> 03:44:58,190
same it's a weird thing where we're
starting from the same like thing and

12790
03:44:58,190 --> 03:44:58,200
starting from the same like thing and
 

12791
03:44:58,200 --> 03:45:00,469
starting from the same like thing and
letting two uh two Divergent you know

12792
03:45:00,469 --> 03:45:00,479
letting two uh two Divergent you know
 

12793
03:45:00,479 --> 03:45:02,870
letting two uh two Divergent you know
Divergent paths go crazy on their own

12794
03:45:02,870 --> 03:45:02,880
Divergent paths go crazy on their own
 

12795
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:04,370
Divergent paths go crazy on their own
development so it's really fun to see

12796
03:45:04,370 --> 03:45:04,380
development so it's really fun to see
 

12797
03:45:04,380 --> 03:45:06,170
development so it's really fun to see
the cultural differences one of the

12798
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:06,180
the cultural differences one of the
 

12799
03:45:06,180 --> 03:45:07,729
the cultural differences one of the
things the United States did is they

12800
03:45:07,729 --> 03:45:07,739
things the United States did is they
 

12801
03:45:07,739 --> 03:45:09,950
things the United States did is they
really would kind of take an engine

12802
03:45:09,950 --> 03:45:09,960
really would kind of take an engine
 

12803
03:45:09,960 --> 03:45:13,309
really would kind of take an engine
and and just perfect it more or less and

12804
03:45:13,309 --> 03:45:13,319
and and just perfect it more or less and
 

12805
03:45:13,319 --> 03:45:15,590
and and just perfect it more or less and
then and not really evolve that much

12806
03:45:15,590 --> 03:45:15,600
then and not really evolve that much
 

12807
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:18,349
then and not really evolve that much
like they they I don't know and I don't

12808
03:45:18,349 --> 03:45:18,359
like they they I don't know and I don't
 

12809
03:45:18,359 --> 03:45:19,729
like they they I don't know and I don't
know why I actually need to do a history

12810
03:45:19,729 --> 03:45:19,739
know why I actually need to do a history
 

12811
03:45:19,739 --> 03:45:21,950
know why I actually need to do a history
lesson on all of the U.S engines but

12812
03:45:21,950 --> 03:45:21,960
lesson on all of the U.S engines but
 

12813
03:45:21,960 --> 03:45:23,990
lesson on all of the U.S engines but
it's literally like uh as far as orbital

12814
03:45:23,990 --> 03:45:24,000
it's literally like uh as far as orbital
 

12815
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:26,570
it's literally like uh as far as orbital
class engines before now

12816
03:45:26,570 --> 03:45:26,580
class engines before now
 

12817
03:45:26,580 --> 03:45:29,150
class engines before now
it's like a dozen or two you know it's

12818
03:45:29,150 --> 03:45:29,160
it's like a dozen or two you know it's
 

12819
03:45:29,160 --> 03:45:32,030
it's like a dozen or two you know it's
it's it's a tenth the amount of the

12820
03:45:32,030 --> 03:45:32,040
it's it's a tenth the amount of the
 

12821
03:45:32,040 --> 03:45:34,190
it's it's a tenth the amount of the
Soviets and the Soviets just literally

12822
03:45:34,190 --> 03:45:34,200
Soviets and the Soviets just literally
 

12823
03:45:34,200 --> 03:45:36,469
Soviets and the Soviets just literally
made up a new engine every time they had

12824
03:45:36,469 --> 03:45:36,479
made up a new engine every time they had
 

12825
03:45:36,479 --> 03:45:39,590
made up a new engine every time they had
a new like they went uh and it was like

12826
03:45:39,590 --> 03:45:39,600
a new like they went uh and it was like
 

12827
03:45:39,600 --> 03:45:42,469
a new like they went uh and it was like
a completely different engine yeah so I

12828
03:45:42,469 --> 03:45:42,479
a completely different engine yeah so I
 

12829
03:45:42,479 --> 03:45:43,910
a completely different engine yeah so I
just yeah I wonder if there's some

12830
03:45:43,910 --> 03:45:43,920
just yeah I wonder if there's some
 

12831
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:45,830
just yeah I wonder if there's some
aspect to the culture and I don't want

12832
03:45:45,830 --> 03:45:45,840
aspect to the culture and I don't want
 

12833
03:45:45,840 --> 03:45:48,410
aspect to the culture and I don't want
to overstate it but uh there is more of

12834
03:45:48,410 --> 03:45:48,420
to overstate it but uh there is more of
 

12835
03:45:48,420 --> 03:45:50,389
to overstate it but uh there is more of
a safety culture I think in the United

12836
03:45:50,389 --> 03:45:50,399
a safety culture I think in the United
 

12837
03:45:50,399 --> 03:45:52,370
a safety culture I think in the United
States and I think if you care about

12838
03:45:52,370 --> 03:45:52,380
States and I think if you care about
 

12839
03:45:52,380 --> 03:45:56,750
States and I think if you care about
safety or rather like you have

12840
03:45:56,750 --> 03:45:56,760
safety or rather like you have
 

12841
03:45:56,760 --> 03:45:59,570
safety or rather like you have
uh you're more risk-averse yeah so you

12842
03:45:59,570 --> 03:45:59,580
uh you're more risk-averse yeah so you
 

12843
03:45:59,580 --> 03:46:01,130
uh you're more risk-averse yeah so you
care about safety more about the value

12844
03:46:01,130 --> 03:46:01,140
care about safety more about the value
 

12845
03:46:01,140 --> 03:46:03,849
care about safety more about the value
of human life there is taken there that

12846
03:46:03,849 --> 03:46:03,859
of human life there is taken there that
 

12847
03:46:03,859 --> 03:46:07,429
of human life there is taken there that
you will iterate less so yeah I think

12848
03:46:07,429 --> 03:46:07,439
you will iterate less so yeah I think
 

12849
03:46:07,439 --> 03:46:08,870
you will iterate less so yeah I think
the Soviets especially in the early

12850
03:46:08,870 --> 03:46:08,880
the Soviets especially in the early
 

12851
03:46:08,880 --> 03:46:10,610
the Soviets especially in the early
aspect of the program I don't want to

12852
03:46:10,610 --> 03:46:10,620
aspect of the program I don't want to
 

12853
03:46:10,620 --> 03:46:12,170
aspect of the program I don't want to
overstate this is

12854
03:46:12,170 --> 03:46:12,180
overstate this is
 

12855
03:46:12,180 --> 03:46:13,729
overstate this is
um some of it is just

12856
03:46:13,729 --> 03:46:13,739
um some of it is just
 

12857
03:46:13,739 --> 03:46:15,769
um some of it is just
um through stories you just hey you're

12858
03:46:15,769 --> 03:46:15,779
um through stories you just hey you're
 

12859
03:46:15,779 --> 03:46:18,530
um through stories you just hey you're
anecdotes there are more willing to take

12860
03:46:18,530 --> 03:46:18,540
anecdotes there are more willing to take
 

12861
03:46:18,540 --> 03:46:21,290
anecdotes there are more willing to take
risks yeah risks with human life risks

12862
03:46:21,290 --> 03:46:21,300
risks yeah risks with human life risks
 

12863
03:46:21,300 --> 03:46:24,950
risks yeah risks with human life risks
with spacecraft for example the first uh

12864
03:46:24,950 --> 03:46:24,960
with spacecraft for example the first uh
 

12865
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:26,389
with spacecraft for example the first uh
orbital space flights from the Soviet

12866
03:46:26,389 --> 03:46:26,399
orbital space flights from the Soviet
 

12867
03:46:26,399 --> 03:46:29,269
orbital space flights from the Soviet
Union the the Cosmonaut had to eject out

12868
03:46:29,269 --> 03:46:29,279
Union the the Cosmonaut had to eject out
 

12869
03:46:29,279 --> 03:46:30,830
Union the the Cosmonaut had to eject out
of the capsule and parachute to a

12870
03:46:30,830 --> 03:46:30,840
of the capsule and parachute to a
 

12871
03:46:30,840 --> 03:46:32,929
of the capsule and parachute to a
landing yes that's not very well like

12872
03:46:32,929 --> 03:46:32,939
landing yes that's not very well like
 

12873
03:46:32,939 --> 03:46:35,030
landing yes that's not very well like
known and it wasn't they were hid that

12874
03:46:35,030 --> 03:46:35,040
known and it wasn't they were hid that
 

12875
03:46:35,040 --> 03:46:37,610
known and it wasn't they were hid that
even from history as best they could at

12876
03:46:37,610 --> 03:46:37,620
even from history as best they could at
 

12877
03:46:37,620 --> 03:46:39,290
even from history as best they could at
first because they were slightly ashamed

12878
03:46:39,290 --> 03:46:39,300
first because they were slightly ashamed
 

12879
03:46:39,300 --> 03:46:40,550
first because they were slightly ashamed
that they couldn't have a full recovery

12880
03:46:40,550 --> 03:46:40,560
that they couldn't have a full recovery
 

12881
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:42,290
that they couldn't have a full recovery
system with their spacecraft they could

12882
03:46:42,290 --> 03:46:42,300
system with their spacecraft they could
 

12883
03:46:42,300 --> 03:46:43,550
system with their spacecraft they could
physically recover it but they wouldn't

12884
03:46:43,550 --> 03:46:43,560
physically recover it but they wouldn't
 

12885
03:46:43,560 --> 03:46:45,110
physically recover it but they wouldn't
have been able to recover the cosmonaut

12886
03:46:45,110 --> 03:46:45,120
have been able to recover the cosmonaut
 

12887
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:47,389
have been able to recover the cosmonaut
in one piece so instead they had them

12888
03:46:47,389 --> 03:46:47,399
in one piece so instead they had them
 

12889
03:46:47,399 --> 03:46:49,610
in one piece so instead they had them
just eject out of the thing and

12890
03:46:49,610 --> 03:46:49,620
just eject out of the thing and
 

12891
03:46:49,620 --> 03:46:52,309
just eject out of the thing and
parachute to safety like that's insane

12892
03:46:52,309 --> 03:46:52,319
parachute to safety like that's insane
 

12893
03:46:52,319 --> 03:46:54,590
parachute to safety like that's insane
and so there definitely was some some

12894
03:46:54,590 --> 03:46:54,600
and so there definitely was some some
 

12895
03:46:54,600 --> 03:46:57,650
and so there definitely was some some
extra risks and but all also a freedom

12896
03:46:57,650 --> 03:46:57,660
extra risks and but all also a freedom
 

12897
03:46:57,660 --> 03:46:59,450
extra risks and but all also a freedom
to just like push things to the limits

12898
03:46:59,450 --> 03:46:59,460
to just like push things to the limits
 

12899
03:46:59,460 --> 03:47:01,309
to just like push things to the limits
and try everything you know they threw

12900
03:47:01,309 --> 03:47:01,319
and try everything you know they threw
 

12901
03:47:01,319 --> 03:47:03,769
and try everything you know they threw
EV all the spaghetti on the wall it's

12902
03:47:03,769 --> 03:47:03,779
EV all the spaghetti on the wall it's
 

12903
03:47:03,779 --> 03:47:05,510
EV all the spaghetti on the wall it's
funny that most people probably don't

12904
03:47:05,510 --> 03:47:05,520
funny that most people probably don't
 

12905
03:47:05,520 --> 03:47:07,070
funny that most people probably don't
even know the first person in the space

12906
03:47:07,070 --> 03:47:07,080
even know the first person in the space
 

12907
03:47:07,080 --> 03:47:09,530
even know the first person in the space
in America and obviously everybody knows

12908
03:47:09,530 --> 03:47:09,540
in America and obviously everybody knows
 

12909
03:47:09,540 --> 03:47:13,070
in America and obviously everybody knows
that in uh that it's like um

12910
03:47:13,070 --> 03:47:13,080
that in uh that it's like um
 

12911
03:47:13,080 --> 03:47:15,950
that in uh that it's like um
it's it's kind of interesting how the

12912
03:47:15,950 --> 03:47:15,960
it's it's kind of interesting how the
 

12913
03:47:15,960 --> 03:47:17,330
it's it's kind of interesting how the
space race

12914
03:47:17,330 --> 03:47:17,340
space race
 

12915
03:47:17,340 --> 03:47:19,849
space race
and even World War II

12916
03:47:19,849 --> 03:47:19,859
and even World War II
 

12917
03:47:19,859 --> 03:47:22,969
and even World War II
even like the history books you ask most

12918
03:47:22,969 --> 03:47:22,979
even like the history books you ask most
 

12919
03:47:22,979 --> 03:47:24,550
even like the history books you ask most
Americans

12920
03:47:24,550 --> 03:47:24,560
Americans
 

12921
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:28,370
Americans
they think that America won World War II

12922
03:47:28,370 --> 03:47:28,380
they think that America won World War II
 

12923
03:47:28,380 --> 03:47:31,849
they think that America won World War II
like without America like they the the

12924
03:47:31,849 --> 03:47:31,859
like without America like they the the
 

12925
03:47:31,859 --> 03:47:34,790
like without America like they the the
real heroes of World War II is America

12926
03:47:34,790 --> 03:47:34,800
real heroes of World War II is America
 

12927
03:47:34,800 --> 03:47:38,389
real heroes of World War II is America
yes uh British people they say and and

12928
03:47:38,389 --> 03:47:38,399
yes uh British people they say and and
 

12929
03:47:38,399 --> 03:47:39,650
yes uh British people they say and and
everybody has a pretty good

12930
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:39,660
everybody has a pretty good
 

12931
03:47:39,660 --> 03:47:42,229
everybody has a pretty good
justification like without Britain

12932
03:47:42,229 --> 03:47:42,239
justification like without Britain
 

12933
03:47:42,239 --> 03:47:44,030
justification like without Britain
without Churchill

12934
03:47:44,030 --> 03:47:44,040
without Churchill
 

12935
03:47:44,040 --> 03:47:46,130
without Churchill
their Hitler would have taken over the

12936
03:47:46,130 --> 03:47:46,140
their Hitler would have taken over the
 

12937
03:47:46,140 --> 03:47:49,250
their Hitler would have taken over the
world and I think probably the strongest

12938
03:47:49,250 --> 03:47:49,260
world and I think probably the strongest
 

12939
03:47:49,260 --> 03:47:51,830
world and I think probably the strongest
case is the Soviet Union case that

12940
03:47:51,830 --> 03:47:51,840
case is the Soviet Union case that
 

12941
03:47:51,840 --> 03:47:53,690
case is the Soviet Union case that
they're the ones that won the war the

12942
03:47:53,690 --> 03:47:53,700
they're the ones that won the war the
 

12943
03:47:53,700 --> 03:47:55,370
they're the ones that won the war the
reason it's the strongest cases were

12944
03:47:55,370 --> 03:47:55,380
reason it's the strongest cases were
 

12945
03:47:55,380 --> 03:47:57,830
reason it's the strongest cases were
most of the fighting happened right most

12946
03:47:57,830 --> 03:47:57,840
most of the fighting happened right most
 

12947
03:47:57,840 --> 03:48:00,469
most of the fighting happened right most
of the death happen most of like most of

12948
03:48:00,469 --> 03:48:00,479
of the death happen most of like most of
 

12949
03:48:00,479 --> 03:48:02,269
of the death happen most of like most of
the destruction but everyone has their

12950
03:48:02,269 --> 03:48:02,279
the destruction but everyone has their
 

12951
03:48:02,279 --> 03:48:03,710
the destruction but everyone has their
perspective and certainly on the space

12952
03:48:03,710 --> 03:48:03,720
perspective and certainly on the space
 

12953
03:48:03,720 --> 03:48:04,670
perspective and certainly on the space
race

12954
03:48:04,670 --> 03:48:04,680
race
 

12955
03:48:04,680 --> 03:48:06,769
race
you know the great accomplishment is the

12956
03:48:06,769 --> 03:48:06,779
you know the great accomplishment is the
 

12957
03:48:06,779 --> 03:48:09,130
you know the great accomplishment is the
first man on the Moon

12958
03:48:09,130 --> 03:48:09,140
first man on the Moon
 

12959
03:48:09,140 --> 03:48:11,389
first man on the Moon
yeah I was gonna say and then Yuri

12960
03:48:11,389 --> 03:48:11,399
yeah I was gonna say and then Yuri
 

12961
03:48:11,399 --> 03:48:13,790
yeah I was gonna say and then Yuri
Gagarin from the Russian perspectives

12962
03:48:13,790 --> 03:48:13,800
Gagarin from the Russian perspectives
 

12963
03:48:13,800 --> 03:48:16,190
Gagarin from the Russian perspectives
like first man in space and that I think

12964
03:48:16,190 --> 03:48:16,200
like first man in space and that I think
 

12965
03:48:16,200 --> 03:48:18,769
like first man in space and that I think
still persists and some of that in

12966
03:48:18,769 --> 03:48:18,779
still persists and some of that in
 

12967
03:48:18,779 --> 03:48:20,929
still persists and some of that in
healthy forms is probably constructive

12968
03:48:20,929 --> 03:48:20,939
healthy forms is probably constructive
 

12969
03:48:20,939 --> 03:48:23,030
healthy forms is probably constructive
to a little bit of competition this

12970
03:48:23,030 --> 03:48:23,040
to a little bit of competition this
 

12971
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:25,130
to a little bit of competition this
pushes all the all the great scientists

12972
03:48:25,130 --> 03:48:25,140
pushes all the all the great scientists
 

12973
03:48:25,140 --> 03:48:27,110
pushes all the all the great scientists
on each side uh but anyway what do you

12974
03:48:27,110 --> 03:48:27,120
on each side uh but anyway what do you
 

12975
03:48:27,120 --> 03:48:28,729
on each side uh but anyway what do you
think about

12976
03:48:28,729 --> 03:48:28,739
think about
 

12977
03:48:28,739 --> 03:48:31,070
think about
this uh Euro Gagarin mission of the

12978
03:48:31,070 --> 03:48:31,080
this uh Euro Gagarin mission of the
 

12979
03:48:31,080 --> 03:48:33,849
this uh Euro Gagarin mission of the
first human in space

12980
03:48:33,849 --> 03:48:33,859
first human in space
 

12981
03:48:33,859 --> 03:48:36,830
first human in space
Commission in 1961 just in general when

12982
03:48:36,830 --> 03:48:36,840
Commission in 1961 just in general when
 

12983
03:48:36,840 --> 03:48:38,210
Commission in 1961 just in general when
you when you look back at that time

12984
03:48:38,210 --> 03:48:38,220
you when you look back at that time
 

12985
03:48:38,220 --> 03:48:41,809
you when you look back at that time
leading to the the the the the first man

12986
03:48:41,809 --> 03:48:41,819
leading to the the the the the first man
 

12987
03:48:41,819 --> 03:48:45,830
leading to the the the the the first man
on the Moon yeah April 12 1961. Yuri's

12988
03:48:45,830 --> 03:48:45,840
on the Moon yeah April 12 1961. Yuri's
 

12989
03:48:45,840 --> 03:48:47,150
on the Moon yeah April 12 1961. Yuri's
night baby that's a

12990
03:48:47,150 --> 03:48:47,160
night baby that's a
 

12991
03:48:47,160 --> 03:48:49,550
night baby that's a
yeah it's it's insane what's insane to

12992
03:48:49,550 --> 03:48:49,560
yeah it's it's insane what's insane to
 

12993
03:48:49,560 --> 03:48:52,429
yeah it's it's insane what's insane to
me is is the first

12994
03:48:52,429 --> 03:48:52,439
me is is the first
 

12995
03:48:52,439 --> 03:48:54,769
me is is the first
person in space didn't just go to space

12996
03:48:54,769 --> 03:48:54,779
person in space didn't just go to space
 

12997
03:48:54,779 --> 03:48:57,370
person in space didn't just go to space
he went into orbit you know you're yarn

12998
03:48:57,370 --> 03:48:57,380
he went into orbit you know you're yarn
 

12999
03:48:57,380 --> 03:49:00,110
he went into orbit you know you're yarn
flew around the Earth in orbit and

13000
03:49:00,110 --> 03:49:00,120
flew around the Earth in orbit and
 

13001
03:49:00,120 --> 03:49:02,870
flew around the Earth in orbit and
re-entered that's a Monumental task

13002
03:49:02,870 --> 03:49:02,880
re-entered that's a Monumental task
 

13003
03:49:02,880 --> 03:49:05,030
re-entered that's a Monumental task
compared to suborbital so the United

13004
03:49:05,030 --> 03:49:05,040
compared to suborbital so the United
 

13005
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:07,849
compared to suborbital so the United
States did two suborbital flights in

13006
03:49:07,849 --> 03:49:07,859
States did two suborbital flights in
 

13007
03:49:07,859 --> 03:49:09,050
States did two suborbital flights in
that same year I believe in that same

13008
03:49:09,050 --> 03:49:09,060
that same year I believe in that same
 

13009
03:49:09,060 --> 03:49:11,389
that same year I believe in that same
year at least I'm pretty sure in 1961

13010
03:49:11,389 --> 03:49:11,399
year at least I'm pretty sure in 1961
 

13011
03:49:11,399 --> 03:49:13,490
year at least I'm pretty sure in 1961
they flew for the first time orbitaly in

13012
03:49:13,490 --> 03:49:13,500
they flew for the first time orbitaly in
 

13013
03:49:13,500 --> 03:49:15,889
they flew for the first time orbitaly in
1962's they weren't terribly far behind

13014
03:49:15,889 --> 03:49:15,899
1962's they weren't terribly far behind
 

13015
03:49:15,899 --> 03:49:17,269
1962's they weren't terribly far behind
to get a human into orbit like in the

13016
03:49:17,269 --> 03:49:17,279
to get a human into orbit like in the
 

13017
03:49:17,279 --> 03:49:18,349
to get a human into orbit like in the
grand scheme of things you know 10

13018
03:49:18,349 --> 03:49:18,359
grand scheme of things you know 10
 

13019
03:49:18,359 --> 03:49:20,510
grand scheme of things you know 10
months difference but at the same time

13020
03:49:20,510 --> 03:49:20,520
months difference but at the same time
 

13021
03:49:20,520 --> 03:49:21,830
months difference but at the same time
like the fact that Soviet Union just

13022
03:49:21,830 --> 03:49:21,840
like the fact that Soviet Union just
 

13023
03:49:21,840 --> 03:49:23,510
like the fact that Soviet Union just
went straight to Flying someone into

13024
03:49:23,510 --> 03:49:23,520
went straight to Flying someone into
 

13025
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:26,450
went straight to Flying someone into
orbit is Monumental and I'm sure they

13026
03:49:26,450 --> 03:49:26,460
orbit is Monumental and I'm sure they
 

13027
03:49:26,460 --> 03:49:28,190
orbit is Monumental and I'm sure they
did not do excessive

13028
03:49:28,190 --> 03:49:28,200
did not do excessive
 

13029
03:49:28,200 --> 03:49:31,309
did not do excessive
uh rigorous testing here because there

13030
03:49:31,309 --> 03:49:31,319
uh rigorous testing here because there
 

13031
03:49:31,319 --> 03:49:33,530
uh rigorous testing here because there
is a space race and you have the first

13032
03:49:33,530 --> 03:49:33,540
is a space race and you have the first
 

13033
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:37,450
is a space race and you have the first
is important just imagine being Yuri

13034
03:49:37,450 --> 03:49:37,460
is important just imagine being Yuri
 

13035
03:49:37,460 --> 03:49:39,170
is important just imagine being Yuri
what do you say when they're like

13036
03:49:39,170 --> 03:49:39,180
what do you say when they're like
 

13037
03:49:39,180 --> 03:49:40,550
what do you say when they're like
launching them like let's go or

13038
03:49:40,550 --> 03:49:40,560
launching them like let's go or
 

13039
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:43,250
launching them like let's go or
something like uh I mean you're taking

13040
03:49:43,250 --> 03:49:43,260
something like uh I mean you're taking
 

13041
03:49:43,260 --> 03:49:45,710
something like uh I mean you're taking
uh dude we're talking about you being on

13042
03:49:45,710 --> 03:49:45,720
uh dude we're talking about you being on
 

13043
03:49:45,720 --> 03:49:47,690
uh dude we're talking about you being on
Starship like you're taking a pretty big

13044
03:49:47,690 --> 03:49:47,700
Starship like you're taking a pretty big
 

13045
03:49:47,700 --> 03:49:51,769
Starship like you're taking a pretty big
risk being launched out into orbit oh

13046
03:49:51,769 --> 03:49:51,779
risk being launched out into orbit oh
 

13047
03:49:51,779 --> 03:49:54,830
risk being launched out into orbit oh
hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri

13048
03:49:54,830 --> 03:49:54,840
hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri
 

13049
03:49:54,840 --> 03:49:57,290
hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri
went through so Yuri's Yuri the crazy

13050
03:49:57,290 --> 03:49:57,300
went through so Yuri's Yuri the crazy
 

13051
03:49:57,300 --> 03:49:59,210
went through so Yuri's Yuri the crazy
thing remember those match sticks we

13052
03:49:59,210 --> 03:49:59,220
thing remember those match sticks we
 

13053
03:49:59,220 --> 03:50:00,410
thing remember those match sticks we
talked about yeah you know there's

13054
03:50:00,410 --> 03:50:00,420
talked about yeah you know there's
 

13055
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:02,990
talked about yeah you know there's
there's 20 Main combustion Chambers on

13056
03:50:02,990 --> 03:50:03,000
there's 20 Main combustion Chambers on
 

13057
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:06,889
there's 20 Main combustion Chambers on
soyuz and there's four and 12 more

13058
03:50:06,889 --> 03:50:06,899
soyuz and there's four and 12 more
 

13059
03:50:06,899 --> 03:50:09,110
soyuz and there's four and 12 more
Vernier engines that all need to be lit

13060
03:50:09,110 --> 03:50:09,120
Vernier engines that all need to be lit
 

13061
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:10,729
Vernier engines that all need to be lit
so you're riding you're sitting on top

13062
03:50:10,729 --> 03:50:10,739
so you're riding you're sitting on top
 

13063
03:50:10,739 --> 03:50:12,950
so you're riding you're sitting on top
of this this booster and they light all

13064
03:50:12,950 --> 03:50:12,960
of this this booster and they light all
 

13065
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:15,530
of this this booster and they light all
of those 32 combustion Chambers on the

13066
03:50:15,530 --> 03:50:15,540
of those 32 combustion Chambers on the
 

13067
03:50:15,540 --> 03:50:18,349
of those 32 combustion Chambers on the
ground and then it has this insane

13068
03:50:18,349 --> 03:50:18,359
ground and then it has this insane
 

13069
03:50:18,359 --> 03:50:20,330
ground and then it has this insane
separation process between what the

13070
03:50:20,330 --> 03:50:20,340
separation process between what the
 

13071
03:50:20,340 --> 03:50:21,530
separation process between what the
Soviet Union would call the first stage

13072
03:50:21,530 --> 03:50:21,540
Soviet Union would call the first stage
 

13073
03:50:21,540 --> 03:50:22,910
Soviet Union would call the first stage
in the second stages but we would call

13074
03:50:22,910 --> 03:50:22,920
in the second stages but we would call
 

13075
03:50:22,920 --> 03:50:25,250
in the second stages but we would call
it like the core stage in the boosters

13076
03:50:25,250 --> 03:50:25,260
it like the core stage in the boosters
 

13077
03:50:25,260 --> 03:50:27,590
it like the core stage in the boosters
um they all for these boosters have to

13078
03:50:27,590 --> 03:50:27,600
um they all for these boosters have to
 

13079
03:50:27,600 --> 03:50:29,950
um they all for these boosters have to
peel away perfectly from the core stage

13080
03:50:29,950 --> 03:50:29,960
peel away perfectly from the core stage
 

13081
03:50:29,960 --> 03:50:31,969
peel away perfectly from the core stage
simultaneously you know if one of them

13082
03:50:31,969 --> 03:50:31,979
simultaneously you know if one of them
 

13083
03:50:31,979 --> 03:50:34,190
simultaneously you know if one of them
sticks on Mission failed if one of them

the other tank you know you're it's it's
 

13089
03:50:38,220 --> 03:50:41,990
the other tank you know you're it's it's
a goner so the the staging process of of

13090
03:50:41,990 --> 03:50:42,000
a goner so the the staging process of of
 

13091
03:50:42,000 --> 03:50:44,210
a goner so the the staging process of of
the soyuz is is insane to me that that

13092
03:50:44,210 --> 03:50:44,220
the soyuz is is insane to me that that
 

13093
03:50:44,220 --> 03:50:46,610
the soyuz is is insane to me that that
ended up working out

ended up working out
 

13095
03:50:46,620 --> 03:50:50,090
ended up working out
I I was just the the technology in

13096
03:50:50,090 --> 03:50:50,100
I I was just the the technology in
 

13097
03:50:50,100 --> 03:50:52,190
I I was just the the technology in
stories and I mean more or less that

13098
03:50:52,190 --> 03:50:52,200
stories and I mean more or less that
 

13099
03:50:52,200 --> 03:50:54,590

think about Russ Cosmos as it stands
 

13115
03:51:10,800 --> 03:51:14,570
think about Russ Cosmos as it stands
today uh it's history and its future

since then like and it started I feel

13154
03:51:52,610 --> 03:51:52,620
since then like and it started I feel
 

13155
03:51:52,620 --> 03:51:55,370
since then like and it started I feel
like in 2018 honestly I think that's

13156
03:51:55,370 --> 03:51:55,380
like in 2018 honestly I think that's
 

13157
03:51:55,380 --> 03:51:56,929
like in 2018 honestly I think that's
kind of one things that's the first time

I specifically remember a pretty nasty
 

13161
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:01,670
I specifically remember a pretty nasty
like thing happened in 2018 I think it

13162
03:52:01,670 --> 03:52:01,680
like thing happened in 2018 I think it
 

13163
03:52:01,680 --> 03:52:04,010
like thing happened in 2018 I think it
was a soyuz mission to the International

03:52:04,010 --> 03:52:04,020
was a soyuz mission to the International
 

13165

was a soyuz mission to the International
Space Station had one of the boosters

13166
03:52:05,510 --> 03:52:05,520

13167
03:52:05,520 --> 03:52:07,690
Space Station had one of the boosters
not detached and had to have an abort

13168
03:52:07,690 --> 03:52:07,700
not detached and had to have an abort
 

13169
03:52:07,700 --> 03:52:11,269
not detached and had to have an abort
but you know that that happened then all

13170
03:52:11,269 --> 03:52:11,279
but you know that that happened then all
 

13171
03:52:11,279 --> 03:52:12,710
but you know that that happened then all
of a sudden next thing you know there's

13172
03:52:12,710 --> 03:52:12,720
of a sudden next thing you know there's
 

13173
03:52:12,720 --> 03:52:14,750
of a sudden next thing you know there's
a progress being docked to the ISS a

13174
03:52:14,750 --> 03:52:14,760
a progress being docked to the ISS a
 

13175
03:52:14,760 --> 03:52:16,309
a progress being docked to the ISS a
couple years ago that spun the ISS

13176

03:52:17,779 --> 03:52:19,969
cartwheel the ISS out of control
followed a few months later the piers

13180
03:52:19,969 --> 03:52:19,979
followed a few months later the piers

in in as Russian segment uh there's well

13190
03:52:32,450 --> 03:52:32,460
in in as Russian segment uh there's well
 

13191
03:52:32,460 --> 03:52:33,889
in in as Russian segment uh there's well
I think the most recent one right now

13192
03:52:33,889 --> 03:52:33,899
I think the most recent one right now
 

13193
03:52:33,899 --> 03:52:35,929
I think the most recent one right now
there's a soyuz doc to the ISS that has

13194
03:52:35,929 --> 03:52:35,939
there's a soyuz doc to the ISS that has
 

13195
03:52:35,939 --> 03:52:37,550
there's a soyuz doc to the ISS that has
a puncture in it and it's leaking

13196
03:52:37,550 --> 03:52:37,560
a puncture in it and it's leaking
 

13197
03:52:37,560 --> 03:52:40,190
a puncture in it and it's leaking
coolant and will not be returning humans

13198
03:52:40,190 --> 03:52:40,200
coolant and will not be returning humans
 

13199
03:52:40,200 --> 03:52:41,809
coolant and will not be returning humans
on it so they're actually having to fly

13200
03:52:41,809 --> 03:52:41,819
on it so they're actually having to fly
 

13201
03:52:41,819 --> 03:52:44,570
on it so they're actually having to fly
up and uncrewed soyuz and that one

13202
03:52:44,570 --> 03:52:44,580
up and uncrewed soyuz and that one
 

13203
03:52:44,580 --> 03:52:46,670
up and uncrewed soyuz and that one
likely wasn't a manufacturing error it

13204
03:52:46,670 --> 03:52:46,680
likely wasn't a manufacturing error it
 

13205
03:52:46,680 --> 03:52:47,870
likely wasn't a manufacturing error it
probably was like a micro meteorite

13206
03:52:47,870 --> 03:52:47,880
probably was like a micro meteorite
 

13207

we don't know for sure yet
 

13211
03:52:52,160 --> 03:52:54,530
we don't know for sure yet
but it's just really been like this fall

13212
03:52:54,530 --> 03:52:54,540
but it's just really been like this fall
 

13213
03:52:54,540 --> 03:52:56,050
but it's just really been like this fall
from grace where

03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:10,790
bronze uh shuttle and the inergia rocket
were incredible had they been able to

13228
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:10,800
were incredible had they been able to
 

13229
03:53:10,800 --> 03:53:13,190
were incredible had they been able to
evolve that into Bronto and the reusable

13230
03:53:13,190 --> 03:53:13,200
evolve that into Bronto and the reusable
 

13231
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:15,170
evolve that into Bronto and the reusable
and ergia they had a fully reusable

13232
03:53:15,170 --> 03:53:15,180
and ergia they had a fully reusable
 

13233
03:53:15,180 --> 03:53:18,130
and ergia they had a fully reusable
energy on the drawing board and like I

13234
03:53:18,130 --> 03:53:18,140
energy on the drawing board and like I
 

13235
03:53:18,140 --> 03:53:20,150
energy on the drawing board and like I
honestly fully think they could have

13236
03:53:20,150 --> 03:53:20,160
honestly fully think they could have
 

13237
03:53:20,160 --> 03:53:22,610
honestly fully think they could have
done it is it possible to return to a

13238
03:53:22,610 --> 03:53:22,620
done it is it possible to return to a
 

13239
03:53:22,620 --> 03:53:23,870
done it is it possible to return to a
place where there is friendly

13240
03:53:23,870 --> 03:53:23,880
place where there is friendly
 

13241
03:53:23,880 --> 03:53:25,490
place where there is friendly
competition between nations that

13242
03:53:25,490 --> 03:53:25,500
competition between nations that
 

13243
03:53:25,500 --> 03:53:26,990
competition between nations that
ultimately

13244
03:53:26,990 --> 03:53:27,000
ultimately
 

13245
03:53:27,000 --> 03:53:28,210
ultimately
um

13246
03:53:28,210 --> 03:53:28,220
um
 

13247
03:53:28,220 --> 03:53:30,889
um
unites and inspires the peoples of these

13248
03:53:30,889 --> 03:53:30,899
unites and inspires the peoples of these
 

13249
03:53:30,899 --> 03:53:32,389
unites and inspires the peoples of these
different worlds these very different

13250
03:53:32,389 --> 03:53:32,399
different worlds these very different
 

13251
03:53:32,399 --> 03:53:35,870
different worlds these very different
worlds that have especially recently uh

13252
03:53:35,870 --> 03:53:35,880
worlds that have especially recently uh
 

13253
03:53:35,880 --> 03:53:37,790
worlds that have especially recently uh
come to conflict over the over the war

13254
03:53:37,790 --> 03:53:37,800
come to conflict over the over the war
 

13255
03:53:37,800 --> 03:53:41,330
come to conflict over the over the war
in Ukraine the tension builds uh the war

13256
03:53:41,330 --> 03:53:41,340
in Ukraine the tension builds uh the war
 

13257
03:53:41,340 --> 03:53:43,849
in Ukraine the tension builds uh the war
the conflict the suffering is actually

13258
03:53:43,849 --> 03:53:43,859
the conflict the suffering is actually
 

13259
03:53:43,859 --> 03:53:46,070
the conflict the suffering is actually
creating more and more division creating

13260
03:53:46,070 --> 03:53:46,080
creating more and more division creating
 

13261
03:53:46,080 --> 03:53:48,110
creating more and more division creating
more and more hate I think as we've

13262
03:53:48,110 --> 03:53:48,120
more and more hate I think as we've
 

13263
03:53:48,120 --> 03:53:49,550
more and more hate I think as we've
talked about I think science and

13264
03:53:49,550 --> 03:53:49,560
talked about I think science and
 

13265
03:53:49,560 --> 03:53:51,769
talked about I think science and
engineering and especially the most epic

13266
03:53:51,769 --> 03:53:51,779
engineering and especially the most epic
 

13267
03:53:51,779 --> 03:53:53,929
engineering and especially the most epic
version of engineering which is a

13268
03:53:53,929 --> 03:53:53,939
version of engineering which is a
 

13269
03:53:53,939 --> 03:53:56,469
version of engineering which is a
rocketry and space travel unites people

13270
03:53:56,469 --> 03:53:56,479
rocketry and space travel unites people
 

13271
03:53:56,479 --> 03:53:59,210
rocketry and space travel unites people
the United people even in a time of

13272
03:53:59,210 --> 03:53:59,220
the United people even in a time of
 

13273
03:53:59,220 --> 03:54:02,510
the United people even in a time of
tension conflict and War so do you have

13274
03:54:02,510 --> 03:54:02,520
tension conflict and War so do you have
 

13275
03:54:02,520 --> 03:54:06,110
tension conflict and War so do you have
a hope that we can return to that place

13276
03:54:06,110 --> 03:54:06,120
a hope that we can return to that place
 

13277
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:09,469
a hope that we can return to that place
I think historically spaceflight has

13278
03:54:09,469 --> 03:54:09,479
I think historically spaceflight has
 

13279
03:54:09,479 --> 03:54:11,750
I think historically spaceflight has
been one of the most bonding things you

13280
03:54:11,750 --> 03:54:11,760
been one of the most bonding things you
 

13281
03:54:11,760 --> 03:54:13,250
been one of the most bonding things you
know we look at we have countless

13282
03:54:13,250 --> 03:54:13,260
know we look at we have countless
 

13283
03:54:13,260 --> 03:54:15,590
know we look at we have countless
examples of you know Cold War enemies

13284
03:54:15,590 --> 03:54:15,600
examples of you know Cold War enemies
 

13285
03:54:15,600 --> 03:54:17,269
examples of you know Cold War enemies
coming together and working together

13286
03:54:17,269 --> 03:54:17,279
coming together and working together
 

13287
03:54:17,279 --> 03:54:19,370
coming together and working together
lending a hand

13288
03:54:19,370 --> 03:54:19,380
lending a hand
 

13289
03:54:19,380 --> 03:54:21,530
lending a hand
um Apollo 13 for example of course you

13290
03:54:21,530 --> 03:54:21,540
um Apollo 13 for example of course you
 

13291
03:54:21,540 --> 03:54:23,570
um Apollo 13 for example of course you
know there is the potential that who

13292
03:54:23,570 --> 03:54:23,580
know there is the potential that who
 

13293
03:54:23,580 --> 03:54:24,710
know there is the potential that who
knew where it was going to re-enter

13294
03:54:24,710 --> 03:54:24,720
knew where it was going to re-enter
 

13295
03:54:24,720 --> 03:54:26,450
knew where it was going to re-enter
since it was not in the planned

13296
03:54:26,450 --> 03:54:26,460
since it was not in the planned
 

13297
03:54:26,460 --> 03:54:28,790
since it was not in the planned
trajectory at all for re-entry and the

13298
03:54:28,790 --> 03:54:28,800
trajectory at all for re-entry and the
 

13299
03:54:28,800 --> 03:54:31,189
trajectory at all for re-entry and the
Soviet Union said hey wherever you know

13300
03:54:31,189 --> 03:54:31,199
Soviet Union said hey wherever you know
 

13301
03:54:31,199 --> 03:54:32,750
Soviet Union said hey wherever you know
wherever they land like we'll help you

13302
03:54:32,750 --> 03:54:32,760
wherever they land like we'll help you
 

13303
03:54:32,760 --> 03:54:34,429
wherever they land like we'll help you
guys out basically you know that was a

13304
03:54:34,429 --> 03:54:34,439
guys out basically you know that was a
 

13305
03:54:34,439 --> 03:54:37,309
guys out basically you know that was a
pretty big thing at the time obviously

13306
03:54:37,309 --> 03:54:37,319
pretty big thing at the time obviously
 

13307
03:54:37,319 --> 03:54:39,950
pretty big thing at the time obviously
um we also in 1975 saw the Apollo soyuz

13308
03:54:39,950 --> 03:54:39,960
um we also in 1975 saw the Apollo soyuz
 

13309
03:54:39,960 --> 03:54:42,050
um we also in 1975 saw the Apollo soyuz
Mission which was an Apollo spacecraft

13310
03:54:42,050 --> 03:54:42,060
Mission which was an Apollo spacecraft
 

13311
03:54:42,060 --> 03:54:45,229
Mission which was an Apollo spacecraft
docking with soyuz spacecraft first time

13312
03:54:45,229 --> 03:54:45,239
docking with soyuz spacecraft first time
 

13313
03:54:45,239 --> 03:54:47,030
docking with soyuz spacecraft first time
there's International collaboration and

13314
03:54:47,030 --> 03:54:47,040
there's International collaboration and
 

13315
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:50,389
there's International collaboration and
again 1975 still very admits the Cold

13316
03:54:50,389 --> 03:54:50,399
again 1975 still very admits the Cold
 

13317
03:54:50,399 --> 03:54:51,229
again 1975 still very admits the Cold
War

13318
03:54:51,229 --> 03:54:51,239
War
 

13319
03:54:51,239 --> 03:54:53,389
War
yet we have this collaboration

13320
03:54:53,389 --> 03:54:53,399
yet we have this collaboration
 

13321
03:54:53,399 --> 03:54:55,429
yet we have this collaboration
um that I don't know what else could

13322
03:54:55,429 --> 03:54:55,439
um that I don't know what else could
 

13323
03:54:55,439 --> 03:54:57,110
um that I don't know what else could
have done that you know I mean and think

13324
03:54:57,110 --> 03:54:57,120
have done that you know I mean and think
 

13325
03:54:57,120 --> 03:54:58,610
have done that you know I mean and think
about what it actually takes to do that

13326
03:54:58,610 --> 03:54:58,620
about what it actually takes to do that
 

13327
03:54:58,620 --> 03:55:00,590
about what it actually takes to do that
you have to come up with a a docking

13328
03:55:00,590 --> 03:55:00,600
you have to come up with a a docking
 

13329
03:55:00,600 --> 03:55:03,110
you have to come up with a a docking
module that is you you know like that

13330
03:55:03,110 --> 03:55:03,120
module that is you you know like that
 

13331
03:55:03,120 --> 03:55:04,849
module that is you you know like that
takes the two different air environments

13332
03:55:04,849 --> 03:55:04,859
takes the two different air environments
 

13333
03:55:04,859 --> 03:55:06,229
takes the two different air environments
and the two different docking systems

13334
03:55:06,229 --> 03:55:06,239
and the two different docking systems
 

13335
03:55:06,239 --> 03:55:08,330
and the two different docking systems
and talk to the engineers and Mission

13336
03:55:08,330 --> 03:55:08,340
and talk to the engineers and Mission
 

13337
03:55:08,340 --> 03:55:10,250
and talk to the engineers and Mission
planners and figure out you know train

13338
03:55:10,250 --> 03:55:10,260
planners and figure out you know train
 

13339
03:55:10,260 --> 03:55:12,349
planners and figure out you know train
together the the cosmonauts and the

13340
03:55:12,349 --> 03:55:12,359
together the the cosmonauts and the
 

13341
03:55:12,359 --> 03:55:13,729
together the the cosmonauts and the
astronauts trained together and got to

13342
03:55:13,729 --> 03:55:13,739
astronauts trained together and got to
 

13343
03:55:13,739 --> 03:55:14,809
astronauts trained together and got to
know each other they were crossing

13344
03:55:14,809 --> 03:55:14,819
know each other they were crossing
 

13345
03:55:14,819 --> 03:55:16,849
know each other they were crossing
boundaries and borders and coming

13346
03:55:16,849 --> 03:55:16,859
boundaries and borders and coming
 

13347
03:55:16,859 --> 03:55:18,530
boundaries and borders and coming
together for this Mission and even if it

13348
03:55:18,530 --> 03:55:18,540
together for this Mission and even if it
 

13349
03:55:18,540 --> 03:55:20,809
together for this Mission and even if it
was totally a Fluff piece like even if

13350
03:55:20,809 --> 03:55:20,819
was totally a Fluff piece like even if
 

13351
03:55:20,819 --> 03:55:22,809
was totally a Fluff piece like even if
it was totally this like you know

13352
03:55:22,809 --> 03:55:22,819
it was totally this like you know
 

13353
03:55:22,819 --> 03:55:25,429
it was totally this like you know
cynical you know just

13354
03:55:25,429 --> 03:55:25,439
cynical you know just
 

13355
03:55:25,439 --> 03:55:27,410
cynical you know just
trying to make a pretty face for

13356
03:55:27,410 --> 03:55:27,420
trying to make a pretty face for
 

13357
03:55:27,420 --> 03:55:28,849
trying to make a pretty face for
everybody for the for the cameras or

13358
03:55:28,849 --> 03:55:28,859
everybody for the for the cameras or
 

13359
03:55:28,859 --> 03:55:30,889
everybody for the for the cameras or
something obviously it still had an

13360
03:55:30,889 --> 03:55:30,899
something obviously it still had an
 

13361
03:55:30,899 --> 03:55:33,830
something obviously it still had an
impact yeah it's a symbolic impact but

13362
03:55:33,830 --> 03:55:33,840
impact yeah it's a symbolic impact but
 

13363
03:55:33,840 --> 03:55:35,450
impact yeah it's a symbolic impact but
there's also the Practical impact I mean

13364
03:55:35,450 --> 03:55:35,460
there's also the Practical impact I mean
 

13365
03:55:35,460 --> 03:55:36,889
there's also the Practical impact I mean
a lot of people have to work together

13366
03:55:36,889 --> 03:55:36,899
a lot of people have to work together
 

13367
03:55:36,899 --> 03:55:39,050
a lot of people have to work together
yes and that and that has a ripple

13368
03:55:39,050 --> 03:55:39,060
yes and that and that has a ripple
 

13369
03:55:39,060 --> 03:55:40,969
yes and that and that has a ripple
effect on the culture on the different

13370
03:55:40,969 --> 03:55:40,979
effect on the culture on the different
 

13371
03:55:40,979 --> 03:55:42,229
effect on the culture on the different
engineers

13372
03:55:42,229 --> 03:55:42,239
engineers
 

13373
03:55:42,239 --> 03:55:45,349
engineers
uh yeah 100 and even just the the

13374
03:55:45,349 --> 03:55:45,359
uh yeah 100 and even just the the
 

13375
03:55:45,359 --> 03:55:47,090
uh yeah 100 and even just the the
astronauts and the cosmonauts involved

13376
03:55:47,090 --> 03:55:47,100
astronauts and the cosmonauts involved
 

13377
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:49,309
astronauts and the cosmonauts involved
like think about what what probably went

13378
03:55:49,309 --> 03:55:49,319
like think about what what probably went
 

13379
03:55:49,319 --> 03:55:50,870
like think about what what probably went
through their heads during this process

13380
03:55:50,870 --> 03:55:50,880
through their heads during this process
 

13381
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:52,910
through their heads during this process
of like going from oh my God I'm gonna

13382
03:55:52,910 --> 03:55:52,920
of like going from oh my God I'm gonna
 

13383
03:55:52,920 --> 03:55:55,250
of like going from oh my God I'm gonna
have to work with them to getting to

13384
03:55:55,250 --> 03:55:55,260
have to work with them to getting to
 

13385
03:55:55,260 --> 03:55:57,410
have to work with them to getting to
know them and then sharing meals in

13386
03:55:57,410 --> 03:55:57,420
know them and then sharing meals in
 

13387
03:55:57,420 --> 03:56:00,349
know them and then sharing meals in
space like that's a crazy transformation

13388
03:56:00,349 --> 03:56:00,359
space like that's a crazy transformation
 

13389
03:56:00,359 --> 03:56:03,530
space like that's a crazy transformation
of of timelines and I would love to I I

13390
03:56:03,530 --> 03:56:03,540
of of timelines and I would love to I I
 

13391
03:56:03,540 --> 03:56:05,630
of of timelines and I would love to I I
do think that spaceflight has the the

13392
03:56:05,630 --> 03:56:05,640
do think that spaceflight has the the
 

13393
03:56:05,640 --> 03:56:07,309
do think that spaceflight has the the
ability to to bond us and unite us

13394
03:56:07,309 --> 03:56:07,319
ability to to bond us and unite us
 

13395
03:56:07,319 --> 03:56:08,450
ability to to bond us and unite us
because it is

13396
03:56:08,450 --> 03:56:08,460
because it is
 

13397
03:56:08,460 --> 03:56:10,429
because it is
ultimately you know this little tiny

13398
03:56:10,429 --> 03:56:10,439
ultimately you know this little tiny
 

13399
03:56:10,439 --> 03:56:11,990
ultimately you know this little tiny
little planet we're floating around on

13400
03:56:11,990 --> 03:56:12,000
little planet we're floating around on
 

13401
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:14,269
little planet we're floating around on
you know it's the only it is the

13402
03:56:14,269 --> 03:56:14,279
you know it's the only it is the
 

13403
03:56:14,279 --> 03:56:16,130
you know it's the only it is the
boundary that we all share you know you

13404
03:56:16,130 --> 03:56:16,140
boundary that we all share you know you
 

13405
03:56:16,140 --> 03:56:18,469
boundary that we all share you know you
only can you it only takes you getting

13406
03:56:18,469 --> 03:56:18,479
only can you it only takes you getting
 

13407
03:56:18,479 --> 03:56:19,969
only can you it only takes you getting
off this planet to realize oh my God

13408
03:56:19,969 --> 03:56:19,979
off this planet to realize oh my God
 

13409
03:56:19,979 --> 03:56:22,250
off this planet to realize oh my God
we're all neighbors we're all living in

13410
03:56:22,250 --> 03:56:22,260
we're all neighbors we're all living in
 

13411
03:56:22,260 --> 03:56:25,010
we're all neighbors we're all living in
the same house together and

13412
03:56:25,010 --> 03:56:25,020
the same house together and
 

13413
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:27,410
the same house together and
I I do think ultimately you know as we

13414
03:56:27,410 --> 03:56:27,420
I I do think ultimately you know as we
 

13415
03:56:27,420 --> 03:56:29,689
I I do think ultimately you know as we
continue to uh expand our Horizons and

13416
03:56:29,689 --> 03:56:29,699
continue to uh expand our Horizons and
 

13417
03:56:29,699 --> 03:56:31,910
continue to uh expand our Horizons and
expand our exploration that it has the

13418
03:56:31,910 --> 03:56:31,920
expand our exploration that it has the
 

13419
03:56:31,920 --> 03:56:34,370
expand our exploration that it has the
potential to to unite us more than than

13420
03:56:34,370 --> 03:56:34,380
potential to to unite us more than than
 

13421
03:56:34,380 --> 03:56:36,710
potential to to unite us more than than
it has the potential to divide us so one

13422
03:56:36,710 --> 03:56:36,720
it has the potential to divide us so one
 

13423
03:56:36,720 --> 03:56:38,870
it has the potential to divide us so one
of the potential conflicts of the 21st

13424
03:56:38,870 --> 03:56:38,880
of the potential conflicts of the 21st
 

13425
03:56:38,880 --> 03:56:43,550
of the potential conflicts of the 21st
century that I think everyone wants to

13426
03:56:43,550 --> 03:56:43,560
century that I think everyone wants to
 

13427
03:56:43,560 --> 03:56:45,830
century that I think everyone wants to
avoid both in the cyberspace and in the

13428
03:56:45,830 --> 03:56:45,840
avoid both in the cyberspace and in the
 

13429
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:48,469
avoid both in the cyberspace and in the
hot War space Cold War Hot War all kinds

13430
03:56:48,469 --> 03:56:48,479
hot War space Cold War Hot War all kinds
 

13431
03:56:48,479 --> 03:56:51,650
hot War space Cold War Hot War all kinds
of War all kinds of economic conflict as

13432
03:56:51,650 --> 03:56:51,660
of War all kinds of economic conflict as
 

13433
03:56:51,660 --> 03:56:54,469
of War all kinds of economic conflict as
with between the United States and China

13434
03:56:54,469 --> 03:56:54,479
with between the United States and China
 

13435
03:56:54,479 --> 03:56:56,929
with between the United States and China
so China is

13436
03:56:56,929 --> 03:56:56,939
so China is
 

13437
03:56:56,939 --> 03:56:59,750
so China is
going full steam ahead in developing a

13438
03:56:59,750 --> 03:56:59,760
going full steam ahead in developing a
 

13439
03:56:59,760 --> 03:57:01,969
going full steam ahead in developing a
space program doing a lot of incredible

13440
03:57:01,969 --> 03:57:01,979
space program doing a lot of incredible
 

13441
03:57:01,979 --> 03:57:05,030
space program doing a lot of incredible
work like you mentioned uh 64 launches

13442
03:57:05,030 --> 03:57:05,040
work like you mentioned uh 64 launches
 

13443
03:57:05,040 --> 03:57:09,110
work like you mentioned uh 64 launches
in 2022 with two failures

13444
03:57:09,110 --> 03:57:09,120
in 2022 with two failures
 

13445
03:57:09,120 --> 03:57:12,050
in 2022 with two failures
but you know Moving Straight Ahead

13446
03:57:12,050 --> 03:57:12,060
but you know Moving Straight Ahead
 

13447
03:57:12,060 --> 03:57:12,670
but you know Moving Straight Ahead
um

13448
03:57:12,670 --> 03:57:12,680
um
 

13449
03:57:12,680 --> 03:57:15,170
um
we had a lot of startups like a lot of

13450
03:57:15,170 --> 03:57:15,180
we had a lot of startups like a lot of
 

13451
03:57:15,180 --> 03:57:16,670
we had a lot of startups like a lot of
the launches were from brand new

13452
03:57:16,670 --> 03:57:16,680
the launches were from brand new
 

13453
03:57:16,680 --> 03:57:19,130
the launches were from brand new
companies so to have two failures out of

13454
03:57:19,130 --> 03:57:19,140
companies so to have two failures out of
 

13455
03:57:19,140 --> 03:57:21,710
companies so to have two failures out of
64. I mean that's still if you look at

13456
03:57:21,710 --> 03:57:21,720
64. I mean that's still if you look at
 

13457
03:57:21,720 --> 03:57:24,469
64. I mean that's still if you look at
operational launches it was flawless

13458
03:57:24,469 --> 03:57:24,479
operational launches it was flawless
 

13459
03:57:24,479 --> 03:57:26,990
operational launches it was flawless
do you see a pathway

13460
03:57:26,990 --> 03:57:27,000
do you see a pathway
 

13461
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:29,630
do you see a pathway
where there's again in that same way

13462
03:57:29,630 --> 03:57:29,640
where there's again in that same way
 

13463
03:57:29,640 --> 03:57:31,250
where there's again in that same way
collaboration

13464
03:57:31,250 --> 03:57:31,260
collaboration
 

13465
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:34,610
collaboration
or a friendly competition between all

13466
03:57:34,610 --> 03:57:34,620
or a friendly competition between all
 

13467
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:37,490
or a friendly competition between all
the different companies and nations of

13468
03:57:37,490 --> 03:57:37,500
the different companies and nations of
 

13469
03:57:37,500 --> 03:57:39,650
the different companies and nations of
the United States and China in the in

13470
03:57:39,650 --> 03:57:39,660
the United States and China in the in
 

13471
03:57:39,660 --> 03:57:43,849
the United States and China in the in
the next as we push towards the moon uh

13472
03:57:43,849 --> 03:57:43,859
the next as we push towards the moon uh
 

13473
03:57:43,859 --> 03:57:47,990
the next as we push towards the moon uh
Mars and Beyond I held a dumb hope that

13474
03:57:47,990 --> 03:57:48,000
Mars and Beyond I held a dumb hope that
 

13475
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:49,849
Mars and Beyond I held a dumb hope that
China would actually be allowed to sign

13476
03:57:49,849 --> 03:57:49,859
China would actually be allowed to sign
 

13477
03:57:49,859 --> 03:57:51,950
China would actually be allowed to sign
onto the Artemis Accord to be able to

13478
03:57:51,950 --> 03:57:51,960
onto the Artemis Accord to be able to
 

13479
03:57:51,960 --> 03:57:54,469
onto the Artemis Accord to be able to
take part in this next step towards the

13480
03:57:54,469 --> 03:57:54,479
take part in this next step towards the
 

13481
03:57:54,479 --> 03:57:57,229
take part in this next step towards the
moon and just imagine if like if they

13482
03:57:57,229 --> 03:57:57,239
moon and just imagine if like if they
 

13483
03:57:57,239 --> 03:57:59,510
moon and just imagine if like if they
provided a you know a propulsion module

13484
03:57:59,510 --> 03:57:59,520
provided a you know a propulsion module
 

13485
03:57:59,520 --> 03:58:00,950
provided a you know a propulsion module
or a Lander or something and we actually

13486
03:58:00,950 --> 03:58:00,960
or a Lander or something and we actually
 

13487
03:58:00,960 --> 03:58:02,389
or a Lander or something and we actually
came together to land on the Moon

13488
03:58:02,389 --> 03:58:02,399
came together to land on the Moon
 

13489
03:58:02,399 --> 03:58:04,729
came together to land on the Moon
instead of having another space race you

13490
03:58:04,729 --> 03:58:04,739
instead of having another space race you
 

13491
03:58:04,739 --> 03:58:06,650
instead of having another space race you
know it's like it would have been so

13492
03:58:06,650 --> 03:58:06,660
know it's like it would have been so
 

13493
03:58:06,660 --> 03:58:08,330
know it's like it would have been so
cool and

13494
03:58:08,330 --> 03:58:08,340
cool and
 

13495
03:58:08,340 --> 03:58:11,269
cool and
yeah I still am hopeful that

13496
03:58:11,269 --> 03:58:11,279
yeah I still am hopeful that
 

13497
03:58:11,279 --> 03:58:14,750
yeah I still am hopeful that
similar to to back in the cold war that

13498
03:58:14,750 --> 03:58:14,760
similar to to back in the cold war that
 

13499
03:58:14,760 --> 03:58:16,370
similar to to back in the cold war that
we might have something like that

13500
03:58:16,370 --> 03:58:16,380
we might have something like that
 

13501
03:58:16,380 --> 03:58:17,689
we might have something like that
someday where we actually are

13502
03:58:17,689 --> 03:58:17,699
someday where we actually are
 

13503
03:58:17,699 --> 03:58:19,610
someday where we actually are
collaborating and it feels like

13504
03:58:19,610 --> 03:58:19,620
collaborating and it feels like
 

13505
03:58:19,620 --> 03:58:20,809
collaborating and it feels like
sometimes we're really close to that and

13506
03:58:20,809 --> 03:58:20,819
sometimes we're really close to that and
 

13507
03:58:20,819 --> 03:58:22,309
sometimes we're really close to that and
then other times it feels like we're

13508
03:58:22,309 --> 03:58:22,319
then other times it feels like we're
 

13509
03:58:22,319 --> 03:58:24,290
then other times it feels like we're
really far from that and it just sucks

13510
03:58:24,290 --> 03:58:24,300
really far from that and it just sucks
 

13511
03:58:24,300 --> 03:58:26,570
really far from that and it just sucks
because I know and you know I try really

13512
03:58:26,570 --> 03:58:26,580
because I know and you know I try really
 

13513
03:58:26,580 --> 03:58:28,790
because I know and you know I try really
hard on my channel to to always separate

13514
03:58:28,790 --> 03:58:28,800
hard on my channel to to always separate
 

13515
03:58:28,800 --> 03:58:30,710
hard on my channel to to always separate
and celebrate the work being done you

13516
03:58:30,710 --> 03:58:30,720
and celebrate the work being done you
 

13517
03:58:30,720 --> 03:58:31,490
and celebrate the work being done you
know because at the end of the day

13518
03:58:31,490 --> 03:58:31,500
know because at the end of the day
 

13519
03:58:31,500 --> 03:58:33,650
know because at the end of the day
there's someone that's just going home

13520
03:58:33,650 --> 03:58:33,660
there's someone that's just going home
 

13521
03:58:33,660 --> 03:58:35,689
there's someone that's just going home
to their family clocking an hour is

13522
03:58:35,689 --> 03:58:35,699
to their family clocking an hour is
 

13523
03:58:35,699 --> 03:58:37,790
to their family clocking an hour is
working really hard on on pushing their

13524
03:58:37,790 --> 03:58:37,800
working really hard on on pushing their
 

13525
03:58:37,800 --> 03:58:39,950
working really hard on on pushing their
program and and doing engineering work

13526
03:58:39,950 --> 03:58:39,960
program and and doing engineering work
 

13527
03:58:39,960 --> 03:58:41,150
program and and doing engineering work
you know and it's

13528
03:58:41,150 --> 03:58:41,160
you know and it's
 

13529
03:58:41,160 --> 03:58:43,250
you know and it's
uh we don't get to choose where we're

13530
03:58:43,250 --> 03:58:43,260
uh we don't get to choose where we're
 

13531
03:58:43,260 --> 03:58:45,170
uh we don't get to choose where we're
born and what we're born into

13532
03:58:45,170 --> 03:58:45,180
born and what we're born into
 

13533
03:58:45,180 --> 03:58:47,330
born and what we're born into
um so I really like to avoid

13534
03:58:47,330 --> 03:58:47,340
um so I really like to avoid
 

13535
03:58:47,340 --> 03:58:49,070
um so I really like to avoid
you know the the political aspects of

13536
03:58:49,070 --> 03:58:49,080
you know the the political aspects of
 

13537
03:58:49,080 --> 03:58:50,510
you know the the political aspects of
things and the geopolitical aspects and

13538
03:58:50,510 --> 03:58:50,520
things and the geopolitical aspects and
 

13539
03:58:50,520 --> 03:58:52,790
things and the geopolitical aspects and
just appreciate the science and the the

13540
03:58:52,790 --> 03:58:52,800
just appreciate the science and the the
 

13541
03:58:52,800 --> 03:58:54,469
just appreciate the science and the the
science we're seeing and the the

13542
03:58:54,469 --> 03:58:54,479
science we're seeing and the the
 

13543
03:58:54,479 --> 03:58:56,689
science we're seeing and the the
progress that China's doing in the last

13544
03:58:56,689 --> 03:58:56,699
progress that China's doing in the last
 

13545
03:58:56,699 --> 03:58:59,689
progress that China's doing in the last
10 years is is very akin to the you know

13546
03:58:59,689 --> 03:58:59,699
10 years is is very akin to the you know
 

13547
03:58:59,699 --> 03:59:01,490
10 years is is very akin to the you know
early space flight programs and and with

13548
03:59:01,490 --> 03:59:01,500
early space flight programs and and with
 

13549
03:59:01,500 --> 03:59:03,349
early space flight programs and and with
the runway of like just going keeping on

13550
03:59:03,349 --> 03:59:03,359
the runway of like just going keeping on
 

13551
03:59:03,359 --> 03:59:04,910
the runway of like just going keeping on
going like I see no reason for them to

13552
03:59:04,910 --> 03:59:04,920
going like I see no reason for them to
 

13553
03:59:04,920 --> 03:59:07,189
going like I see no reason for them to
be slowing down so it's it's definitely

13554
03:59:07,189 --> 03:59:07,199
be slowing down so it's it's definitely
 

13555
03:59:07,199 --> 03:59:09,530
be slowing down so it's it's definitely
something to watch and and be interested

13556
03:59:09,530 --> 03:59:09,540
something to watch and and be interested
 

13557
03:59:09,540 --> 03:59:11,929
something to watch and and be interested
in and who knows I mean there really

13558
03:59:11,929 --> 03:59:11,939
in and who knows I mean there really
 

13559
03:59:11,939 --> 03:59:14,030
in and who knows I mean there really
genuinely might be a race to the moon

13560
03:59:14,030 --> 03:59:14,040
genuinely might be a race to the moon
 

13561
03:59:14,040 --> 03:59:15,530
genuinely might be a race to the moon
again and there really genuinely might

13562
03:59:15,530 --> 03:59:15,540
again and there really genuinely might
 

13563
03:59:15,540 --> 03:59:18,170
again and there really genuinely might
be a race to Mars

13564
03:59:18,170 --> 03:59:18,180
be a race to Mars
 

13565
03:59:18,180 --> 03:59:20,870
be a race to Mars
hey the part of me is excited about that

13566
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:20,880
hey the part of me is excited about that
 

13567
03:59:20,880 --> 03:59:24,769
hey the part of me is excited about that
because a race is is pretty cool yeah uh

13568
03:59:24,769 --> 03:59:24,779
because a race is is pretty cool yeah uh
 

13569
03:59:24,779 --> 03:59:26,710
because a race is is pretty cool yeah uh
but

13570
03:59:26,710 --> 03:59:26,720
but
 

13571
03:59:26,720 --> 03:59:29,330
but
hopefully it's friendly competition and

13572
03:59:29,330 --> 03:59:29,340
hopefully it's friendly competition and
 

13573
03:59:29,340 --> 03:59:32,210
hopefully it's friendly competition and
some collaboration it is true that uh

13574
03:59:32,210 --> 03:59:32,220
some collaboration it is true that uh
 

13575
03:59:32,220 --> 03:59:34,969
some collaboration it is true that uh
maybe I'm being a bit cynical but

13576
03:59:34,969 --> 03:59:34,979
maybe I'm being a bit cynical but
 

13577
03:59:34,979 --> 03:59:38,090
maybe I'm being a bit cynical but
Nations sometimes governments and

13578
03:59:38,090 --> 03:59:38,100
Nations sometimes governments and
 

13579
03:59:38,100 --> 03:59:39,830
Nations sometimes governments and
leaders of those governments sometimes

13580
03:59:39,830 --> 03:59:39,840
leaders of those governments sometimes
 

13581
03:59:39,840 --> 03:59:42,650
leaders of those governments sometimes
ruin things like you don't often have

13582
03:59:42,650 --> 03:59:42,660
ruin things like you don't often have
 

13583
03:59:42,660 --> 03:59:44,929
ruin things like you don't often have
I think statistically speaking it's

13584
03:59:44,929 --> 03:59:44,939
I think statistically speaking it's
 

13585
03:59:44,939 --> 03:59:47,689
I think statistically speaking it's
harder to have a leader of a nation that

13586
03:59:47,689 --> 03:59:47,699
harder to have a leader of a nation that
 

13587
03:59:47,699 --> 03:59:50,330
harder to have a leader of a nation that
looks beyond the political the

13588
03:59:50,330 --> 03:59:50,340
looks beyond the political the
 

13589
03:59:50,340 --> 03:59:52,490
looks beyond the political the
particular political bickering of that

13590
03:59:52,490 --> 03:59:52,500
particular political bickering of that
 

13591
03:59:52,500 --> 03:59:54,650
particular political bickering of that
nation and you have like a JFK type

13592
03:59:54,650 --> 03:59:54,660
nation and you have like a JFK type
 

13593
03:59:54,660 --> 03:59:56,090
nation and you have like a JFK type
character that really steps up and

13594
03:59:56,090 --> 03:59:56,100
character that really steps up and
 

13595
03:59:56,100 --> 03:59:58,429
character that really steps up and
inspires I think statistically speaking

13596
03:59:58,429 --> 03:59:58,439
inspires I think statistically speaking
 

13597
03:59:58,439 --> 04:00:00,229
inspires I think statistically speaking
it's better to have somebody like Elon

13598
04:00:00,229 --> 04:00:00,239
it's better to have somebody like Elon
 

13599
04:00:00,239 --> 04:00:01,610
it's better to have somebody like Elon
who's the leader of a company a

13600
04:00:01,610 --> 04:00:01,620
who's the leader of a company a
 

13601
04:00:01,620 --> 04:00:04,309
who's the leader of a company a
commercial effort that is able to look

13602
04:00:04,309 --> 04:00:04,319
commercial effort that is able to look
 

13603
04:00:04,319 --> 04:00:07,010
commercial effort that is able to look
beyond the borders of Nations and uh

13604
04:00:07,010 --> 04:00:07,020
beyond the borders of Nations and uh
 

13605
04:00:07,020 --> 04:00:09,590
beyond the borders of Nations and uh
certainly inspiring Educators like

13606
04:00:09,590 --> 04:00:09,600
certainly inspiring Educators like
 

13607
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:13,010
certainly inspiring Educators like
yourself uh to look beyond the borders

13608
04:00:13,010 --> 04:00:13,020
yourself uh to look beyond the borders
 

13609
04:00:13,020 --> 04:00:15,229
yourself uh to look beyond the borders
of those Nations and the geopolitical

13610
04:00:15,229 --> 04:00:15,239
of those Nations and the geopolitical
 

13611
04:00:15,239 --> 04:00:18,050
of those Nations and the geopolitical
conflicts and so on to uh to inspire the

13612
04:00:18,050 --> 04:00:18,060
conflicts and so on to uh to inspire the
 

13613
04:00:18,060 --> 04:00:20,630
conflicts and so on to uh to inspire the

made so much easier like you can have
more reach

13618

more reach
 

13619
04:00:25,080 --> 04:00:28,250
more reach
uh Tim Tim Dodd can have more reach than

13620
04:00:28,250 --> 04:00:28,260
uh Tim Tim Dodd can have more reach than
 

13621
04:00:28,260 --> 04:00:31,550
uh Tim Tim Dodd can have more reach than
NASA right like in terms of inspiring

13622
04:00:31,550 --> 04:00:31,560
NASA right like in terms of inspiring
 

13623
04:00:31,560 --> 04:00:33,590
NASA right like in terms of inspiring
the world and that's fascinating like

13624
04:00:33,590 --> 04:00:33,600
the world and that's fascinating like
 

13625
04:00:33,600 --> 04:00:35,809
the world and that's fascinating like
that that gives power to the individuals

13626
04:00:35,809 --> 04:00:35,819
that that gives power to the individuals
 

13627
04:00:35,819 --> 04:00:38,929
that that gives power to the individuals
let's see past the this the silly

let's see past the this the silly
 

13629
04:00:38,939 --> 04:00:41,150
let's see past the this the silly
short-term geopolitical conflicts yeah

13630
04:00:41,150 --> 04:00:41,160
short-term geopolitical conflicts yeah
 

13631
04:00:41,160 --> 04:00:44,570
short-term geopolitical conflicts yeah
that's the whole police yeah yeah

13632
04:00:44,570 --> 04:00:44,580
that's the whole police yeah yeah
 

13633
04:00:44,580 --> 04:00:46,790
that's the whole police yeah yeah
do you worry that there might be a war

13634
04:00:46,790 --> 04:00:46,800
do you worry that there might be a war
 

13635
04:00:46,800 --> 04:00:48,590
do you worry that there might be a war
in space

13636
04:00:48,590 --> 04:00:48,600
in space
 

13637
04:00:48,600 --> 04:00:50,929

so forget
 

13641
04:00:52,140 --> 04:00:54,410
so forget
so the interesting thing about these

13642
04:00:54,410 --> 04:00:54,420
so the interesting thing about these
 

13643
04:00:54,420 --> 04:00:56,990
so the interesting thing about these
Rockets right let's not forget rock is

13644
04:00:56,990 --> 04:00:57,000
Rockets right let's not forget rock is
 

13645
04:00:57,000 --> 04:01:00,290
Rockets right let's not forget rock is
uh do what Rockets do that they can

13646
04:01:00,290 --> 04:01:00,300
uh do what Rockets do that they can
 

13647
04:01:00,300 --> 04:01:04,090
uh do what Rockets do that they can
carry payloads that uh can be weapons

13648
04:01:04,090 --> 04:01:04,100
carry payloads that uh can be weapons
 

13649
04:01:04,100 --> 04:01:07,729
carry payloads that uh can be weapons
uh do you worry about this

13650
04:01:07,729 --> 04:01:07,739
uh do you worry about this
 

13651
04:01:07,739 --> 04:01:12,830
uh do you worry about this
I worry most about space wars as leading

13652
04:01:12,830 --> 04:01:12,840
I worry most about space wars as leading
 

13653
04:01:12,840 --> 04:01:15,710
I worry most about space wars as leading
to The Kessler syndrome of of having a

13654
04:01:15,710 --> 04:01:15,720
to The Kessler syndrome of of having a
 

13655
04:01:15,720 --> 04:01:17,630
to The Kessler syndrome of of having a
cascading effect of like a spacecraft

13656
04:01:17,630 --> 04:01:17,640
cascading effect of like a spacecraft
 

13657
04:01:17,640 --> 04:01:19,550
cascading effect of like a spacecraft
blowing up and then affecting another

13658
04:01:19,550 --> 04:01:19,560
blowing up and then affecting another
 

13659
04:01:19,560 --> 04:01:21,110
blowing up and then affecting another
spacecraft and that blows up and then

13660
04:01:21,110 --> 04:01:21,120
spacecraft and that blows up and then
 

13661
04:01:21,120 --> 04:01:22,790
spacecraft and that blows up and then
all of a sudden you're trapped and have

13662
04:01:22,790 --> 04:01:22,800
all of a sudden you're trapped and have
 

13663
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:24,650
all of a sudden you're trapped and have
this debris Cloud that we can't

13664
04:01:24,650 --> 04:01:24,660
this debris Cloud that we can't
 

13665
04:01:24,660 --> 04:01:26,510
this debris Cloud that we can't
you know go we can't go into space

13666
04:01:26,510 --> 04:01:26,520
you know go we can't go into space
 

13667
04:01:26,520 --> 04:01:28,250
you know go we can't go into space
anymore like that's my biggest because

13668
04:01:28,250 --> 04:01:28,260
anymore like that's my biggest because
 

13669
04:01:28,260 --> 04:01:29,630
anymore like that's my biggest because
frankly at this point we could

13670
04:01:29,630 --> 04:01:29,640
frankly at this point we could
 

13671
04:01:29,640 --> 04:01:31,010
frankly at this point we could
annihilate ourselves with terrestrial

13672
04:01:31,010 --> 04:01:31,020
annihilate ourselves with terrestrial
 

13673
04:01:31,020 --> 04:01:32,990
annihilate ourselves with terrestrial
stuff anyway you know what I mean we

13674
04:01:32,990 --> 04:01:33,000
stuff anyway you know what I mean we
 

13675
04:01:33,000 --> 04:01:37,189
stuff anyway you know what I mean we
don't need space to to end society as we

13676
04:01:37,189 --> 04:01:37,199
don't need space to to end society as we
 

13677
04:01:37,199 --> 04:01:38,929
don't need space to to end society as we
know it you know what I mean yeah

13678
04:01:38,929 --> 04:01:38,939
know it you know what I mean yeah
 

13679
04:01:38,939 --> 04:01:43,070
know it you know what I mean yeah
um but we do we could really and the the

13680
04:01:43,070 --> 04:01:43,080
um but we do we could really and the the
 

13681
04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:44,750
um but we do we could really and the the
good thing is I think everyone well

13682
04:01:44,750 --> 04:01:44,760
good thing is I think everyone well
 

13683
04:01:44,760 --> 04:01:46,849
good thing is I think everyone well
mostly everyone seems to understand this

13684
04:01:46,849 --> 04:01:46,859
mostly everyone seems to understand this
 

13685
04:01:46,859 --> 04:01:48,410
mostly everyone seems to understand this
for the most part that like

13686
04:01:48,410 --> 04:01:48,420
for the most part that like
 

13687
04:01:48,420 --> 04:01:51,469
for the most part that like
we really can't be risking blowing up

13688
04:01:51,469 --> 04:01:51,479
we really can't be risking blowing up
 

13689
04:01:51,479 --> 04:01:53,389
we really can't be risking blowing up
stuff in space and in low earth orbit

13690
04:01:53,389 --> 04:01:53,399
stuff in space and in low earth orbit
 

13691
04:01:53,399 --> 04:01:55,910
stuff in space and in low earth orbit
because it could easily like we could

13692
04:01:55,910 --> 04:01:55,920
because it could easily like we could
 

13693
04:01:55,920 --> 04:01:57,769
because it could easily like we could
strain ourselves from space assets for

13694
04:01:57,769 --> 04:01:57,779
strain ourselves from space assets for
 

13695
04:01:57,779 --> 04:01:58,910
strain ourselves from space assets for
50 years

13696
04:01:58,910 --> 04:01:58,920
50 years
 

13697
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:01,130
50 years
if oh can you elaborate on that so like

13698
04:02:01,130 --> 04:02:01,140
if oh can you elaborate on that so like
 

13699
04:02:01,140 --> 04:02:02,809
if oh can you elaborate on that so like
what is the danger of the debris there

13700
04:02:02,809 --> 04:02:02,819
what is the danger of the debris there
 

13701
04:02:02,819 --> 04:02:07,729
what is the danger of the debris there
that uh could jeopardize yeah so for

13702
04:02:07,729 --> 04:02:07,739
that uh could jeopardize yeah so for
 

13703
04:02:07,739 --> 04:02:09,050
that uh could jeopardize yeah so for
instance and it was only a couple years

13704
04:02:09,050 --> 04:02:09,060
instance and it was only a couple years
 

13705
04:02:09,060 --> 04:02:11,570
instance and it was only a couple years
ago Russia did an anti-satellite test on

13706
04:02:11,570 --> 04:02:11,580
ago Russia did an anti-satellite test on
 

13707
04:02:11,580 --> 04:02:14,450
ago Russia did an anti-satellite test on
a on an orbital there's a we've done

13708
04:02:14,450 --> 04:02:14,460
a on an orbital there's a we've done
 

13709
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:16,070
a on an orbital there's a we've done
this to the U.S has done this like I'm

13710
04:02:16,070 --> 04:02:16,080
this to the U.S has done this like I'm
 

13711
04:02:16,080 --> 04:02:18,889
this to the U.S has done this like I'm
not pinning it on them but we kind of

13712
04:02:18,889 --> 04:02:18,899
not pinning it on them but we kind of
 

13713
04:02:18,899 --> 04:02:20,630
not pinning it on them but we kind of
know nowadays like don't do

13714
04:02:20,630 --> 04:02:20,640
know nowadays like don't do
 

13715
04:02:20,640 --> 04:02:22,670
know nowadays like don't do
anti-satellite tests on orbital things

13716
04:02:22,670 --> 04:02:22,680
anti-satellite tests on orbital things
 

13717
04:02:22,680 --> 04:02:24,769
anti-satellite tests on orbital things
because those things stay in orbit you

13718
04:02:24,769 --> 04:02:24,779
because those things stay in orbit you
 

13719
04:02:24,779 --> 04:02:26,389
because those things stay in orbit you
know when you blow something up in space

13720
04:02:26,389 --> 04:02:26,399
know when you blow something up in space
 

13721
04:02:26,399 --> 04:02:28,969
know when you blow something up in space
it's not like you know people think you

13722
04:02:28,969 --> 04:02:28,979
it's not like you know people think you
 

13723
04:02:28,979 --> 04:02:31,070
it's not like you know people think you
know when in in space like oh you throw

13724
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,080
know when in in space like oh you throw
 

13725
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:32,269
know when in in space like oh you throw
a something that's just going to keep

13726
04:02:32,269 --> 04:02:32,279
a something that's just going to keep
 

13727
04:02:32,279 --> 04:02:34,309
a something that's just going to keep
going forever and ever and ever yeah I

13728
04:02:34,309 --> 04:02:34,319
going forever and ever and ever yeah I
 

13729
04:02:34,319 --> 04:02:36,110
going forever and ever and ever yeah I
mean that's in the in the sense that

13730
04:02:36,110 --> 04:02:36,120
mean that's in the in the sense that
 

13731
04:02:36,120 --> 04:02:38,389
mean that's in the in the sense that
it's not going to be slowed down due to

13732
04:02:38,389 --> 04:02:38,399
it's not going to be slowed down due to
 

13733
04:02:38,399 --> 04:02:40,010
it's not going to be slowed down due to
you know due to air resistance it's

13734
04:02:40,010 --> 04:02:40,020
you know due to air resistance it's
 

13735
04:02:40,020 --> 04:02:41,750
you know due to air resistance it's
going to continue to do that but it's

13736
04:02:41,750 --> 04:02:41,760
going to continue to do that but it's
 

13737
04:02:41,760 --> 04:02:43,250
going to continue to do that but it's
staying in orbit around the Earth like

13738
04:02:43,250 --> 04:02:43,260
staying in orbit around the Earth like
 

13739
04:02:43,260 --> 04:02:45,469
staying in orbit around the Earth like
you just slightly change the orbit of it

13740
04:02:45,469 --> 04:02:45,479
you just slightly change the orbit of it
 

13741
04:02:45,479 --> 04:02:47,330
you just slightly change the orbit of it
around earth when you throw a ball or

13742
04:02:47,330 --> 04:02:47,340
around earth when you throw a ball or
 

13743
04:02:47,340 --> 04:02:48,590
around earth when you throw a ball or
something you know

13744
04:02:48,590 --> 04:02:48,600
something you know
 

13745
04:02:48,600 --> 04:02:49,670
something you know
so

13746
04:02:49,670 --> 04:02:49,680
so
 

13747
04:02:49,680 --> 04:02:52,010
so
the scary thing is when you blow up a

13748
04:02:52,010 --> 04:02:52,020
the scary thing is when you blow up a
 

13749
04:02:52,020 --> 04:02:52,969
the scary thing is when you blow up a
satellite

13750
04:02:52,969 --> 04:02:52,979
satellite
 

13751
04:02:52,979 --> 04:02:55,130
satellite
all those pieces of that satellite are

13752
04:02:55,130 --> 04:02:55,140
all those pieces of that satellite are
 

13753
04:02:55,140 --> 04:02:56,510
all those pieces of that satellite are
now

13754
04:02:56,510 --> 04:02:56,520
now
 

13755
04:02:56,520 --> 04:02:59,809
now
millions of bullets in a halo around the

13756
04:02:59,809 --> 04:02:59,819
millions of bullets in a halo around the
 

13757
04:02:59,819 --> 04:03:00,710
millions of bullets in a halo around the
Earth

13758
04:03:00,710 --> 04:03:00,720
Earth
 

13759
04:03:00,720 --> 04:03:03,830
Earth
in a very specific Halo you know so some

13760
04:03:03,830 --> 04:03:03,840
in a very specific Halo you know so some
 

13761
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:06,110
in a very specific Halo you know so some
things get blown up uh faster you know

13762
04:03:06,110 --> 04:03:06,120
things get blown up uh faster you know
 

13763
04:03:06,120 --> 04:03:08,389
things get blown up uh faster you know
in according to its orbit faster so

13764
04:03:08,389 --> 04:03:08,399
in according to its orbit faster so
 

13765
04:03:08,399 --> 04:03:09,349
in according to its orbit faster so
they'll go a little bit higher

13766
04:03:09,349 --> 04:03:09,359
they'll go a little bit higher
 

13767
04:03:09,359 --> 04:03:11,630
they'll go a little bit higher
elliptically some things will get slowed

13768
04:03:11,630 --> 04:03:11,640
elliptically some things will get slowed
 

13769
04:03:11,640 --> 04:03:12,769
elliptically some things will get slowed
down in that explosion and actually

13770
04:03:12,769 --> 04:03:12,779
down in that explosion and actually
 

13771
04:03:12,779 --> 04:03:14,870
down in that explosion and actually
re-enter some things will go sideways

13772
04:03:14,870 --> 04:03:14,880
re-enter some things will go sideways
 

13773
04:03:14,880 --> 04:03:16,490
re-enter some things will go sideways
and change its inclination of that orbit

13774
04:03:16,490 --> 04:03:16,500
and change its inclination of that orbit
 

13775
04:03:16,500 --> 04:03:18,410
and change its inclination of that orbit
so you have this debris field but it

13776
04:03:18,410 --> 04:03:18,420
so you have this debris field but it
 

13777
04:03:18,420 --> 04:03:22,070
so you have this debris field but it
more or less becomes a band of like no

13778
04:03:22,070 --> 04:03:22,080
more or less becomes a band of like no
 

13779
04:03:22,080 --> 04:03:24,849
more or less becomes a band of like no
no you know like a big scary

13780
04:03:24,849 --> 04:03:24,859
no you know like a big scary
 

13781
04:03:24,859 --> 04:03:27,710
no you know like a big scary
sharp scary bullets that can destroy

13782
04:03:27,710 --> 04:03:27,720
sharp scary bullets that can destroy
 

13783
04:03:27,720 --> 04:03:29,570
sharp scary bullets that can destroy
another spacecraft since then all of a

13784
04:03:29,570 --> 04:03:29,580
another spacecraft since then all of a
 

13785
04:03:29,580 --> 04:03:30,889
another spacecraft since then all of a
sudden especially now starlink you know

13786
04:03:30,889 --> 04:03:30,899
sudden especially now starlink you know
 

13787
04:03:30,899 --> 04:03:31,969
sudden especially now starlink you know
we're talking about thousands and

13788
04:03:31,969 --> 04:03:31,979
we're talking about thousands and
 

13789
04:03:31,979 --> 04:03:33,469
we're talking about thousands and
thousands and thousands of satellites in

13790
04:03:33,469 --> 04:03:33,479
thousands and thousands of satellites in
 

13791
04:03:33,479 --> 04:03:34,370
thousands and thousands of satellites in
space

13792
04:03:34,370 --> 04:03:34,380
space
 

13793
04:03:34,380 --> 04:03:37,010
space
if all of a sudden one you know a couple

13794
04:03:37,010 --> 04:03:37,020
if all of a sudden one you know a couple
 

13795
04:03:37,020 --> 04:03:39,229
if all of a sudden one you know a couple
of them crash and and you know blow up

13796
04:03:39,229 --> 04:03:39,239
of them crash and and you know blow up
 

13797
04:03:39,239 --> 04:03:40,550
of them crash and and you know blow up
and obviously have all the shrapnel

13798
04:03:40,550 --> 04:03:40,560
and obviously have all the shrapnel
 

13799
04:03:40,560 --> 04:03:41,630
and obviously have all the shrapnel
going everywhere and then that hits

13800
04:03:41,630 --> 04:03:41,640
going everywhere and then that hits
 

13801
04:03:41,640 --> 04:03:43,490
going everywhere and then that hits
another satellite that creates shrapnel

13802
04:03:43,490 --> 04:03:43,500
another satellite that creates shrapnel
 

13803
04:03:43,500 --> 04:03:45,710
another satellite that creates shrapnel
you can literally blanket our entire low

13804
04:03:45,710 --> 04:03:45,720
you can literally blanket our entire low
 

13805
04:03:45,720 --> 04:03:46,849
you can literally blanket our entire low
earth orbit

13806
04:03:46,849 --> 04:03:46,859
earth orbit
 

13807
04:03:46,859 --> 04:03:51,950
earth orbit
and 17 500 mile an hour bullets

13808
04:03:51,950 --> 04:03:51,960
and 17 500 mile an hour bullets
 

13809
04:03:51,960 --> 04:03:53,269
and 17 500 mile an hour bullets
you know we're talking that the the

13810
04:03:53,269 --> 04:03:53,279
you know we're talking that the the
 

13811
04:03:53,279 --> 04:03:56,330
you know we're talking that the the
connection the kinetic energy in this is

13812
04:03:56,330 --> 04:03:56,340
connection the kinetic energy in this is
 

13813
04:03:56,340 --> 04:03:57,469
connection the kinetic energy in this is
so hard for people to Fathom because

13814
04:03:57,469 --> 04:03:57,479
so hard for people to Fathom because
 

13815
04:03:57,479 --> 04:03:59,090
so hard for people to Fathom because
that you know that's over 10 times

13816
04:03:59,090 --> 04:03:59,100
that you know that's over 10 times
 

13817
04:03:59,100 --> 04:04:01,309
that you know that's over 10 times
faster than most like rifle bullets and

13818
04:04:01,309 --> 04:04:01,319
faster than most like rifle bullets and
 

13819
04:04:01,319 --> 04:04:03,410
faster than most like rifle bullets and
even like a big 50 cal

13820
04:04:03,410 --> 04:04:03,420
even like a big 50 cal
 

13821
04:04:03,420 --> 04:04:05,870
even like a big 50 cal
is not going to be you know we're still

13822
04:04:05,870 --> 04:04:05,880
is not going to be you know we're still
 

13823
04:04:05,880 --> 04:04:07,610
is not going to be you know we're still
talking about about 10 percent

13824
04:04:07,610 --> 04:04:07,620
talking about about 10 percent
 

13825
04:04:07,620 --> 04:04:09,469
talking about about 10 percent
that so when you think about the kinetic

13826
04:04:09,469 --> 04:04:09,479
that so when you think about the kinetic
 

13827
04:04:09,479 --> 04:04:12,710
that so when you think about the kinetic
energy it's insane so a Fleck of paint

13828
04:04:12,710 --> 04:04:12,720
energy it's insane so a Fleck of paint
 

13829
04:04:12,720 --> 04:04:15,170
energy it's insane so a Fleck of paint
can go through panes of glass

13830
04:04:15,170 --> 04:04:15,180
can go through panes of glass
 

13831
04:04:15,180 --> 04:04:18,229
can go through panes of glass
at that velocity you know a little piece

13832
04:04:18,229 --> 04:04:18,239
at that velocity you know a little piece
 

13833
04:04:18,239 --> 04:04:20,210
at that velocity you know a little piece
of metal can puncture you know blow

13834
04:04:20,210 --> 04:04:20,220
of metal can puncture you know blow
 

13835
04:04:20,220 --> 04:04:21,889
of metal can puncture you know blow
straight through

13836
04:04:21,889 --> 04:04:21,899
straight through
 

13837
04:04:21,899 --> 04:04:23,750
straight through
so like

13838
04:04:23,750 --> 04:04:23,760
so like
 

13839
04:04:23,760 --> 04:04:27,229
so like
so our actions that seem small so small

13840
04:04:27,229 --> 04:04:27,239
so our actions that seem small so small
 

13841
04:04:27,239 --> 04:04:29,630
so our actions that seem small so small
scale military actions

13842
04:04:29,630 --> 04:04:29,640
scale military actions
 

13843
04:04:29,640 --> 04:04:31,910
scale military actions
can have uh

13844
04:04:31,910 --> 04:04:31,920
can have uh
 

13845
04:04:31,920 --> 04:04:34,790
can have uh
can have dire detrimental effects to the

13846
04:04:34,790 --> 04:04:34,800
can have dire detrimental effects to the
 

13847
04:04:34,800 --> 04:04:36,710
can have dire detrimental effects to the
whole Space Program like Global Space

13848
04:04:36,710 --> 04:04:36,720
whole Space Program like Global Space
 

13849
04:04:36,720 --> 04:04:39,290
whole Space Program like Global Space
Program oh yeah it can affect everything

13850
04:04:39,290 --> 04:04:39,300
Program oh yeah it can affect everything
 

13851
04:04:39,300 --> 04:04:41,510
Program oh yeah it can affect everything
and everyone including the like

13852
04:04:41,510 --> 04:04:41,520
and everyone including the like
 

13853
04:04:41,520 --> 04:04:43,910
and everyone including the like
including satellites oh yeah especially

13854
04:04:43,910 --> 04:04:43,920
including satellites oh yeah especially
 

13855
04:04:43,920 --> 04:04:46,670
including satellites oh yeah especially
satellites like that's why I mean the

13856
04:04:46,670 --> 04:04:46,680
satellites like that's why I mean the
 

13857
04:04:46,680 --> 04:04:48,110
satellites like that's why I mean the
good and the bad thing is the good thing

13858
04:04:48,110 --> 04:04:48,120
good and the bad thing is the good thing
 

13859
04:04:48,120 --> 04:04:50,450
good and the bad thing is the good thing
is a lot of satellites don't operate in

13860
04:04:50,450 --> 04:04:50,460
is a lot of satellites don't operate in
 

13861
04:04:50,460 --> 04:04:52,849
is a lot of satellites don't operate in
low earth orbit like a lot of uh the the

13862
04:04:52,849 --> 04:04:52,859
low earth orbit like a lot of uh the the
 

13863
04:04:52,859 --> 04:04:54,410
low earth orbit like a lot of uh the the
ones that we use day to day a lot of

13864
04:04:54,410 --> 04:04:54,420
ones that we use day to day a lot of
 

13865
04:04:54,420 --> 04:04:55,550
ones that we use day to day a lot of
them are

13866
04:04:55,550 --> 04:04:55,560
them are
 

13867
04:04:55,560 --> 04:04:57,889
them are
and medium earth orbit like the GPS or

13868
04:04:57,889 --> 04:04:57,899
and medium earth orbit like the GPS or
 

13869
04:04:57,899 --> 04:05:00,590
and medium earth orbit like the GPS or
their geostationary which are way way

13870
04:05:00,590 --> 04:05:00,600
their geostationary which are way way
 

13871
04:05:00,600 --> 04:05:03,530
their geostationary which are way way
out there and because of that they they

13872
04:05:03,530 --> 04:05:03,540
out there and because of that they they
 

13873
04:05:03,540 --> 04:05:06,170
out there and because of that they they
won't really ever de-orbit or like it'll

13874
04:05:06,170 --> 04:05:06,180
won't really ever de-orbit or like it'll
 

13875
04:05:06,180 --> 04:05:07,910
won't really ever de-orbit or like it'll
take you know Millennia to deorbit

13876
04:05:07,910 --> 04:05:07,920
take you know Millennia to deorbit
 

13877
04:05:07,920 --> 04:05:09,469
take you know Millennia to deorbit
because you know just because

13878
04:05:09,469 --> 04:05:09,479
because you know just because
 

13879
04:05:09,479 --> 04:05:10,729
because you know just because
something's in space doesn't mean it's

13880
04:05:10,729 --> 04:05:10,739
something's in space doesn't mean it's
 

13881
04:05:10,739 --> 04:05:12,229
something's in space doesn't mean it's
there forever especially like in low

13882
04:05:12,229 --> 04:05:12,239
there forever especially like in low
 

13883
04:05:12,239 --> 04:05:14,090
there forever especially like in low
earth orbit the atmosphere doesn't just

13884
04:05:14,090 --> 04:05:14,100
earth orbit the atmosphere doesn't just
 

13885
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:16,130
earth orbit the atmosphere doesn't just
suddenly stop it's not like you hit the

13886
04:05:16,130 --> 04:05:16,140
suddenly stop it's not like you hit the
 

13887
04:05:16,140 --> 04:05:17,630
suddenly stop it's not like you hit the
carbon line 100 kilometers and also

13888
04:05:17,630 --> 04:05:17,640
carbon line 100 kilometers and also
 

13889
04:05:17,640 --> 04:05:19,189
carbon line 100 kilometers and also
there's zero atmosphere the atmosphere

13890
04:05:19,189 --> 04:05:19,199
there's zero atmosphere the atmosphere
 

13891
04:05:19,199 --> 04:05:20,750
there's zero atmosphere the atmosphere
just slowly tapers you know you can

13892
04:05:20,750 --> 04:05:20,760
just slowly tapers you know you can
 

13893
04:05:20,760 --> 04:05:22,189
just slowly tapers you know you can
experience that yourself as you climb

13894
04:05:22,189 --> 04:05:22,199
experience that yourself as you climb
 

13895
04:05:22,199 --> 04:05:23,990
experience that yourself as you climb
them out and you slowly realize there's

13896
04:05:23,990 --> 04:05:24,000
them out and you slowly realize there's
 

13897
04:05:24,000 --> 04:05:25,510
them out and you slowly realize there's
less and less air you just keep going

13898
04:05:25,510 --> 04:05:25,520
less and less air you just keep going
 

13899
04:05:25,520 --> 04:05:28,729
less and less air you just keep going
and just because you're in space 200 300

13900
04:05:28,729 --> 04:05:28,739
and just because you're in space 200 300
 

13901
04:05:28,739 --> 04:05:30,650
and just because you're in space 200 300
kilometers up there's still Trace

13902
04:05:30,650 --> 04:05:30,660
kilometers up there's still Trace
 

13903
04:05:30,660 --> 04:05:32,150
kilometers up there's still Trace
molecules you know there's the

13904
04:05:32,150 --> 04:05:32,160
molecules you know there's the
 

13905
04:05:32,160 --> 04:05:34,429
molecules you know there's the
occasional oxygen molecule there's the

13906
04:05:34,429 --> 04:05:34,439
occasional oxygen molecule there's the
 

13907
04:05:34,439 --> 04:05:36,530
occasional oxygen molecule there's the
occasional nitrogen molecule and so that

13908
04:05:36,530 --> 04:05:36,540
occasional nitrogen molecule and so that
 

13909
04:05:36,540 --> 04:05:38,330
occasional nitrogen molecule and so that
is actually dragged so as a spacecraft

13910
04:05:38,330 --> 04:05:38,340
is actually dragged so as a spacecraft
 

13911
04:05:38,340 --> 04:05:40,610
is actually dragged so as a spacecraft
in low earth orbit depending on its

in low earth orbit depending on its
 

13913
04:05:40,620 --> 04:05:42,950
in low earth orbit depending on its
altitude will take anywhere from

altitude will take anywhere from
 

13915
04:05:42,960 --> 04:05:45,950
altitude will take anywhere from
five years to five months to deorbit you

13916
04:05:45,950 --> 04:05:45,960
five years to five months to deorbit you
 

13917
04:05:45,960 --> 04:05:47,630
five years to five months to deorbit you
know or two months or one month like

04:05:49,670 --> 04:05:49,680
depending on its orbit or its altitude
 

13921
04:05:49,680 --> 04:05:52,010
depending on its orbit or its altitude
we'll have some parasitic drag still and

13922
04:05:52,010 --> 04:05:52,020
we'll have some parasitic drag still and
 

13923
04:05:52,020 --> 04:05:54,349
we'll have some parasitic drag still and
slowly throughout time slow down which

13924
04:05:54,349 --> 04:05:54,359
slowly throughout time slow down which
 

13925
04:05:54,359 --> 04:05:56,929
slowly throughout time slow down which
lowers its orbit which drags it down

13926
04:05:56,929 --> 04:05:56,939
lowers its orbit which drags it down
 

13927
04:05:56,939 --> 04:05:58,729
lowers its orbit which drags it down
more lowers this orbit Etc et cetera

more lowers this orbit Etc et cetera
until it reenters so if we end up with

13930
04:06:02,510 --> 04:06:02,520
until it reenters so if we end up with
 

13931
04:06:02,520 --> 04:06:04,849
until it reenters so if we end up with
uh some kind of catastrophic event where

13932
04:06:04,849 --> 04:06:04,859
uh some kind of catastrophic event where
 

13933
04:06:04,859 --> 04:06:06,889
uh some kind of catastrophic event where
the entire low earth orbit is you know

13934
04:06:06,889 --> 04:06:06,899
the entire low earth orbit is you know
 

13935
04:06:06,899 --> 04:06:09,469
the entire low earth orbit is you know
has been inundated and blown up it'll

13936
04:06:09,469 --> 04:06:09,479
has been inundated and blown up it'll
 

13937
04:06:09,479 --> 04:06:11,750
has been inundated and blown up it'll
take months for the first band you know

13938
04:06:11,750 --> 04:06:11,760
take months for the first band you know
 

13939
04:06:11,760 --> 04:06:13,910
take months for the first band you know
to clear up it'll take years for

13940
04:06:13,910 --> 04:06:13,920
to clear up it'll take years for
 

13941
04:06:13,920 --> 04:06:15,530
to clear up it'll take years for
something like Beyond there's charts you

13942
04:06:15,530 --> 04:06:15,540
something like Beyond there's charts you
 

13943
04:06:15,540 --> 04:06:16,910
something like Beyond there's charts you
know people have all this stuff

13944
04:06:16,910 --> 04:06:16,920
know people have all this stuff
 

13945
04:06:16,920 --> 04:06:18,650
know people have all this stuff
available you shouldn't look it's

13946
04:06:18,650 --> 04:06:18,660
available you shouldn't look it's
 

13947
04:06:18,660 --> 04:06:21,530
available you shouldn't look it's
terrifying by the way but this is really

13948
04:06:21,530 --> 04:06:21,540
terrifying by the way but this is really
 

13949
04:06:21,540 --> 04:06:25,130
terrifying by the way but this is really
the but again the caveat is for the most

13950
04:06:25,130 --> 04:06:25,140
the but again the caveat is for the most
 

13951
04:06:25,140 --> 04:06:26,630
the but again the caveat is for the most
part the low earth orbit stuff would

13952
04:06:26,630 --> 04:06:26,640
part the low earth orbit stuff would
 

13953
04:06:26,640 --> 04:06:29,210
part the low earth orbit stuff would
clear up within years so we could get

13954
04:06:29,210 --> 04:06:29,220
clear up within years so we could get
 

13955
04:06:29,220 --> 04:06:30,710
clear up within years so we could get
back to doing some more with it like

13956
04:06:30,710 --> 04:06:30,720
back to doing some more with it like
 

13957
04:06:30,720 --> 04:06:32,450
back to doing some more with it like
starlink stuff would probably be able to

13958
04:06:32,450 --> 04:06:32,460
starlink stuff would probably be able to
 

13959
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:34,910
starlink stuff would probably be able to
be re and you know we could kind of redo

13960
04:06:34,910 --> 04:06:34,920
be re and you know we could kind of redo
 

13961
04:06:34,920 --> 04:06:36,650
be re and you know we could kind of redo
it and build up from the ground up again

13962
04:06:36,650 --> 04:06:36,660
it and build up from the ground up again
 

13963
04:06:36,660 --> 04:06:38,870
it and build up from the ground up again
GPS wouldn't be wiped out and our

13964
04:06:38,870 --> 04:06:38,880
GPS wouldn't be wiped out and our
 

13965
04:06:38,880 --> 04:06:40,010
GPS wouldn't be wiped out and our
geostationary satellites wouldn't be

13966
04:06:40,010 --> 04:06:40,020
geostationary satellites wouldn't be
 

13967
04:06:40,020 --> 04:06:41,030
geostationary satellites wouldn't be
wiped up but the scary thing is we

13968
04:06:41,030 --> 04:06:41,040
wiped up but the scary thing is we
 

13969
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:43,010
wiped up but the scary thing is we
wouldn't be able to relaunch and replace

13970
04:06:43,010 --> 04:06:43,020
wouldn't be able to relaunch and replace
 

13971
04:06:43,020 --> 04:06:45,650
wouldn't be able to relaunch and replace
new things because we're stuck we're not

13972
04:06:45,650 --> 04:06:45,660
new things because we're stuck we're not
 

13973
04:06:45,660 --> 04:06:46,790
new things because we're stuck we're not
going to fly through that debris field

13974
04:06:46,790 --> 04:06:46,800

you know
 

13977
04:06:48,779 --> 04:06:51,050
you know
and we avoid that by avoiding military

13981
04:06:53,939 --> 04:06:56,990

04:09:50,819 --> 04:09:53,150
learn and learn about rockets and learn
about uh water management and

14148
04:09:53,150 --> 04:09:53,160
about uh water management and
 

14149
04:09:53,160 --> 04:09:56,090
about uh water management and
architecture and City Planning and

14150

fitness and health all of the all of the
modern conveniences that we Google every

14154
04:10:00,469 --> 04:10:00,479
modern conveniences that we Google every
 

14155
04:10:00,479 --> 04:10:01,729
modern conveniences that we Google every
single day there's people that don't

14156
04:10:01,729 --> 04:10:01,739
single day there's people that don't
 

14157
04:10:01,739 --> 04:10:04,010
single day there's people that don't
have access to that right now you know I

14158
04:10:04,010 --> 04:10:04,020
have access to that right now you know I
 

14159
04:10:04,020 --> 04:10:06,950
have access to that right now you know I
I'm a self-taught rocket nerd I would

14160
04:10:06,950 --> 04:10:06,960
I'm a self-taught rocket nerd I would
 

14161
04:10:06,960 --> 04:10:08,510
I'm a self-taught rocket nerd I would
not be who I am if it wasn't for the

14162
04:10:08,510 --> 04:10:08,520
not be who I am if it wasn't for the
 

14163
04:10:08,520 --> 04:10:10,309
not be who I am if it wasn't for the
internet in the last seven years you

14164
04:10:10,309 --> 04:10:10,319
internet in the last seven years you
 

14165
04:10:10,319 --> 04:10:13,130
internet in the last seven years you
know six seven years so unlocking the

14166
04:10:13,130 --> 04:10:13,140
know six seven years so unlocking the
 

14167
04:10:13,140 --> 04:10:14,750
know six seven years so unlocking the
intellectual potential of places like

14168
04:10:14,750 --> 04:10:14,760
intellectual potential of places like
 

14169
04:10:14,760 --> 04:10:16,790
intellectual potential of places like
Africa of rural areas that don't

14170
04:10:16,790 --> 04:10:16,800
Africa of rural areas that don't
 

14171
04:10:16,800 --> 04:10:19,429
Africa of rural areas that don't
currently have internet access

14172
04:10:19,429 --> 04:10:19,439
currently have internet access
 

14173
04:10:19,439 --> 04:10:22,250
currently have internet access
um that's a genuine that's a huge thing

14174
04:10:22,250 --> 04:10:22,260
um that's a genuine that's a huge thing
 

14175
04:10:22,260 --> 04:10:25,790
um that's a genuine that's a huge thing
that's like humanitarian 101 is give

14176
04:10:25,790 --> 04:10:25,800
that's like humanitarian 101 is give
 

14177
04:10:25,800 --> 04:10:28,070
that's like humanitarian 101 is give
people access to information and you

14178
04:10:28,070 --> 04:10:28,080
people access to information and you
 

14179
04:10:28,080 --> 04:10:30,530
people access to information and you
like you know I think we have this uh

14180
04:10:30,530 --> 04:10:30,540
like you know I think we have this uh
 

14181
04:10:30,540 --> 04:10:32,450
like you know I think we have this uh
potential to try to step in and fix

14182
04:10:32,450 --> 04:10:32,460
potential to try to step in and fix
 

14183
04:10:32,460 --> 04:10:33,830
potential to try to step in and fix
other people's problems but the reality

14184
04:10:33,830 --> 04:10:33,840
other people's problems but the reality
 

14185
04:10:33,840 --> 04:10:35,750
other people's problems but the reality
is like people are smart no matter where

14186
04:10:35,750 --> 04:10:35,760
is like people are smart no matter where
 

14187
04:10:35,760 --> 04:10:37,550
is like people are smart no matter where
you are you give them the resources to

14188
04:10:37,550 --> 04:10:37,560
you are you give them the resources to
 

14189
04:10:37,560 --> 04:10:38,870
you are you give them the resources to
learn they're going to solve problems

14190
04:10:38,870 --> 04:10:38,880
learn they're going to solve problems
 

14191
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:40,130
learn they're going to solve problems
they're going to problem solve they're

14192
04:10:40,130 --> 04:10:40,140
they're going to problem solve they're
 

14193
04:10:40,140 --> 04:10:41,929
they're going to problem solve they're
going to engineer they're going to but

14194
04:10:41,929 --> 04:10:41,939
going to engineer they're going to but
 

14195
04:10:41,939 --> 04:10:43,429
going to engineer they're going to but
if you don't give them access to that

14196
04:10:43,429 --> 04:10:43,439
if you don't give them access to that
 

14197
04:10:43,439 --> 04:10:44,929
if you don't give them access to that
information they're going to be stuck in

14198
04:10:44,929 --> 04:10:44,939
information they're going to be stuck in
 

14199
04:10:44,939 --> 04:10:45,710
information they're going to be stuck in
there

14200
04:10:45,710 --> 04:10:45,720
there
 

14201
04:10:45,720 --> 04:10:48,410
there
and their Cycles you know and so I I

14202
04:10:48,410 --> 04:10:48,420
and their Cycles you know and so I I
 

14203
04:10:48,420 --> 04:10:50,090
and their Cycles you know and so I I
think the potential for starlink is

14204
04:10:50,090 --> 04:10:50,100
think the potential for starlink is
 

14205
04:10:50,100 --> 04:10:51,590
think the potential for starlink is
incredible I think it's already

14206
04:10:51,590 --> 04:10:51,600
incredible I think it's already
 

14207
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:54,229
incredible I think it's already
impactful it's already affecting

14208
04:10:54,229 --> 04:10:54,239
impactful it's already affecting
 

14209
04:10:54,239 --> 04:10:56,809
impactful it's already affecting
people in you know in Rural and

14210
04:10:56,809 --> 04:10:56,819
people in you know in Rural and
 

14211
04:10:56,819 --> 04:10:58,429
people in you know in Rural and
Indigenous areas and it's already

14212
04:10:58,429 --> 04:10:58,439
Indigenous areas and it's already
 

14213
04:10:58,439 --> 04:11:00,650
Indigenous areas and it's already
affecting businesses and all that stuff

14214
04:11:00,650 --> 04:11:00,660
affecting businesses and all that stuff
 

14215
04:11:00,660 --> 04:11:03,290
affecting businesses and all that stuff
I think it's great I think it

14216
04:11:03,290 --> 04:11:03,300
I think it's great I think it
 

14217
04:11:03,300 --> 04:11:04,610
I think it's great I think it
is

14218
04:11:04,610 --> 04:11:04,620
is
 

14219
04:11:04,620 --> 04:11:06,349
is
you know there's some downsides with

14220
04:11:06,349 --> 04:11:06,359
you know there's some downsides with
 

14221
04:11:06,359 --> 04:11:08,510
you know there's some downsides with
astronomy with with ground-based

14222
04:11:08,510 --> 04:11:08,520
astronomy with with ground-based
 

14223
04:11:08,520 --> 04:11:11,030
astronomy with with ground-based
astronomy that it can hinder uh

14224
04:11:11,030 --> 04:11:11,040
astronomy that it can hinder uh
 

14225
04:11:11,040 --> 04:11:13,130
astronomy that it can hinder uh
observations from the ground

14226
04:11:13,130 --> 04:11:13,140
observations from the ground
 

14227
04:11:13,140 --> 04:11:14,269
observations from the ground
um there's already a lot of

14228
04:11:14,269 --> 04:11:14,279
um there's already a lot of
 

14229
04:11:14,279 --> 04:11:17,389
um there's already a lot of
communications between SpaceX and um

14230
04:11:17,389 --> 04:11:17,399
communications between SpaceX and um
 

14231
04:11:17,399 --> 04:11:19,969
communications between SpaceX and um
astronomical societies and things like

14232
04:11:19,969 --> 04:11:19,979
astronomical societies and things like
 

14233
04:11:19,979 --> 04:11:21,530
astronomical societies and things like
that because it is a real concern you

14234
04:11:21,530 --> 04:11:21,540
that because it is a real concern you
 

14235
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:23,510
that because it is a real concern you
know it's it can ruin observations it

14236
04:11:23,510 --> 04:11:23,520
know it's it can ruin observations it
 

14237
04:11:23,520 --> 04:11:25,969
know it's it can ruin observations it
can ruin data but like one of the big

14238
04:11:25,969 --> 04:11:25,979
can ruin data but like one of the big
 

14239
04:11:25,979 --> 04:11:28,010
can ruin data but like one of the big
ones for instance recently I think a new

14240
04:11:28,010 --> 04:11:28,020
ones for instance recently I think a new
 

14241
04:11:28,020 --> 04:11:29,450
ones for instance recently I think a new
thing they're going to be working into

14242
04:11:29,450 --> 04:11:29,460
thing they're going to be working into
 

14243
04:11:29,460 --> 04:11:32,090
thing they're going to be working into
is that currently if a starlink is

14244
04:11:32,090 --> 04:11:32,100
is that currently if a starlink is
 

14245
04:11:32,100 --> 04:11:34,070
is that currently if a starlink is
flying over

14246
04:11:34,070 --> 04:11:34,080
flying over
 

14247
04:11:34,080 --> 04:11:36,950
flying over
um over a ground-based asset a lot of a

14248
04:11:36,950 --> 04:11:36,960
um over a ground-based asset a lot of a
 

14249
04:11:36,960 --> 04:11:38,389
um over a ground-based asset a lot of a
lot of ground telescopes actually have a

14250
04:11:38,389 --> 04:11:38,399
lot of ground telescopes actually have a
 

14251
04:11:38,399 --> 04:11:41,210
lot of ground telescopes actually have a
laser that goes up and it measures the

14252
04:11:41,210 --> 04:11:41,220
laser that goes up and it measures the
 

14253
04:11:41,220 --> 04:11:42,650
laser that goes up and it measures the
atmospheric Distortion and the

14254
04:11:42,650 --> 04:11:42,660
atmospheric Distortion and the
 

14255
04:11:42,660 --> 04:11:44,570
atmospheric Distortion and the
telescopes literally sit there and like

14256
04:11:44,570 --> 04:11:44,580
telescopes literally sit there and like
 

14257
04:11:44,580 --> 04:11:47,750
telescopes literally sit there and like
by the millisecond fixes like changes

14258
04:11:47,750 --> 04:11:47,760
by the millisecond fixes like changes
 

14259
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:50,210
by the millisecond fixes like changes
the focus and fixes those atmospheric

14260
04:11:50,210 --> 04:11:50,220
the focus and fixes those atmospheric
 

14261
04:11:50,220 --> 04:11:53,809
the focus and fixes those atmospheric
distortions and that laser can interfere

14262
04:11:53,809 --> 04:11:53,819
distortions and that laser can interfere
 

14263
04:11:53,819 --> 04:11:55,849
distortions and that laser can interfere
with satellites so previously I I'm

14264
04:11:55,849 --> 04:11:55,859
with satellites so previously I I'm
 

14265
04:11:55,859 --> 04:11:58,010
with satellites so previously I I'm
pretty sure that SpaceX actually had to

14266
04:11:58,010 --> 04:11:58,020
pretty sure that SpaceX actually had to
 

14267
04:11:58,020 --> 04:12:00,530
pretty sure that SpaceX actually had to
you know request that as they're flying

14268
04:12:00,530 --> 04:12:00,540
you know request that as they're flying
 

14269
04:12:00,540 --> 04:12:02,150
you know request that as they're flying
over these satellites they are these

14270
04:12:02,150 --> 04:12:02,160
over these satellites they are these
 

14271
04:12:02,160 --> 04:12:04,550
over these satellites they are these
telescopes they turn off the laser and

14272
04:12:04,550 --> 04:12:04,560
telescopes they turn off the laser and
 

14273
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:07,969
telescopes they turn off the laser and
when you have tens of thousands of these

14274
04:12:07,969 --> 04:12:07,979
when you have tens of thousands of these
 

14275
04:12:07,979 --> 04:12:09,530
when you have tens of thousands of these
things flying it's you're going to be

14276
04:12:09,530 --> 04:12:09,540
things flying it's you're going to be
 

14277
04:12:09,540 --> 04:12:11,330
things flying it's you're going to be
turning off the laser more than it's on

14278
04:12:11,330 --> 04:12:11,340
turning off the laser more than it's on
 

14279
04:12:11,340 --> 04:12:12,889
turning off the laser more than it's on
you know and just being this insanely

14280
04:12:12,889 --> 04:12:12,899
you know and just being this insanely
 

14281
04:12:12,899 --> 04:12:14,510
you know and just being this insanely
inconvenient thing because you're gonna

14282
04:12:14,510 --> 04:12:14,520
inconvenient thing because you're gonna
 

14283
04:12:14,520 --> 04:12:16,969
inconvenient thing because you're gonna
have these Junctions happen often and I

14284
04:12:16,969 --> 04:12:16,979
have these Junctions happen often and I
 

14285
04:12:16,979 --> 04:12:18,469
have these Junctions happen often and I
think one of the things that SpaceX is

14286
04:12:18,469 --> 04:12:18,479
think one of the things that SpaceX is
 

14287
04:12:18,479 --> 04:12:20,150
think one of the things that SpaceX is
like okay no no you guys keep the laser

14288
04:12:20,150 --> 04:12:20,160
like okay no no you guys keep the laser
 

14289
04:12:20,160 --> 04:12:22,429
like okay no no you guys keep the laser
on we'll deal with your laser

14290
04:12:22,429 --> 04:12:22,439
on we'll deal with your laser
 

14291
04:12:22,439 --> 04:12:24,349
on we'll deal with your laser
um good good step you know things like

14292
04:12:24,349 --> 04:12:24,359
um good good step you know things like
 

14293
04:12:24,359 --> 04:12:26,030
um good good step you know things like
that mitigating the brightness of them

14294
04:12:26,030 --> 04:12:26,040
that mitigating the brightness of them
 

14295
04:12:26,040 --> 04:12:28,309
that mitigating the brightness of them
so they're not visible under most

14296
04:12:28,309 --> 04:12:28,319
so they're not visible under most
 

14297
04:12:28,319 --> 04:12:30,290
so they're not visible under most
conditions of course like there's still

14298
04:12:30,290 --> 04:12:30,300
conditions of course like there's still
 

14299
04:12:30,300 --> 04:12:32,510
conditions of course like there's still
always going to be visible in some

14300
04:12:32,510 --> 04:12:32,520
always going to be visible in some
 

14301
04:12:32,520 --> 04:12:34,849
always going to be visible in some
um but then ultimately for me it's like

14302
04:12:34,849 --> 04:12:34,859
um but then ultimately for me it's like
 

14303
04:12:34,859 --> 04:12:36,650
um but then ultimately for me it's like
this you have this weird like almost

14304
04:12:36,650 --> 04:12:36,660
this you have this weird like almost
 

14305
04:12:36,660 --> 04:12:39,830
this you have this weird like almost
like a puberty of space flight and and

14306
04:12:39,830 --> 04:12:39,840
like a puberty of space flight and and
 

14307
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:42,469
like a puberty of space flight and and
astronomy where currently it's not cheap

14308
04:12:42,469 --> 04:12:42,479
astronomy where currently it's not cheap
 

14309
04:12:42,479 --> 04:12:44,510
astronomy where currently it's not cheap
enough to really do a ton of incredible

14310
04:12:44,510 --> 04:12:44,520
enough to really do a ton of incredible
 

14311
04:12:44,520 --> 04:12:46,790
enough to really do a ton of incredible
science or space-based telescopes you

14312
04:12:46,790 --> 04:12:46,800
science or space-based telescopes you
 

14313
04:12:46,800 --> 04:12:49,250
science or space-based telescopes you
know we have web we have Hubble we have

14314
04:12:49,250 --> 04:12:49,260
know we have web we have Hubble we have
 

14315
04:12:49,260 --> 04:12:51,290
know we have web we have Hubble we have
uh you know all these other

14316
04:12:51,290 --> 04:12:51,300
uh you know all these other
 

14317
04:12:51,300 --> 04:12:54,349
uh you know all these other
you know awesome space-based telescopes

14318
04:12:54,349 --> 04:12:54,359
you know awesome space-based telescopes
 

14319
04:12:54,359 --> 04:12:56,269
you know awesome space-based telescopes
um Chandra you know

14320
04:12:56,269 --> 04:12:56,279
um Chandra you know
 

14321
04:12:56,279 --> 04:12:58,309
um Chandra you know
Etc et cetera whatever and

14322
04:12:58,309 --> 04:12:58,319
Etc et cetera whatever and
 

14323
04:12:58,319 --> 04:13:01,429
Etc et cetera whatever and
you uh is but it's still so expensive to

14324
04:13:01,429 --> 04:13:01,439
you uh is but it's still so expensive to
 

14325
04:13:01,439 --> 04:13:03,170
you uh is but it's still so expensive to
launch them yeah that were still so

14326
04:13:03,170 --> 04:13:03,180
launch them yeah that were still so
 

14327
04:13:03,180 --> 04:13:05,150
launch them yeah that were still so
reliant on our ground telescopes but in

14328
04:13:05,150 --> 04:13:05,160
reliant on our ground telescopes but in
 

14329
04:13:05,160 --> 04:13:07,910
reliant on our ground telescopes but in
the future you can see a world where oh

14330
04:13:07,910 --> 04:13:07,920
the future you can see a world where oh
 

14331
04:13:07,920 --> 04:13:09,710
the future you can see a world where oh
this is so cheap we'll just launch like

14332
04:13:09,710 --> 04:13:09,720
this is so cheap we'll just launch like
 

14333
04:13:09,720 --> 04:13:11,809
this is so cheap we'll just launch like
we can launch 50 James Webb Space

14334
04:13:11,809 --> 04:13:11,819
we can launch 50 James Webb Space
 

14335
04:13:11,819 --> 04:13:14,090
we can launch 50 James Webb Space
Telescope size telescopes this year for

14336
04:13:14,090 --> 04:13:14,100
Telescope size telescopes this year for
 

14337
04:13:14,100 --> 04:13:16,130
Telescope size telescopes this year for
half the price of doing it on Earth you

14338
04:13:16,130 --> 04:13:16,140
half the price of doing it on Earth you
 

14339
04:13:16,140 --> 04:13:18,469
half the price of doing it on Earth you
know and get way better data so in the

14340
04:13:18,469 --> 04:13:18,479
know and get way better data so in the
 

14341
04:13:18,479 --> 04:13:20,389
know and get way better data so in the
future I think in 20 30 years we'll look

14342
04:13:20,389 --> 04:13:20,399
future I think in 20 30 years we'll look
 

14343
04:13:20,399 --> 04:13:21,590
future I think in 20 30 years we'll look
at it and be like oh man that was an

14344
04:13:21,590 --> 04:13:21,600
at it and be like oh man that was an
 

14345
04:13:21,600 --> 04:13:24,050
at it and be like oh man that was an
awkward time where space assets were

14346
04:13:24,050 --> 04:13:24,060
awkward time where space assets were
 

14347
04:13:24,060 --> 04:13:26,389
awkward time where space assets were
interfering with us astronomy but I

14348
04:13:26,389 --> 04:13:26,399
interfering with us astronomy but I
 

14349
04:13:26,399 --> 04:13:27,710
interfering with us astronomy but I
think in the future it's like can you

14350
04:13:27,710 --> 04:13:27,720
think in the future it's like can you
 

14351
04:13:27,720 --> 04:13:29,689
think in the future it's like can you
imagine doing space you know astronomy

14352
04:13:29,689 --> 04:13:29,699
imagine doing space you know astronomy
 

14353
04:13:29,699 --> 04:13:32,750
imagine doing space you know astronomy
from the ground that's insane there

14354
04:13:32,750 --> 04:13:32,760
from the ground that's insane there
 

14355
04:13:32,760 --> 04:13:34,010
from the ground that's insane there
could be complexities to just having

14356
04:13:34,010 --> 04:13:34,020
could be complexities to just having
 

14357
04:13:34,020 --> 04:13:36,710
could be complexities to just having
that many uh just another topic so a

14358
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:36,720
that many uh just another topic so a
 

14359
04:13:36,720 --> 04:13:38,630
that many uh just another topic so a
complexity is associated with having so

14360
04:13:38,630 --> 04:13:38,640
complexity is associated with having so
 

14361
04:13:38,640 --> 04:13:40,309
complexity is associated with having so
many satellites

14362
04:13:40,309 --> 04:13:40,319
many satellites
 

14363
04:13:40,319 --> 04:13:42,349
many satellites
uh especially with competing companies

14364
04:13:42,349 --> 04:13:42,359
uh especially with competing companies
 

14365
04:13:42,359 --> 04:13:44,809
uh especially with competing companies
and competing Nations do you see that as

14366
04:13:44,809 --> 04:13:44,819
and competing Nations do you see that as
 

14367
04:13:44,819 --> 04:13:46,189
and competing Nations do you see that as
an issue having tens of thousands

14368
04:13:46,189 --> 04:13:46,199
an issue having tens of thousands
 

14369
04:13:46,199 --> 04:13:48,050
an issue having tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands of satellites yeah

14370
04:13:48,050 --> 04:13:48,060
hundreds of thousands of satellites yeah
 

14371
04:13:48,060 --> 04:13:50,870
hundreds of thousands of satellites yeah
it becomes a very interesting robotics

14372
04:13:50,870 --> 04:13:50,880
it becomes a very interesting robotics
 

14373
04:13:50,880 --> 04:13:53,330
it becomes a very interesting robotics
collision avoidance problem the the one

14374
04:13:53,330 --> 04:13:53,340
collision avoidance problem the the one
 

14375
04:13:53,340 --> 04:13:55,189
collision avoidance problem the the one
thing to keep in mind is perspective

14376
04:13:55,189 --> 04:13:55,199
thing to keep in mind is perspective
 

14377
04:13:55,199 --> 04:13:57,349
thing to keep in mind is perspective
like I know 10 000 satellites and twenty

14378
04:13:57,349 --> 04:13:57,359
like I know 10 000 satellites and twenty
 

14379
04:13:57,359 --> 04:13:58,130
like I know 10 000 satellites and twenty
thousand and a hundred thousand

14380
04:13:58,130 --> 04:13:58,140
thousand and a hundred thousand
 

14381
04:13:58,140 --> 04:14:00,469
thousand and a hundred thousand
satellites sounds insane and it sounds

14382
04:14:00,469 --> 04:14:00,479
satellites sounds insane and it sounds
 

14383
04:14:00,479 --> 04:14:01,729
satellites sounds insane and it sounds
really scary

14384
04:14:01,729 --> 04:14:01,739
really scary
 

14385
04:14:01,739 --> 04:14:03,769
really scary
but I mean just even look at how many

14386
04:14:03,769 --> 04:14:03,779
but I mean just even look at how many
 

14387
04:14:03,779 --> 04:14:05,330
but I mean just even look at how many
planes are in the air at any given time

14388
04:14:05,330 --> 04:14:05,340
planes are in the air at any given time
 

14389
04:14:05,340 --> 04:14:07,969
planes are in the air at any given time
and the planes are are bigger they're

14390
04:14:07,969 --> 04:14:07,979
and the planes are are bigger they're
 

14391
04:14:07,979 --> 04:14:09,530
and the planes are are bigger they're
flying slower which actually means

14392
04:14:09,530 --> 04:14:09,540
flying slower which actually means
 

14393
04:14:09,540 --> 04:14:10,849
flying slower which actually means
there's a greater chance of collision if

14394
04:14:10,849 --> 04:14:10,859
there's a greater chance of collision if
 

14395
04:14:10,859 --> 04:14:12,889
there's a greater chance of collision if
you think about you know two objects

14396
04:14:12,889 --> 04:14:12,899
you think about you know two objects
 

14397
04:14:12,899 --> 04:14:15,229
you think about you know two objects
occupying space if they're one's moving

14398
04:14:15,229 --> 04:14:15,239
occupying space if they're one's moving
 

14399
04:14:15,239 --> 04:14:16,849
occupying space if they're one's moving
really fast like imagine trying to you

14400
04:14:16,849 --> 04:14:16,859
really fast like imagine trying to you
 

14401
04:14:16,859 --> 04:14:18,349
really fast like imagine trying to you
know throw two basketballs at each other

14402
04:14:18,349 --> 04:14:18,359
know throw two basketballs at each other
 

14403
04:14:18,359 --> 04:14:20,389
know throw two basketballs at each other
relatively easy now try shooting two

14404
04:14:20,389 --> 04:14:20,399
relatively easy now try shooting two
 

14405
04:14:20,399 --> 04:14:22,429
relatively easy now try shooting two
bullets at each other and have like you

14406
04:14:22,429 --> 04:14:22,439
bullets at each other and have like you
 

14407
04:14:22,439 --> 04:14:24,349
bullets at each other and have like you
know at 90 degrees from each other you

14408
04:14:24,349 --> 04:14:24,359
know at 90 degrees from each other you
 

14409
04:14:24,359 --> 04:14:25,809
know at 90 degrees from each other you
have to have your timing down like

14410
04:14:25,809 --> 04:14:25,819
have to have your timing down like
 

14411
04:14:25,819 --> 04:14:28,910
have to have your timing down like
really perfect to do that now take that

14412
04:14:28,910 --> 04:14:28,920
really perfect to do that now take that
 

14413
04:14:28,920 --> 04:14:30,889
really perfect to do that now take that
times 10 you know and these objects are

14414
04:14:30,889 --> 04:14:30,899
times 10 you know and these objects are
 

14415
04:14:30,899 --> 04:14:33,830
times 10 you know and these objects are
taking up a physical space a very small

14416
04:14:33,830 --> 04:14:33,840
taking up a physical space a very small
 

14417
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:35,150
taking up a physical space a very small
amount of time they're relatively small

14418
04:14:35,150 --> 04:14:35,160
amount of time they're relatively small
 

14419
04:14:35,160 --> 04:14:36,650
amount of time they're relatively small
like most satellites are not very big

14420
04:14:36,650 --> 04:14:36,660
like most satellites are not very big
 

14421
04:14:36,660 --> 04:14:39,889
like most satellites are not very big
and they have ins Limitless altitudes to

14422
04:14:39,889 --> 04:14:39,899
and they have ins Limitless altitudes to
 

14423
04:14:39,899 --> 04:14:41,750
and they have ins Limitless altitudes to
deal with so even though you can have

14424
04:14:41,750 --> 04:14:41,760
deal with so even though you can have
 

14425
04:14:41,760 --> 04:14:43,309
deal with so even though you can have
what look like convergences you know

14426
04:14:43,309 --> 04:14:43,319
what look like convergences you know
 

14427
04:14:43,319 --> 04:14:46,010
what look like convergences you know
they can be 10 20 50 100 kilometers

14428
04:14:46,010 --> 04:14:46,020
they can be 10 20 50 100 kilometers
 

14429
04:14:46,020 --> 04:14:48,229
they can be 10 20 50 100 kilometers
difference often and you know they're

14430
04:14:48,229 --> 04:14:48,239
difference often and you know they're
 

14431
04:14:48,239 --> 04:14:50,210
difference often and you know they're
dealing with this like all the the all

14432
04:14:50,210 --> 04:14:50,220
dealing with this like all the the all
 

14433
04:14:50,220 --> 04:14:52,610
dealing with this like all the the all
space assets know hey I'm at this

14434
04:14:52,610 --> 04:14:52,620
space assets know hey I'm at this
 

14435
04:14:52,620 --> 04:14:54,349
space assets know hey I'm at this
orbital plane and this blah blah blah

14436
04:14:54,349 --> 04:14:54,359
orbital plane and this blah blah blah
 

14437
04:14:54,359 --> 04:14:55,610
orbital plane and this blah blah blah
and they know their altitudes and know

14438
04:14:55,610 --> 04:14:55,620
and they know their altitudes and know
 

14439
04:14:55,620 --> 04:14:56,870
and they know their altitudes and know
their safe distances and have these

14440
04:14:56,870 --> 04:14:56,880
their safe distances and have these
 

14441
04:14:56,880 --> 04:14:59,389
their safe distances and have these
margins built in and it's spaced so

14442
04:14:59,389 --> 04:14:59,399
margins built in and it's spaced so
 

14443
04:14:59,399 --> 04:15:01,070
margins built in and it's spaced so
there's like an insane amount of room

14444
04:15:01,070 --> 04:15:01,080
there's like an insane amount of room
 

14445
04:15:01,080 --> 04:15:03,170
there's like an insane amount of room
you know so there's there's a lot of

14446
04:15:03,170 --> 04:15:03,180
you know so there's there's a lot of
 

14447
04:15:03,180 --> 04:15:05,450
you know so there's there's a lot of
margin there's a lot of margin but of

14448
04:15:05,450 --> 04:15:05,460
margin there's a lot of margin but of
 

14449
04:15:05,460 --> 04:15:07,610
margin there's a lot of margin but of
course you can't excuse that all the way

14450
04:15:07,610 --> 04:15:07,620
course you can't excuse that all the way
 

14451
04:15:07,620 --> 04:15:09,950
course you can't excuse that all the way
like you have to still have plans and

14452
04:15:09,950 --> 04:15:09,960
like you have to still have plans and
 

14453
04:15:09,960 --> 04:15:12,229
like you have to still have plans and
and be considering that and considering

14454
04:15:12,229 --> 04:15:12,239
and be considering that and considering
 

14455
04:15:12,239 --> 04:15:14,210
and be considering that and considering
collisions and considering all of the

14456
04:15:14,210 --> 04:15:14,220
collisions and considering all of the
 

14457
04:15:14,220 --> 04:15:17,870
collisions and considering all of the
above

14458
04:15:17,870 --> 04:15:17,880

 

14459
04:15:17,880 --> 04:15:19,610

when do you think the first human being

14460
04:15:19,610 --> 04:15:19,620
when do you think the first human being
 

14461
04:15:19,620 --> 04:15:22,670
when do you think the first human being
will step foot on Mars

14462
04:15:22,670 --> 04:15:22,680
will step foot on Mars
 

14463
04:15:22,680 --> 04:15:25,309
will step foot on Mars
you don't like timelines but is this

14464
04:15:25,309 --> 04:15:25,319
you don't like timelines but is this
 

14465
04:15:25,319 --> 04:15:27,590
you don't like timelines but is this
something and you're very much focused

14466
04:15:27,590 --> 04:15:27,600
something and you're very much focused
 

14467
04:15:27,600 --> 04:15:30,550
something and you're very much focused
on kind of the short term

14468
04:15:30,550 --> 04:15:30,560
on kind of the short term
 

14469
04:15:30,560 --> 04:15:33,170
on kind of the short term
of uh incredible progress that's

14470
04:15:33,170 --> 04:15:33,180
of uh incredible progress that's
 

14471
04:15:33,180 --> 04:15:35,210
of uh incredible progress that's
happening and that makes total sense but

14472
04:15:35,210 --> 04:15:35,220
happening and that makes total sense but
 

14473
04:15:35,220 --> 04:15:37,729
happening and that makes total sense but
there is the Mars plan that that was

14474
04:15:37,729 --> 04:15:37,739
there is the Mars plan that that was
 

14475
04:15:37,739 --> 04:15:40,189
there is the Mars plan that that was
that the origin of the commercial space

14476
04:15:40,189 --> 04:15:40,199
that the origin of the commercial space
 

14477
04:15:40,199 --> 04:15:42,050
that the origin of the commercial space
flight efforts

14478
04:15:42,050 --> 04:15:42,060
flight efforts
 

14479
04:15:42,060 --> 04:15:44,330
flight efforts
um do you still see and dream about that

14480
04:15:44,330 --> 04:15:44,340
um do you still see and dream about that
 

14481
04:15:44,340 --> 04:15:45,469
um do you still see and dream about that
day

14482
04:15:45,469 --> 04:15:45,479
day
 

14483
04:15:45,479 --> 04:15:47,030
day
let me be clear that I don't want to go

14484
04:15:47,030 --> 04:15:47,040
let me be clear that I don't want to go
 

14485
04:15:47,040 --> 04:15:50,450
let me be clear that I don't want to go
to Mars but um I do think if you're if

14486
04:15:50,450 --> 04:15:50,460
to Mars but um I do think if you're if
 

14487
04:15:50,460 --> 04:15:53,150
to Mars but um I do think if you're if
you're making me guess a timeline for

14488
04:15:53,150 --> 04:15:53,160
you're making me guess a timeline for
 

14489
04:15:53,160 --> 04:15:56,689
you're making me guess a timeline for
when humans will walk on Mars I even a

14490
04:15:56,689 --> 04:15:56,699
when humans will walk on Mars I even a
 

14491
04:15:56,699 --> 04:15:58,130
when humans will walk on Mars I even a
year ago I still would have said by the

14492
04:15:58,130 --> 04:15:58,140
year ago I still would have said by the
 

14493
04:15:58,140 --> 04:16:00,950
year ago I still would have said by the
end of 2020 like the 2020s decade you

14494
04:16:00,950 --> 04:16:00,960
end of 2020 like the 2020s decade you
 

14495
04:16:00,960 --> 04:16:01,729
end of 2020 like the 2020s decade you
know

14496
04:16:01,729 --> 04:16:01,739
know
 

14497
04:16:01,739 --> 04:16:05,450
know
um so by December 31st 2029 I thought

14498
04:16:05,450 --> 04:16:05,460
um so by December 31st 2029 I thought
 

14499
04:16:05,460 --> 04:16:06,710
um so by December 31st 2029 I thought
humans would have walked on mars I'm

14500
04:16:06,710 --> 04:16:06,720
humans would have walked on mars I'm
 

14501
04:16:06,720 --> 04:16:08,750
humans would have walked on mars I'm
starting to think

14502
04:16:08,750 --> 04:16:08,760
starting to think
 

14503
04:16:08,760 --> 04:16:12,410
starting to think
that's still too optimistic but I do I I

14504
04:16:12,410 --> 04:16:12,420
that's still too optimistic but I do I I
 

14505
04:16:12,420 --> 04:16:14,990
that's still too optimistic but I do I I
definitely think by 2040 like I I for

14506
04:16:14,990 --> 04:16:15,000
definitely think by 2040 like I I for
 

14507
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:17,170
definitely think by 2040 like I I for
sure think that and I really think

14508
04:16:17,170 --> 04:16:17,180
sure think that and I really think
 

14509
04:16:17,180 --> 04:16:19,610
sure think that and I really think
it's it's just hard to predict that

14510
04:16:19,610 --> 04:16:19,620
it's it's just hard to predict that
 

14511
04:16:19,620 --> 04:16:21,349
it's it's just hard to predict that
curve you know that that project out

14512
04:16:21,349 --> 04:16:21,359
curve you know that that project out
 

14513
04:16:21,359 --> 04:16:22,729
curve you know that that project out
that curve we're gonna go from feeling

14514
04:16:22,729 --> 04:16:22,739
that curve we're gonna go from feeling
 

14515
04:16:22,739 --> 04:16:24,229
that curve we're gonna go from feeling
like it's impossible like it's feeling

14516
04:16:24,229 --> 04:16:24,239
like it's impossible like it's feeling
 

14517
04:16:24,239 --> 04:16:25,610
like it's impossible like it's feeling
like it's enough you know it could be

14518
04:16:25,610 --> 04:16:25,620
like it's enough you know it could be
 

14519
04:16:25,620 --> 04:16:27,469
like it's enough you know it could be
another by the end of this decade JFK

14520
04:16:27,469 --> 04:16:27,479
another by the end of this decade JFK
 

14521
04:16:27,479 --> 04:16:29,750
another by the end of this decade JFK
type moment especially if China steps up

14522
04:16:29,750 --> 04:16:29,760
type moment especially if China steps up
 

14523
04:16:29,760 --> 04:16:31,969
type moment especially if China steps up
with the Space Race yeah it could be

14524
04:16:31,969 --> 04:16:31,979
with the Space Race yeah it could be
 

14525
04:16:31,979 --> 04:16:35,929
with the Space Race yeah it could be
like uh all right NASA NASA kind of says

14526
04:16:35,929 --> 04:16:35,939
like uh all right NASA NASA kind of says
 

14527
04:16:35,939 --> 04:16:38,750
like uh all right NASA NASA kind of says
all right this Elon fella like really

14528
04:16:38,750 --> 04:16:38,760
all right this Elon fella like really
 

14529
04:16:38,760 --> 04:16:41,210
all right this Elon fella like really
make us a gigantic effort well and if

14530
04:16:41,210 --> 04:16:41,220
make us a gigantic effort well and if
 

14531
04:16:41,220 --> 04:16:43,429
make us a gigantic effort well and if
Starship works out as planned and as as

14532
04:16:43,429 --> 04:16:43,439
Starship works out as planned and as as
 

14533
04:16:43,439 --> 04:16:45,590
Starship works out as planned and as as
NASA has invested in human Landing

14534
04:16:45,590 --> 04:16:45,600
NASA has invested in human Landing
 

14535
04:16:45,600 --> 04:16:47,510
NASA has invested in human Landing
system they're relying on SpaceX to land

14536
04:16:47,510 --> 04:16:47,520
system they're relying on SpaceX to land
 

14537
04:16:47,520 --> 04:16:49,370
system they're relying on SpaceX to land
on the moon SpaceX can land on the moon

14538
04:16:49,370 --> 04:16:49,380
on the moon SpaceX can land on the moon
 

14539
04:16:49,380 --> 04:16:50,990
on the moon SpaceX can land on the moon
they can land on Mars

14540
04:16:50,990 --> 04:16:51,000
they can land on Mars
 

14541
04:16:51,000 --> 04:16:53,090
they can land on Mars
now whether or not the life support and

14542
04:16:53,090 --> 04:16:53,100
now whether or not the life support and
 

14543
04:16:53,100 --> 04:16:55,490
now whether or not the life support and
the human considerations of of long-term

14544
04:16:55,490 --> 04:16:55,500
the human considerations of of long-term
 

14545
04:16:55,500 --> 04:16:57,170
the human considerations of of long-term
space flight missions and high radiation

14546
04:16:57,170 --> 04:16:57,180
space flight missions and high radiation
 

14547
04:16:57,180 --> 04:16:59,570
space flight missions and high radiation
and blah blah blah blah refueling on

14548
04:16:59,570 --> 04:16:59,580
and blah blah blah blah refueling on
 

14549
04:16:59,580 --> 04:17:01,670
and blah blah blah blah refueling on
Mars is a huge huge huge deal

14550
04:17:01,670 --> 04:17:01,680
Mars is a huge huge huge deal
 

14551
04:17:01,680 --> 04:17:03,410
Mars is a huge huge huge deal
they definitely could send a Starship to

14552
04:17:03,410 --> 04:17:03,420
they definitely could send a Starship to
 

14553
04:17:03,420 --> 04:17:04,429
they definitely could send a Starship to
Mars

14554
04:17:04,429 --> 04:17:04,439
Mars
 

14555
04:17:04,439 --> 04:17:07,070
Mars
um and land ideally land in one piece on

14556
04:17:07,070 --> 04:17:07,080
um and land ideally land in one piece on
 

14557
04:17:07,080 --> 04:17:08,870
um and land ideally land in one piece on
Mars

14558
04:17:08,870 --> 04:17:08,880
Mars
 

14559
04:17:08,880 --> 04:17:10,670
Mars
as soon as they can land on the moon

14560
04:17:10,670 --> 04:17:10,680
as soon as they can land on the moon
 

14561
04:17:10,680 --> 04:17:12,170
as soon as they can land on the moon
they can land on Mars basically I mean

14562
04:17:12,170 --> 04:17:12,180
they can land on Mars basically I mean
 

14563
04:17:12,180 --> 04:17:13,969
they can land on Mars basically I mean
those two things are very in some ways

14564
04:17:13,969 --> 04:17:13,979
those two things are very in some ways
 

14565
04:17:13,979 --> 04:17:16,070
those two things are very in some ways
Mars is almost easier

14566
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:16,080
Mars is almost easier
 

14567
04:17:16,080 --> 04:17:17,809
Mars is almost easier
if you can use because you can use the

14568
04:17:17,809 --> 04:17:17,819
if you can use because you can use the
 

14569
04:17:17,819 --> 04:17:18,889
if you can use because you can use the
atmosphere to slow down it actually

14570
04:17:18,889 --> 04:17:18,899
atmosphere to slow down it actually
 

14571
04:17:18,899 --> 04:17:21,530
atmosphere to slow down it actually
doesn't take that much more Delta V to

14572
04:17:21,530 --> 04:17:21,540
doesn't take that much more Delta V to
 

14573
04:17:21,540 --> 04:17:23,030
doesn't take that much more Delta V to
actually land on Mars than it does

14574
04:17:23,030 --> 04:17:23,040
actually land on Mars than it does
 

14575
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:24,290
actually land on Mars than it does
because on the moon you don't have any

14576
04:17:24,290 --> 04:17:24,300
because on the moon you don't have any
 

14577
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:26,450
because on the moon you don't have any
you got to first get out to the Moon

14578
04:17:26,450 --> 04:17:26,460
you got to first get out to the Moon
 

14579
04:17:26,460 --> 04:17:28,010
you got to first get out to the Moon
then orbit the Moon you know you have to

14580
04:17:28,010 --> 04:17:28,020
then orbit the Moon you know you have to
 

14581
04:17:28,020 --> 04:17:29,269
then orbit the Moon you know you have to
slow down every one of those is a

14582
04:17:29,269 --> 04:17:29,279
slow down every one of those is a
 

14583
04:17:29,279 --> 04:17:31,729
slow down every one of those is a
maneuver change then you have to slow

14584
04:17:31,729 --> 04:17:31,739
maneuver change then you have to slow
 

14585
04:17:31,739 --> 04:17:35,090
maneuver change then you have to slow
reorbit until it coincides you know hits

14586
04:17:35,090 --> 04:17:35,100
reorbit until it coincides you know hits
 

14587
04:17:35,100 --> 04:17:36,769
reorbit until it coincides you know hits
the moon and then if it's slow down

14588
04:17:36,769 --> 04:17:36,779
the moon and then if it's slow down
 

14589
04:17:36,779 --> 04:17:38,809
the moon and then if it's slow down
enough to not explode when you hit the

14590
04:17:38,809 --> 04:17:38,819
enough to not explode when you hit the
 

14591
04:17:38,819 --> 04:17:40,790
enough to not explode when you hit the
moon so there's a lot of Delta V there a

14592
04:17:40,790 --> 04:17:40,800
moon so there's a lot of Delta V there a
 

14593
04:17:40,800 --> 04:17:42,590
moon so there's a lot of Delta V there a
lot of change in velocity

14594
04:17:42,590 --> 04:17:42,600
lot of change in velocity
 

14595
04:17:42,600 --> 04:17:44,689
lot of change in velocity
um Mars is actually by the time we kind

14596
04:17:44,689 --> 04:17:44,699
um Mars is actually by the time we kind
 

14597
04:17:44,699 --> 04:17:46,250
um Mars is actually by the time we kind
of crunch the numbers it's relatively

14598
04:17:46,250 --> 04:17:46,260
of crunch the numbers it's relatively
 

14599
04:17:46,260 --> 04:17:47,870
of crunch the numbers it's relatively
similar it's just a lot more difficult

14600
04:17:47,870 --> 04:17:47,880
similar it's just a lot more difficult
 

14601
04:17:47,880 --> 04:17:50,450
similar it's just a lot more difficult
like timeline wise and you know accuracy

14602
04:17:50,450 --> 04:17:50,460
like timeline wise and you know accuracy
 

14603
04:17:50,460 --> 04:17:52,610
like timeline wise and you know accuracy
and all of these other communication you

14604
04:17:52,610 --> 04:17:52,620
and all of these other communication you
 

14605
04:17:52,620 --> 04:17:53,570
and all of these other communication you
know there's a lot of other things

14606
04:17:53,570 --> 04:17:53,580
know there's a lot of other things
 

14607
04:17:53,580 --> 04:17:55,729
know there's a lot of other things
obviously involved I'm glossing over

14608
04:17:55,729 --> 04:17:55,739
obviously involved I'm glossing over
 

14609
04:17:55,739 --> 04:17:59,030
obviously involved I'm glossing over
making it sound easy it's not but

14610
04:17:59,030 --> 04:17:59,040
making it sound easy it's not but
 

14611
04:17:59,040 --> 04:17:59,689
making it sound easy it's not but
um

14612
04:17:59,689 --> 04:17:59,699
um
 

14613
04:17:59,699 --> 04:18:01,729
um
but you know I think if I think there's

14614
04:18:01,729 --> 04:18:01,739
but you know I think if I think there's
 

14615
04:18:01,739 --> 04:18:03,290
but you know I think if I think there's
a real decent chance we could see a

14616
04:18:03,290 --> 04:18:03,300
a real decent chance we could see a
 

14617
04:18:03,300 --> 04:18:05,389
a real decent chance we could see a
Starship vehicle land on Mars uh

14618
04:18:05,389 --> 04:18:05,399
Starship vehicle land on Mars uh
 

14619
04:18:05,399 --> 04:18:06,769
Starship vehicle land on Mars uh
uncrewed by the end of the decade though

14620
04:18:06,769 --> 04:18:06,779
uncrewed by the end of the decade though
 

14621
04:18:06,779 --> 04:18:09,469
uncrewed by the end of the decade though
end of the decade I mean there's also a

14622
04:18:09,469 --> 04:18:09,479
end of the decade I mean there's also a
 

14623
04:18:09,479 --> 04:18:11,510
end of the decade I mean there's also a
sociological element maybe a political

14624
04:18:11,510 --> 04:18:11,520
sociological element maybe a political
 

14625
04:18:11,520 --> 04:18:12,830
sociological element maybe a political
one where

14626
04:18:12,830 --> 04:18:12,840
one where
 

14627
04:18:12,840 --> 04:18:14,750
one where
I think you're allowed to take more

14628
04:18:14,750 --> 04:18:14,760
I think you're allowed to take more
 

14629
04:18:14,760 --> 04:18:16,610
I think you're allowed to take more
risks with Mars than you are with the

14630
04:18:16,610 --> 04:18:16,620
risks with Mars than you are with the
 

14631
04:18:16,620 --> 04:18:19,490
risks with Mars than you are with the
moon because we've done the moon 1969

14632
04:18:19,490 --> 04:18:19,500
moon because we've done the moon 1969
 

14633
04:18:19,500 --> 04:18:23,510
moon because we've done the moon 1969
yeah it's been a while so PR wise you

14634
04:18:23,510 --> 04:18:23,520
yeah it's been a while so PR wise you
 

14635
04:18:23,520 --> 04:18:25,790
yeah it's been a while so PR wise you
have to be much safer yeah with Mars

14636
04:18:25,790 --> 04:18:25,800
have to be much safer yeah with Mars
 

14637
04:18:25,800 --> 04:18:26,809
have to be much safer yeah with Mars
like everyone's like it's super

14638
04:18:26,809 --> 04:18:26,819
like everyone's like it's super
 

14639
04:18:26,819 --> 04:18:29,450
like everyone's like it's super
dangerous like super like so you could

14640
04:18:29,450 --> 04:18:29,460
dangerous like super like so you could
 

14641
04:18:29,460 --> 04:18:32,929
dangerous like super like so you could
take a little more risk 100 especially

14642
04:18:32,929 --> 04:18:32,939
take a little more risk 100 especially
 

14643
04:18:32,939 --> 04:18:35,030
take a little more risk 100 especially
with the with man missions but actually

14644
04:18:35,030 --> 04:18:35,040
with the with man missions but actually
 

14645
04:18:35,040 --> 04:18:38,630
with the with man missions but actually
just uh going back to the moon landing

14646
04:18:38,630 --> 04:18:38,640
just uh going back to the moon landing
 

14647
04:18:38,640 --> 04:18:40,969
just uh going back to the moon landing
Apollo 11 Mission I haven't talked about

14648
04:18:40,969 --> 04:18:40,979
Apollo 11 Mission I haven't talked about
 

14649
04:18:40,979 --> 04:18:42,130
Apollo 11 Mission I haven't talked about
this at all

14650
04:18:42,130 --> 04:18:42,140
this at all
 

14651
04:18:42,140 --> 04:18:45,110
this at all
the the amazing engine there but it

14652
04:18:45,110 --> 04:18:45,120
the the amazing engine there but it
 

14653
04:18:45,120 --> 04:18:47,389
the the amazing engine there but it
again the Romantic question and you look

14654
04:18:47,389 --> 04:18:47,399
again the Romantic question and you look
 

14655
04:18:47,399 --> 04:18:49,610
again the Romantic question and you look
back at that Moon landing

14656
04:18:49,610 --> 04:18:49,620
back at that Moon landing
 

14657
04:18:49,620 --> 04:18:50,630
back at that Moon landing
um

14658
04:18:50,630 --> 04:18:50,640
um
 

14659
04:18:50,640 --> 04:18:53,330
um
one small step for man one giant step

14660
04:18:53,330 --> 04:18:53,340
one small step for man one giant step
 

14661
04:18:53,340 --> 04:18:55,309
one small step for man one giant step
for mankind uh what do you think about

14662
04:18:55,309 --> 04:18:55,319
for mankind uh what do you think about
 

14663
04:18:55,319 --> 04:18:58,610
for mankind uh what do you think about
that moment in human history do you go

14664
04:18:58,610 --> 04:18:58,620
that moment in human history do you go
 

14665
04:18:58,620 --> 04:19:00,410
that moment in human history do you go
back to that often or are you focused

14666
04:19:00,410 --> 04:19:00,420
back to that often or are you focused
 

14667
04:19:00,420 --> 04:19:02,210
back to that often or are you focused
just like with the cars on the on the

14668
04:19:02,210 --> 04:19:02,220
just like with the cars on the on the
 

14669
04:19:02,220 --> 04:19:05,929
just like with the cars on the on the
engines no no I I I I still when I need

14670
04:19:05,929 --> 04:19:05,939
engines no no I I I I still when I need
 

14671
04:19:05,939 --> 04:19:07,910
engines no no I I I I still when I need
inspiration I re-watch this documentary

14672
04:19:07,910 --> 04:19:07,920
inspiration I re-watch this documentary
 

14673
04:19:07,920 --> 04:19:09,769
inspiration I re-watch this documentary
called um when we left Earth I think it

14674
04:19:09,769 --> 04:19:09,779
called um when we left Earth I think it
 

14675
04:19:09,779 --> 04:19:10,910
called um when we left Earth I think it
was like a I think it was Discovery

14676
04:19:10,910 --> 04:19:10,920
was like a I think it was Discovery
 

14677
04:19:10,920 --> 04:19:14,030
was like a I think it was Discovery
Channel did it six part episode uh it it

14678
04:19:14,030 --> 04:19:14,040
Channel did it six part episode uh it it
 

14679
04:19:14,040 --> 04:19:16,870
Channel did it six part episode uh it it
was narrated by Gary Sinise

14680
04:19:16,870 --> 04:19:16,880
was narrated by Gary Sinise
 

14681
04:19:16,880 --> 04:19:19,570
was narrated by Gary Sinise
phenomenal overview of the Space Race

14682
04:19:19,570 --> 04:19:19,580
phenomenal overview of the Space Race
 

14683
04:19:19,580 --> 04:19:22,490
phenomenal overview of the Space Race
and that will get my juices flowing

14684
04:19:22,490 --> 04:19:22,500
and that will get my juices flowing
 

14685
04:19:22,500 --> 04:19:25,189
and that will get my juices flowing
every time every time just it's so well

14686
04:19:25,189 --> 04:19:25,199
every time every time just it's so well
 

14687
04:19:25,199 --> 04:19:27,349
every time every time just it's so well
done and it's it really just summarizes

14688
04:19:27,349 --> 04:19:27,359
done and it's it really just summarizes
 

14689
04:19:27,359 --> 04:19:30,050
done and it's it really just summarizes
that program so well and when I and

14690
04:19:30,050 --> 04:19:30,060
that program so well and when I and
 

14691
04:19:30,060 --> 04:19:31,610
that program so well and when I and
Beyond it goes all the way to the Space

14692
04:19:31,610 --> 04:19:31,620
Beyond it goes all the way to the Space
 

14693
04:19:31,620 --> 04:19:33,229
Beyond it goes all the way to the Space
Shuttle but

14694
04:19:33,229 --> 04:19:33,239
Shuttle but
 

14695
04:19:33,239 --> 04:19:36,229
Shuttle but
um yeah when I when I watch footage of

14696
04:19:36,229 --> 04:19:36,239
um yeah when I when I watch footage of
 

14697
04:19:36,239 --> 04:19:39,830
um yeah when I when I watch footage of
humans walking on the moon it's just I

14698
04:19:39,830 --> 04:19:39,840
humans walking on the moon it's just I
 

14699
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:41,929
humans walking on the moon it's just I
can't believe we're dumb enough to do it

14700
04:19:41,929 --> 04:19:41,939
can't believe we're dumb enough to do it
 

14701
04:19:41,939 --> 04:19:44,330
can't believe we're dumb enough to do it
with the technology we had and the risks

14702
04:19:44,330 --> 04:19:44,340
with the technology we had and the risks
 

14703
04:19:44,340 --> 04:19:48,050
with the technology we had and the risks
they took to do it and the insane

14704
04:19:48,050 --> 04:19:48,060
they took to do it and the insane
 

14705
04:19:48,060 --> 04:19:50,450
they took to do it and the insane
engineering that it took to do that is

14706
04:19:50,450 --> 04:19:50,460
engineering that it took to do that is
 

14707
04:19:50,460 --> 04:19:53,450
engineering that it took to do that is
just absolutely astonishing the the

14708
04:19:53,450 --> 04:19:53,460
just absolutely astonishing the the
 

14709
04:19:53,460 --> 04:19:56,510
just absolutely astonishing the the
amount of the sheer like Logistics of

14710
04:19:56,510 --> 04:19:56,520
amount of the sheer like Logistics of
 

14711
04:19:56,520 --> 04:19:58,309
amount of the sheer like Logistics of
what it took to do it with the

14712
04:19:58,309 --> 04:19:58,319
what it took to do it with the
 

14713
04:19:58,319 --> 04:20:01,429
what it took to do it with the
technology we had back then is like how

14714
04:20:01,429 --> 04:20:01,439
technology we had back then is like how
 

14715
04:20:01,439 --> 04:20:04,729
technology we had back then is like how
did we have so much money and effort and

14716
04:20:04,729 --> 04:20:04,739
did we have so much money and effort and
 

14717
04:20:04,739 --> 04:20:07,070
did we have so much money and effort and
energy and time and resources human

14718
04:20:07,070 --> 04:20:07,080
energy and time and resources human
 

14719
04:20:07,080 --> 04:20:09,769
energy and time and resources human
resources to do this like it's just

14720
04:20:09,769 --> 04:20:09,779
resources to do this like it's just
 

14721
04:20:09,779 --> 04:20:12,050
resources to do this like it's just
just the weakness of the computers I had

14722
04:20:12,050 --> 04:20:12,060
just the weakness of the computers I had
 

14723
04:20:12,060 --> 04:20:14,689
just the weakness of the computers I had
back then they had to do so much I mean

14724
04:20:14,689 --> 04:20:14,699
back then they had to do so much I mean
 

14725
04:20:14,699 --> 04:20:17,510
back then they had to do so much I mean
yeah it's so much was so little it's

14726
04:20:17,510 --> 04:20:17,520
yeah it's so much was so little it's
 

14727
04:20:17,520 --> 04:20:20,929
yeah it's so much was so little it's
insane and but at the same time like

14728
04:20:20,929 --> 04:20:20,939
insane and but at the same time like
 

14729
04:20:20,939 --> 04:20:22,010
insane and but at the same time like
I don't know if we want to talk about

14730
04:20:22,010 --> 04:20:22,020
I don't know if we want to talk about
 

14731
04:20:22,020 --> 04:20:23,450
I don't know if we want to talk about
conspiracy theories or anything but like

14732
04:20:23,450 --> 04:20:23,460
conspiracy theories or anything but like
 

14733
04:20:23,460 --> 04:20:25,550
conspiracy theories or anything but like
it is all of like we have the proof and

14734
04:20:25,550 --> 04:20:25,560
it is all of like we have the proof and
 

14735
04:20:25,560 --> 04:20:28,550
it is all of like we have the proof and
the pudding of like the 400 000 people

14736
04:20:28,550 --> 04:20:28,560
the pudding of like the 400 000 people
 

14737
04:20:28,560 --> 04:20:31,610
the pudding of like the 400 000 people
on payroll like all of the paperwork all

14738
04:20:31,610 --> 04:20:31,620
on payroll like all of the paperwork all
 

14739
04:20:31,620 --> 04:20:33,710
on payroll like all of the paperwork all
of the Oh you mean the the question the

14740
04:20:33,710 --> 04:20:33,720
of the Oh you mean the the question the
 

14741
04:20:33,720 --> 04:20:35,689
of the Oh you mean the the question the
conspiracy if we land on the Moon yeah

14742
04:20:35,689 --> 04:20:35,699
conspiracy if we land on the Moon yeah
 

14743
04:20:35,699 --> 04:20:37,610
conspiracy if we land on the Moon yeah
like I mean I I think the receipts are

14744
04:20:37,610 --> 04:20:37,620
like I mean I I think the receipts are
 

14745
04:20:37,620 --> 04:20:40,130
like I mean I I think the receipts are
there like literally we did but it's

14746
04:20:40,130 --> 04:20:40,140
there like literally we did but it's
 

14747
04:20:40,140 --> 04:20:44,090
there like literally we did but it's
like a lot of things like that I mean we

14748
04:20:44,090 --> 04:20:44,100
like a lot of things like that I mean we
 

14749
04:20:44,100 --> 04:20:45,950
like a lot of things like that I mean we
actually generally live in a in a pretty

14750
04:20:45,950 --> 04:20:45,960
actually generally live in a in a pretty
 

14751
04:20:45,960 --> 04:20:47,330
actually generally live in a in a pretty
cynical time where people distrust

14752
04:20:47,330 --> 04:20:47,340
cynical time where people distrust
 

14753
04:20:47,340 --> 04:20:49,189
cynical time where people distrust
institutions part of the thing with the

14754
04:20:49,189 --> 04:20:49,199
institutions part of the thing with the
 

14755
04:20:49,199 --> 04:20:51,769
institutions part of the thing with the
space program is one of the things that

14756
04:20:51,769 --> 04:20:51,779
space program is one of the things that
 

14757
04:20:51,779 --> 04:20:54,349
space program is one of the things that
can help reinvigorate the Trust In

14758
04:20:54,349 --> 04:20:54,359
can help reinvigorate the Trust In
 

14759
04:20:54,359 --> 04:20:57,410
can help reinvigorate the Trust In
institutions by institutions even that

14760
04:20:57,410 --> 04:20:57,420
institutions by institutions even that
 

14761
04:20:57,420 --> 04:20:59,929
institutions by institutions even that
word is a bad word now but institutions

14762
04:20:59,929 --> 04:20:59,939
word is a bad word now but institutions
 

14763
04:20:59,939 --> 04:21:02,510
word is a bad word now but institutions
means a bunch of humans get together and

14764
04:21:02,510 --> 04:21:02,520
means a bunch of humans get together and
 

14765
04:21:02,520 --> 04:21:05,450
means a bunch of humans get together and
do a big thing together yeah

14766
04:21:05,450 --> 04:21:05,460
do a big thing together yeah
 

14767
04:21:05,460 --> 04:21:09,530
do a big thing together yeah
um yeah but you know like if I was

14768
04:21:09,530 --> 04:21:09,540
um yeah but you know like if I was
 

14769
04:21:09,540 --> 04:21:13,010
um yeah but you know like if I was
conspiratorily minded It's like how the

14770
04:21:13,010 --> 04:21:13,020
conspiratorily minded It's like how the
 

14771
04:21:13,020 --> 04:21:15,710
conspiratorily minded It's like how the
hell did humans do that yeah

14772
04:21:15,710 --> 04:21:15,720
hell did humans do that yeah
 

14773
04:21:15,720 --> 04:21:17,990
hell did humans do that yeah
so yeah I I think that's a very cynical

14774
04:21:17,990 --> 04:21:18,000
so yeah I I think that's a very cynical
 

14775
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:20,389
so yeah I I think that's a very cynical
take unfortunately but it's still an

14776
04:21:20,389 --> 04:21:20,399
take unfortunately but it's still an
 

14777
04:21:20,399 --> 04:21:23,030
take unfortunately but it's still an
incredible one and also you know there's

14778
04:21:23,030 --> 04:21:23,040
incredible one and also you know there's
 

14779
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:25,910
incredible one and also you know there's
grow there's uh until you look at the

14780
04:21:25,910 --> 04:21:25,920
grow there's uh until you look at the
 

14781
04:21:25,920 --> 04:21:28,790
grow there's uh until you look at the
receipts there's a kind of

14782
04:21:28,790 --> 04:21:28,800
receipts there's a kind of
 

14783
04:21:28,800 --> 04:21:30,769
receipts there's a kind of
um

14784
04:21:30,769 --> 04:21:30,779
um
 

14785
04:21:30,779 --> 04:21:32,929
um
like a rationale to that kind of

14786
04:21:32,929 --> 04:21:32,939
like a rationale to that kind of
 

14787
04:21:32,939 --> 04:21:34,990
like a rationale to that kind of
conspiracy theory because

14788
04:21:34,990 --> 04:21:35,000
conspiracy theory because
 

14789
04:21:35,000 --> 04:21:37,550
conspiracy theory because
so much pressure was put on the Space

14790
04:21:37,550 --> 04:21:37,560
so much pressure was put on the Space
 

14791
04:21:37,560 --> 04:21:40,010
so much pressure was put on the Space
Race the the pr of it to be the winner

14792
04:21:40,010 --> 04:21:40,020
Race the the pr of it to be the winner
 

14793
04:21:40,020 --> 04:21:43,070
Race the the pr of it to be the winner
so it makes sense that you might want to

14794
04:21:43,070 --> 04:21:43,080
so it makes sense that you might want to
 

14795
04:21:43,080 --> 04:21:45,710
so it makes sense that you might want to
try to take shortcuts and fake things

14796
04:21:45,710 --> 04:21:45,720
try to take shortcuts and fake things
 

14797
04:21:45,720 --> 04:21:47,710
try to take shortcuts and fake things
and you know propaganda

14798
04:21:47,710 --> 04:21:47,720
and you know propaganda
 

14799
04:21:47,720 --> 04:21:49,670
and you know propaganda
you you know different kinds of

14800
04:21:49,670 --> 04:21:49,680
you you know different kinds of
 

14801
04:21:49,680 --> 04:21:50,929
you you know different kinds of
messaging and I'm sure stuff like that

14802
04:21:50,929 --> 04:21:50,939
messaging and I'm sure stuff like that
 

14803
04:21:50,939 --> 04:21:53,450
messaging and I'm sure stuff like that
was happening some kind of like little

14804
04:21:53,450 --> 04:21:53,460
was happening some kind of like little
 

14805
04:21:53,460 --> 04:21:56,030
was happening some kind of like little
you know adjustment here and there to

14806
04:21:56,030 --> 04:21:56,040
you know adjustment here and there to
 

14807
04:21:56,040 --> 04:21:57,590
you know adjustment here and there to
present things better and so on but

14808
04:21:57,590 --> 04:21:57,600
present things better and so on but
 

14809
04:21:57,600 --> 04:21:59,330
present things better and so on but
ultimately the actual engineering

14810
04:21:59,330 --> 04:21:59,340
ultimately the actual engineering
 

14811
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:02,210
ultimately the actual engineering
project of landing on the moon I the

14812
04:22:02,210 --> 04:22:02,220
project of landing on the moon I the
 

14813
04:22:02,220 --> 04:22:04,550
project of landing on the moon I the
fact that humans did that I mean it is

14814
04:22:04,550 --> 04:22:04,560
fact that humans did that I mean it is
 

14815
04:22:04,560 --> 04:22:07,910
fact that humans did that I mean it is
sad that we didn't have better like ways

14816
04:22:07,910 --> 04:22:07,920
sad that we didn't have better like ways
 

14817
04:22:07,920 --> 04:22:09,889
sad that we didn't have better like ways
to record it and as I watched like

14818
04:22:09,889 --> 04:22:09,899
to record it and as I watched like
 

14819
04:22:09,899 --> 04:22:12,050
to record it and as I watched like
SpaceX efforts and blue origin and these

14820
04:22:12,050 --> 04:22:12,060
SpaceX efforts and blue origin and these
 

14821
04:22:12,060 --> 04:22:13,070
SpaceX efforts and blue origin and these
efforts

14822
04:22:13,070 --> 04:22:13,080
efforts
 

14823
04:22:13,080 --> 04:22:17,290
efforts
is still not trivial to record the uh

14824
04:22:17,290 --> 04:22:17,300
is still not trivial to record the uh
 

14825
04:22:17,300 --> 04:22:20,630
is still not trivial to record the uh
how just amazing awe-inspiring spaces

14826
04:22:20,630 --> 04:22:20,640
how just amazing awe-inspiring spaces
 

14827
04:22:20,640 --> 04:22:22,610
how just amazing awe-inspiring spaces
because it like

14828
04:22:22,610 --> 04:22:22,620
because it like
 

14829
04:22:22,620 --> 04:22:24,530
because it like
you know like it's like Elon jokes about

14830
04:22:24,530 --> 04:22:24,540
you know like it's like Elon jokes about
 

14831

like his face does look fake yeah like I

14832
04:22:27,889 --> 04:22:27,899
like his face does look fake yeah like I
 

14833
04:22:27,899 --> 04:22:29,630
like his face does look fake yeah like I
think there is some element of it where

14834
04:22:29,630 --> 04:22:29,640
think there is some element of it where
 

14835
04:22:29,640 --> 04:22:31,610
think there is some element of it where
you have to be there to experience it

14836
04:22:31,610 --> 04:22:31,620
you have to be there to experience it
 

14837
04:22:31,620 --> 04:22:34,389
you have to be there to experience it
really and I don't like I think it's

14838
04:22:34,389 --> 04:22:34,399
really and I don't like I think it's
 

14839
04:22:34,399 --> 04:22:37,729
really and I don't like I think it's
it's currently is still an unsolved

14840
04:22:37,729 --> 04:22:37,739
it's currently is still an unsolved
 

14841
04:22:37,739 --> 04:22:39,530
it's currently is still an unsolved
problem of how do you capture the awe of

14842
04:22:39,530 --> 04:22:39,540
problem of how do you capture the awe of
 

14843
04:22:39,540 --> 04:22:41,570
problem of how do you capture the awe of
that I mean you're one of the early

14844
04:22:41,570 --> 04:22:41,580
that I mean you're one of the early
 

14845

people that are uh part of the crew that

14846
04:22:45,410 --> 04:22:45,420
people that are uh part of the crew that
 

14847
04:22:45,420 --> 04:22:47,450
people that are uh part of the crew that
is exploring that very question I'm sure

14848
04:22:47,450 --> 04:22:47,460
is exploring that very question I'm sure
 

14849
04:22:47,460 --> 04:22:49,250
is exploring that very question I'm sure
you won't find all the answers but

14850
04:22:49,250 --> 04:22:49,260
you won't find all the answers but
 

14851
04:22:49,260 --> 04:22:51,530
you won't find all the answers but
you'll start to say like how do we

14852
04:22:51,530 --> 04:22:51,540
you'll start to say like how do we
 

14853
04:22:51,540 --> 04:22:53,570
you'll start to say like how do we
convert this into a visual format into

14854
04:22:53,570 --> 04:22:53,580
convert this into a visual format into
 

14855
04:22:53,580 --> 04:22:55,550
convert this into a visual format into
some kind of format that captures the

14856
04:22:55,550 --> 04:22:55,560
some kind of format that captures the
 

14857
04:22:55,560 --> 04:22:58,010
some kind of format that captures the
the magic of it 100 and that's a

14858
04:22:58,010 --> 04:22:58,020
the magic of it 100 and that's a
 

14859
04:22:58,020 --> 04:22:59,870
the magic of it 100 and that's a
perspective thing that I think about all

14860
04:22:59,870 --> 04:22:59,880
perspective thing that I think about all
 

14861
04:22:59,880 --> 04:23:02,630
perspective thing that I think about all
the time you know when I I'll I'll do a

14862
04:23:02,630 --> 04:23:02,640
the time you know when I I'll I'll do a
 

14863
04:23:02,640 --> 04:23:04,790
the time you know when I I'll I'll do a
lot of thinking about like what is the

14864
04:23:04,790 --> 04:23:04,800
lot of thinking about like what is the
 

14865
04:23:04,800 --> 04:23:06,410
lot of thinking about like what is the
thing that's reacting to people is it

14866
04:23:06,410 --> 04:23:06,420
thing that's reacting to people is it
 

14867
04:23:06,420 --> 04:23:08,090
thing that's reacting to people is it
the sound is it the perspective is it

14868
04:23:08,090 --> 04:23:08,100
the sound is it the perspective is it
 

14869
04:23:08,100 --> 04:23:09,650
the sound is it the perspective is it
like seeing a little tiny human next to

14870
04:23:09,650 --> 04:23:09,660
like seeing a little tiny human next to
 

14871
04:23:09,660 --> 04:23:11,750
like seeing a little tiny human next to
a landing leg that makes people go oh my

14872
04:23:11,750 --> 04:23:11,760
a landing leg that makes people go oh my
 

14873
04:23:11,760 --> 04:23:13,570
a landing leg that makes people go oh my
God this thing is huge you know just

14874
04:23:13,570 --> 04:23:13,580
God this thing is huge you know just
 

14875
04:23:13,580 --> 04:23:15,710
God this thing is huge you know just
reading you know and digesting that and

14876
04:23:15,710 --> 04:23:15,720
reading you know and digesting that and
 

14877
04:23:15,720 --> 04:23:17,330
reading you know and digesting that and
trying to help

14878
04:23:17,330 --> 04:23:17,340
trying to help
 

14879
04:23:17,340 --> 04:23:19,610
trying to help
to convey that as best as possible

14880
04:23:19,610 --> 04:23:19,620
to convey that as best as possible
 

14881
04:23:19,620 --> 04:23:21,769
to convey that as best as possible
because the stuff that we are and have

14882

because the stuff that we are and have
 

14883
04:23:21,779 --> 04:23:26,210
because the stuff that we are and have
worked on is is so cool it's so exciting

14884
04:23:26,210 --> 04:23:26,220
worked on is is so cool it's so exciting
 

14885
04:23:26,220 --> 04:23:28,429
worked on is is so cool it's so exciting
and it's so it's so important and like

14886
04:23:28,429 --> 04:23:28,439
and it's so it's so important and like
 

14887
04:23:28,439 --> 04:23:29,990
and it's so it's so important and like
actually you know

14888
04:23:29,990 --> 04:23:30,000
actually you know
 

14889
04:23:30,000 --> 04:23:31,809
actually you know
so much bigger than any one of us

14890
04:23:31,809 --> 04:23:31,819
so much bigger than any one of us
 

14891
04:23:31,819 --> 04:23:35,090
so much bigger than any one of us
physically and metaphorically it's just

14892
04:23:35,090 --> 04:23:35,100
physically and metaphorically it's just
 

14893
04:23:35,100 --> 04:23:37,010
physically and metaphorically it's just
so it's just I wish everyone had that

14894
04:23:37,010 --> 04:23:37,020
so it's just I wish everyone had that
 

14895
04:23:37,020 --> 04:23:38,809
so it's just I wish everyone had that
that experience and had that light bulb

14896
04:23:38,809 --> 04:23:38,819
that experience and had that light bulb
 

14897
04:23:38,819 --> 04:23:40,010
that experience and had that light bulb
go off and that's the cool thing that

14898
04:23:40,010 --> 04:23:40,020
go off and that's the cool thing that
 

14899
04:23:40,020 --> 04:23:42,710
go off and that's the cool thing that
you're like smack in the middle of

14900
04:23:42,710 --> 04:23:42,720
you're like smack in the middle of
 

14901
04:23:42,720 --> 04:23:45,050
you're like smack in the middle of
solving that really difficult and

14902
04:23:45,050 --> 04:23:45,060
solving that really difficult and
 

14903
04:23:45,060 --> 04:23:47,929
solving that really difficult and
fascinating problem of how how do you

14904
04:23:47,929 --> 04:23:47,939
fascinating problem of how how do you
 

14905
04:23:47,939 --> 04:23:50,090
fascinating problem of how how do you
capture the magic how do you inspire

14906
04:23:50,090 --> 04:23:50,100
capture the magic how do you inspire

04:23:50,100 --> 04:23:52,729
capture the magic how do you inspire
like that's not just an engineering

14908
04:23:52,729 --> 04:23:52,739
like that's not just an engineering
 

14909
04:23:52,739 --> 04:23:54,410
like that's not just an engineering
problem that's a communication problem

14910
04:23:54,410 --> 04:23:54,420
problem that's a communication problem
 

14911
04:23:54,420 --> 04:23:57,290
problem that's a communication problem
education I I find specifically for

14912
04:23:57,290 --> 04:23:57,300
education I I find specifically for
 

14913
04:23:57,300 --> 04:23:59,150
education I I find specifically for
myself that I get most excited about

14914
04:23:59,150 --> 04:23:59,160
myself that I get most excited about
 

14915
04:23:59,160 --> 04:24:00,349
myself that I get most excited about
something when I learn a lot about it

14916
04:24:00,349 --> 04:24:00,359
something when I learn a lot about it
 

14917
04:24:00,359 --> 04:24:01,969
something when I learn a lot about it
like when I learned the ins and outs and

14918
04:24:01,969 --> 04:24:01,979
like when I learned the ins and outs and
 

14919
04:24:01,979 --> 04:24:03,469
like when I learned the ins and outs and
I learn all the little problem solving

14920
04:24:03,469 --> 04:24:03,479
I learn all the little problem solving
 

14921
04:24:03,479 --> 04:24:06,170
I learn all the little problem solving
and the you know the cool like oh my God

14922
04:24:06,170 --> 04:24:06,180
and the you know the cool like oh my God
 

14923
04:24:06,180 --> 04:24:08,210
and the you know the cool like oh my God
they had to do what to make it work wow

14924
04:24:08,210 --> 04:24:08,220
they had to do what to make it work wow
 

14925
04:24:08,220 --> 04:24:11,030
they had to do what to make it work wow
that's amazing and that's I try to just

14926
04:24:11,030 --> 04:24:11,040
that's amazing and that's I try to just
 

14927
04:24:11,040 --> 04:24:13,550
that's amazing and that's I try to just
always go back to that thing of like

14928
04:24:13,550 --> 04:24:13,560
always go back to that thing of like
 

14929
04:24:13,560 --> 04:24:15,410
always go back to that thing of like
what can I teach myself like if I'm

14930
04:24:15,410 --> 04:24:15,420
what can I teach myself like if I'm
 

14931
04:24:15,420 --> 04:24:17,689
what can I teach myself like if I'm
every video I I expect that I learned

14932
04:24:17,689 --> 04:24:17,699
every video I I expect that I learned
 

14933
04:24:17,699 --> 04:24:19,429
every video I I expect that I learned
something making it no matter what like

14934
04:24:19,429 --> 04:24:19,439
something making it no matter what like
 

14935
04:24:19,439 --> 04:24:22,130
something making it no matter what like
no matter how uh much I think I know

14936
04:24:22,130 --> 04:24:22,140
no matter how uh much I think I know
 

14937
04:24:22,140 --> 04:24:23,389
no matter how uh much I think I know
about something at the end of the day if

14938
04:24:23,389 --> 04:24:23,399
about something at the end of the day if
 

14939
04:24:23,399 --> 04:24:24,769
about something at the end of the day if
I'm not learning something it's not a

14940
04:24:24,769 --> 04:24:24,779
I'm not learning something it's not a
 

14941
04:24:24,779 --> 04:24:27,170
I'm not learning something it's not a
good video you know and

14942
04:24:27,170 --> 04:24:27,180
good video you know and
 

14943
04:24:27,180 --> 04:24:28,849
good video you know and
I always think that people get excited

14944
04:24:28,849 --> 04:24:28,859
I always think that people get excited
 

14945
04:24:28,859 --> 04:24:31,189
I always think that people get excited
when they learn and when they have uh

14946
04:24:31,189 --> 04:24:31,199
when they learn and when they have uh
 

14947
04:24:31,199 --> 04:24:34,370
when they learn and when they have uh
some questions answered for them

14948
04:24:34,370 --> 04:24:34,380
some questions answered for them
 

14949
04:24:34,380 --> 04:24:36,950
some questions answered for them
let me ask you a couple of quick out

14950
04:24:36,950 --> 04:24:36,960
let me ask you a couple of quick out
 

14951
04:24:36,960 --> 04:24:38,750
let me ask you a couple of quick out
there futuristic questions I have to

14952
04:24:38,750 --> 04:24:38,760
there futuristic questions I have to
 

14953
04:24:38,760 --> 04:24:40,750
there futuristic questions I have to
sure I'd hate myself if I don't ask you

14954
04:24:40,750 --> 04:24:40,760
sure I'd hate myself if I don't ask you
 

14955
04:24:40,760 --> 04:24:43,010
sure I'd hate myself if I don't ask you
so first let's talk about nuclear

14956
04:24:43,010 --> 04:24:43,020
so first let's talk about nuclear
 

14957
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:44,809
so first let's talk about nuclear
propulsion so out there interesting

14958
04:24:44,809 --> 04:24:44,819
propulsion so out there interesting
 

14959
04:24:44,819 --> 04:24:48,349
propulsion so out there interesting
propulsion ideas uh so what do you think

14960
04:24:48,349 --> 04:24:48,359
propulsion ideas uh so what do you think
 

14961
04:24:48,359 --> 04:24:51,650
propulsion ideas uh so what do you think
beyond the the chemical engines that we

14962
04:24:51,650 --> 04:24:51,660
beyond the the chemical engines that we
 

14963
04:24:51,660 --> 04:24:53,330
beyond the the chemical engines that we
talked about what do you think about

14964
04:24:53,330 --> 04:24:53,340
talked about what do you think about
 

14965
04:24:53,340 --> 04:24:55,130
talked about what do you think about
using nuclear

14966
04:24:55,130 --> 04:24:55,140
using nuclear
 

14967
04:24:55,140 --> 04:24:58,269
using nuclear
fishing and maybe even nuclear fusion

14968
04:24:58,269 --> 04:24:58,279
fishing and maybe even nuclear fusion
 

14969
04:24:58,279 --> 04:25:01,790
fishing and maybe even nuclear fusion
for uh for propulsion we already have

14970
04:25:01,790 --> 04:25:01,800
for uh for propulsion we already have
 

14971
04:25:01,800 --> 04:25:04,309
for uh for propulsion we already have
thermal nuclear reactors uh they're

14972
04:25:04,309 --> 04:25:04,319
thermal nuclear reactors uh they're
 

14973
04:25:04,319 --> 04:25:06,349
thermal nuclear reactors uh they're
nuclear engines that have been tested

14974
04:25:06,349 --> 04:25:06,359
nuclear engines that have been tested
 

14975
04:25:06,359 --> 04:25:07,910
nuclear engines that have been tested
both by the United States and Soviet

14976
04:25:07,910 --> 04:25:07,920
both by the United States and Soviet
 

14977
04:25:07,920 --> 04:25:10,849
both by the United States and Soviet
Union that were 100 valid like totally

14978
04:25:10,849 --> 04:25:10,859
Union that were 100 valid like totally
 

14979
04:25:10,859 --> 04:25:14,450
Union that were 100 valid like totally
ready to go efficient super awesome

14980
04:25:14,450 --> 04:25:14,460
ready to go efficient super awesome
 

14981
04:25:14,460 --> 04:25:17,150
ready to go efficient super awesome
um yes yes yes hardcore yes

14982
04:25:17,150 --> 04:25:17,160
um yes yes yes hardcore yes
 

14983
04:25:17,160 --> 04:25:18,830
um yes yes yes hardcore yes
um and what what they're using is yeah

14984
04:25:18,830 --> 04:25:18,840
um and what what they're using is yeah
 

14985
04:25:18,840 --> 04:25:21,590
um and what what they're using is yeah
basically a fusion reactor you're

14986
04:25:21,590 --> 04:25:21,600
basically a fusion reactor you're
 

14987
04:25:21,600 --> 04:25:23,689
basically a fusion reactor you're
flowing hydrogen through it and heating

14988
04:25:23,689 --> 04:25:23,699
flowing hydrogen through it and heating
 

14989
04:25:23,699 --> 04:25:25,429
flowing hydrogen through it and heating
up the hydrogen taking it from liquid to

14990
04:25:25,429 --> 04:25:25,439
up the hydrogen taking it from liquid to
 

14991
04:25:25,439 --> 04:25:28,189
up the hydrogen taking it from liquid to
a gas you know and by heating it up

14992
04:25:28,189 --> 04:25:28,199
a gas you know and by heating it up
 

14993
04:25:28,199 --> 04:25:29,750
a gas you know and by heating it up
you're adding energy to the propellant

14994
04:25:29,750 --> 04:25:29,760
you're adding energy to the propellant
 

14995
04:25:29,760 --> 04:25:31,490
you're adding energy to the propellant
and then you're literally just using

14996
04:25:31,490 --> 04:25:31,500
and then you're literally just using
 

14997
04:25:31,500 --> 04:25:34,670
and then you're literally just using
that now steam hot hydrogen and flowing

14998
04:25:34,670 --> 04:25:34,680
that now steam hot hydrogen and flowing
 

14999
04:25:34,680 --> 04:25:36,950
that now steam hot hydrogen and flowing
it through a d level nozzle and you also

15000
04:25:36,950 --> 04:25:36,960
it through a d level nozzle and you also
 

15001
04:25:36,960 --> 04:25:38,750
it through a d level nozzle and you also
have to use that that energy to spin the

15002
04:25:38,750 --> 04:25:38,760
have to use that that energy to spin the
 

15003
04:25:38,760 --> 04:25:40,790
have to use that that energy to spin the
pumps to still pump the thing so you're

15004
04:25:40,790 --> 04:25:40,800
pumps to still pump the thing so you're
 

15005
04:25:40,800 --> 04:25:42,050
pumps to still pump the thing so you're
still kind of using like a lot of the

15006
04:25:42,050 --> 04:25:42,060
still kind of using like a lot of the
 

15007
04:25:42,060 --> 04:25:43,610
still kind of using like a lot of the
tricks that you're using but instead of

15008
04:25:43,610 --> 04:25:43,620
tricks that you're using but instead of
 

15009
04:25:43,620 --> 04:25:45,710
tricks that you're using but instead of
a chemical reaction you're literally

15010
04:25:45,710 --> 04:25:45,720
a chemical reaction you're literally
 

15011
04:25:45,720 --> 04:25:47,050
a chemical reaction you're literally
just using

15012
04:25:47,050 --> 04:25:47,060
just using
 

15013
04:25:47,060 --> 04:25:50,570
just using
nuclear fission to heat up propellant

15014
04:25:50,570 --> 04:25:50,580
nuclear fission to heat up propellant
 

15015
04:25:50,580 --> 04:25:52,250
nuclear fission to heat up propellant
and do the same thing and at the end of

15016
04:25:52,250 --> 04:25:52,260
and do the same thing and at the end of
 

15017
04:25:52,260 --> 04:25:53,630
and do the same thing and at the end of
the day end up with like eight to nine

15018
04:25:53,630 --> 04:25:53,640
the day end up with like eight to nine
 

15019
04:25:53,640 --> 04:25:54,950
the day end up with like eight to nine
hundred seconds of specific impulse

15020
04:25:54,950 --> 04:25:54,960
hundred seconds of specific impulse
 

15021
04:25:54,960 --> 04:25:56,689
hundred seconds of specific impulse
which is double that of chemical

15022
04:25:56,689 --> 04:25:56,699
which is double that of chemical
 

15023
04:25:56,699 --> 04:25:58,670
which is double that of chemical
propulsion most of that comes just

15024
04:25:58,670 --> 04:25:58,680
propulsion most of that comes just
 

15025
04:25:58,680 --> 04:26:00,410
propulsion most of that comes just
because hydrogen is so light you're only

15026
04:26:00,410 --> 04:26:00,420
because hydrogen is so light you're only
 

15027
04:26:00,420 --> 04:26:02,689
because hydrogen is so light you're only
emitting you're only ejecting hydrogen

15028
04:26:02,689 --> 04:26:02,699
emitting you're only ejecting hydrogen
 

15029
04:26:02,699 --> 04:26:04,429
emitting you're only ejecting hydrogen
out of the nozzle so the lighter

15030
04:26:04,429 --> 04:26:04,439
out of the nozzle so the lighter
 

15031
04:26:04,439 --> 04:26:07,309
out of the nozzle so the lighter
molecule is the faster you know just

15032
04:26:07,309 --> 04:26:07,319
molecule is the faster you know just
 

15033
04:26:07,319 --> 04:26:09,349
molecule is the faster you know just
like if you had a

15034
04:26:09,349 --> 04:26:09,359
like if you had a
 

15035
04:26:09,359 --> 04:26:11,870
like if you had a
you know a golf ball versus like a

15036
04:26:11,870 --> 04:26:11,880
you know a golf ball versus like a
 

15037
04:26:11,880 --> 04:26:13,729
you know a golf ball versus like a
bowling ball you can only physically

15038
04:26:13,729 --> 04:26:13,739
bowling ball you can only physically
 

15039
04:26:13,739 --> 04:26:15,889
bowling ball you can only physically
throw one so fast and the other one as a

15040
04:26:15,889 --> 04:26:15,899
throw one so fast and the other one as a
 

15041
04:26:15,899 --> 04:26:16,969
throw one so fast and the other one as a
human you're not going to do very well

15042
04:26:16,969 --> 04:26:16,979
human you're not going to do very well
 

15043
04:26:16,979 --> 04:26:19,610
human you're not going to do very well
with so you can just you get you have

15044
04:26:19,610 --> 04:26:19,620
with so you can just you get you have
 

15045
04:26:19,620 --> 04:26:22,130
with so you can just you get you have
the more potential for a higher exit

15046
04:26:22,130 --> 04:26:22,140
the more potential for a higher exit
 

15047
04:26:22,140 --> 04:26:25,550
the more potential for a higher exit
velocity so nuclear thermal amazing you

15048
04:26:25,550 --> 04:26:25,560
velocity so nuclear thermal amazing you
 

15049
04:26:25,560 --> 04:26:27,110
velocity so nuclear thermal amazing you
can just shoot these little hydrogen

15050
04:26:27,110 --> 04:26:27,120
can just shoot these little hydrogen
 

15051
04:26:27,120 --> 04:26:28,670
can just shoot these little hydrogen
molecules out crazy fast crazy

15052
04:26:28,670 --> 04:26:28,680
molecules out crazy fast crazy
 

15053
04:26:28,680 --> 04:26:31,010
molecules out crazy fast crazy
efficiently we already have it like we

15054
04:26:31,010 --> 04:26:31,020
efficiently we already have it like we
 

15055
04:26:31,020 --> 04:26:32,990
efficiently we already have it like we
can do it yes yes and actually we're

15056
04:26:32,990 --> 04:26:33,000
can do it yes yes and actually we're
 

15057
04:26:33,000 --> 04:26:35,269
can do it yes yes and actually we're
already re uh investing in that again as

15058
04:26:35,269 --> 04:26:35,279
already re uh investing in that again as
 

15059
04:26:35,279 --> 04:26:37,689
already re uh investing in that again as
United States is is looking at a

15060
04:26:37,689 --> 04:26:37,699
United States is is looking at a
 

15061
04:26:37,699 --> 04:26:39,950
United States is is looking at a
basically ramping back up our nuclear

15062
04:26:39,950 --> 04:26:39,960
basically ramping back up our nuclear
 

15063
04:26:39,960 --> 04:26:42,349
basically ramping back up our nuclear
propulsion why haven't we done it yet

15064
04:26:42,349 --> 04:26:42,359
propulsion why haven't we done it yet
 

15065
04:26:42,359 --> 04:26:44,210
propulsion why haven't we done it yet
and uh what do you think the challenges

15066
04:26:44,210 --> 04:26:44,220
and uh what do you think the challenges
 

15067
04:26:44,220 --> 04:26:45,469
and uh what do you think the challenges
are there and do you think that's an

15068
04:26:45,469 --> 04:26:45,479
are there and do you think that's an
 

15069
04:26:45,479 --> 04:26:47,210
are there and do you think that's an
obvious future like would you would you

15070
04:26:47,210 --> 04:26:47,220
obvious future like would you would you
 

15071
04:26:47,220 --> 04:26:51,050
obvious future like would you would you
see in 50 years we're not using

15072
04:26:51,050 --> 04:26:51,060
see in 50 years we're not using
 

15073
04:26:51,060 --> 04:26:52,309
see in 50 years we're not using
um

15074
04:26:52,309 --> 04:26:52,319
um
 

15075
04:26:52,319 --> 04:26:54,649
um
like we're not you for major projects

15076
04:26:54,649 --> 04:26:54,659
like we're not you for major projects
 

15077
04:26:54,659 --> 04:26:56,210
like we're not you for major projects
like a Starship type of project we're

15078
04:26:56,210 --> 04:26:56,220
like a Starship type of project we're
 

15079
04:26:56,220 --> 04:26:57,590
like a Starship type of project we're
not using chemical propulsion anymore

15080
04:26:57,590 --> 04:26:57,600
not using chemical propulsion anymore
 

15081
04:26:57,600 --> 04:26:59,990
not using chemical propulsion anymore
for getting off Earth you'll always want

15082
04:26:59,990 --> 04:27:00,000
for getting off Earth you'll always want
 

15083
04:27:00,000 --> 04:27:02,030
for getting off Earth you'll always want
to use chemical propulsion because the

15084
04:27:02,030 --> 04:27:02,040
to use chemical propulsion because the
 

15085
04:27:02,040 --> 04:27:03,889
to use chemical propulsion because the
the gas will become irradiated like you

15086
04:27:03,889 --> 04:27:03,899
the gas will become irradiated like you
 

15087
04:27:03,899 --> 04:27:05,450
the gas will become irradiated like you
don't but you don't want to and and

15088
04:27:05,450 --> 04:27:05,460
don't but you don't want to and and
 

15089
04:27:05,460 --> 04:27:06,710
don't but you don't want to and and
actually the Thruster weight ratio of

15090
04:27:06,710 --> 04:27:06,720
actually the Thruster weight ratio of
 

15091
04:27:06,720 --> 04:27:08,090
actually the Thruster weight ratio of
these engines are relatively poor

15092
04:27:08,090 --> 04:27:08,100
these engines are relatively poor
 

15093
04:27:08,100 --> 04:27:09,950
these engines are relatively poor
they're they're very heavy they have a

15094
04:27:09,950 --> 04:27:09,960
they're they're very heavy they have a
 

15095
04:27:09,960 --> 04:27:12,290
they're they're very heavy they have a
nuclear reactor like they're not they're

15096
04:27:12,290 --> 04:27:12,300
nuclear reactor like they're not they're
 

15097
04:27:12,300 --> 04:27:14,210
nuclear reactor like they're not they're
really the reason we kind of give up on

15098
04:27:14,210 --> 04:27:14,220
really the reason we kind of give up on
 

15099
04:27:14,220 --> 04:27:15,950
really the reason we kind of give up on
them is they're really most useful for

15100
04:27:15,950 --> 04:27:15,960
them is they're really most useful for
 

15101
04:27:15,960 --> 04:27:17,870
them is they're really most useful for
like interplanetary if you're trying to

15102
04:27:17,870 --> 04:27:17,880
like interplanetary if you're trying to
 

15103
04:27:17,880 --> 04:27:19,250
like interplanetary if you're trying to
get a big like if you're trying to send

15104
04:27:19,250 --> 04:27:19,260
get a big like if you're trying to send
 

15105
04:27:19,260 --> 04:27:21,710
get a big like if you're trying to send
a huge payload off to Mars nuclear

15106
04:27:21,710 --> 04:27:21,720
a huge payload off to Mars nuclear
 

15107
04:27:21,720 --> 04:27:25,370
a huge payload off to Mars nuclear
thermal is amazing it's still could be

15108
04:27:25,370 --> 04:27:25,380
thermal is amazing it's still could be
 

15109
04:27:25,380 --> 04:27:27,170
thermal is amazing it's still could be
beneficial even going to the Moon you

15110
04:27:27,170 --> 04:27:27,180
beneficial even going to the Moon you
 

15111
04:27:27,180 --> 04:27:28,610
beneficial even going to the Moon you
know like in an Earth Moon system you

15112
04:27:28,610 --> 04:27:28,620
know like in an Earth Moon system you
 

15113
04:27:28,620 --> 04:27:31,370
know like in an Earth Moon system you
could use nuclear thermal uh very

15114
04:27:31,370 --> 04:27:31,380
could use nuclear thermal uh very
 

15115
04:27:31,380 --> 04:27:32,929
could use nuclear thermal uh very
effectively it could be a great choice

15116
04:27:32,929 --> 04:27:32,939
effectively it could be a great choice
 

15117
04:27:32,939 --> 04:27:35,689
effectively it could be a great choice
but it also that starts to get into that

15118
04:27:35,689 --> 04:27:35,699
but it also that starts to get into that
 

15119
04:27:35,699 --> 04:27:37,309
but it also that starts to get into that
trait of like well we can just kind of

15120
04:27:37,309 --> 04:27:37,319
trait of like well we can just kind of
 

15121
04:27:37,319 --> 04:27:39,710
trait of like well we can just kind of
use a little bit bigger rocket and

15122
04:27:39,710 --> 04:27:39,720
use a little bit bigger rocket and
 

15123
04:27:39,720 --> 04:27:42,050
use a little bit bigger rocket and
and fly a normal you know it's it's that

15124
04:27:42,050 --> 04:27:42,060
and fly a normal you know it's it's that
 

15125
04:27:42,060 --> 04:27:45,050
and fly a normal you know it's it's that
whole trade thing but another reason why

15126
04:27:45,050 --> 04:27:45,060
whole trade thing but another reason why
 

15127
04:27:45,060 --> 04:27:46,969
whole trade thing but another reason why
we kind of stopped using them the the

15128
04:27:46,969 --> 04:27:46,979
we kind of stopped using them the the
 

15129
04:27:46,979 --> 04:27:48,349
we kind of stopped using them the the
one that the United States developed

15130
04:27:48,349 --> 04:27:48,359
one that the United States developed
 

15131
04:27:48,359 --> 04:27:51,050
one that the United States developed
nerva was so heavy only a Saturn V could

15132
04:27:51,050 --> 04:27:51,060
nerva was so heavy only a Saturn V could
 

15133
04:27:51,060 --> 04:27:53,210
nerva was so heavy only a Saturn V could
actually lift the stage of it like the

15134
04:27:53,210 --> 04:27:53,220
actually lift the stage of it like the
 

15135
04:27:53,220 --> 04:27:56,210
actually lift the stage of it like the
upper stage so replace the s4b with a

15136
04:27:56,210 --> 04:27:56,220
upper stage so replace the s4b with a
 

15137
04:27:56,220 --> 04:27:58,429
upper stage so replace the s4b with a
nuclear thermal with the nerva engine

15138
04:27:58,429 --> 04:27:58,439
nuclear thermal with the nerva engine
 

15139
04:27:58,439 --> 04:27:59,750
nuclear thermal with the nerva engine
um the Soviet Union developed one about

15140
04:27:59,750 --> 04:27:59,760
um the Soviet Union developed one about
 

15141
04:27:59,760 --> 04:28:02,330
um the Soviet Union developed one about
one tenth the size and and thrust that

15142
04:28:02,330 --> 04:28:02,340
one tenth the size and and thrust that
 

15143
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:03,950
one tenth the size and and thrust that
was small enough to fly in Pro on a

15144
04:28:03,950 --> 04:28:03,960
was small enough to fly in Pro on a
 

15145
04:28:03,960 --> 04:28:05,510
was small enough to fly in Pro on a
proton rocket

15146
04:28:05,510 --> 04:28:05,520
proton rocket
 

15147
04:28:05,520 --> 04:28:07,610
proton rocket
um but neither of them ever flew both of

15148
04:28:07,610 --> 04:28:07,620
um but neither of them ever flew both of
 

15149
04:28:07,620 --> 04:28:09,950
um but neither of them ever flew both of
them have been tested and like thumbs up

15150
04:28:09,950 --> 04:28:09,960
them have been tested and like thumbs up
 

15151
04:28:09,960 --> 04:28:13,189
them have been tested and like thumbs up
ready to go was just a huge shame to me

15152
04:28:13,189 --> 04:28:13,199
ready to go was just a huge shame to me
 

15153
04:28:13,199 --> 04:28:15,610
ready to go was just a huge shame to me
because they could unlock a lot of

15154
04:28:15,610 --> 04:28:15,620
because they could unlock a lot of
 

15155
04:28:15,620 --> 04:28:18,530
because they could unlock a lot of
interplanetary potential and yeah just

15156
04:28:18,530 --> 04:28:18,540
interplanetary potential and yeah just
 

15157
04:28:18,540 --> 04:28:19,910
interplanetary potential and yeah just
all around us which potentially

15158
04:28:19,910 --> 04:28:19,920
all around us which potentially
 

15159
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:22,849
all around us which potentially
Interstellar as well not I don't think

15160
04:28:22,849 --> 04:28:22,859
Interstellar as well not I don't think
 

15161
04:28:22,859 --> 04:28:24,889
Interstellar as well not I don't think
nuclear thermal not we're not quite

15162
04:28:24,889 --> 04:28:24,899
nuclear thermal not we're not quite
 

15163
04:28:24,899 --> 04:28:26,809
nuclear thermal not we're not quite
getting there but then you get into like

15164
04:28:26,809 --> 04:28:26,819
getting there but then you get into like
 

15165
04:28:26,819 --> 04:28:28,130
getting there but then you get into like
nuclear pulse drives and things where

15166
04:28:28,130 --> 04:28:28,140
nuclear pulse drives and things where
 

15167
04:28:28,140 --> 04:28:29,229
nuclear pulse drives and things where
you're literally like

15168
04:28:29,229 --> 04:28:29,239
you're literally like
 

15169
04:28:29,239 --> 04:28:31,490
you're literally like
basically ejecting a bomb out the back

15170
04:28:31,490 --> 04:28:31,500
basically ejecting a bomb out the back
 

15171
04:28:31,500 --> 04:28:33,830
basically ejecting a bomb out the back
of your rocket and exploding and having

15172
04:28:33,830 --> 04:28:33,840
of your rocket and exploding and having
 

15173
04:28:33,840 --> 04:28:35,809
of your rocket and exploding and having
like a shock absorber and pogo sticking

15174
04:28:35,809 --> 04:28:35,819
like a shock absorber and pogo sticking
 

15175
04:28:35,819 --> 04:28:37,910
like a shock absorber and pogo sticking
your way out of the solar system

15176
04:28:37,910 --> 04:28:37,920
your way out of the solar system
 

15177
04:28:37,920 --> 04:28:41,630
your way out of the solar system
that that's I mean by all physics sure

15178
04:28:41,630 --> 04:28:41,640
that that's I mean by all physics sure
 

15179
04:28:41,640 --> 04:28:43,429
that that's I mean by all physics sure
you know there's not nothing wrong with

15180
04:28:43,429 --> 04:28:43,439
you know there's not nothing wrong with
 

15181
04:28:43,439 --> 04:28:44,630
you know there's not nothing wrong with
that it's not breaking any laws of

15182
04:28:44,630 --> 04:28:44,640
that it's not breaking any laws of
 

15183
04:28:44,640 --> 04:28:45,950
that it's not breaking any laws of
physics and

15184
04:28:45,950 --> 04:28:45,960
physics and
 

15185
04:28:45,960 --> 04:28:47,689
physics and
you know I but I just don't see us

15186
04:28:47,689 --> 04:28:47,699
you know I but I just don't see us
 

15187
04:28:47,699 --> 04:28:50,030
you know I but I just don't see us
getting to that need anytime soon I

15188
04:28:50,030 --> 04:28:50,040
getting to that need anytime soon I
 

15189
04:28:50,040 --> 04:28:51,110
getting to that need anytime soon I
don't think we're just going to travel

15190
04:28:51,110 --> 04:28:51,120
don't think we're just going to travel
 

15191
04:28:51,120 --> 04:28:53,809
don't think we're just going to travel
yeah I mean that's that's I think we're

15192
04:28:53,809 --> 04:28:53,819
yeah I mean that's that's I think we're
 

15193
04:28:53,819 --> 04:28:55,309
yeah I mean that's that's I think we're
going to want a better understanding of

15194
04:28:55,309 --> 04:28:55,319
going to want a better understanding of
 

15195
04:28:55,319 --> 04:28:58,610
going to want a better understanding of
physics and physics itself yeah do you

15196
04:28:58,610 --> 04:28:58,620
physics and physics itself yeah do you
 

15197
04:28:58,620 --> 04:29:00,649
physics and physics itself yeah do you
have a hope that maybe theoretical

15198
04:29:00,649 --> 04:29:00,659
have a hope that maybe theoretical
 

15199
04:29:00,659 --> 04:29:02,330
have a hope that maybe theoretical
physics will open the door to some

15200
04:29:02,330 --> 04:29:02,340
physics will open the door to some
 

15201
04:29:02,340 --> 04:29:05,570
physics will open the door to some
exciting propulsion systems yeah I do I

15202
04:29:05,570 --> 04:29:05,580
exciting propulsion systems yeah I do I
 

15203
04:29:05,580 --> 04:29:07,370
exciting propulsion systems yeah I do I
think we're still at the very infancy of

15204
04:29:07,370 --> 04:29:07,380
think we're still at the very infancy of
 

15205
04:29:07,380 --> 04:29:09,469
think we're still at the very infancy of
our understanding of everything and how

15206
04:29:09,469 --> 04:29:09,479
our understanding of everything and how
 

15207
04:29:09,479 --> 04:29:12,229
our understanding of everything and how
things work and you know 100 years ago

15208
04:29:12,229 --> 04:29:12,239
things work and you know 100 years ago
 

15209
04:29:12,239 --> 04:29:13,729
things work and you know 100 years ago
it would be stupid to try to predict the

15210
04:29:13,729 --> 04:29:13,739
it would be stupid to try to predict the
 

15211
04:29:13,739 --> 04:29:16,070
it would be stupid to try to predict the
things we know today and who knows like

15212
04:29:16,070 --> 04:29:16,080
things we know today and who knows like
 

15213
04:29:16,080 --> 04:29:17,269
things we know today and who knows like
even you know I think about things like

15214
04:29:17,269 --> 04:29:17,279
even you know I think about things like
 

15215
04:29:17,279 --> 04:29:19,969
even you know I think about things like
James Webb looking deeper into our solar

15216
04:29:19,969 --> 04:29:19,979
James Webb looking deeper into our solar
 

15217
04:29:19,979 --> 04:29:21,769
James Webb looking deeper into our solar
system than ever before and physically

15218
04:29:21,769 --> 04:29:21,779
system than ever before and physically
 

15219
04:29:21,779 --> 04:29:23,269
system than ever before and physically
being able to see objects that we just

15220
04:29:23,269 --> 04:29:23,279
being able to see objects that we just
 

15221
04:29:23,279 --> 04:29:24,590
being able to see objects that we just
have not even been able to physically

15222
04:29:24,590 --> 04:29:24,600
have not even been able to physically
 

15223
04:29:24,600 --> 04:29:27,410
have not even been able to physically
see before on being able to study black

15224
04:29:27,410 --> 04:29:27,420
see before on being able to study black
 

15225
04:29:27,420 --> 04:29:29,870
see before on being able to study black
holes for example uh a better better

15226
04:29:29,870 --> 04:29:29,880
holes for example uh a better better
 

15227
04:29:29,880 --> 04:29:31,250
holes for example uh a better better
this stuff that's happening outside of

15228
04:29:31,250 --> 04:29:31,260
this stuff that's happening outside of
 

15229
04:29:31,260 --> 04:29:33,410
this stuff that's happening outside of
black holes at the edges of black holes

15230
04:29:33,410 --> 04:29:33,420
black holes at the edges of black holes
 

15231
04:29:33,420 --> 04:29:36,530
black holes at the edges of black holes
how the information is stored uh the uh

15232
04:29:36,530 --> 04:29:36,540
how the information is stored uh the uh
 

15233
04:29:36,540 --> 04:29:39,530
how the information is stored uh the uh
100 holographic principles just there's

15234
04:29:39,530 --> 04:29:39,540
100 holographic principles just there's
 

15235
04:29:39,540 --> 04:29:42,729
100 holographic principles just there's
so much weirdness black holes yes around

15236
04:29:42,729 --> 04:29:42,739
so much weirdness black holes yes around
 

15237
04:29:42,739 --> 04:29:47,870
so much weirdness black holes yes around
where gravity starts bending light

15238
04:29:47,870 --> 04:29:47,880
where gravity starts bending light
 

15239
04:29:47,880 --> 04:29:50,870
where gravity starts bending light
it's like all right we get to look at

15240
04:29:50,870 --> 04:29:50,880
it's like all right we get to look at
 

15241
04:29:50,880 --> 04:29:53,210
it's like all right we get to look at
that now and start to wonder like what

15242
04:29:53,210 --> 04:29:53,220
that now and start to wonder like what
 

15243
04:29:53,220 --> 04:29:56,929
that now and start to wonder like what
is going on and how can we like use that

15244
04:29:56,929 --> 04:29:56,939
is going on and how can we like use that
 

15245
04:29:56,939 --> 04:29:59,630
is going on and how can we like use that
somehow exactly propulsion I mean it

15246
04:29:59,630 --> 04:29:59,640
somehow exactly propulsion I mean it
 

15247
04:29:59,640 --> 04:30:01,490
somehow exactly propulsion I mean it
seems like awfully crazy and futuristic

15248
04:30:01,490 --> 04:30:01,500
seems like awfully crazy and futuristic
 

15249
04:30:01,500 --> 04:30:03,469
seems like awfully crazy and futuristic
at this moment but I think that's

15250
04:30:03,469 --> 04:30:03,479
at this moment but I think that's
 

15251
04:30:03,479 --> 04:30:07,010
at this moment but I think that's
because we know almost nothing about uh

15252
04:30:07,010 --> 04:30:07,020
because we know almost nothing about uh
 

15253
04:30:07,020 --> 04:30:09,110
because we know almost nothing about uh
you know that those kinds of objects

15254
04:30:09,110 --> 04:30:09,120
you know that those kinds of objects
 

15255
04:30:09,120 --> 04:30:12,950
you know that those kinds of objects
where again where the general relativity

15256
04:30:12,950 --> 04:30:12,960
where again where the general relativity
 

15257
04:30:12,960 --> 04:30:16,670
where again where the general relativity
and quantum mechanics start to start to

15258
04:30:16,670 --> 04:30:16,680
and quantum mechanics start to start to
 

15259
04:30:16,680 --> 04:30:18,229
and quantum mechanics start to start to
um have to be both considered to

15260
04:30:18,229 --> 04:30:18,239
um have to be both considered to
 

15261
04:30:18,239 --> 04:30:20,030
um have to be both considered to
describe those kinds of objects and as

15262
04:30:20,030 --> 04:30:20,040
describe those kinds of objects and as
 

15263
04:30:20,040 --> 04:30:21,769
describe those kinds of objects and as
we study those objects we might figure

15264
04:30:21,769 --> 04:30:21,779
we study those objects we might figure
 

15265
04:30:21,779 --> 04:30:23,809
we study those objects we might figure
out some kind of unification thing that

15266
04:30:23,809 --> 04:30:23,819
out some kind of unification thing that
 

15267
04:30:23,819 --> 04:30:26,750
out some kind of unification thing that
will allow us to uh understand maybe how

15268
04:30:26,750 --> 04:30:26,760
will allow us to uh understand maybe how
 

15269
04:30:26,760 --> 04:30:29,330
will allow us to uh understand maybe how
to use black holes to for propulsion

15270
04:30:29,330 --> 04:30:29,340
to use black holes to for propulsion
 

15271
04:30:29,340 --> 04:30:31,389
to use black holes to for propulsion
like yeah

15272
04:30:31,389 --> 04:30:31,399
like yeah
 

15273
04:30:31,399 --> 04:30:33,530
like yeah
I could say a lot of crazy things but

15274
04:30:33,530 --> 04:30:33,540
I could say a lot of crazy things but
 

15275
04:30:33,540 --> 04:30:35,149
I could say a lot of crazy things but
like basically but the point is it'd be

15276
04:30:35,149 --> 04:30:35,159
like basically but the point is it'd be
 

15277
04:30:35,159 --> 04:30:37,550
like basically but the point is it'd be
stupid for us to even guess about things

15278
04:30:37,550 --> 04:30:37,560
stupid for us to even guess about things
 

15279
04:30:37,560 --> 04:30:38,929
stupid for us to even guess about things
we don't even know about yet you know

15280
04:30:38,929 --> 04:30:38,939
we don't even know about yet you know
 

15281
04:30:38,939 --> 04:30:41,269
we don't even know about yet you know
what I mean like and so therefore I'm

15282
04:30:41,269 --> 04:30:41,279
what I mean like and so therefore I'm
 

15283
04:30:41,279 --> 04:30:42,889
what I mean like and so therefore I'm
not going to say that the best option

15284
04:30:42,889 --> 04:30:42,899
not going to say that the best option
 

15285
04:30:42,899 --> 04:30:44,830
not going to say that the best option
for Interstellar travel is

15286
04:30:44,830 --> 04:30:44,840
for Interstellar travel is
 

15287
04:30:44,840 --> 04:30:47,330
for Interstellar travel is
nuclear drives like that could be like

15288
04:30:47,330 --> 04:30:47,340
nuclear drives like that could be like
 

15289
04:30:47,340 --> 04:30:50,030
nuclear drives like that could be like
someone saying you know in 1600 the only

15290
04:30:50,030 --> 04:30:50,040
someone saying you know in 1600 the only
 

15291
04:30:50,040 --> 04:30:52,070
someone saying you know in 1600 the only
way to fly is by strapping a thousand

15292
04:30:52,070 --> 04:30:52,080
way to fly is by strapping a thousand
 

15293
04:30:52,080 --> 04:30:54,110
way to fly is by strapping a thousand
Birds to your head you know like

15294
04:30:54,110 --> 04:30:54,120
Birds to your head you know like
 

15295
04:30:54,120 --> 04:30:57,590
Birds to your head you know like
but that said I mean everything you're

15296
04:30:57,590 --> 04:30:57,600
but that said I mean everything you're
 

15297
04:30:57,600 --> 04:30:59,929
but that said I mean everything you're
saying is right but the human history is

15298
04:30:59,929 --> 04:30:59,939
saying is right but the human history is
 

15299
04:30:59,939 --> 04:31:01,370
saying is right but the human history is
such like at the beginning of the 20th

15300
04:31:01,370 --> 04:31:01,380
such like at the beginning of the 20th
 

15301
04:31:01,380 --> 04:31:03,469
such like at the beginning of the 20th
century physicists Rutherford they

15302
04:31:03,469 --> 04:31:03,479
century physicists Rutherford they
 

15303
04:31:03,479 --> 04:31:05,269
century physicists Rutherford they
everybody this This brilliant people

15304
04:31:05,269 --> 04:31:05,279
everybody this This brilliant people
 

15305
04:31:05,279 --> 04:31:07,490
everybody this This brilliant people
that said we've basically solved all of

15306
04:31:07,490 --> 04:31:07,500
that said we've basically solved all of
 

15307
04:31:07,500 --> 04:31:09,649
that said we've basically solved all of
it right if you talk to most physicists

15308
04:31:09,649 --> 04:31:09,659
it right if you talk to most physicists
 

15309
04:31:09,659 --> 04:31:12,050
it right if you talk to most physicists
I think they're going to say like we've

15310
04:31:12,050 --> 04:31:12,060
I think they're going to say like we've
 

15311
04:31:12,060 --> 04:31:13,729
I think they're going to say like we've
pretty much

15312
04:31:13,729 --> 04:31:13,739
pretty much
 

15313
04:31:13,739 --> 04:31:16,670
pretty much
solved like the standard model describes

15314
04:31:16,670 --> 04:31:16,680
solved like the standard model describes
 

15315
04:31:16,680 --> 04:31:19,790
solved like the standard model describes
physics extremely accurately right uh

15316
04:31:19,790 --> 04:31:19,800
physics extremely accurately right uh
 

15317
04:31:19,800 --> 04:31:22,429
physics extremely accurately right uh
general relativity explains the cosmos

15318
04:31:22,429 --> 04:31:22,439
general relativity explains the cosmos
 

15319
04:31:22,439 --> 04:31:24,830
general relativity explains the cosmos
as we observe them extremely accurately

15320
04:31:24,830 --> 04:31:24,840
as we observe them extremely accurately
 

15321
04:31:24,840 --> 04:31:26,450
as we observe them extremely accurately
yeah there's a whole Dark Matter Dark

15322
04:31:26,450 --> 04:31:26,460
yeah there's a whole Dark Matter Dark
 

15323
04:31:26,460 --> 04:31:28,490
yeah there's a whole Dark Matter Dark
Energy things whatever yeah but uh

15324
04:31:28,490 --> 04:31:28,500
Energy things whatever yeah but uh
 

15325
04:31:28,500 --> 04:31:31,370
Energy things whatever yeah but uh
outside of that so like we basically

15326
04:31:31,370 --> 04:31:31,380
outside of that so like we basically
 

15327
04:31:31,380 --> 04:31:33,010
outside of that so like we basically
solved like

15328
04:31:33,010 --> 04:31:33,020
solved like
 

15329
04:31:33,020 --> 04:31:37,370
solved like
like where are you going to find gaps in

15330
04:31:37,370 --> 04:31:37,380
like where are you going to find gaps in
 

15331
04:31:37,380 --> 04:31:38,689
like where are you going to find gaps in
knowledge that are going to somehow

15332
04:31:38,689 --> 04:31:38,699
knowledge that are going to somehow
 

15333
04:31:38,699 --> 04:31:41,030
knowledge that are going to somehow
create warp drives or something like

15334
04:31:41,030 --> 04:31:41,040
create warp drives or something like
 

15335
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:45,649
create warp drives or something like
that so wormholes uh but uh that's it

15336
04:31:45,649 --> 04:31:45,659
that so wormholes uh but uh that's it
 

15337
04:31:45,659 --> 04:31:47,210
that so wormholes uh but uh that's it
seems like throughout history we prove

15338
04:31:47,210 --> 04:31:47,220
seems like throughout history we prove
 

15339
04:31:47,220 --> 04:31:49,309
seems like throughout history we prove
ourselves wrong time and time again yes

15340
04:31:49,309 --> 04:31:49,319
ourselves wrong time and time again yes
 

15341
04:31:49,319 --> 04:31:52,610
ourselves wrong time and time again yes
no I and I this is well outside of any

15342
04:31:52,610 --> 04:31:52,620
no I and I this is well outside of any
 

15343
04:31:52,620 --> 04:31:54,229
no I and I this is well outside of any
of my knowledge base so I want to make

15344
04:31:54,229 --> 04:31:54,239
of my knowledge base so I want to make
 

15345
04:31:54,239 --> 04:31:55,969
of my knowledge base so I want to make
sure that if I say anything stupid it's

15346
04:31:55,969 --> 04:31:55,979
sure that if I say anything stupid it's
 

15347
04:31:55,979 --> 04:31:58,849
sure that if I say anything stupid it's
because I'm I just did a peasant here in

15348
04:31:58,849 --> 04:31:58,859
because I'm I just did a peasant here in
 

15349
04:31:58,859 --> 04:32:01,130
because I'm I just did a peasant here in
physics land but yes

15350
04:32:01,130 --> 04:32:01,140
physics land but yes
 

15351
04:32:01,140 --> 04:32:02,929
physics land but yes
um we're all peasants in physics land

15352
04:32:02,929 --> 04:32:02,939
um we're all peasants in physics land
 

15353
04:32:02,939 --> 04:32:06,110
um we're all peasants in physics land
but I really just think like it's very

15354
04:32:06,110 --> 04:32:06,120
but I really just think like it's very
 

15355
04:32:06,120 --> 04:32:07,550
but I really just think like it's very
humbling that we're still using chemical

15356
04:32:07,550 --> 04:32:07,560
humbling that we're still using chemical
 

15357
04:32:07,560 --> 04:32:09,830
humbling that we're still using chemical
propulsion and and variant cell like

15358
04:32:09,830 --> 04:32:09,840
propulsion and and variant cell like
 

15359
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:11,809
propulsion and and variant cell like
injecting mass to to propel ourselves

15360
04:32:11,809 --> 04:32:11,819
injecting mass to to propel ourselves
 

15361
04:32:11,819 --> 04:32:14,330
injecting mass to to propel ourselves
and I I and no matter how you get at it

15362
04:32:14,330 --> 04:32:14,340
and I I and no matter how you get at it
 

15363
04:32:14,340 --> 04:32:17,210
and I I and no matter how you get at it
and I think someday I I would expect

to get beyond that
 

15369
04:32:21,420 --> 04:32:25,370
to get beyond that

then um
 

15421
04:33:31,080 --> 04:33:34,131
then um
then then something like an antimatter

15422

then then something like an antimatter
 

15423

um in that sense whether he's lying or

15430
04:33:42,650 --> 04:33:42,660
um in that sense whether he's lying or
 

15431
04:33:42,660 --> 04:33:44,869
um in that sense whether he's lying or
not are both interesting things to

not are both interesting things to
 

15433
04:33:44,879 --> 04:33:46,730
not are both interesting things to
explore from a psychology perspective

15434
04:33:46,730 --> 04:33:46,740
explore from a psychology perspective
 

15435

04:33:51,299 --> 04:33:53,330
and he's basically saying that I guess
it's an alien

just total you know quack
and then another part of me still is

15464
04:34:17,810 --> 04:34:17,820
and then another part of me still is
 

15465
04:34:17,820 --> 04:34:19,490
and then another part of me still is
like this is exciting and fun to think

15466
04:34:19,490 --> 04:34:19,500
like this is exciting and fun to think
 

15467
04:34:19,500 --> 04:34:21,769
like this is exciting and fun to think
that this is all real and then another

15468
04:34:21,769 --> 04:34:21,779
that this is all real and then another
 

15469
04:34:21,779 --> 04:34:23,449
that this is all real and then another
part of me goes why

15470
04:34:23,449 --> 04:34:23,459
part of me goes why
 

15471
04:34:23,459 --> 04:34:25,970

really good like good storytelling good

15476
04:34:30,590 --> 04:34:30,600
really good like good storytelling good
 

15477

I don't know I'm really very skeptical

15480
04:34:35,269 --> 04:34:35,279
I don't know I'm really very skeptical
 

15481
04:34:35,279 --> 04:34:37,131
I don't know I'm really very skeptical
about anyone explaining anything like

15482

about anyone explaining anything like
 

15483
04:34:37,141 --> 04:34:39,529
about anyone explaining anything like
this like I mean my my radar is like

15484
04:34:39,529 --> 04:34:39,539
this like I mean my my radar is like
 

15485
04:34:39,539 --> 04:34:42,170
this like I mean my my radar is like
screaming at me like this is all app

15486
04:34:42,170 --> 04:34:42,180
screaming at me like this is all app
 

15487
04:34:42,180 --> 04:34:44,269
screaming at me like this is all app
full crap you know

15488
04:34:44,269 --> 04:34:44,279
full crap you know
 

15489
04:34:44,279 --> 04:34:46,070
full crap you know
but I'd say like there's still an

15490
04:34:46,070 --> 04:34:46,080
but I'd say like there's still an
 

15491
04:34:46,080 --> 04:34:48,349
but I'd say like there's still an
apartment just like man that is kind of

15492
04:34:48,349 --> 04:34:48,359
apartment just like man that is kind of
 

15493
04:34:48,359 --> 04:34:50,990
apartment just like man that is kind of
cool how did he know that and like you

15494
04:34:50,990 --> 04:34:51,000
cool how did he know that and like you
 

15495
04:34:51,000 --> 04:34:52,310
cool how did he know that and like you
know what I mean well I think you're

15496
04:34:52,310 --> 04:34:52,320
know what I mean well I think you're
 

15497
04:34:52,320 --> 04:34:53,929
know what I mean well I think you're
conflicted I think you're actually in

15498
04:34:53,929 --> 04:34:53,939
conflicted I think you're actually in
 

15499
04:34:53,939 --> 04:34:55,310

the in the best kind of place because

15500
04:34:55,310 --> 04:34:55,320
the in the best kind of place because
 

15501
04:34:55,320 --> 04:34:56,810
the in the best kind of place because
it's uh

15502

it's uh
 

15503
04:34:56,820 --> 04:34:58,609
it's uh
I'm afraid of being the kind of person

it's definitely
 

15509
04:35:03,299 --> 04:35:04,970
it's definitely
um he's definitely full of crap and

15510
04:35:04,970 --> 04:35:04,980
um he's definitely full of crap and
 

15511
04:35:04,980 --> 04:35:06,590
um he's definitely full of crap and
basically closed my mind off to all that

15512
04:35:06,590 --> 04:35:06,600
basically closed my mind off to all that
 

15513

closes my mind off to a thing that's
 

15517
04:35:10,799 --> 04:35:14,390
closes my mind off to a thing that's
actually uh a early thread to a

15518
04:35:14,390 --> 04:35:14,400
actually uh a early thread to a
 

15519
04:35:14,400 --> 04:35:17,150
actually uh a early thread to a
brilliant to it to a future to a

15520
04:35:17,150 --> 04:35:17,160
brilliant to it to a future to a
 

15521
04:35:17,160 --> 04:35:21,109
brilliant to it to a future to a
fascinating solution to a mystery so uh

15522
04:35:21,109 --> 04:35:21,119
fascinating solution to a mystery so uh
 

15523
04:35:21,119 --> 04:35:23,029
fascinating solution to a mystery so uh
but in this case I mean I have so many

15524
04:35:23,029 --> 04:35:23,039
but in this case I mean I have so many
 

15525
04:35:23,039 --> 04:35:24,590
but in this case I mean I have so many
red flags from a psychological

15526
04:35:24,590 --> 04:35:24,600
red flags from a psychological
 

15527
04:35:24,600 --> 04:35:27,410
red flags from a psychological
perspective that um

15528
04:35:27,410 --> 04:35:27,420
perspective that um
 

15529
04:35:27,420 --> 04:35:30,709
perspective that um
that but again uh outside of this

15530
04:35:30,709 --> 04:35:30,719
that but again uh outside of this
 

15531
04:35:30,719 --> 04:35:32,810
that but again uh outside of this
particular individual I do wonder if

15532
04:35:32,810 --> 04:35:32,820
particular individual I do wonder if
 

15533
04:35:32,820 --> 04:35:35,330
particular individual I do wonder if
aliens have visited us

15534
04:35:35,330 --> 04:35:35,340
aliens have visited us
 

15535
04:35:35,340 --> 04:35:37,730
aliens have visited us
I think aliens are everywhere I think

15536
04:35:37,730 --> 04:35:37,740
I think aliens are everywhere I think
 

15537
04:35:37,740 --> 04:35:40,609
I think aliens are everywhere I think
the universe is teeming with alien life

15538
04:35:40,609 --> 04:35:40,619
the universe is teeming with alien life
 

15539
04:35:40,619 --> 04:35:43,310
the universe is teeming with alien life
I mean there's

15540
04:35:43,310 --> 04:35:43,320
I mean there's
 

15541
04:35:43,320 --> 04:35:44,689
I mean there's
it's very difficult for me to

15542
04:35:44,689 --> 04:35:44,699
it's very difficult for me to
 

15543
04:35:44,699 --> 04:35:47,990
it's very difficult for me to
statistically understand given

15544
04:35:47,990 --> 04:35:48,000
statistically understand given
 

15545
04:35:48,000 --> 04:35:49,849
statistically understand given
how

15546
04:35:49,849 --> 04:35:49,859
how
 

15547
04:35:49,859 --> 04:35:52,551
how
life finds a way here on Earth just

15548
04:35:52,551 --> 04:35:52,561
life finds a way here on Earth just
 

15549
04:35:52,561 --> 04:35:55,070
life finds a way here on Earth just
everywhere is the entire history of life

15550
04:35:55,070 --> 04:35:55,080
everywhere is the entire history of life
 

15551
04:35:55,080 --> 04:35:58,429
everywhere is the entire history of life
on Earth from the very origin of life it

15552
04:35:58,429 --> 04:35:58,439
on Earth from the very origin of life it
 

15553
04:35:58,439 --> 04:36:00,910
on Earth from the very origin of life it
seems to be damn good at doing its thing

15554
04:36:00,910 --> 04:36:00,920
seems to be damn good at doing its thing
 

15555
04:36:00,920 --> 04:36:03,289
seems to be damn good at doing its thing
evolving to get better and better and

15556
04:36:03,289 --> 04:36:03,299
evolving to get better and better and
 

15557
04:36:03,299 --> 04:36:05,150
evolving to get better and better and
better at doing its thing now there

15558
04:36:05,150 --> 04:36:05,160
better at doing its thing now there
 

15559
04:36:05,160 --> 04:36:07,070
better at doing its thing now there
could be some special aspects to the

15560
04:36:07,070 --> 04:36:07,080
could be some special aspects to the
 

15561
04:36:07,080 --> 04:36:08,810
could be some special aspects to the
origin of life itself which is

15562
04:36:08,810 --> 04:36:08,820
origin of life itself which is
 

15563
04:36:08,820 --> 04:36:11,029
origin of life itself which is
completely not understood so maybe the

15564
04:36:11,029 --> 04:36:11,039
completely not understood so maybe the
 

15565
04:36:11,039 --> 04:36:13,609
completely not understood so maybe the
true magic is in the origin of life

15566
04:36:13,609 --> 04:36:13,619
true magic is in the origin of life
 

15567
04:36:13,619 --> 04:36:15,529
true magic is in the origin of life
or it could be that there is some

15568
04:36:15,529 --> 04:36:15,539
or it could be that there is some
 

15569
04:36:15,539 --> 04:36:18,890
or it could be that there is some
magical leaps uh to uh eukaryotic cells

15570
04:36:18,890 --> 04:36:18,900
magical leaps uh to uh eukaryotic cells
 

15571
04:36:18,900 --> 04:36:21,830
magical leaps uh to uh eukaryotic cells
for example that the Universe our

15572
04:36:21,830 --> 04:36:21,840
for example that the Universe our
 

15573
04:36:21,840 --> 04:36:23,570
for example that the Universe our
galaxies teeming with alien life but

15574
04:36:23,570 --> 04:36:23,580
galaxies teeming with alien life but
 

15575
04:36:23,580 --> 04:36:25,490
galaxies teeming with alien life but
it's all bacteria they're all boring

15576
04:36:25,490 --> 04:36:25,500
it's all bacteria they're all boring
 

15577
04:36:25,500 --> 04:36:27,949
it's all bacteria they're all boring
bacteria or exciting bacteria no offense

15578
04:36:27,949 --> 04:36:27,959
bacteria or exciting bacteria no offense
 

15579
04:36:27,959 --> 04:36:30,949
bacteria or exciting bacteria no offense
to bacteria the but the no intelligence

15580
04:36:30,949 --> 04:36:30,959
to bacteria the but the no intelligence
 

15581
04:36:30,959 --> 04:36:33,230
to bacteria the but the no intelligence
space-faring civilizations I don't know

15582
04:36:33,230 --> 04:36:33,240
space-faring civilizations I don't know
 

15583
04:36:33,240 --> 04:36:34,310
space-faring civilizations I don't know
but

15584
04:36:34,310 --> 04:36:34,320
but
 

15585
04:36:34,320 --> 04:36:36,230
but
I just if I were to guess if I had to

15586
04:36:36,230 --> 04:36:36,240
I just if I were to guess if I had to
 

15587
04:36:36,240 --> 04:36:37,551
I just if I were to guess if I had to
bet all my money

15588
04:36:37,551 --> 04:36:37,561
bet all my money
 

15589
04:36:37,561 --> 04:36:40,849
bet all my money
there is space faring civilizations

15590
04:36:40,849 --> 04:36:40,859
there is space faring civilizations
 

15591
04:36:40,859 --> 04:36:42,830
there is space faring civilizations
everywhere in the universe

15592
04:36:42,830 --> 04:36:42,840
everywhere in the universe
 

15593
04:36:42,840 --> 04:36:45,170
everywhere in the universe
and the fact that they're not that they

15594
04:36:45,170 --> 04:36:45,180
and the fact that they're not that they
 

15595
04:36:45,180 --> 04:36:48,230
and the fact that they're not that they
have not been directly definitively

15596
04:36:48,230 --> 04:36:48,240
have not been directly definitively
 

15597
04:36:48,240 --> 04:36:49,929
have not been directly definitively
observed

15598
04:36:49,929 --> 04:36:49,939
observed
 

15599
04:36:49,939 --> 04:36:53,029
observed
confuses me and I think it's a mystery

15600
04:36:53,029 --> 04:36:53,039
confuses me and I think it's a mystery
 

15601
04:36:53,039 --> 04:36:56,209
confuses me and I think it's a mystery
and if I were to suggest what solution

15602
04:36:56,209 --> 04:36:56,219
and if I were to suggest what solution
 

15603
04:36:56,219 --> 04:36:58,369
and if I were to suggest what solution
to that mystery is is they might look

15604
04:36:58,369 --> 04:36:58,379
to that mystery is is they might look
 

15605
04:36:58,379 --> 04:37:00,529
to that mystery is is they might look
extremely different from us

15606
04:37:00,529 --> 04:37:00,539
extremely different from us
 

15607
04:37:00,539 --> 04:37:03,170
extremely different from us
and we might be too dumb to detect them

15608
04:37:03,170 --> 04:37:03,180
and we might be too dumb to detect them
 

15609
04:37:03,180 --> 04:37:06,410
and we might be too dumb to detect them
yeah and then and so there I think you

15610
04:37:06,410 --> 04:37:06,420
yeah and then and so there I think you
 

15611
04:37:06,420 --> 04:37:08,390
yeah and then and so there I think you
have to be extremely open-minded

15612
04:37:08,390 --> 04:37:08,400
have to be extremely open-minded
 

15613
04:37:08,400 --> 04:37:12,010
have to be extremely open-minded
at what would we be looking for right

15614
04:37:12,010 --> 04:37:12,020
at what would we be looking for right
 

15615
04:37:12,020 --> 04:37:14,810
at what would we be looking for right
that and that that's a very practical

15616
04:37:14,810 --> 04:37:14,820
that and that that's a very practical
 

15617
04:37:14,820 --> 04:37:17,449
that and that that's a very practical
thing to be open-minded about and

15618
04:37:17,449 --> 04:37:17,459
thing to be open-minded about and
 

15619
04:37:17,459 --> 04:37:20,570
thing to be open-minded about and
practically speaking if we were to be

15620
04:37:20,570 --> 04:37:20,580
practically speaking if we were to be
 

15621
04:37:20,580 --> 04:37:22,849
practically speaking if we were to be
able to even detect them from a distance

15622
04:37:22,849 --> 04:37:22,859
able to even detect them from a distance
 

15623
04:37:22,859 --> 04:37:26,150
able to even detect them from a distance
get a tech techno signature of a distant

15624
04:37:26,150 --> 04:37:26,160
get a tech techno signature of a distant
 

15625
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:29,449
get a tech techno signature of a distant
planet of a distant star system that has

15626
04:37:29,449 --> 04:37:29,459
planet of a distant star system that has
 

15627
04:37:29,459 --> 04:37:31,189
planet of a distant star system that has
alien life

15628
04:37:31,189 --> 04:37:31,199
alien life
 

15629
04:37:31,199 --> 04:37:33,650
alien life
honestly the number one thing I kind of

15630
04:37:33,650 --> 04:37:33,660
honestly the number one thing I kind of
 

15631
04:37:33,660 --> 04:37:35,810
honestly the number one thing I kind of
want to know is like

15632
04:37:35,810 --> 04:37:35,820
want to know is like
 

15633
04:37:35,820 --> 04:37:38,769
want to know is like
what's your propulsion system

15634
04:37:38,769 --> 04:37:38,779
what's your propulsion system
 

15635
04:37:38,779 --> 04:37:41,150
what's your propulsion system
how do we travel faster right like

15636
04:37:41,150 --> 04:37:41,160
how do we travel faster right like
 

15637
04:37:41,160 --> 04:37:43,189
how do we travel faster right like
there's a bunch of details probably but

15638
04:37:43,189 --> 04:37:43,199
there's a bunch of details probably but
 

15639
04:37:43,199 --> 04:37:45,949
there's a bunch of details probably but
first let's get together and teach me

15640
04:37:45,949 --> 04:37:45,959
first let's get together and teach me
 

15641
04:37:45,959 --> 04:37:47,810
first let's get together and teach me
how to go fast go fast I like

15642
04:37:47,810 --> 04:37:47,820
how to go fast go fast I like
 

15643
04:37:47,820 --> 04:37:49,490
how to go fast go fast I like
motorcycles I like rockets exactly what

15644
04:37:49,490 --> 04:37:49,500
motorcycles I like rockets exactly what
 

15645
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:51,949
motorcycles I like rockets exactly what
you got yeah uh yeah like how like I'll

15646
04:37:51,949 --> 04:37:51,959
you got yeah uh yeah like how like I'll
 

15647
04:37:51,959 --> 04:37:53,390
you got yeah uh yeah like how like I'll
show you mine if you show me yours kind

15648
04:37:53,390 --> 04:37:53,400
show you mine if you show me yours kind
 

15649
04:37:53,400 --> 04:37:55,150
show you mine if you show me yours kind
of thing at the at the inter

15650
04:37:55,150 --> 04:37:55,160
of thing at the at the inter
 

15651
04:37:55,160 --> 04:37:58,730
of thing at the at the inter
Interstellar Intergalactic uh level

15652
04:37:58,730 --> 04:37:58,740
Interstellar Intergalactic uh level
 

15653
04:37:58,740 --> 04:38:01,010
Interstellar Intergalactic uh level
um yeah anyway I just wonder

15654
04:38:01,010 --> 04:38:01,020
um yeah anyway I just wonder
 

15655
04:38:01,020 --> 04:38:03,410
um yeah anyway I just wonder
maybe it's a cheat code in this video

15656
04:38:03,410 --> 04:38:03,420
maybe it's a cheat code in this video
 

15657
04:38:03,420 --> 04:38:06,170
maybe it's a cheat code in this video
game we call life but I wanna I wanna

15658
04:38:06,170 --> 04:38:06,180
game we call life but I wanna I wanna
 

15659
04:38:06,180 --> 04:38:07,910
game we call life but I wanna I wanna
use the cheat code to figure out what

15660
04:38:07,910 --> 04:38:07,920
use the cheat code to figure out what
 

15661
04:38:07,920 --> 04:38:09,470
use the cheat code to figure out what
kind of propulsion systems are possible

15662
04:38:09,470 --> 04:38:09,480
kind of propulsion systems are possible
 

15663
04:38:09,480 --> 04:38:11,269
kind of propulsion systems are possible
and it feels like other alien

15664
04:38:11,269 --> 04:38:11,279
and it feels like other alien
 

15665
04:38:11,279 --> 04:38:16,189
and it feels like other alien
civilizations might help us give us

15666
04:38:16,189 --> 04:38:16,199
civilizations might help us give us
 

15667
04:38:16,199 --> 04:38:17,869
civilizations might help us give us
um

15668
04:38:17,869 --> 04:38:17,879
um
 

15669
04:38:17,879 --> 04:38:20,810
um
give us a guidance on that of course I

15670
04:38:20,810 --> 04:38:20,820
give us a guidance on that of course I
 

15671
04:38:20,820 --> 04:38:22,631
give us a guidance on that of course I
think even just

15672
04:38:22,631 --> 04:38:22,641
think even just
 

15673
04:38:22,641 --> 04:38:24,590
think even just
discovering

15674
04:38:24,590 --> 04:38:24,600
discovering
 

15675
04:38:24,600 --> 04:38:26,269

about the romantic thing is humans on
 

15685
04:38:32,879 --> 04:38:35,510
about the romantic thing is humans on
Mars but the secret thing is building

15686
04:38:35,510 --> 04:38:35,520
Mars but the secret thing is building
 

15687
04:38:35,520 --> 04:38:38,449
Mars but the secret thing is building
giant stations on Mars that allow us to

15688
04:38:38,449 --> 04:38:38,459
giant stations on Mars that allow us to
 

15689
04:38:38,459 --> 04:38:40,369
giant stations on Mars that allow us to
definitely

definitely
 

15691
04:38:40,379 --> 04:38:45,529
definitely
hopefully find the traces of life that

15692
04:38:45,529 --> 04:38:45,539
hopefully find the traces of life that
 

15693
04:38:45,539 --> 04:38:48,051
hopefully find the traces of life that
either currently doesn't live or has

15694
04:38:48,051 --> 04:38:48,061
either currently doesn't live or has
 

15695
04:38:48,061 --> 04:38:50,449
either currently doesn't live or has
once lived on Mars because if that's the

15696
04:38:50,449 --> 04:38:50,459
once lived on Mars because if that's the
 

15697
04:38:50,459 --> 04:38:52,789
once lived on Mars because if that's the
case that means for sure life is

15698
04:38:52,789 --> 04:38:52,799
case that means for sure life is
 

15699
04:38:52,799 --> 04:38:54,890
case that means for sure life is

completely to really really hardcore
 

15717
04:39:13,439 --> 04:39:15,769
completely to really really hardcore
push to Interstellar travel or

15718
04:39:15,769 --> 04:39:15,779
push to Interstellar travel or
 

15719
04:39:15,779 --> 04:39:18,230
push to Interstellar travel or
colonizing Mars becoming multiple entire

15720
04:39:18,230 --> 04:39:18,240
colonizing Mars becoming multiple entire
 

15721
04:39:18,240 --> 04:39:20,750

species it'd be truly inspiring

15722

you think that
 

15725
04:39:23,299 --> 04:39:25,670
you think that
do you do you get nervous though like

15726

do you do you get nervous though like
 

15727
04:39:25,680 --> 04:39:28,010
do you do you get nervous though like
I'm gonna I'm the interviewer now yeah

15728
04:39:28,010 --> 04:39:28,020
I'm gonna I'm the interviewer now yeah
 

15729
04:39:28,020 --> 04:39:29,929
I'm gonna I'm the interviewer now yeah
um don't you get nervous that we could

15730
04:39:29,929 --> 04:39:29,939
um don't you get nervous that we could
 

15731
04:39:29,939 --> 04:39:32,390
um don't you get nervous that we could
make spectacular discovery on Mars that

15732
04:39:32,390 --> 04:39:32,400
make spectacular discovery on Mars that
 

15733
04:39:32,400 --> 04:39:34,189
make spectacular discovery on Mars that
not only has there been life there's

15734
04:39:34,189 --> 04:39:34,199
not only has there been life there's
 

15735
04:39:34,199 --> 04:39:36,949
not only has there been life there's
actually like pretty Advanced Micro you

15736
04:39:36,949 --> 04:39:36,959
actually like pretty Advanced Micro you
 

15737
04:39:36,959 --> 04:39:40,190
actually like pretty Advanced Micro you
know or a multicellular life totally

15738
04:39:40,190 --> 04:39:40,200
know or a multicellular life totally
 

15739
04:39:40,200 --> 04:39:41,690
know or a multicellular life totally
thriving in certain regions we just

15740
04:39:41,690 --> 04:39:41,700
thriving in certain regions we just
 

15741
04:39:41,700 --> 04:39:43,070
thriving in certain regions we just
hadn't visited the man on Mars and we

15742
04:39:43,070 --> 04:39:43,080
hadn't visited the man on Mars and we
 

15743
04:39:43,080 --> 04:39:45,530
hadn't visited the man on Mars and we
make this big discovery that

15744
04:39:45,530 --> 04:39:45,540
make this big discovery that
 

15745
04:39:45,540 --> 04:39:47,810
make this big discovery that
um a relatively large percentage of

15746
04:39:47,810 --> 04:39:47,820
um a relatively large percentage of
 

15747
04:39:47,820 --> 04:39:49,430
um a relatively large percentage of
people just simply wouldn't believe it

15748
04:39:49,430 --> 04:39:49,440
people just simply wouldn't believe it
 

15749
04:39:49,440 --> 04:39:53,270
people just simply wouldn't believe it
they think it's all yeah 100 fake and

15750
04:39:53,270 --> 04:39:53,280
they think it's all yeah 100 fake and
 

15751
04:39:53,280 --> 04:39:54,350
they think it's all yeah 100 fake and
that they're just doing this to control

15752
04:39:54,350 --> 04:39:54,360
that they're just doing this to control
 

15753
04:39:54,360 --> 04:39:56,930
that they're just doing this to control
us and that blah blah blah like we could

15754
04:39:56,930 --> 04:39:56,940
us and that blah blah blah like we could
 

15755
04:39:56,940 --> 04:39:59,330
us and that blah blah blah like we could
make the most important discovery

15756
04:39:59,330 --> 04:39:59,340
make the most important discovery
 

15757
04:39:59,340 --> 04:40:02,868
make the most important discovery
in human life like in all of human

15758
04:40:02,868 --> 04:40:02,878
in human life like in all of human
 

15759
04:40:02,878 --> 04:40:05,090
in human life like in all of human
existence that that we're not alone in

15760
04:40:05,090 --> 04:40:05,100
existence that that we're not alone in
 

15761
04:40:05,100 --> 04:40:06,230
existence that that we're not alone in
this universe

15762
04:40:06,230 --> 04:40:06,240
this universe
 

15763
04:40:06,240 --> 04:40:10,190
this universe
by you know cellularly at least and a

15764
04:40:10,190 --> 04:40:10,200
by you know cellularly at least and a
 

15765
04:40:10,200 --> 04:40:11,690
by you know cellularly at least and a
good percentage of people I'm thinking

15766
04:40:11,690 --> 04:40:11,700
good percentage of people I'm thinking
 

15767
04:40:11,700 --> 04:40:15,470
good percentage of people I'm thinking
20 30 40 in today's world 40 plus

15768
04:40:15,470 --> 04:40:15,480
20 30 40 in today's world 40 plus
 

15769
04:40:15,480 --> 04:40:17,990
20 30 40 in today's world 40 plus
percent of people wouldn't even believe

15770
04:40:17,990 --> 04:40:18,000
percent of people wouldn't even believe
 

15771
04:40:18,000 --> 04:40:21,470
percent of people wouldn't even believe
it existed interesting I I I'd be it's

15772
04:40:21,470 --> 04:40:21,480
it existed interesting I I I'd be it's
 

15773
04:40:21,480 --> 04:40:23,208
it existed interesting I I I'd be it's
just a very important thing to think

15774
04:40:23,208 --> 04:40:23,218
just a very important thing to think
 

15775
04:40:23,218 --> 04:40:25,190
just a very important thing to think
about especially as an educator like

15776
04:40:25,190 --> 04:40:25,200
about especially as an educator like
 

15777
04:40:25,200 --> 04:40:26,150
about especially as an educator like
yourself

15778
04:40:26,150 --> 04:40:26,160
yourself
 

15779
04:40:26,160 --> 04:40:29,390
yourself
I think the the current cynicism towards

15780
04:40:29,390 --> 04:40:29,400
I think the the current cynicism towards
 

15781
04:40:29,400 --> 04:40:31,970
I think the the current cynicism towards
institutions and science is temporary I

15782
04:40:31,970 --> 04:40:31,980
institutions and science is temporary I
 

15783
04:40:31,980 --> 04:40:33,650
institutions and science is temporary I
think it's they're basically the

15784
04:40:33,650 --> 04:40:33,660
think it's they're basically the
 

15785
04:40:33,660 --> 04:40:35,090
think it's they're basically the
internet woke up

15786
04:40:35,090 --> 04:40:35,100
internet woke up
 

15787
04:40:35,100 --> 04:40:37,670
internet woke up
the internet smells [\h__\h] and it

15788
04:40:37,670 --> 04:40:37,680
the internet smells [\h__\h] and it
 

15789
04:40:37,680 --> 04:40:40,430
the internet smells [\h__\h] and it
looked at uh I'm sorry I'm not being

15790
04:40:40,430 --> 04:40:40,440
looked at uh I'm sorry I'm not being
 

15791
04:40:40,440 --> 04:40:42,410
looked at uh I'm sorry I'm not being
ageless but saying older scientists and

15792
04:40:42,410 --> 04:40:42,420
ageless but saying older scientists and
 

15793
04:40:42,420 --> 04:40:44,390
ageless but saying older scientists and
and they looked at them and they kind of

15794
04:40:44,390 --> 04:40:44,400
and they looked at them and they kind of
 

15795
04:40:44,400 --> 04:40:46,190
and they looked at them and they kind of
said you're kind of full of [\h__\h] you got

15796
04:40:46,190 --> 04:40:46,200
said you're kind of full of [\h__\h] you got
 

15797
04:40:46,200 --> 04:40:49,550
said you're kind of full of [\h__\h] you got
a lot of ego uh you're you speak down to

15798
04:40:49,550 --> 04:40:49,560
a lot of ego uh you're you speak down to
 

15799
04:40:49,560 --> 04:40:50,990
a lot of ego uh you're you speak down to
everybody you're not very good at

15800
04:40:50,990 --> 04:40:51,000
everybody you're not very good at
 

15801
04:40:51,000 --> 04:40:53,630
everybody you're not very good at
communicating I think there's a lot of

15802
04:40:53,630 --> 04:40:53,640
communicating I think there's a lot of
 

15803
04:40:53,640 --> 04:40:55,250
communicating I think there's a lot of
Truth to what they're saying and I think

15804
04:40:55,250 --> 04:40:55,260
Truth to what they're saying and I think
 

15805
04:40:55,260 --> 04:40:56,990
Truth to what they're saying and I think
the young scientists that are coming up

15806
04:40:56,990 --> 04:40:57,000
the young scientists that are coming up
 

15807
04:40:57,000 --> 04:40:59,030
the young scientists that are coming up
will be much better at not being full of

15808
04:40:59,030 --> 04:40:59,040
will be much better at not being full of
 

15809
04:40:59,040 --> 04:41:01,368
will be much better at not being full of
[\h__\h] being authentic being real not

15810
04:41:01,368 --> 04:41:01,378
[\h__\h] being authentic being real not
 

15811
04:41:01,378 --> 04:41:03,948
[\h__\h] being authentic being real not
treating uh people like their children

15812
04:41:03,948 --> 04:41:03,958
treating uh people like their children
 

15813
04:41:03,958 --> 04:41:05,448
treating uh people like their children
they can't possibly understand like

15814
04:41:05,448 --> 04:41:05,458
they can't possibly understand like
 

15815
04:41:05,458 --> 04:41:08,030
they can't possibly understand like
taking it very seriously that there's a

15816
04:41:08,030 --> 04:41:08,040
taking it very seriously that there's a
 

15817
04:41:08,040 --> 04:41:09,530
taking it very seriously that there's a
lot of intelligent people out there that

15818
04:41:09,530 --> 04:41:09,540
lot of intelligent people out there that
 

15819
04:41:09,540 --> 04:41:12,110
lot of intelligent people out there that
are curious that are this full desire

15820
04:41:12,110 --> 04:41:12,120
are curious that are this full desire
 

15821
04:41:12,120 --> 04:41:14,448
are curious that are this full desire
for knowledge like being transparent

15822
04:41:14,448 --> 04:41:14,458
for knowledge like being transparent
 

15823
04:41:14,458 --> 04:41:18,050
for knowledge like being transparent
about all the uncertainties uh of the

15824
04:41:18,050 --> 04:41:18,060
about all the uncertainties uh of the
 

15825
04:41:18,060 --> 04:41:20,090
about all the uncertainties uh of the
scientific process all the tensions the

15826
04:41:20,090 --> 04:41:20,100
scientific process all the tensions the
 

15827
04:41:20,100 --> 04:41:23,510
scientific process all the tensions the
conflicts all of that and I I think

15828
04:41:23,510 --> 04:41:23,520
conflicts all of that and I I think
 

15829
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:25,670
conflicts all of that and I I think
I think once we fix the community

15830
04:41:25,670 --> 04:41:25,680
I think once we fix the community
 

15831
04:41:25,680 --> 04:41:28,788
I think once we fix the community

the internet
 

15835
04:41:30,240 --> 04:41:32,690
the internet
um I think that won't be an issue I I

15836
04:41:32,690 --> 04:41:32,700
um I think that won't be an issue I I
 

15837
04:41:32,700 --> 04:41:34,610
um I think that won't be an issue I I
hope I hope I mean that's that's why

15838
04:41:34,610 --> 04:41:34,620
hope I hope I mean that's that's why
 

15839
04:41:34,620 --> 04:41:36,050
hope I hope I mean that's that's why
people like you are really important is

15840
04:41:36,050 --> 04:41:36,060
people like you are really important is
 

15841
04:41:36,060 --> 04:41:37,610
people like you are really important is
it's like uh communicate with

15842
04:41:37,610 --> 04:41:37,620
it's like uh communicate with
 

15843
04:41:37,620 --> 04:41:39,530
it's like uh communicate with
authenticity

authenticity
 

15845
04:41:39,540 --> 04:41:40,430
authenticity
um

15846
04:41:40,430 --> 04:41:40,440
um
 

15847
04:41:40,440 --> 04:41:41,930
um
but yeah that's definitely something to

15848
04:41:41,930 --> 04:41:41,940
but yeah that's definitely something to
 

15849
04:41:41,940 --> 04:41:45,288
but yeah that's definitely something to
think about I mean yes the early uh I

15850
04:41:45,288 --> 04:41:45,298
think about I mean yes the early uh I
 

15851
04:41:45,298 --> 04:41:46,910
think about I mean yes the early uh I
mean listen scientists too like the

15852
04:41:46,910 --> 04:41:46,920
mean listen scientists too like the
 

15853
04:41:46,920 --> 04:41:49,730
mean listen scientists too like the
phosphine discovered on on Venus is like

15854
04:41:49,730 --> 04:41:49,740
phosphine discovered on on Venus is like
 

15855
04:41:49,740 --> 04:41:52,910
phosphine discovered on on Venus is like
they're extremely skeptical always uh so

15856
04:41:52,910 --> 04:41:52,920
they're extremely skeptical always uh so
 

15857
04:41:52,920 --> 04:41:54,410
they're extremely skeptical always uh so
definitely there will there will be a

15858
04:41:54,410 --> 04:41:54,420
definitely there will there will be a
 

15859
04:41:54,420 --> 04:41:57,170
definitely there will there will be a
lot of skepticism uh it and it depends

15860
04:41:57,170 --> 04:41:57,180
lot of skepticism uh it and it depends
 

15861
04:41:57,180 --> 04:41:58,910
lot of skepticism uh it and it depends
what it looks like if it kind of looks

15862
04:41:58,910 --> 04:41:58,920
what it looks like if it kind of looks
 

15863
04:41:58,920 --> 04:42:00,650
what it looks like if it kind of looks
like this thing kind of looks like

15864
04:42:00,650 --> 04:42:00,660
like this thing kind of looks like
 

15865
04:42:00,660 --> 04:42:03,890
like this thing kind of looks like
bacteria back on Earth uh yes uh so it

15866
04:42:03,890 --> 04:42:03,900
bacteria back on Earth uh yes uh so it
 

15867
04:42:03,900 --> 04:42:05,570
bacteria back on Earth uh yes uh so it
means contamination is very difficult to

15868
04:42:05,570 --> 04:42:05,580
means contamination is very difficult to
 

15869
04:42:05,580 --> 04:42:08,090
means contamination is very difficult to
avoid in general but if the thing looks

15870
04:42:08,090 --> 04:42:08,100
avoid in general but if the thing looks
 

15871
04:42:08,100 --> 04:42:10,670
avoid in general but if the thing looks
like fundamentally different yeah then

15872
04:42:10,670 --> 04:42:10,680
like fundamentally different yeah then
 

15873
04:42:10,680 --> 04:42:13,128
like fundamentally different yeah then
you're like all right yeah that like

15874
04:42:13,128 --> 04:42:13,138
you're like all right yeah that like
 

15875
04:42:13,138 --> 04:42:15,770
you're like all right yeah that like
totally different DNA RNA like this is

15876
04:42:15,770 --> 04:42:15,780
totally different DNA RNA like this is
 

15877
04:42:15,780 --> 04:42:17,990
totally different DNA RNA like this is
not we would never observe this ever

15878
04:42:17,990 --> 04:42:18,000
not we would never observe this ever
 

15879
04:42:18,000 --> 04:42:20,690
not we would never observe this ever
yeah then uh then you're like all right

15880
04:42:20,690 --> 04:42:20,700
yeah then uh then you're like all right
 

15881
04:42:20,700 --> 04:42:25,250
yeah then uh then you're like all right
cool of course and uh so that another

15882
04:42:25,250 --> 04:42:25,260
cool of course and uh so that another
 

15883
04:42:25,260 --> 04:42:27,708
cool of course and uh so that another
promising thing that difficult to be

15884
04:42:27,708 --> 04:42:27,718
promising thing that difficult to be
 

15885
04:42:27,718 --> 04:42:30,110
promising thing that difficult to be
definitive about but let's get better

15886
04:42:30,110 --> 04:42:30,120
definitive about but let's get better
 

15887
04:42:30,120 --> 04:42:32,270
definitive about but let's get better
and better direct Imaging systems

15888
04:42:32,270 --> 04:42:32,280
and better direct Imaging systems
 

15889
04:42:32,280 --> 04:42:34,730
and better direct Imaging systems
there's now uh like I don't know how

15890
04:42:34,730 --> 04:42:34,740
there's now uh like I don't know how
 

15891
04:42:34,740 --> 04:42:37,910
there's now uh like I don't know how
many but thousands of planets are being

15892
04:42:37,910 --> 04:42:37,920
many but thousands of planets are being
 

15893
04:42:37,920 --> 04:42:39,650
many but thousands of planets are being
discovered outside of our solar system

15894
04:42:39,650 --> 04:42:39,660
discovered outside of our solar system
 

15895
04:42:39,660 --> 04:42:41,750
discovered outside of our solar system
there's moons being discovered now the

15896
04:42:41,750 --> 04:42:41,760
there's moons being discovered now the
 

15897
04:42:41,760 --> 04:42:43,670
there's moons being discovered now the
earth-like planets being discovered so

15898
04:42:43,670 --> 04:42:43,680
earth-like planets being discovered so
 

15899
04:42:43,680 --> 04:42:45,470
earth-like planets being discovered so
like all of that if you could do direct

15900
04:42:45,470 --> 04:42:45,480
like all of that if you could do direct
 

15901
04:42:45,480 --> 04:42:47,690
like all of that if you could do direct
Imaging of those planets more and more

15902
04:42:47,690 --> 04:42:47,700
Imaging of those planets more and more
 

15903
04:42:47,700 --> 04:42:50,868
Imaging of those planets more and more
and more uh there could be some gigantic

15904
04:42:50,868 --> 04:42:50,878
and more uh there could be some gigantic
 

15905
04:42:50,878 --> 04:42:54,230
and more uh there could be some gigantic
listen if there is like a Kardashian

15906
04:42:54,230 --> 04:42:54,240
listen if there is like a Kardashian
 

15907
04:42:54,240 --> 04:42:56,570
listen if there is like a Kardashian
like type 2 civilization we're gonna see

15908
04:42:56,570 --> 04:42:56,580
like type 2 civilization we're gonna see
 

15909
04:42:56,580 --> 04:42:58,070
like type 2 civilization we're gonna see
the damn thing it's going to be

15910
04:42:58,070 --> 04:42:58,080
the damn thing it's going to be
 

15911
04:42:58,080 --> 04:43:00,650
the damn thing it's going to be
producing a lot of uh it's going to be

15912
04:43:00,650 --> 04:43:00,660
producing a lot of uh it's going to be
 

15913
04:43:00,660 --> 04:43:03,110
producing a lot of uh it's going to be
radiating a lot of energy so the

15914
04:43:03,110 --> 04:43:03,120
radiating a lot of energy so the
 

15915
04:43:03,120 --> 04:43:04,610
radiating a lot of energy so the
possibility of detecting someone that

15916
04:43:04,610 --> 04:43:04,620
possibility of detecting someone that
 

15917
04:43:04,620 --> 04:43:07,250
possibility of detecting someone that
that's also a real possibility with

15918
04:43:07,250 --> 04:43:07,260
that's also a real possibility with
 

15919
04:43:07,260 --> 04:43:08,868
that's also a real possibility with
something like James Webb telescopes

15920
04:43:08,868 --> 04:43:08,878
something like James Webb telescopes
 

15921
04:43:08,878 --> 04:43:11,030
something like James Webb telescopes
like those kinds of efforts that starts

15922
04:43:11,030 --> 04:43:11,040
like those kinds of efforts that starts
 

15923
04:43:11,040 --> 04:43:13,430
like those kinds of efforts that starts
becoming a reality uh have you read Andy

15924
04:43:13,430 --> 04:43:13,440
becoming a reality uh have you read Andy
 

15925
04:43:13,440 --> 04:43:15,590
becoming a reality uh have you read Andy
Weir's project Hail Mary I have not no

15926
04:43:15,590 --> 04:43:15,600
Weir's project Hail Mary I have not no
 

15927
04:43:15,600 --> 04:43:19,070
Weir's project Hail Mary I have not no
you're going to love it like it is

15928
04:43:19,070 --> 04:43:19,080
you're going to love it like it is
 

15929
04:43:19,080 --> 04:43:21,230
you're going to love it like it is
basically uh

15930
04:43:21,230 --> 04:43:21,240
basically uh
 

15931
04:43:21,240 --> 04:43:23,690
basically uh
almost answering that like how could

15932
04:43:23,690 --> 04:43:23,700
almost answering that like how could
 

15933
04:43:23,700 --> 04:43:25,368
almost answering that like how could
they not see us type of thing almost

15934
04:43:25,368 --> 04:43:25,378
they not see us type of thing almost
 

15935
04:43:25,378 --> 04:43:28,310
they not see us type of thing almost
where he creates this this incredible I

15936
04:43:28,310 --> 04:43:28,320
where he creates this this incredible I

don't want to spoil anything but you

15938
04:43:30,050 --> 04:43:30,060
don't want to spoil anything but you
 

15939
04:43:30,060 --> 04:43:33,770
don't want to spoil anything but you
know um it's just the sense of like

15940
04:43:33,770 --> 04:43:33,780
know um it's just the sense of like
 

15941
04:43:33,780 --> 04:43:34,970
know um it's just the sense of like
we could have totally different

15942
04:43:34,970 --> 04:43:34,980
we could have totally different
 

15943
04:43:34,980 --> 04:43:37,430
we could have totally different
perspectives with with an alien race and

15944
04:43:37,430 --> 04:43:37,440
perspectives with with an alien race and
 

15945
04:43:37,440 --> 04:43:40,010
perspectives with with an alien race and
not even like consider that you know the

15946
04:43:40,010 --> 04:43:40,020
not even like consider that you know the
 

15947
04:43:40,020 --> 04:43:42,530
not even like consider that you know the
two of us are coexisting almost yeah I

15948
04:43:42,530 --> 04:43:42,540
two of us are coexisting almost yeah I
 

15949
04:43:42,540 --> 04:43:43,368
two of us are coexisting almost yeah I
don't want to spoil anything because

15950
04:43:43,368 --> 04:43:43,378
don't want to spoil anything because
 

15951
04:43:43,378 --> 04:43:45,530
don't want to spoil anything because
it's really really really worth the read

15952
04:43:45,530 --> 04:43:45,540
it's really really really worth the read
 

15953
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:46,970
it's really really really worth the read
or Oh you mean a different perspective

15954
04:43:46,970 --> 04:43:46,980
or Oh you mean a different perspective
 

15955
04:43:46,980 --> 04:43:48,170
or Oh you mean a different perspective
like the aliens have a different

15956
04:43:48,170 --> 04:43:48,180
like the aliens have a different
 

15957
04:43:48,180 --> 04:43:50,570
like the aliens have a different
perspective than humans yeah like but we

15958
04:43:50,570 --> 04:43:50,580
perspective than humans yeah like but we
 

15959
04:43:50,580 --> 04:43:52,670
perspective than humans yeah like but we
just like we see with this visual light

15960
04:43:52,670 --> 04:43:52,680
just like we see with this visual light
 

15961
04:43:52,680 --> 04:43:54,830
just like we see with this visual light
yeah someone could see in x-ray et

15962
04:43:54,830 --> 04:43:54,840
yeah someone could see in x-ray et
 

15963
04:43:54,840 --> 04:43:56,868
yeah someone could see in x-ray et
cetera you know like and just the way we

15964
04:43:56,868 --> 04:43:56,878
cetera you know like and just the way we
 

15965
04:43:56,878 --> 04:44:00,170
cetera you know like and just the way we
even come to the same perspective like

15966
04:44:00,170 --> 04:44:00,180
even come to the same perspective like
 

15967
04:44:00,180 --> 04:44:01,970
even come to the same perspective like
looking and observing is just so

15968
04:44:01,970 --> 04:44:01,980
looking and observing is just so
 

15969
04:44:01,980 --> 04:44:03,530
looking and observing is just so
different fundamentally

15970
04:44:03,530 --> 04:44:03,540
different fundamentally
 

15971
04:44:03,540 --> 04:44:05,810
different fundamentally
that like we could I mean it's not quite

15972
04:44:05,810 --> 04:44:05,820
that like we could I mean it's not quite
 

15973
04:44:05,820 --> 04:44:07,310
that like we could I mean it's not quite
like that it's not like it's like oh

15974
04:44:07,310 --> 04:44:07,320
like that it's not like it's like oh
 

15975
04:44:07,320 --> 04:44:08,628
like that it's not like it's like oh
they were actually on the moon and we're

15976
04:44:08,628 --> 04:44:08,638
they were actually on the moon and we're
 

15977
04:44:08,638 --> 04:44:11,030
they were actually on the moon and we're
you know it's nothing like that but uh

15978
04:44:11,030 --> 04:44:11,040
you know it's nothing like that but uh
 

15979
04:44:11,040 --> 04:44:13,730
you know it's nothing like that but uh
but it's such a unique and incredible

15980
04:44:13,730 --> 04:44:13,740
but it's such a unique and incredible
 

15981
04:44:13,740 --> 04:44:15,288
but it's such a unique and incredible
story I think Andy Weir is one of the

15982
04:44:15,288 --> 04:44:15,298
story I think Andy Weir is one of the
 

15983
04:44:15,298 --> 04:44:17,868
story I think Andy Weir is one of the
the best science fiction writers I don't

15984
04:44:17,868 --> 04:44:17,878
the best science fiction writers I don't
 

15985
04:44:17,878 --> 04:44:19,310
the best science fiction writers I don't
I can't say that with much Authority

15986
04:44:19,310 --> 04:44:19,320
I can't say that with much Authority
 

15987
04:44:19,320 --> 04:44:20,750
I can't say that with much Authority
because I don't listen to much science

15988
04:44:20,750 --> 04:44:20,760
because I don't listen to much science
 

15989
04:44:20,760 --> 04:44:21,590
because I don't listen to much science
fiction

15990
04:44:21,590 --> 04:44:21,600
fiction
 

15991
04:44:21,600 --> 04:44:24,230

so zero 30. I really like Andy Weir's
 

15993
04:44:24,240 --> 04:44:25,730
so zero 30. I really like Andy Weir's
books and that book is no different but

15994
04:44:25,730 --> 04:44:25,740
books and that book is no different but
 

15995
04:44:25,740 --> 04:44:26,990
books and that book is no different but
that sounds like I'm really worried

that sounds like I'm really worried
 

15997
04:44:27,000 --> 04:44:29,390
that sounds like I'm really worried
about this I was like uh I would really

uh on a normal day especially now

16034
04:45:07,010 --> 04:45:07,020
uh on a normal day especially now
 

16035
04:45:07,020 --> 04:45:08,690
uh on a normal day especially now
because I've been really focused on on

16036
04:45:08,690 --> 04:45:08,700
because I've been really focused on on
 

16037
04:45:08,700 --> 04:45:13,310
because I've been really focused on on
reading it's about 60 Minutes of

16038
04:45:13,310 --> 04:45:13,320
reading it's about 60 Minutes of
 

16039
04:45:13,320 --> 04:45:16,910
reading it's about 60 Minutes of
reading on a Kindle and I wanted two

16040
04:45:16,910 --> 04:45:16,920
reading on a Kindle and I wanted two
 

16041
04:45:16,920 --> 04:45:19,390
reading on a Kindle and I wanted two
hours uh because I run about two hours

16042
04:45:19,390 --> 04:45:19,400
hours uh because I run about two hours
 

16043
04:45:19,400 --> 04:45:22,070
hours uh because I run about two hours
when I don't have like other stuff like

04:45:22,070 --> 04:45:22,080
when I don't have like other stuff like
 

16045
04:45:22,080 --> 04:45:24,410
when I don't have like other stuff like
today I won't run uh so it's about three

16046
04:45:24,410 --> 04:45:24,420
today I won't run uh so it's about three
 

16047
04:45:24,420 --> 04:45:26,090
today I won't run uh so it's about three
hours so on average I would say it's

16048
04:45:26,090 --> 04:45:26,100
hours so on average I would say it's
 

16049
04:45:26,100 --> 04:45:28,070
hours so on average I would say it's
like two two and a half hours a day and

about radiation on Mars
 

16121
04:46:41,520 --> 04:46:45,650
about radiation on Mars
uh and out in Space over periods of uh

16122

uh and out in Space over periods of uh
 

16123
04:46:45,660 --> 04:46:47,150
uh and out in Space over periods of uh
actually the effects on the human body

actually the effects on the human body
 

16125
04:46:47,160 --> 04:46:49,788
actually the effects on the human body
forget even the radiation over periods

forget even the radiation over periods
 

16127
04:46:49,798 --> 04:46:53,270
forget even the radiation over periods
of months and years yeah

16128
04:46:53,270 --> 04:46:53,280
of months and years yeah
 

16129

16131
04:46:55,680 --> 04:46:59,448
I think realistically we have a really
good handle on what the effects are

16132
04:46:59,448 --> 04:46:59,458
good handle on what the effects are
 

16133
04:46:59,458 --> 04:47:01,490
good handle on what the effects are
and we actually have the solution to

16134
04:47:01,490 --> 04:47:01,500
and we actually have the solution to
 

16135
04:47:01,500 --> 04:47:04,390
and we actually have the solution to
like everything it's just whether or not

16136
04:47:04,390 --> 04:47:04,400
like everything it's just whether or not
 

16137
04:47:04,400 --> 04:47:07,010
like everything it's just whether or not
we can like you know for instance one of

16138
04:47:07,010 --> 04:47:07,020
we can like you know for instance one of
 

16139
04:47:07,020 --> 04:47:08,750
we can like you know for instance one of
the you know in low earth orbit one of

16140
04:47:08,750 --> 04:47:08,760
the you know in low earth orbit one of
 

16141
04:47:08,760 --> 04:47:10,490
the you know in low earth orbit one of
the biggest challenges eventually after

16142
04:47:10,490 --> 04:47:10,500
the biggest challenges eventually after
 

16143
04:47:10,500 --> 04:47:13,070
the biggest challenges eventually after
your long-term space travel is bone

16144
04:47:13,070 --> 04:47:13,080
your long-term space travel is bone
 

16145
04:47:13,080 --> 04:47:15,410
your long-term space travel is bone
density loss and not having gravity you

16146
04:47:15,410 --> 04:47:15,420
density loss and not having gravity you
 

16147
04:47:15,420 --> 04:47:17,510
density loss and not having gravity you
know you actually have issues with a

16148
04:47:17,510 --> 04:47:17,520
know you actually have issues with a
 

16149
04:47:17,520 --> 04:47:19,788
know you actually have issues with a
handful of things and artificial gravity

16150
04:47:19,788 --> 04:47:19,798
handful of things and artificial gravity
 

16151
04:47:19,798 --> 04:47:23,628
handful of things and artificial gravity
is easy in terms of relatively easy in

16152
04:47:23,628 --> 04:47:23,638
is easy in terms of relatively easy in
 

16153
04:47:23,638 --> 04:47:25,190
is easy in terms of relatively easy in
terms of uh space flight you know you

16154
04:47:25,190 --> 04:47:25,200
terms of uh space flight you know you
 

16155
04:47:25,200 --> 04:47:27,288
terms of uh space flight you know you
can you have two vehicles just tethered

16156
04:47:27,288 --> 04:47:27,298
can you have two vehicles just tethered
 

16157
04:47:27,298 --> 04:47:30,650
can you have two vehicles just tethered
together and you know just spinning uh

16158
04:47:30,650 --> 04:47:30,660
together and you know just spinning uh
 

16159
04:47:30,660 --> 04:47:32,390
together and you know just spinning uh
give it enough distance and a decent

16160
04:47:32,390 --> 04:47:32,400
give it enough distance and a decent
 

16161
04:47:32,400 --> 04:47:34,910
give it enough distance and a decent
enough spin velocity and you can you can

16162
04:47:34,910 --> 04:47:34,920
enough spin velocity and you can you can
 

16163
04:47:34,920 --> 04:47:37,670
enough spin velocity and you can you can
get one gene like relatively easy we're

16164
04:47:37,670 --> 04:47:37,680
get one gene like relatively easy we're
 

16165
04:47:37,680 --> 04:47:39,410
get one gene like relatively easy we're
talking again relatively easy especially

16166
04:47:39,410 --> 04:47:39,420
talking again relatively easy especially
 

16167
04:47:39,420 --> 04:47:40,610
talking again relatively easy especially
after talking about theoretical physics

16168
04:47:40,610 --> 04:47:40,620
after talking about theoretical physics
 

16169
04:47:40,620 --> 04:47:42,890
after talking about theoretical physics
like this is that's easy stuff

16170
04:47:42,890 --> 04:47:42,900
like this is that's easy stuff
 

16171
04:47:42,900 --> 04:47:45,110
like this is that's easy stuff
um we haven't done that yet but like

16172
04:47:45,110 --> 04:47:45,120
um we haven't done that yet but like
 

16173
04:47:45,120 --> 04:47:47,390
um we haven't done that yet but like
there's there's no reason why we can't

16174
04:47:47,390 --> 04:47:47,400
there's there's no reason why we can't
 

16175
04:47:47,400 --> 04:47:49,310
there's there's no reason why we can't
produce artificial gravity if we say

16176
04:47:49,310 --> 04:47:49,320
produce artificial gravity if we say
 

16177
04:47:49,320 --> 04:47:50,750
produce artificial gravity if we say
that that's

16178
04:47:50,750 --> 04:47:50,760
that that's
 

16179
04:47:50,760 --> 04:47:52,610
that that's
um you know a big enough hurdle that we

16180
04:47:52,610 --> 04:47:52,620
um you know a big enough hurdle that we
 

16181
04:47:52,620 --> 04:47:54,410
um you know a big enough hurdle that we
absolutely have to overcome this okay

16182
04:47:54,410 --> 04:47:54,420
absolutely have to overcome this okay
 

16183
04:47:54,420 --> 04:47:56,570
absolutely have to overcome this okay
cool we'll just spin up two vehicles

16184
04:47:56,570 --> 04:47:56,580
cool we'll just spin up two vehicles
 

16185
04:47:56,580 --> 04:47:58,610
cool we'll just spin up two vehicles
that are going to Mars and people will

16186
04:47:58,610 --> 04:47:58,620
that are going to Mars and people will
 

16187
04:47:58,620 --> 04:47:59,868
that are going to Mars and people will
have but you know that's the thing is

16188
04:47:59,868 --> 04:47:59,878
have but you know that's the thing is
 

16189
04:47:59,878 --> 04:48:02,030
have but you know that's the thing is
Mars is only about we'll say six months

16190
04:48:02,030 --> 04:48:02,040
Mars is only about we'll say six months
 

16191
04:48:02,040 --> 04:48:04,550
Mars is only about we'll say six months
there then you're hanging out on Mars

16192
04:48:04,550 --> 04:48:04,560
there then you're hanging out on Mars
 

16193
04:48:04,560 --> 04:48:06,650
there then you're hanging out on Mars
you have 38 of gravity and then six

16194
04:48:06,650 --> 04:48:06,660
you have 38 of gravity and then six
 

16195
04:48:06,660 --> 04:48:09,770
you have 38 of gravity and then six
months ish back people live on you know

16196
04:48:09,770 --> 04:48:09,780
months ish back people live on you know
 

16197
04:48:09,780 --> 04:48:11,090
months ish back people live on you know
the International Space Station at six

16198
04:48:11,090 --> 04:48:11,100
the International Space Station at six
 

16199
04:48:11,100 --> 04:48:12,650
the International Space Station at six
month stints we've had people for

16200
04:48:12,650 --> 04:48:12,660
month stints we've had people for
 

16201
04:48:12,660 --> 04:48:13,910
month stints we've had people for
basically a year up on the International

16202
04:48:13,910 --> 04:48:13,920
basically a year up on the International
 

16203
04:48:13,920 --> 04:48:16,368
basically a year up on the International
Space Station it's not like it's it's

16204
04:48:16,368 --> 04:48:16,378
Space Station it's not like it's it's
 

16205
04:48:16,378 --> 04:48:18,410
Space Station it's not like it's it's
not life-altering yeah you have a couple

16206
04:48:18,410 --> 04:48:18,420
not life-altering yeah you have a couple
 

16207
04:48:18,420 --> 04:48:20,810
not life-altering yeah you have a couple
days of not being able to walk very well

16208
04:48:20,810 --> 04:48:20,820
days of not being able to walk very well
 

16209
04:48:20,820 --> 04:48:22,730
days of not being able to walk very well
and you do have some bone density loss

16210
04:48:22,730 --> 04:48:22,740
and you do have some bone density loss
 

16211
04:48:22,740 --> 04:48:24,830
and you do have some bone density loss
and some other concerns but like again

16212
04:48:24,830 --> 04:48:24,840
and some other concerns but like again
 

16213
04:48:24,840 --> 04:48:25,970
and some other concerns but like again
that's

16214
04:48:25,970 --> 04:48:25,980
that's
 

16215
04:48:25,980 --> 04:48:28,310
that's
it's solvable and I think you know the

16216
04:48:28,310 --> 04:48:28,320
it's solvable and I think you know the
 

16217
04:48:28,320 --> 04:48:29,868
it's solvable and I think you know the
first mission is to Mars

16218
04:48:29,868 --> 04:48:29,878
first mission is to Mars
 

16219
04:48:29,878 --> 04:48:33,110
first mission is to Mars
I think it might we might we'll probably

16220
04:48:33,110 --> 04:48:33,120
I think it might we might we'll probably
 

16221
04:48:33,120 --> 04:48:35,030
I think it might we might we'll probably
do the trade is it worth it to like land

16222
04:48:35,030 --> 04:48:35,040
do the trade is it worth it to like land
 

16223
04:48:35,040 --> 04:48:37,128
do the trade is it worth it to like land
on Mars and have a crippled crew that

16224
04:48:37,128 --> 04:48:37,138
on Mars and have a crippled crew that
 

16225
04:48:37,138 --> 04:48:39,530
on Mars and have a crippled crew that
can't even physically stand yet you know

16226
04:48:39,530 --> 04:48:39,540
can't even physically stand yet you know
 

16227
04:48:39,540 --> 04:48:42,110
can't even physically stand yet you know
for a day or two before they get their

16228
04:48:42,110 --> 04:48:42,120
for a day or two before they get their
 

16229
04:48:42,120 --> 04:48:43,910
for a day or two before they get their
you know feet from underneath them or is

16230
04:48:43,910 --> 04:48:43,920
you know feet from underneath them or is
 

16231
04:48:43,920 --> 04:48:46,010
you know feet from underneath them or is
it do we need to spin up

16232
04:48:46,010 --> 04:48:46,020
it do we need to spin up
 

16233
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:48,350
it do we need to spin up
two Space Crafter you know a tether and

16234
04:48:48,350 --> 04:48:48,360
two Space Crafter you know a tether and
 

16235
04:48:48,360 --> 04:48:50,270
two Space Crafter you know a tether and
have like you can't do it like Starship

16236
04:48:50,270 --> 04:48:50,280
have like you can't do it like Starship
 

16237
04:48:50,280 --> 04:48:51,650
have like you can't do it like Starship
you know even though it's 30 feet wide

16238
04:48:51,650 --> 04:48:51,660
you know even though it's 30 feet wide
 

16239
04:48:51,660 --> 04:48:53,750
you know even though it's 30 feet wide
or nine meters wide if you spin it on

16240
04:48:53,750 --> 04:48:53,760
or nine meters wide if you spin it on
 

16241
04:48:53,760 --> 04:48:55,368
or nine meters wide if you spin it on
that one axis

16242
04:48:55,368 --> 04:48:55,378
that one axis
 

16243
04:48:55,378 --> 04:48:59,150
that one axis
um that's not enough space to get 1G uh

16244
04:48:59,150 --> 04:48:59,160
um that's not enough space to get 1G uh
 

16245
04:48:59,160 --> 04:49:00,590
um that's not enough space to get 1G uh
without your feet and your head being at

16246
04:49:00,590 --> 04:49:00,600
without your feet and your head being at
 

16247
04:49:00,600 --> 04:49:02,868
without your feet and your head being at
two different uh velocities so you get

16248
04:49:02,868 --> 04:49:02,878
two different uh velocities so you get
 

16249
04:49:02,878 --> 04:49:04,550
two different uh velocities so you get
really sick at all you always feel like

16250
04:49:04,550 --> 04:49:04,560
really sick at all you always feel like
 

16251
04:49:04,560 --> 04:49:06,170
really sick at all you always feel like
you're falling your brain will tell you

16252
04:49:06,170 --> 04:49:06,180
you're falling your brain will tell you
 

16253
04:49:06,180 --> 04:49:08,208
you're falling your brain will tell you
that you're falling constantly

16254
04:49:08,208 --> 04:49:08,218
that you're falling constantly
 

16255
04:49:08,218 --> 04:49:10,010
that you're falling constantly
um but then again okay so this is this

16256
04:49:10,010 --> 04:49:10,020
um but then again okay so this is this
 

16257
04:49:10,020 --> 04:49:11,330
um but then again okay so this is this
is the whole thing is

16258
04:49:11,330 --> 04:49:11,340
is the whole thing is
 

16259
04:49:11,340 --> 04:49:13,070
is the whole thing is
I you know and I don't know if there's

16260
04:49:13,070 --> 04:49:13,080
I you know and I don't know if there's
 

16261
04:49:13,080 --> 04:49:14,930
I you know and I don't know if there's
we don't really have the data yet on

16262
04:49:14,930 --> 04:49:14,940
we don't really have the data yet on
 

16263
04:49:14,940 --> 04:49:16,910
we don't really have the data yet on
like going from zero g we know the

16264
04:49:16,910 --> 04:49:16,920
like going from zero g we know the
 

16265
04:49:16,920 --> 04:49:18,650
like going from zero g we know the
effects of that we know the effects of

16266
04:49:18,650 --> 04:49:18,660
effects of that we know the effects of
 

16267
04:49:18,660 --> 04:49:21,110
effects of that we know the effects of
1G really well that's our majority of

16268
04:49:21,110 --> 04:49:21,120
1G really well that's our majority of
 

16269
04:49:21,120 --> 04:49:22,910
1G really well that's our majority of
our data set but we don't really have

16270
04:49:22,910 --> 04:49:22,920
our data set but we don't really have
 

16271
04:49:22,920 --> 04:49:25,550
our data set but we don't really have
much data on the long-term effects of

16272
04:49:25,550 --> 04:49:25,560
much data on the long-term effects of
 

16273
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:27,890
much data on the long-term effects of
uh you know 1 6 gravity like on the moon

16274
04:49:27,890 --> 04:49:27,900
uh you know 1 6 gravity like on the moon
 

16275
04:49:27,900 --> 04:49:31,368
uh you know 1 6 gravity like on the moon
or 38 gravity is it is 1 6 gravity

16276
04:49:31,368 --> 04:49:31,378
or 38 gravity is it is 1 6 gravity
 

16277
04:49:31,378 --> 04:49:34,430
or 38 gravity is it is 1 6 gravity
actually enough to counteract 95 of the

16278
04:49:34,430 --> 04:49:34,440
actually enough to counteract 95 of the
 

16279
04:49:34,440 --> 04:49:37,430
actually enough to counteract 95 of the
effects of low gravity or is it 15 for

16280
04:49:37,430 --> 04:49:37,440
effects of low gravity or is it 15 for
 

16281
04:49:37,440 --> 04:49:39,230
effects of low gravity or is it 15 for
you know is it 1 6 the is it like a

16282
04:49:39,230 --> 04:49:39,240
you know is it 1 6 the is it like a
 

16283
04:49:39,240 --> 04:49:42,948
you know is it 1 6 the is it like a
linear thing is 38 gravity totally you

16284
04:49:42,948 --> 04:49:42,958
linear thing is 38 gravity totally you
 

16285
04:49:42,958 --> 04:49:45,470
linear thing is 38 gravity totally you
know 38 as bad as one or whatever you

16286
04:49:45,470 --> 04:49:45,480
know 38 as bad as one or whatever you
 

16287
04:49:45,480 --> 04:49:47,270
know 38 as bad as one or whatever you
know is it a slight like where is it out

16288
04:49:47,270 --> 04:49:47,280
know is it a slight like where is it out
 

16289
04:49:47,280 --> 04:49:49,490
know is it a slight like where is it out
on the scale so there's a chance that we

16290
04:49:49,490 --> 04:49:49,500
on the scale so there's a chance that we
 

16291
04:49:49,500 --> 04:49:51,410
on the scale so there's a chance that we
don't need anywhere near one g of

16292
04:49:51,410 --> 04:49:51,420
don't need anywhere near one g of
 

16293
04:49:51,420 --> 04:49:53,510
don't need anywhere near one g of
gravity to counteract the bulk majority

16294
04:49:53,510 --> 04:49:53,520
gravity to counteract the bulk majority
 

16295
04:49:53,520 --> 04:49:55,250
gravity to counteract the bulk majority
of these problems we could have

16296
04:49:55,250 --> 04:49:55,260
of these problems we could have
 

16297
04:49:55,260 --> 04:49:57,650
of these problems we could have
0.1 G or whatever is the you know the

16298
04:49:57,650 --> 04:49:57,660
0.1 G or whatever is the you know the
 

16299
04:49:57,660 --> 04:50:00,590
0.1 G or whatever is the you know the
right compromise of of vehicle

16300
04:50:00,590 --> 04:50:00,600
right compromise of of vehicle
 

16301
04:50:00,600 --> 04:50:04,670
right compromise of of vehicle
complexity and human biology and all of

16302
04:50:04,670 --> 04:50:04,680
complexity and human biology and all of
 

16303
04:50:04,680 --> 04:50:06,350
complexity and human biology and all of
these other effects like we this is

16304
04:50:06,350 --> 04:50:06,360
these other effects like we this is
 

16305
04:50:06,360 --> 04:50:08,330
these other effects like we this is
absolutely a solvable thing that is and

16306
04:50:08,330 --> 04:50:08,340
absolutely a solvable thing that is and
 

16307
04:50:08,340 --> 04:50:10,490
absolutely a solvable thing that is and
and all we figure some of this out

16308
04:50:10,490 --> 04:50:10,500
and all we figure some of this out
 

16309
04:50:10,500 --> 04:50:12,708
and all we figure some of this out
through just experimentation 100 along

16310
04:50:12,708 --> 04:50:12,718
through just experimentation 100 along
 

16311
04:50:12,718 --> 04:50:15,110
through just experimentation 100 along
the way yep uh one of this is back to my

16312
04:50:15,110 --> 04:50:15,120
the way yep uh one of this is back to my
 

16313
04:50:15,120 --> 04:50:16,910
the way yep uh one of this is back to my
dating life I think one of the essential

16314
04:50:16,910 --> 04:50:16,920
dating life I think one of the essential
 

16315
04:50:16,920 --> 04:50:19,070
dating life I think one of the essential
fundamental research questions I'm

16316
04:50:19,070 --> 04:50:19,080
fundamental research questions I'm
 

16317
04:50:19,080 --> 04:50:24,110
fundamental research questions I'm
wondering about is uh the Dynamics and

16318
04:50:24,110 --> 04:50:24,120
wondering about is uh the Dynamics and
 

16319
04:50:24,120 --> 04:50:24,948
wondering about is uh the Dynamics and
um

16320
04:50:24,948 --> 04:50:24,958
um
 

16321
04:50:24,958 --> 04:50:27,350
um
so the details of how you have sex in

16322
04:50:27,350 --> 04:50:27,360
so the details of how you have sex in
 

16323
04:50:27,360 --> 04:50:29,090
so the details of how you have sex in
space

16324
04:50:29,090 --> 04:50:29,100
space
 

16325
04:50:29,100 --> 04:50:31,250
space
um asking for a friend of course I mean

16326
04:50:31,250 --> 04:50:31,260
um asking for a friend of course I mean
 

16327
04:50:31,260 --> 04:50:33,110
um asking for a friend of course I mean
that's there literally is sort of work

16328
04:50:33,110 --> 04:50:33,120
that's there literally is sort of work
 

16329
04:50:33,120 --> 04:50:34,970
that's there literally is sort of work
on this right because like if you think

16330
04:50:34,970 --> 04:50:34,980
on this right because like if you think
 

16331
04:50:34,980 --> 04:50:36,948
on this right because like if you think
about long-term space travel

16332
04:50:36,948 --> 04:50:36,958
about long-term space travel
 

16333
04:50:36,958 --> 04:50:38,690
about long-term space travel
I mean

16334
04:50:38,690 --> 04:50:38,700
I mean
 

16335
04:50:38,700 --> 04:50:41,330
I mean
sex is is uh

16336
04:50:41,330 --> 04:50:41,340
sex is is uh
 

16337
04:50:41,340 --> 04:50:42,650
sex is is uh
sort of like the there's the

16338
04:50:42,650 --> 04:50:42,660
sort of like the there's the
 

16339
04:50:42,660 --> 04:50:44,570
sort of like the there's the
recreational aspect of sex but the most

16340
04:50:44,570 --> 04:50:44,580
recreational aspect of sex but the most
 

16341
04:50:44,580 --> 04:50:46,910
recreational aspect of sex but the most
important aspect of sex for long-term

16342
04:50:46,910 --> 04:50:46,920
important aspect of sex for long-term
 

16343
04:50:46,920 --> 04:50:48,170
important aspect of sex for long-term
space travel is

16344
04:50:48,170 --> 04:50:48,180
space travel is
 

16345
04:50:48,180 --> 04:50:48,830
space travel is
um

16346
04:50:48,830 --> 04:50:48,840
um
 

16347
04:50:48,840 --> 04:50:50,890
um
uh procreations

16348
04:50:50,890 --> 04:50:50,900
uh procreations
 

16349
04:50:50,900 --> 04:50:54,110
uh procreations
and also the full biological cycle of

16350
04:50:54,110 --> 04:50:54,120
and also the full biological cycle of
 

16351
04:50:54,120 --> 04:50:55,610
and also the full biological cycle of
that so that from the embryo the

16352
04:50:55,610 --> 04:50:55,620
that so that from the embryo the
 

16353
04:50:55,620 --> 04:50:57,350
that so that from the embryo the
development of the baby the giving the

16354
04:50:57,350 --> 04:50:57,360
development of the baby the giving the
 

16355
04:50:57,360 --> 04:51:00,288
development of the baby the giving the
birth and all that kind of stuff so like

16356
04:51:00,288 --> 04:51:00,298
birth and all that kind of stuff so like
 

16357
04:51:00,298 --> 04:51:02,090
birth and all that kind of stuff so like
you know there's a lot of really

16358
04:51:02,090 --> 04:51:02,100
you know there's a lot of really
 

16359
04:51:02,100 --> 04:51:03,910
you know there's a lot of really
difficult

16360
04:51:03,910 --> 04:51:03,920
difficult
 

16361
04:51:03,920 --> 04:51:06,430
difficult
problems of biology there to understand

16362
04:51:06,430 --> 04:51:06,440
problems of biology there to understand
 

16363
04:51:06,440 --> 04:51:09,110
problems of biology there to understand
and uh but perhaps it's all some of that

16364
04:51:09,110 --> 04:51:09,120
and uh but perhaps it's all some of that
 

16365
04:51:09,120 --> 04:51:10,550
and uh but perhaps it's all some of that
again just like you said brilliantly

16366
04:51:10,550 --> 04:51:10,560
again just like you said brilliantly
 

16367
04:51:10,560 --> 04:51:13,010
again just like you said brilliantly
some of that can be just solved with

16368
04:51:13,010 --> 04:51:13,020
some of that can be just solved with
 

16369
04:51:13,020 --> 04:51:14,868
some of that can be just solved with
engineering outside of the human body by

16370
04:51:14,868 --> 04:51:14,878
engineering outside of the human body by
 

16371
04:51:14,878 --> 04:51:18,050
engineering outside of the human body by
creating a gravitational field like that

16372
04:51:18,050 --> 04:51:18,060
creating a gravitational field like that
 

16373
04:51:18,060 --> 04:51:20,030
creating a gravitational field like that
but maybe along the way you can figure

16374
04:51:20,030 --> 04:51:20,040
but maybe along the way you can figure
 

16375
04:51:20,040 --> 04:51:22,070
but maybe along the way you can figure
out how to do that without doing it but

16376
04:51:22,070 --> 04:51:22,080
out how to do that without doing it but
 

16377
04:51:22,080 --> 04:51:23,810
out how to do that without doing it but
we're balancing the cost and so on and

16378
04:51:23,810 --> 04:51:23,820
we're balancing the cost and so on and
 

16379
04:51:23,820 --> 04:51:26,810
we're balancing the cost and so on and
radiation is the other thing we know we

16380
04:51:26,810 --> 04:51:26,820
radiation is the other thing we know we
 

16381
04:51:26,820 --> 04:51:29,208
radiation is the other thing we know we
have a really good data set on what

16382
04:51:29,208 --> 04:51:29,218
have a really good data set on what
 

16383
04:51:29,218 --> 04:51:31,490
have a really good data set on what
radiation and doses do to humans like we

16384
04:51:31,490 --> 04:51:31,500
radiation and doses do to humans like we
 

16385
04:51:31,500 --> 04:51:33,830
radiation and doses do to humans like we
we know we can measure radiation we know

16386
04:51:33,830 --> 04:51:33,840
we know we can measure radiation we know
 

16387
04:51:33,840 --> 04:51:35,990
we know we can measure radiation we know
we can approximate you know and kind of

16388
04:51:35,990 --> 04:51:36,000
we can approximate you know and kind of
 

16389
04:51:36,000 --> 04:51:38,208
we can approximate you know and kind of
give edge cases for the Mars transient

16390
04:51:38,208 --> 04:51:38,218
give edge cases for the Mars transient
 

16391
04:51:38,218 --> 04:51:39,770
give edge cases for the Mars transient
and getting to Mars and being on Mars

16392
04:51:39,770 --> 04:51:39,780
and getting to Mars and being on Mars
 

16393
04:51:39,780 --> 04:51:42,770
and getting to Mars and being on Mars
and the simple answer to that is like at

16394
04:51:42,770 --> 04:51:42,780
and the simple answer to that is like at
 

16395
04:51:42,780 --> 04:51:44,868
and the simple answer to that is like at
the end of the day if we have to you

16396
04:51:44,868 --> 04:51:44,878
the end of the day if we have to you
 

16397
04:51:44,878 --> 04:51:47,208
the end of the day if we have to you
know dig into Mars or find a tunnel to

16398
04:51:47,208 --> 04:51:47,218
know dig into Mars or find a tunnel to
 

16399
04:51:47,218 --> 04:51:49,730
know dig into Mars or find a tunnel to
to live in so you get some extra mass in

16400
04:51:49,730 --> 04:51:49,740
to live in so you get some extra mass in
 

16401
04:51:49,740 --> 04:51:52,128
to live in so you get some extra mass in
between you and Cosmic radiation so be

16402
04:51:52,128 --> 04:51:52,138
between you and Cosmic radiation so be
 

16403
04:51:52,138 --> 04:51:53,390
between you and Cosmic radiation so be
it like that's the that's the answer

16404
04:51:53,390 --> 04:51:53,400
it like that's the that's the answer
 

16405
04:51:53,400 --> 04:51:55,030
it like that's the that's the answer
then again none of these are like

16406
04:51:55,030 --> 04:51:55,040
then again none of these are like
 

16407
04:51:55,040 --> 04:51:57,590
then again none of these are like
insolvable problems they're just things

16408
04:51:57,590 --> 04:51:57,600
insolvable problems they're just things
 

16409
04:51:57,600 --> 04:51:59,270
insolvable problems they're just things
the hurdles you would have to overcome

16410
04:51:59,270 --> 04:51:59,280
the hurdles you would have to overcome
 

16411
04:51:59,280 --> 04:52:00,530
the hurdles you would have to overcome
based on

16412
04:52:00,530 --> 04:52:00,540
based on
 

16413
04:52:00,540 --> 04:52:02,810
based on
you know the the risk exposure and the

16414
04:52:02,810 --> 04:52:02,820
you know the the risk exposure and the
 

16415
04:52:02,820 --> 04:52:05,628
you know the the risk exposure and the
posture there imagine being

16416
04:52:05,628 --> 04:52:05,638
posture there imagine being
 

16417
04:52:05,638 --> 04:52:07,610
posture there imagine being
the first

16418
04:52:07,610 --> 04:52:07,620
the first
 

16419
04:52:07,620 --> 04:52:10,788
the first
child the first baby born

16420
04:52:10,788 --> 04:52:10,798
child the first baby born
 

16421
04:52:10,798 --> 04:52:12,708
child the first baby born
outside of Earth

16422
04:52:12,708 --> 04:52:12,718
outside of Earth
 

16423
04:52:12,718 --> 04:52:15,230
outside of Earth
that'd be pretty cool yeah I would love

16424
04:52:15,230 --> 04:52:15,240
that'd be pretty cool yeah I would love
 

16425
04:52:15,240 --> 04:52:18,470
that'd be pretty cool yeah I would love
to be alive to see that that's a big one

16426
04:52:18,470 --> 04:52:18,480
to be alive to see that that's a big one
 

16427
04:52:18,480 --> 04:52:21,890
to be alive to see that that's a big one
I don't know if they'll um

16428
04:52:21,890 --> 04:52:21,900
I don't know if they'll um
 

16429
04:52:21,900 --> 04:52:23,570
I don't know if they'll um
I don't know because it's such a

16430
04:52:23,570 --> 04:52:23,580
I don't know because it's such a
 

16431
04:52:23,580 --> 04:52:26,330
I don't know because it's such a
dangerous thing it's so risky I think

16432
04:52:26,330 --> 04:52:26,340
dangerous thing it's so risky I think
 

16433
04:52:26,340 --> 04:52:28,250
dangerous thing it's so risky I think
that could be in our lifetime you think

16434
04:52:28,250 --> 04:52:28,260
that could be in our lifetime you think
 

16435
04:52:28,260 --> 04:52:29,390
that could be in our lifetime you think
so yeah

16436
04:52:29,390 --> 04:52:29,400
so yeah
 

16437
04:52:29,400 --> 04:52:31,190
so yeah
I I would like to think in a perfect

16438
04:52:31,190 --> 04:52:31,200
I I would like to think in a perfect
 

16439
04:52:31,200 --> 04:52:33,650
I I would like to think in a perfect
world of her thinking futurism then

16440
04:52:33,650 --> 04:52:33,660
world of her thinking futurism then
 

16441
04:52:33,660 --> 04:52:35,810
world of her thinking futurism then
30 to 50 years I definitely think we

16442
04:52:35,810 --> 04:52:35,820
30 to 50 years I definitely think we
 

16443
04:52:35,820 --> 04:52:38,750
30 to 50 years I definitely think we
could have a full-time like permanent

16444
04:52:38,750 --> 04:52:38,760
could have a full-time like permanent
 

16445
04:52:38,760 --> 04:52:41,750
could have a full-time like permanent
major civilizations you know like like

16446
04:52:41,750 --> 04:52:41,760
major civilizations you know like like
 

16447
04:52:41,760 --> 04:52:42,350
major civilizations you know like like
um

16448
04:52:42,350 --> 04:52:42,360
um
 

16449
04:52:42,360 --> 04:52:44,270
um
uh like what blue origin wants to

16450
04:52:44,270 --> 04:52:44,280
uh like what blue origin wants to
 

16451
04:52:44,280 --> 04:52:46,610
uh like what blue origin wants to
develop where they have a a huge like

16452
04:52:46,610 --> 04:52:46,620
develop where they have a a huge like
 

16453
04:52:46,620 --> 04:52:48,230
develop where they have a a huge like
sphere you know and you're doing a lot

16454
04:52:48,230 --> 04:52:48,240
sphere you know and you're doing a lot
 

16455
04:52:48,240 --> 04:52:51,890
sphere you know and you're doing a lot
of uh especially heavy industry off of

16456
04:52:51,890 --> 04:52:51,900
of uh especially heavy industry off of
 

16457
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:53,150
of uh especially heavy industry off of
Earth you're not polluting earth like

16458
04:52:53,150 --> 04:52:53,160
Earth you're not polluting earth like
 

16459
04:52:53,160 --> 04:52:55,970
Earth you're not polluting earth like
that's makes so much sense to me

16460
04:52:55,970 --> 04:52:55,980
that's makes so much sense to me
 

16461
04:52:55,980 --> 04:52:58,570
that's makes so much sense to me
um I yeah I think I think we

16462
04:52:58,570 --> 04:52:58,580
um I yeah I think I think we
 

16463
04:52:58,580 --> 04:53:00,890
um I yeah I think I think we
we could live in a lifetime where you

16464
04:53:00,890 --> 04:53:00,900
we could live in a lifetime where you
 

16465
04:53:00,900 --> 04:53:02,810
we could live in a lifetime where you
know we thought that since the 50s and

16466
04:53:02,810 --> 04:53:02,820
know we thought that since the 50s and
 

16467
04:53:02,820 --> 04:53:04,010
know we thought that since the 50s and
60s that people are going to be living

16468
04:53:04,010 --> 04:53:04,020
60s that people are going to be living
 

16469
04:53:04,020 --> 04:53:06,288
60s that people are going to be living
and working in space like crazy and at

16470
04:53:06,288 --> 04:53:06,298
and working in space like crazy and at
 

16471
04:53:06,298 --> 04:53:07,670
and working in space like crazy and at
any given point we're lucky to have 12

16472
04:53:07,670 --> 04:53:07,680
any given point we're lucky to have 12
 

16473
04:53:07,680 --> 04:53:10,010
any given point we're lucky to have 12
people in space today

16474
04:53:10,010 --> 04:53:10,020
people in space today
 

16475
04:53:10,020 --> 04:53:10,610
people in space today
um

16476
04:53:10,610 --> 04:53:10,620
um
 

16477
04:53:10,620 --> 04:53:12,410
um
but I really think In Our Lifetime we're

16478
04:53:12,410 --> 04:53:12,420
but I really think In Our Lifetime we're
 

16479
04:53:12,420 --> 04:53:14,650
but I really think In Our Lifetime we're
finally getting to that point of

16480
04:53:14,650 --> 04:53:14,660
finally getting to that point of
 

16481
04:53:14,660 --> 04:53:17,930
finally getting to that point of
yeah that that's a reality let me

16482
04:53:17,930 --> 04:53:17,940
yeah that that's a reality let me
 

16483
04:53:17,940 --> 04:53:20,090
yeah that that's a reality let me
because you mentioned blue origin I can

16484
04:53:20,090 --> 04:53:20,100
because you mentioned blue origin I can
 

16485
04:53:20,100 --> 04:53:21,948
because you mentioned blue origin I can
we just lay out some of the competitors

16486
04:53:21,948 --> 04:53:21,958
we just lay out some of the competitors
 

16487
04:53:21,958 --> 04:53:24,470
we just lay out some of the competitors
to SpaceX so much of what we talked

16488
04:53:24,470 --> 04:53:24,480
to SpaceX so much of what we talked
 

16489
04:53:24,480 --> 04:53:28,250
to SpaceX so much of what we talked
about is uh SpaceX specifically because

16490
04:53:28,250 --> 04:53:28,260
about is uh SpaceX specifically because
 

16491
04:53:28,260 --> 04:53:29,810
about is uh SpaceX specifically because
they're sort of pushing the boundaries

16492
04:53:29,810 --> 04:53:29,820
they're sort of pushing the boundaries
 

16493
04:53:29,820 --> 04:53:30,948
they're sort of pushing the boundaries
of what's possible in the commercial

16494
04:53:30,948 --> 04:53:30,958
of what's possible in the commercial
 

16495
04:53:30,958 --> 04:53:32,990
of what's possible in the commercial
space light but there's a lot of like

16496
04:53:32,990 --> 04:53:33,000
space light but there's a lot of like
 

16497
04:53:33,000 --> 04:53:35,510
space light but there's a lot of like
you said incredible work being done for

16498
04:53:35,510 --> 04:53:35,520
you said incredible work being done for
 

16499
04:53:35,520 --> 04:53:36,890
you said incredible work being done for
large companies and small companies

16500
04:53:36,890 --> 04:53:36,900
large companies and small companies
 

16501
04:53:36,900 --> 04:53:39,110
large companies and small companies
startups and so on uh so who are the

16502
04:53:39,110 --> 04:53:39,120
startups and so on uh so who are the
 

16503
04:53:39,120 --> 04:53:41,628
startups and so on uh so who are the
competitors to SpaceX

16504
04:53:41,628 --> 04:53:41,638
competitors to SpaceX
 

16505
04:53:41,638 --> 04:53:43,670
competitors to SpaceX
Ula United launch Alliance blue origin

16506
04:53:43,670 --> 04:53:43,680
Ula United launch Alliance blue origin
 

16507
04:53:43,680 --> 04:53:47,570
Ula United launch Alliance blue origin
as a Virgin uh is it Galactic orbit

16508
04:53:47,570 --> 04:53:47,580
as a Virgin uh is it Galactic orbit
 

16509
04:53:47,580 --> 04:53:51,110
as a Virgin uh is it Galactic orbit
orbit or the competitor virgin orbit uh

16510
04:53:51,110 --> 04:53:51,120
orbit or the competitor virgin orbit uh
 

16511
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:53,570
orbit or the competitor virgin orbit uh
there's a rocket Labs electron rocket

16512
04:53:53,570 --> 04:53:53,580
there's a rocket Labs electron rocket
 

16513
04:53:53,580 --> 04:53:55,788
there's a rocket Labs electron rocket
that you mentioned

16514
04:53:55,788 --> 04:53:55,798
that you mentioned
 

16515
04:53:55,798 --> 04:53:57,770
that you mentioned
um there's the folks you covered Firefly

16516
04:53:57,770 --> 04:53:57,780
um there's the folks you covered Firefly
 

16517
04:53:57,780 --> 04:54:01,490
um there's the folks you covered Firefly
yep and uh what are we missing there's

16518
04:54:01,490 --> 04:54:01,500
yep and uh what are we missing there's
 

16519
04:54:01,500 --> 04:54:04,250
yep and uh what are we missing there's
the the Epic space launch system

16520
04:54:04,250 --> 04:54:04,260
the the Epic space launch system
 

16521
04:54:04,260 --> 04:54:06,708
the the Epic space launch system
from NASA I guess that is yeah

16522
04:54:06,708 --> 04:54:06,718
from NASA I guess that is yeah
 

16523
04:54:06,718 --> 04:54:08,448
from NASA I guess that is yeah
technically NASA but prime contractor

16524
04:54:08,448 --> 04:54:08,458
technically NASA but prime contractor
 

16525
04:54:08,458 --> 04:54:10,330
technically NASA but prime contractor
Boeing and Boeing

16526

Boeing and Boeing
 

16527
04:54:10,340 --> 04:54:14,090
Boeing and Boeing
yeah the boosters yep okay nice so like

16528
04:54:14,090 --> 04:54:14,100
yeah the boosters yep okay nice so like
 

16529
04:54:14,100 --> 04:54:16,250
yeah the boosters yep okay nice so like
what uh what's what's interesting to say

16530
04:54:16,250 --> 04:54:16,260
what uh what's what's interesting to say
 

16531
04:54:16,260 --> 04:54:17,750
what uh what's what's interesting to say
to lay out the land here that you're

16532
04:54:17,750 --> 04:54:17,760
to lay out the land here that you're
 

16533
04:54:17,760 --> 04:54:20,330
to lay out the land here that you're
excited about just in general I think if

16534
04:54:20,330 --> 04:54:20,340
excited about just in general I think if
 

16535
04:54:20,340 --> 04:54:23,030
excited about just in general I think if
you aren't working on a reusable some

16536
04:54:23,030 --> 04:54:23,040
you aren't working on a reusable some
 

16537
04:54:23,040 --> 04:54:25,250
you aren't working on a reusable some
form of reusable vehicle like physically

16538
04:54:25,250 --> 04:54:25,260
form of reusable vehicle like physically
 

16539
04:54:25,260 --> 04:54:27,590
form of reusable vehicle like physically
working on it pen to paper not Beyond

16540
04:54:27,590 --> 04:54:27,600
working on it pen to paper not Beyond
 

16541
04:54:27,600 --> 04:54:29,930
working on it pen to paper not Beyond
pen to paper like bending metal for a

16542
04:54:29,930 --> 04:54:29,940
pen to paper like bending metal for a
 

16543
04:54:29,940 --> 04:54:31,368
pen to paper like bending metal for a
reusable vehicle you're gone you're

16544
04:54:31,368 --> 04:54:31,378
reusable vehicle you're gone you're
 

16545
04:54:31,378 --> 04:54:32,448
reusable vehicle you're gone you're
toast

16546
04:54:32,448 --> 04:54:32,458
toast
 

16547
04:54:32,458 --> 04:54:35,628
toast
I think we're well into that being the

16548
04:54:35,628 --> 04:54:35,638
I think we're well into that being the
 

16549
04:54:35,638 --> 04:54:36,530
I think we're well into that being the
only

16550
04:54:36,530 --> 04:54:36,540
only
 

16551
04:54:36,540 --> 04:54:39,948
only
provable you know Way Forward the only

16552
04:54:39,948 --> 04:54:39,958
provable you know Way Forward the only
 

16553
04:54:39,958 --> 04:54:41,510
provable you know Way Forward the only
way you're going to compete and survive

16554
04:54:41,510 --> 04:54:41,520
way you're going to compete and survive
 

16555
04:54:41,520 --> 04:54:43,970
way you're going to compete and survive
is a reusable rocket fully reusable

16556
04:54:43,970 --> 04:54:43,980
is a reusable rocket fully reusable
 

16557
04:54:43,980 --> 04:54:45,350
is a reusable rocket fully reusable
would be great but that's obviously

16558
04:54:45,350 --> 04:54:45,360
would be great but that's obviously
 

16559
04:54:45,360 --> 04:54:47,690
would be great but that's obviously
massively aspirational still

16560
04:54:47,690 --> 04:54:47,700
massively aspirational still
 

16561
04:54:47,700 --> 04:54:50,390
massively aspirational still
um but it will come but to me

16562
04:54:50,390 --> 04:54:50,400
um but it will come but to me
 

16563
04:54:50,400 --> 04:54:50,990
um but it will come but to me
um

16564
04:54:50,990 --> 04:54:51,000
um
 

16565

the the yeah the list you pretty much
had it right on the head uh there's

16568
04:54:54,470 --> 04:54:54,480
had it right on the head uh there's
 

16569
04:54:54,480 --> 04:54:57,050
had it right on the head uh there's
there's Astra was another orbital rocket

16570
04:54:57,050 --> 04:54:57,060
there's Astra was another orbital rocket
 

16571
04:54:57,060 --> 04:54:58,430
there's Astra was another orbital rocket
company

16572

believe in
um you know rocket lab is is awesome I

16582
04:55:08,750 --> 04:55:08,760
um you know rocket lab is is awesome I
 

16583
04:55:08,760 --> 04:55:10,430
um you know rocket lab is is awesome I
really think that they are

16584
04:55:10,430 --> 04:55:10,440
really think that they are
 

16585

one of the few that I believe can
 

16587
04:55:11,878 --> 04:55:13,690
one of the few that I believe can
actually build a falcon 9 class rocket

16588
04:55:13,690 --> 04:55:13,700
actually build a falcon 9 class rocket
 

16589
04:55:13,700 --> 04:55:16,610
actually build a falcon 9 class rocket
uh like today with the with their

16590
04:55:16,610 --> 04:55:16,620
uh like today with the with their
 

16591
04:55:16,620 --> 04:55:18,230
uh like today with the with their
technology with their knowledge with

16592
04:55:18,230 --> 04:55:18,240
technology with their knowledge with
 

16593
04:55:18,240 --> 04:55:20,750
technology with their knowledge with
their Investments with their funding you

16594
04:55:20,750 --> 04:55:20,760
their Investments with their funding you
 

16595
04:55:20,760 --> 04:55:21,708
their Investments with their funding you
know like they've and they've proven

16596
04:55:21,708 --> 04:55:21,718
know like they've and they've proven
 

16597
04:55:21,718 --> 04:55:23,690
know like they've and they've proven
themselves there's very few they have

16598
04:55:23,690 --> 04:55:23,700
themselves there's very few they have
 

16599
04:55:23,700 --> 04:55:25,850
themselves there's very few they have
actually made it look easy I think

16600
04:55:25,850 --> 04:55:25,860
actually made it look easy I think
 

16601
04:55:25,860 --> 04:55:27,410
actually made it look easy I think
there's a lot of startups and a lot of

16602
04:55:27,410 --> 04:55:27,420
there's a lot of startups and a lot of
 

16603
04:55:27,420 --> 04:55:29,208
there's a lot of startups and a lot of
new rocket there's a too many launch

16604
04:55:29,208 --> 04:55:29,218
new rocket there's a too many launch
 

16605
04:55:29,218 --> 04:55:30,830
new rocket there's a too many launch
providers popping out of the woodwork

16606
04:55:30,830 --> 04:55:30,840
providers popping out of the woodwork
 

16607
04:55:30,840 --> 04:55:32,868
providers popping out of the woodwork
right now they won't all survive of

16608
04:55:32,868 --> 04:55:32,878
right now they won't all survive of
 

16609
04:55:32,878 --> 04:55:34,850
right now they won't all survive of
course I think realistically if you look

16610
04:55:34,850 --> 04:55:34,860
course I think realistically if you look
 

16611
04:55:34,860 --> 04:55:37,970
course I think realistically if you look
at like airplanes how many airplane you

16612
04:55:37,970 --> 04:55:37,980
at like airplanes how many airplane you
 

16613
04:55:37,980 --> 04:55:39,050
at like airplanes how many airplane you
know there's a handful of airplane

16614
04:55:39,050 --> 04:55:39,060
know there's a handful of airplane
 

16615
04:55:39,060 --> 04:55:41,150
know there's a handful of airplane
manufacturers there's not hundreds and

16616
04:55:41,150 --> 04:55:41,160
manufacturers there's not hundreds and
 

16617
04:55:41,160 --> 04:55:43,368
manufacturers there's not hundreds and
thousands of airplane manufacturers I

16618
04:55:43,368 --> 04:55:43,378
thousands of airplane manufacturers I
 

16619
04:55:43,378 --> 04:55:44,628
thousands of airplane manufacturers I
think it'll be a similar thing for space

16620
04:55:44,628 --> 04:55:44,638
think it'll be a similar thing for space
 

16621
04:55:44,638 --> 04:55:47,990
think it'll be a similar thing for space
flight I think we'll see we'll see you

16622
04:55:47,990 --> 04:55:48,000
flight I think we'll see we'll see you
 

16623
04:55:48,000 --> 04:55:50,030
flight I think we'll see we'll see you
know realistically in the terms of jumbo

16624
04:55:50,030 --> 04:55:50,040
know realistically in the terms of jumbo
 

16625
04:55:50,040 --> 04:55:51,470
know realistically in the terms of jumbo
adjusting passengers there's basically

16626
04:55:51,470 --> 04:55:51,480
adjusting passengers there's basically
 

16627
04:55:51,480 --> 04:55:53,330
adjusting passengers there's basically
two you know there's Airbus and there's

16628
04:55:53,330 --> 04:55:53,340
two you know there's Airbus and there's
 

16629
04:55:53,340 --> 04:55:54,830
two you know there's Airbus and there's
Boeing

16630
04:55:54,830 --> 04:55:54,840
Boeing
 

16631
04:55:54,840 --> 04:55:59,270
Boeing
um so I I think in the long run there'll

16632
04:55:59,270 --> 04:55:59,280
um so I I think in the long run there'll
 

16633
04:55:59,280 --> 04:56:01,490
um so I I think in the long run there'll
be two or three major players

16634
04:56:01,490 --> 04:56:01,500
be two or three major players
 

16635
04:56:01,500 --> 04:56:04,868
be two or three major players
I think they'll be you know 10

16636
04:56:04,868 --> 04:56:04,878
I think they'll be you know 10
 

16637
04:56:04,878 --> 04:56:07,850
I think they'll be you know 10
minor like as far as launch providers as

16638
04:56:07,850 --> 04:56:07,860
minor like as far as launch providers as
 

16639
04:56:07,860 --> 04:56:09,350
minor like as far as launch providers as
far as the ones actually leaving Earth

16640
04:56:09,350 --> 04:56:09,360
far as the ones actually leaving Earth
 

16641
04:56:09,360 --> 04:56:10,910
far as the ones actually leaving Earth
and getting into orbit I just don't

16642
04:56:10,910 --> 04:56:10,920
and getting into orbit I just don't
 

16643
04:56:10,920 --> 04:56:12,948
and getting into orbit I just don't
think there's a ton of room for

16644
04:56:12,948 --> 04:56:12,958
think there's a ton of room for
 

16645
04:56:12,958 --> 04:56:15,410
think there's a ton of room for
individuality really you know yeah I

16646
04:56:15,410 --> 04:56:15,420
individuality really you know yeah I
 

16647
04:56:15,420 --> 04:56:17,150
individuality really you know yeah I
would love to see it like a really

16648
04:56:17,150 --> 04:56:17,160
would love to see it like a really
 

16649
04:56:17,160 --> 04:56:20,270
would love to see it like a really
serious competitor uh to SpaceX in the

16650
04:56:20,270 --> 04:56:20,280
serious competitor uh to SpaceX in the
 

16651
04:56:20,280 --> 04:56:21,890
serious competitor uh to SpaceX in the
way that SpaceX does things I don't know

16652
04:56:21,890 --> 04:56:21,900
way that SpaceX does things I don't know
 

16653
04:56:21,900 --> 04:56:23,868
way that SpaceX does things I don't know
if you'll like is quite

16654
04:56:23,868 --> 04:56:23,878
if you'll like is quite
 

16655
04:56:23,878 --> 04:56:27,230
if you'll like is quite
what I it's quite the right kind of

16656
04:56:27,230 --> 04:56:27,240
what I it's quite the right kind of
 

16657
04:56:27,240 --> 04:56:29,270
what I it's quite the right kind of
competitor let me let me say this Ula

16658
04:56:29,270 --> 04:56:29,280
competitor let me let me say this Ula
 

16659
04:56:29,280 --> 04:56:31,910
competitor let me let me say this Ula
has all of the potential but just

16660
04:56:31,910 --> 04:56:31,920
has all of the potential but just
 

16661
04:56:31,920 --> 04:56:33,350
has all of the potential but just
operationally they're you know they're

16662
04:56:33,350 --> 04:56:33,360
operationally they're you know they're
 

16663
04:56:33,360 --> 04:56:35,510
operationally they're you know they're
either Lockheed Martin and Boeing's like

16664
04:56:35,510 --> 04:56:35,520
either Lockheed Martin and Boeing's like
 

16665
04:56:35,520 --> 04:56:37,970
either Lockheed Martin and Boeing's like
love child yeah but they're

16666
04:56:37,970 --> 04:56:37,980
love child yeah but they're
 

16667
04:56:37,980 --> 04:56:40,850
love child yeah but they're
kind of set up in a far too traditional

16668
04:56:40,850 --> 04:56:40,860
kind of set up in a far too traditional
 

16669
04:56:40,860 --> 04:56:42,770
kind of set up in a far too traditional
manner where they just really aren't

16670
04:56:42,770 --> 04:56:42,780
manner where they just really aren't
 

16671
04:56:42,780 --> 04:56:46,010
manner where they just really aren't
given the opportunity to innovate like a

16672
04:56:46,010 --> 04:56:46,020
given the opportunity to innovate like a
 

16673
04:56:46,020 --> 04:56:47,510
given the opportunity to innovate like a
lot of these startups are so rocket lab

16674
04:56:47,510 --> 04:56:47,520
lot of these startups are so rocket lab
 

16675
04:56:47,520 --> 04:56:50,030
lot of these startups are so rocket lab
is a little bit more of that nature what

16676
04:56:50,030 --> 04:56:50,040
is a little bit more of that nature what
 

16677
04:56:50,040 --> 04:56:51,770
is a little bit more of that nature what
do you think about sort of just blue

16678
04:56:51,770 --> 04:56:51,780
do you think about sort of just blue
 

16679
04:56:51,780 --> 04:56:56,448
do you think about sort of just blue
origin in general Georgians ah man I

16680
04:56:56,448 --> 04:56:56,458
origin in general Georgians ah man I
 

16681
04:56:56,458 --> 04:56:58,010
origin in general Georgians ah man I
what blue origin has done with new

16682
04:56:58,010 --> 04:56:58,020
what blue origin has done with new
 

16683
04:56:58,020 --> 04:57:01,368
what blue origin has done with new
Shepard is amazing and people just lot

16684
04:57:01,368 --> 04:57:01,378
Shepard is amazing and people just lot
 

16685
04:57:01,378 --> 04:57:03,830
Shepard is amazing and people just lot
it because it's sub-orbital and it looks

16686
04:57:03,830 --> 04:57:03,840
it because it's sub-orbital and it looks
 

16687
04:57:03,840 --> 04:57:06,650
it because it's sub-orbital and it looks
very phallic it's

16688
04:57:06,650 --> 04:57:06,660
very phallic it's
 

16689
04:57:06,660 --> 04:57:08,990
very phallic it's
it's uh so I guess the meme matters also

16690
04:57:08,990 --> 04:57:09,000
it's uh so I guess the meme matters also
 

16691
04:57:09,000 --> 04:57:10,788
it's uh so I guess the meme matters also
it's modern day but it's sad because

16692
04:57:10,788 --> 04:57:10,798
it's modern day but it's sad because
 

16693
04:57:10,798 --> 04:57:12,530
it's modern day but it's sad because
people don't see what they are also

16694
04:57:12,530 --> 04:57:12,540
people don't see what they are also
 

16695
04:57:12,540 --> 04:57:14,448
people don't see what they are also
working on which is new Glenn you know I

16696
04:57:14,448 --> 04:57:14,458
working on which is new Glenn you know I
 

16697
04:57:14,458 --> 04:57:16,250
working on which is new Glenn you know I
I see comments almost every day still of

16698
04:57:16,250 --> 04:57:16,260
I see comments almost every day still of
 

16699
04:57:16,260 --> 04:57:17,990
I see comments almost every day still of
like it doesn't matter because you know

16700
04:57:17,990 --> 04:57:18,000
like it doesn't matter because you know
 

16701
04:57:18,000 --> 04:57:19,730
like it doesn't matter because you know
they're they're working on Tiny it's

16702
04:57:19,730 --> 04:57:19,740
they're they're working on Tiny it's
 

16703
04:57:19,740 --> 04:57:22,010
they're they're working on Tiny it's
like no new Glenn is more powerful and

16704
04:57:22,010 --> 04:57:22,020
like no new Glenn is more powerful and
 

16705
04:57:22,020 --> 04:57:24,230
like no new Glenn is more powerful and
more capable than Falcon heavy new Glenn

16706
04:57:24,230 --> 04:57:24,240
more capable than Falcon heavy new Glenn
 

16707
04:57:24,240 --> 04:57:26,510
more capable than Falcon heavy new Glenn
is almost more of a competitor to not

16708
04:57:26,510 --> 04:57:26,520
is almost more of a competitor to not
 

16709
04:57:26,520 --> 04:57:28,310
is almost more of a competitor to not
quite as to Starship but it's almost in

16710
04:57:28,310 --> 04:57:28,320
quite as to Starship but it's almost in
 

16711
04:57:28,320 --> 04:57:30,590
quite as to Starship but it's almost in
that class it's a it's a heavy lift

16712
04:57:30,590 --> 04:57:30,600
that class it's a it's a heavy lift
 

16713
04:57:30,600 --> 04:57:32,510
that class it's a it's a heavy lift
launch vehicle it's huge it's crazy

16714
04:57:32,510 --> 04:57:32,520
launch vehicle it's huge it's crazy
 

16715
04:57:32,520 --> 04:57:35,030
launch vehicle it's huge it's crazy
it'll be nuts they're very actively

16716
04:57:35,030 --> 04:57:35,040
it'll be nuts they're very actively
 

16717
04:57:35,040 --> 04:57:36,230
it'll be nuts they're very actively
working on it you know I still think

16718
04:57:36,230 --> 04:57:36,240
working on it you know I still think
 

16719
04:57:36,240 --> 04:57:38,330
working on it you know I still think
we're three years away from it launching

16720
04:57:38,330 --> 04:57:38,340
we're three years away from it launching
 

16721
04:57:38,340 --> 04:57:41,270
we're three years away from it launching
but that's a very strong competitor in

16722
04:57:41,270 --> 04:57:41,280
but that's a very strong competitor in
 

16723
04:57:41,280 --> 04:57:43,310
but that's a very strong competitor in
the class of rockets at SpaceX is

16724
04:57:43,310 --> 04:57:43,320
the class of rockets at SpaceX is
 

16725
04:57:43,320 --> 04:57:45,410
the class of rockets at SpaceX is
currently making so SpaceX is currently

16726
04:57:45,410 --> 04:57:45,420
currently making so SpaceX is currently
 

16727
04:57:45,420 --> 04:57:48,110
currently making so SpaceX is currently
leading the way but that that it

16728
04:57:48,110 --> 04:57:48,120
leading the way but that that it
 

16729
04:57:48,120 --> 04:57:50,510
leading the way but that that it
couldn't become a close race and what

16730
04:57:50,510 --> 04:57:50,520
couldn't become a close race and what
 

16731
04:57:50,520 --> 04:57:52,910
couldn't become a close race and what
it's just I we'll just for now we'll

16732
04:57:52,910 --> 04:57:52,920
it's just I we'll just for now we'll
 

16733
04:57:52,920 --> 04:57:54,590
it's just I we'll just for now we'll
ignore SpaceX and we'll just kind of

16734
04:57:54,590 --> 04:57:54,600
ignore SpaceX and we'll just kind of
 

16735
04:57:54,600 --> 04:57:55,970
ignore SpaceX and we'll just kind of
talk about like I think who's kind of

16736
04:57:55,970 --> 04:57:55,980
talk about like I think who's kind of
 

16737
04:57:55,980 --> 04:57:57,708
talk about like I think who's kind of
coming around the corner here who's here

16738
04:57:57,708 --> 04:57:57,718
coming around the corner here who's here
 

16739
04:57:57,718 --> 04:58:00,230
coming around the corner here who's here
so let me just do a quick overview I'm

16740
04:58:00,230 --> 04:58:00,240
so let me just do a quick overview I'm
 

16741
04:58:00,240 --> 04:58:01,730
so let me just do a quick overview I'm
going to shoot myself in the foot for

16742
04:58:01,730 --> 04:58:01,740
going to shoot myself in the foot for
 

16743
04:58:01,740 --> 04:58:03,590
going to shoot myself in the foot for
getting some cool people here and some

16744
04:58:03,590 --> 04:58:03,600
getting some cool people here and some
 

16745
04:58:03,600 --> 04:58:05,030
getting some cool people here and some
some exciting companies but relativity

16746
04:58:05,030 --> 04:58:05,040
some exciting companies but relativity
 

16747
04:58:05,040 --> 04:58:07,190
some exciting companies but relativity
is one that if you you should definitely

16748
04:58:07,190 --> 04:58:07,200
is one that if you you should definitely
 

16749
04:58:07,200 --> 04:58:10,190
is one that if you you should definitely
get to MLS on the show who is the uh CEO

16750
04:58:10,190 --> 04:58:10,200
get to MLS on the show who is the uh CEO
 

16751
04:58:10,200 --> 04:58:12,050
get to MLS on the show who is the uh CEO
of Relativity they're doing 3D printed

16752
04:58:12,050 --> 04:58:12,060
of Relativity they're doing 3D printed
 

16753
04:58:12,060 --> 04:58:12,948
of Relativity they're doing 3D printed
Rockets

16754
04:58:12,948 --> 04:58:12,958
Rockets
 

16755
04:58:12,958 --> 04:58:14,690
Rockets
the ones that have the world's largest

16756
04:58:14,690 --> 04:58:14,700
the ones that have the world's largest
 

16757
04:58:14,700 --> 04:58:16,788
the ones that have the world's largest
3D printer they're getting really close

16758
04:58:16,788 --> 04:58:16,798
3D printer they're getting really close
 

16759
04:58:16,798 --> 04:58:18,890
3D printer they're getting really close
to their first orbital launch

16760
04:58:18,890 --> 04:58:18,900
to their first orbital launch
 

16761
04:58:18,900 --> 04:58:20,090
to their first orbital launch
um the cool thing about them the reason

16762
04:58:20,090 --> 04:58:20,100
um the cool thing about them the reason
 

16763
04:58:20,100 --> 04:58:22,010
um the cool thing about them the reason
that I think they're exciting the reason

16764
04:58:22,010 --> 04:58:22,020
that I think they're exciting the reason
 

16765
04:58:22,020 --> 04:58:24,470
that I think they're exciting the reason
that I I think they have the potential

16766
04:58:24,470 --> 04:58:24,480
that I I think they have the potential
 

16767
04:58:24,480 --> 04:58:27,288
that I I think they have the potential
is just how quickly they can iterate I

16768
04:58:27,288 --> 04:58:27,298
is just how quickly they can iterate I
 

16769
04:58:27,298 --> 04:58:28,670
is just how quickly they can iterate I
think 3D printing a rocket is really

16770
04:58:28,670 --> 04:58:28,680
think 3D printing a rocket is really
 

16771
04:58:28,680 --> 04:58:29,590
think 3D printing a rocket is really
dumb

16772
04:58:29,590 --> 04:58:29,600
dumb
 

16773
04:58:29,600 --> 04:58:32,390
dumb
I think iterating with 3D printing on a

16774
04:58:32,390 --> 04:58:32,400
I think iterating with 3D printing on a
 

16775
04:58:32,400 --> 04:58:34,190
I think iterating with 3D printing on a
rocket is brilliant because you can

16776
04:58:34,190 --> 04:58:34,200
rocket is brilliant because you can
 

16777
04:58:34,200 --> 04:58:36,410
rocket is brilliant because you can
literally change software and have like

16778
04:58:36,410 --> 04:58:36,420
literally change software and have like
 

16779
04:58:36,420 --> 04:58:38,990
literally change software and have like
very little you know upload a file and

16780
04:58:38,990 --> 04:58:39,000
very little you know upload a file and
 

16781
04:58:39,000 --> 04:58:41,810
very little you know upload a file and
have a new rocket like that's amazing so

16782
04:58:41,810 --> 04:58:41,820
have a new rocket like that's amazing so
 

16783
04:58:41,820 --> 04:58:44,930
have a new rocket like that's amazing so
in terms of long-term iterative process

16784
04:58:44,930 --> 04:58:44,940
in terms of long-term iterative process
 

16785
04:58:44,940 --> 04:58:46,970
in terms of long-term iterative process
if if we're really talking about like

16786
04:58:46,970 --> 04:58:46,980
if if we're really talking about like
 

16787
04:58:46,980 --> 04:58:49,010
if if we're really talking about like
hitting the ground running and and just

16788
04:58:49,010 --> 04:58:49,020
hitting the ground running and and just
 

16789
04:58:49,020 --> 04:58:50,750
hitting the ground running and and just
seeing where the the evolution takes you

16790
04:58:50,750 --> 04:58:50,760
seeing where the the evolution takes you
 

16791
04:58:50,760 --> 04:58:52,310
seeing where the the evolution takes you
I think that's about as good as you can

16792
04:58:52,310 --> 04:58:52,320
I think that's about as good as you can
 

16793
04:58:52,320 --> 04:58:54,050
I think that's about as good as you can
get you know I think what SpaceX is

16794
04:58:54,050 --> 04:58:54,060
get you know I think what SpaceX is
 

16795
04:58:54,060 --> 04:58:55,070
get you know I think what SpaceX is
doing at Starbase just physically

16796
04:58:55,070 --> 04:58:55,080
doing at Starbase just physically
 

16797
04:58:55,080 --> 04:58:57,590
doing at Starbase just physically
bending cheap steel is probably also a

16798
04:58:57,590 --> 04:58:57,600
bending cheap steel is probably also a
 

16799
04:58:57,600 --> 04:58:58,970
bending cheap steel is probably also a
very valid solution

16800
04:58:58,970 --> 04:58:58,980
very valid solution
 

16801
04:58:58,980 --> 04:59:00,650
very valid solution
all right so I really think and they

16802
04:59:00,650 --> 04:59:00,660
all right so I really think and they
 

16803
04:59:00,660 --> 04:59:01,788
all right so I really think and they
have the engineering jobs I think

16804
04:59:01,788 --> 04:59:01,798
have the engineering jobs I think
 

16805
04:59:01,798 --> 04:59:03,890
have the engineering jobs I think
they've got some amazing people there

16806
04:59:03,890 --> 04:59:03,900
they've got some amazing people there
 

16807
04:59:03,900 --> 04:59:06,650
they've got some amazing people there
um again rocket lab I adore what they

16808
04:59:06,650 --> 04:59:06,660
um again rocket lab I adore what they
 

16809
04:59:06,660 --> 04:59:09,050
um again rocket lab I adore what they
work on and you know like every everyone

16810
04:59:09,050 --> 04:59:09,060
work on and you know like every everyone
 

16811
04:59:09,060 --> 04:59:10,910
work on and you know like every everyone
there's a caveat here that everything

16812
04:59:10,910 --> 04:59:10,920
there's a caveat here that everything
 

16813
04:59:10,920 --> 04:59:13,190
there's a caveat here that everything
takes longer anything any company tells

16814
04:59:13,190 --> 04:59:13,200
takes longer anything any company tells
 

16815
04:59:13,200 --> 04:59:14,750
takes longer anything any company tells
you it's two or three times longer just

16816
04:59:14,750 --> 04:59:14,760
you it's two or three times longer just
 

16817
04:59:14,760 --> 04:59:17,390
you it's two or three times longer just
period rocket lab's no different

16818
04:59:17,390 --> 04:59:17,400
period rocket lab's no different
 

16819
04:59:17,400 --> 04:59:18,650
period rocket lab's no different
um but I really they're they're working

16820
04:59:18,650 --> 04:59:18,660
um but I really they're they're working
 

16821
04:59:18,660 --> 04:59:21,170
um but I really they're they're working
on a neutron rocket that's going to be

16822
04:59:21,170 --> 04:59:21,180
on a neutron rocket that's going to be
 

16823
04:59:21,180 --> 04:59:22,610
on a neutron rocket that's going to be
um like I think eight thousand to

16824
04:59:22,610 --> 04:59:22,620
um like I think eight thousand to
 

16825
04:59:22,620 --> 04:59:24,230
um like I think eight thousand to
fifteen thousand kilograms to low earth

16826
04:59:24,230 --> 04:59:24,240
fifteen thousand kilograms to low earth
 

16827
04:59:24,240 --> 04:59:25,850
fifteen thousand kilograms to low earth
orbit like it's a good medium class

16828
04:59:25,850 --> 04:59:25,860
orbit like it's a good medium class
 

16829
04:59:25,860 --> 04:59:28,010
orbit like it's a good medium class
rocket well compete right along with

16830
04:59:28,010 --> 04:59:28,020
rocket well compete right along with
 

16831
04:59:28,020 --> 04:59:30,410
rocket well compete right along with
Falcon 9 hopefully by the way Neutron

16832
04:59:30,410 --> 04:59:30,420
Falcon 9 hopefully by the way Neutron
 

16833
04:59:30,420 --> 04:59:32,270
Falcon 9 hopefully by the way Neutron
would be its name right yeah yeah so

16834
04:59:32,270 --> 04:59:32,280
would be its name right yeah yeah so
 

16835
04:59:32,280 --> 04:59:33,650
would be its name right yeah yeah so
that's like kind of neutron it's not

16836
04:59:33,650 --> 04:59:33,660
that's like kind of neutron it's not
 

16837
04:59:33,660 --> 04:59:35,150
that's like kind of neutron it's not
some kind of fascinating new physics

16838
04:59:35,150 --> 04:59:35,160
some kind of fascinating new physics
 

16839
04:59:35,160 --> 04:59:36,170
some kind of fascinating new physics
breakthrough where they're using

16840
04:59:36,170 --> 04:59:36,180
breakthrough where they're using
 

16841
04:59:36,180 --> 04:59:38,150
breakthrough where they're using
neutrons no no but they are using

16842
04:59:38,150 --> 04:59:38,160
neutrons no no but they are using
 

16843
04:59:38,160 --> 04:59:39,708
neutrons no no but they are using
they're also using liquid methane and

16844
04:59:39,708 --> 04:59:39,718
they're also using liquid methane and
 

16845
04:59:39,718 --> 04:59:41,390
they're also using liquid methane and
liquid oxygen

16846
04:59:41,390 --> 04:59:41,400
liquid oxygen
 

16847
04:59:41,400 --> 04:59:43,010
liquid oxygen
um I just think it's a really it's a

16848
04:59:43,010 --> 04:59:43,020
um I just think it's a really it's a
 

16849
04:59:43,020 --> 04:59:45,948
um I just think it's a really it's a
seems like a great rocket and assuming

16850
04:59:45,948 --> 04:59:45,958
seems like a great rocket and assuming
 

16851
04:59:45,958 --> 04:59:47,330
seems like a great rocket and assuming
they can actually get it flying in two

16852
04:59:47,330 --> 04:59:47,340
they can actually get it flying in two
 

16853
04:59:47,340 --> 04:59:48,770
they can actually get it flying in two
or three years I think they're gonna be

16854
04:59:48,770 --> 04:59:48,780
or three years I think they're gonna be
 

16855
04:59:48,780 --> 04:59:51,230
or three years I think they're gonna be
it's here to stay you know

16856
04:59:51,230 --> 04:59:51,240
it's here to stay you know
 

16857
04:59:51,240 --> 04:59:52,850
it's here to stay you know
um I I'd be remiss right now I'm editing

16858
04:59:52,850 --> 04:59:52,860
um I I'd be remiss right now I'm editing
 

16859
04:59:52,860 --> 04:59:54,110
um I I'd be remiss right now I'm editing
a video from an interview with Stoke

16860
04:59:54,110 --> 04:59:54,120

Aerospace out in in Kent Washington

16862
04:59:57,170 --> 04:59:57,180
Aerospace out in in Kent Washington
 

16863
04:59:57,180 --> 04:59:58,910
Aerospace out in in Kent Washington
um it's just one of these companies that

16864
04:59:58,910 --> 04:59:58,920
um it's just one of these companies that
 

16865
04:59:58,920 --> 05:00:01,010
um it's just one of these companies that
they have a long ways to go like they're

16866
05:00:01,010 --> 05:00:01,020
they have a long ways to go like they're
 

16867
05:00:01,020 --> 05:00:02,990
they have a long ways to go like they're
still in the very they're they're behind

16868
05:00:02,990 --> 05:00:03,000
still in the very they're they're behind
 

16869
05:00:03,000 --> 05:00:05,090
still in the very they're they're behind
the curve frankly in in terms of launch

16870
05:00:05,090 --> 05:00:05,100
the curve frankly in in terms of launch
 

16871
05:00:05,100 --> 05:00:06,288
the curve frankly in in terms of launch
Vehicles right now because like I said

16872
05:00:06,288 --> 05:00:06,298
Vehicles right now because like I said
 

16873
05:00:06,298 --> 05:00:08,090
Vehicles right now because like I said
there's so many coming out of the

16874
05:00:08,090 --> 05:00:08,100
there's so many coming out of the
 

16875
05:00:08,100 --> 05:00:10,970
there's so many coming out of the
woodwork but the idea they're working on

16876
05:00:10,970 --> 05:00:10,980
woodwork but the idea they're working on
 

16877
05:00:10,980 --> 05:00:13,128
woodwork but the idea they're working on
their solution to a fully reusable

16878
05:00:13,128 --> 05:00:13,138
their solution to a fully reusable
 

16879
05:00:13,138 --> 05:00:16,430
their solution to a fully reusable
rocket is amazing one of the coolest

16880
05:00:16,430 --> 05:00:16,440
rocket is amazing one of the coolest
 

16881
05:00:16,440 --> 05:00:18,410
rocket is amazing one of the coolest
Concepts I've ever seen are you going to

16882
05:00:18,410 --> 05:00:18,420
Concepts I've ever seen are you going to
 

16883
05:00:18,420 --> 05:00:20,570
Concepts I've ever seen are you going to
cover in the video yeah yeah that'll be

16884
05:00:20,570 --> 05:00:20,580
cover in the video yeah yeah that'll be
 

16885
05:00:20,580 --> 05:00:21,948
cover in the video yeah yeah that'll be
hopefully coming out the next depending

16886
05:00:21,948 --> 05:00:21,958
hopefully coming out the next depending
 

16887
05:00:21,958 --> 05:00:24,110
hopefully coming out the next depending
on what the schedule like is down there

16888
05:00:24,110 --> 05:00:24,120
on what the schedule like is down there
 

16889

engineer magnificence they have they
 

16915
05:00:54,060 --> 05:00:55,368
engineer magnificence they have they
used to they both have worked at Blue

16916
05:00:55,368 --> 05:00:55,378
used to they both have worked at Blue
 

16917
05:00:55,378 --> 05:00:57,350
used to they both have worked at Blue
they developed engines in a hurry there

16918
05:00:57,350 --> 05:00:57,360
they developed engines in a hurry there
 

16919
05:00:57,360 --> 05:00:59,448
they developed engines in a hurry there
and then left blue and it felt like it

16920
05:00:59,448 --> 05:00:59,458
and then left blue and it felt like it
 

16921
05:00:59,458 --> 05:01:00,830
and then left blue and it felt like it
was getting too slow for them and now

16922
05:01:00,830 --> 05:01:00,840
was getting too slow for them and now
 

16923
05:01:00,840 --> 05:01:03,470
was getting too slow for them and now
they are I mean these these guys fired a

16924
05:01:03,470 --> 05:01:03,480
they are I mean these these guys fired a
 

16925
05:01:03,480 --> 05:01:06,350
they are I mean these these guys fired a
15 chambered rocket engine instead of

16926
05:01:06,350 --> 05:01:06,360
15 chambered rocket engine instead of
 

16927
05:01:06,360 --> 05:01:07,970
15 chambered rocket engine instead of
four from the Soviet we're talking 15

wow that's impressive wow and that's
like that was on average you know if you

16936
05:01:17,990 --> 05:01:18,000
like that was on average you know if you
 

16937
05:01:18,000 --> 05:01:20,448
like that was on average you know if you
think about like days off time off you

16938
05:01:20,448 --> 05:01:20,458
think about like days off time off you
 

16939
05:01:20,458 --> 05:01:23,628
think about like days off time off you
know Parts changing yes over twice a day

16940
05:01:23,628 --> 05:01:23,638
know Parts changing yes over twice a day

they're looking to uh um some U.S
 

16987
05:02:11,760 --> 05:02:14,030
they're looking to uh um some U.S
propulsion and stages so they actually

16988
05:02:14,030 --> 05:02:14,040
propulsion and stages so they actually
 

16989
05:02:14,040 --> 05:02:17,208
propulsion and stages so they actually
are partnering with uh with firefly and

16990
05:02:17,208 --> 05:02:17,218
are partnering with uh with firefly and
 

16991
05:02:17,218 --> 05:02:19,850
are partnering with uh with firefly and
their new Antares rocket will be a first

16992
05:02:19,850 --> 05:02:19,860
their new Antares rocket will be a first
 

16993
05:02:19,860 --> 05:02:21,708
their new Antares rocket will be a first
stage built entirely by Firefly so I'm

16994
05:02:21,708 --> 05:02:21,718
stage built entirely by Firefly so I'm
 

16995
05:02:21,718 --> 05:02:24,050
stage built entirely by Firefly so I'm
excited that Firefly already has the

16996
05:02:24,050 --> 05:02:24,060
excited that Firefly already has the
 

16997
05:02:24,060 --> 05:02:25,850

17055
05:03:27,000 --> 05:03:29,448
general there's so much technology
that's currently being developed that we

17056
05:03:29,448 --> 05:03:29,458
that's currently being developed that we
 

17057
05:03:29,458 --> 05:03:31,430
that's currently being developed that we
probably know nothing about yeah

17058
05:03:31,430 --> 05:03:31,440
probably know nothing about yeah
 

17059

like oh it changed orbit you know it
 

17103
05:04:24,298 --> 05:04:26,030
like oh it changed orbit you know it
raised and lowered its orbit blah blah

raised and lowered its orbit blah blah
 

17105
05:04:26,040 --> 05:04:28,490

more but wait there's more and you you
 

17191
05:06:07,560 --> 05:06:09,288
more but wait there's more and you you
uh you said like you streamed yourself

17192
05:06:09,288 --> 05:06:09,298
uh you said like you streamed yourself
 

17193
05:06:09,298 --> 05:06:10,730
uh you said like you streamed yourself
playing this at those any of those

17194
05:06:10,730 --> 05:06:10,740
playing this at those any of those
 

17195
05:06:10,740 --> 05:06:12,650
playing this at those any of those
videos up oh yeah yeah there's some of

17196
05:06:12,650 --> 05:06:12,660
videos up oh yeah yeah there's some of
 

17197
05:06:12,660 --> 05:06:14,090
videos up oh yeah yeah there's some of
my actually the first videos I ever

17198
05:06:14,090 --> 05:06:14,100
my actually the first videos I ever
 

17199
05:06:14,100 --> 05:06:16,490
my actually the first videos I ever
uploaded to YouTube were re like

17200
05:06:16,490 --> 05:06:16,500
uploaded to YouTube were re like
 

17201
05:06:16,500 --> 05:06:19,070
uploaded to YouTube were re like
recaptured streams from twitch that are

17202
05:06:19,070 --> 05:06:19,080
recaptured streams from twitch that are
 

17203
05:06:19,080 --> 05:06:21,110
recaptured streams from twitch that are
just physically uploaded to YouTube this

17204
05:06:21,110 --> 05:06:21,120
just physically uploaded to YouTube this
 

17205
05:06:21,120 --> 05:06:23,150
just physically uploaded to YouTube this
is awesome and so it's it's me playing

17206
05:06:23,150 --> 05:06:23,160
is awesome and so it's it's me playing
 

17207
05:06:23,160 --> 05:06:24,770
is awesome and so it's it's me playing
Chrome we I used to do this kind of like

17208
05:06:24,770 --> 05:06:24,780
Chrome we I used to do this kind of like
 

17209
05:06:24,780 --> 05:06:27,230
Chrome we I used to do this kind of like
a podcast style thing uh I should get

17210
05:06:27,230 --> 05:06:27,240
a podcast style thing uh I should get
 

17211
05:06:27,240 --> 05:06:28,128
a podcast style thing uh I should get
back into this because it's one of my

17212
05:06:28,128 --> 05:06:28,138
back into this because it's one of my
 

17213
05:06:28,138 --> 05:06:29,270
back into this because it's one of my
favorite things I ever did it's called

17214
05:06:29,270 --> 05:06:29,280
favorite things I ever did it's called
 

17215
05:06:29,280 --> 05:06:31,010
favorite things I ever did it's called
we called it today's in space fight

17216
05:06:31,010 --> 05:06:31,020
we called it today's in space fight
 

17217
05:06:31,020 --> 05:06:32,990
we called it today's in space fight
history but these days I'd probably just

17218
05:06:32,990 --> 05:06:33,000
history but these days I'd probably just
 

17219
05:06:33,000 --> 05:06:35,330
history but these days I'd probably just
play Kerbal but I had my friend come sit

17220
05:06:35,330 --> 05:06:35,340
play Kerbal but I had my friend come sit
 

17221
05:06:35,340 --> 05:06:39,470
play Kerbal but I had my friend come sit
next to me his name's Jacob and he is a

17222
05:06:39,470 --> 05:06:39,480
next to me his name's Jacob and he is a
 

17223
05:06:39,480 --> 05:06:41,390
next to me his name's Jacob and he is a
former professional pole vaulter just

17224
05:06:41,390 --> 05:06:41,400
former professional pole vaulter just
 

17225
05:06:41,400 --> 05:06:44,208
former professional pole vaulter just
this really knows nothing about Rockets

17226
05:06:44,208 --> 05:06:44,218
this really knows nothing about Rockets
 

17227
05:06:44,218 --> 05:06:46,490
this really knows nothing about Rockets
yes knows nothing about space hilarious

17228
05:06:46,490 --> 05:06:46,500
yes knows nothing about space hilarious
 

17229
05:06:46,500 --> 05:06:49,190
yes knows nothing about space hilarious
like in the sweetest most fun way you

17230
05:06:49,190 --> 05:06:49,200
like in the sweetest most fun way you
 

17231
05:06:49,200 --> 05:06:51,110
like in the sweetest most fun way you
know like he you know as an adult asked

17232
05:06:51,110 --> 05:06:51,120
know like he you know as an adult asked
 

17233
05:06:51,120 --> 05:06:52,850
know like he you know as an adult asked
me which is bigger the Earth or the Moon

17234
05:06:52,850 --> 05:06:52,860
me which is bigger the Earth or the Moon
 

17235
05:06:52,860 --> 05:06:54,708
me which is bigger the Earth or the Moon
and I love that for him you know that's

17236
05:06:54,708 --> 05:06:54,718
and I love that for him you know that's
 

17237
05:06:54,718 --> 05:06:56,628
and I love that for him you know that's
that's fantastic he's just a delightful

17238
05:06:56,628 --> 05:06:56,638
that's fantastic he's just a delightful
 

17239
05:06:56,638 --> 05:06:58,788
that's fantastic he's just a delightful
human he would sit next to me we would

17240
05:06:58,788 --> 05:06:58,798
human he would sit next to me we would
 

17241
05:06:58,798 --> 05:07:00,170
human he would sit next to me we would
recreate a historical space flight

17242
05:07:00,170 --> 05:07:00,180
recreate a historical space flight
 

17243
05:07:00,180 --> 05:07:01,910
recreate a historical space flight
mission in Kerbal Space Program and he

17244
05:07:01,910 --> 05:07:01,920
mission in Kerbal Space Program and he
 

17245
05:07:01,920 --> 05:07:03,530
mission in Kerbal Space Program and he
would just sit there and play guitar and

17246
05:07:03,530 --> 05:07:03,540
would just sit there and play guitar and
 

17247
05:07:03,540 --> 05:07:05,150
would just sit there and play guitar and
sing about what I'm like doing and

17248
05:07:05,150 --> 05:07:05,160
sing about what I'm like doing and
 

17249
05:07:05,160 --> 05:07:07,010
sing about what I'm like doing and
asking questions yeah and it's still one

17250
05:07:07,010 --> 05:07:07,020
asking questions yeah and it's still one
 

17251
05:07:07,020 --> 05:07:08,150
asking questions yeah and it's still one
of my favorite things I've ever done

17252
05:07:08,150 --> 05:07:08,160
of my favorite things I've ever done
 

17253
05:07:08,160 --> 05:07:09,708
of my favorite things I've ever done
yeah you should definitely do something

17254
05:07:09,708 --> 05:07:09,718
yeah you should definitely do something
 

17255
05:07:09,718 --> 05:07:12,708
yeah you should definitely do something
like that so basically just uh yeah

17256
05:07:12,708 --> 05:07:12,718
like that so basically just uh yeah
 

17257
05:07:12,718 --> 05:07:15,050
like that so basically just uh yeah
shoot the [\h__\h] with a friend get their

17258
05:07:15,050 --> 05:07:15,060
shoot the [\h__\h] with a friend get their
 

17259
05:07:15,060 --> 05:07:16,730
shoot the [\h__\h] with a friend get their
curiosity going let them just sit there

17260
05:07:16,730 --> 05:07:16,740
curiosity going let them just sit there
 

17261
05:07:16,740 --> 05:07:20,030
curiosity going let them just sit there
and ask questions it was awesome like I

17262
05:07:20,030 --> 05:07:20,040
and ask questions it was awesome like I
 

17263
05:07:20,040 --> 05:07:22,610
and ask questions it was awesome like I
mean yeah those are some I I've done it

17264
05:07:22,610 --> 05:07:22,620
mean yeah those are some I I've done it
 

17265
05:07:22,620 --> 05:07:23,570
mean yeah those are some I I've done it
a handful of times I think we probably

17266
05:07:23,570 --> 05:07:23,580
a handful of times I think we probably
 

17267
05:07:23,580 --> 05:07:25,010
a handful of times I think we probably
did like 20 or 30 episodes or something

17268
05:07:25,010 --> 05:07:25,020
did like 20 or 30 episodes or something
 

17269
05:07:25,020 --> 05:07:27,288
did like 20 or 30 episodes or something
and it is it's definitely something I

17270
05:07:27,288 --> 05:07:27,298
and it is it's definitely something I
 

17271
05:07:27,298 --> 05:07:28,850
and it is it's definitely something I
would like to get back to doing can you

17272
05:07:28,850 --> 05:07:28,860
would like to get back to doing can you
 

17273
05:07:28,860 --> 05:07:31,070
would like to get back to doing can you
in the in the game like go to go to the

17274
05:07:31,070 --> 05:07:31,080
in the in the game like go to go to the
 

17275
05:07:31,080 --> 05:07:32,690
in the in the game like go to go to the
Moon Yeah so it's technically a

17276
05:07:32,690 --> 05:07:32,700
Moon Yeah so it's technically a
 

17277
05:07:32,700 --> 05:07:35,030
Moon Yeah so it's technically a
different solar system it's the Kerbal

17278
05:07:35,030 --> 05:07:35,040
different solar system it's the Kerbal
 

17279
05:07:35,040 --> 05:07:37,070
different solar system it's the Kerbal
system and you're on the planet curbin

17280
05:07:37,070 --> 05:07:37,080
system and you're on the planet curbin
 

17281
05:07:37,080 --> 05:07:40,490
system and you're on the planet curbin
so there's the mun m-u-n there's a

17282
05:07:40,490 --> 05:07:40,500
so there's the mun m-u-n there's a
 

17283
05:07:40,500 --> 05:07:43,070
so there's the mun m-u-n there's a
second moon in the system uh on this

17284
05:07:43,070 --> 05:07:43,080
second moon in the system uh on this
 

17285
05:07:43,080 --> 05:07:45,530
second moon in the system uh on this
planet uh it's called mid Miss they

17286
05:07:45,530 --> 05:07:45,540
planet uh it's called mid Miss they
 

17287
05:07:45,540 --> 05:07:47,270
planet uh it's called mid Miss they
didn't want to pay licensing fees or

17288
05:07:47,270 --> 05:07:47,280
didn't want to pay licensing fees or
 

17289
05:07:47,280 --> 05:07:48,010
didn't want to pay licensing fees or
what

17290
05:07:48,010 --> 05:07:48,020
what
 

17291
05:07:48,020 --> 05:07:50,330
what
well it's just a little easier it's a

17292
05:07:50,330 --> 05:07:50,340
well it's just a little easier it's a
 

17293
05:07:50,340 --> 05:07:52,010
well it's just a little easier it's a
little bit smaller so the physics are

17294
05:07:52,010 --> 05:07:52,020
little bit smaller so the physics are
 

17295
05:07:52,020 --> 05:07:54,708
little bit smaller so the physics are
easier oh so it tries to be consistent

17296
05:07:54,708 --> 05:07:54,718
easier oh so it tries to be consistent
 

17297
05:07:54,718 --> 05:07:56,270
easier oh so it tries to be consistent
with physics yeah oh yeah yeah the

17298
05:07:56,270 --> 05:07:56,280
with physics yeah oh yeah yeah the
 

17299
05:07:56,280 --> 05:07:58,128
with physics yeah oh yeah yeah the
physics are all are all like real world

17300
05:07:58,128 --> 05:07:58,138
physics are all are all like real world
 

17301
05:07:58,138 --> 05:08:00,050
physics are all are all like real world
physics and I mean there's Aero

17302
05:08:00,050 --> 05:08:00,060
physics and I mean there's Aero
 

17303
05:08:00,060 --> 05:08:02,750
physics and I mean there's Aero
simulations there's all of it's like one

17304
05:08:02,750 --> 05:08:02,760
simulations there's all of it's like one
 

17305
05:08:02,760 --> 05:08:04,610
simulations there's all of it's like one
to one you know for Earth physics

17306
05:08:04,610 --> 05:08:04,620
to one you know for Earth physics
 

17307
05:08:04,620 --> 05:08:06,708
to one you know for Earth physics
awesome it's just on an easier scale

17308
05:08:06,708 --> 05:08:06,718
awesome it's just on an easier scale
 

17309
05:08:06,718 --> 05:08:09,230
awesome it's just on an easier scale
solar system so it's easier to to

17310
05:08:09,230 --> 05:08:09,240
solar system so it's easier to to
 

17311
05:08:09,240 --> 05:08:10,490
solar system so it's easier to to
navigate but there's still like there's

17312
05:08:10,490 --> 05:08:10,500
navigate but there's still like there's
 

17313
05:08:10,500 --> 05:08:12,050
navigate but there's still like there's
a planet called Eve that's kind of like

17314
05:08:12,050 --> 05:08:12,060
a planet called Eve that's kind of like
 

17315
05:08:12,060 --> 05:08:14,090
a planet called Eve that's kind of like
Venus so it has a really thick

17316
05:08:14,090 --> 05:08:14,100
Venus so it has a really thick
 

17317
05:08:14,100 --> 05:08:16,070
Venus so it has a really thick
atmosphere really thick really soupy

17318
05:08:16,070 --> 05:08:16,080
atmosphere really thick really soupy
 

17319
05:08:16,080 --> 05:08:18,830
atmosphere really thick really soupy
it's um it's and a lot more gravity so

17320
05:08:18,830 --> 05:08:18,840
it's um it's and a lot more gravity so
 

17321
05:08:18,840 --> 05:08:20,510
it's um it's and a lot more gravity so
it's just really really hard to get off

17322
05:08:20,510 --> 05:08:20,520
it's just really really hard to get off
 

17323
05:08:20,520 --> 05:08:21,410
it's just really really hard to get off
of

17324
05:08:21,410 --> 05:08:21,420
of
 

17325
05:08:21,420 --> 05:08:23,150
of
um it's easy relatively easy to land on

17326
05:08:23,150 --> 05:08:23,160
um it's easy relatively easy to land on
 

17327
05:08:23,160 --> 05:08:24,410
um it's easy relatively easy to land on
Eve but like that's kind of like the

17328
05:08:24,410 --> 05:08:24,420
Eve but like that's kind of like the
 

17329
05:08:24,420 --> 05:08:25,850
Eve but like that's kind of like the
ultimate boss in the game it's like

17330
05:08:25,850 --> 05:08:25,860
ultimate boss in the game it's like
 

17331
05:08:25,860 --> 05:08:27,350
ultimate boss in the game it's like
getting off of Eve so that's one of my

17332
05:08:27,350 --> 05:08:27,360
getting off of Eve so that's one of my
 

17333
05:08:27,360 --> 05:08:29,330
getting off of Eve so that's one of my
favorite things to do is build these

17334
05:08:29,330 --> 05:08:29,340
favorite things to do is build these
 

17335
05:08:29,340 --> 05:08:31,490
favorite things to do is build these
crafts to to get to even and try to

17336
05:08:31,490 --> 05:08:31,500
crafts to to get to even and try to
 

17337
05:08:31,500 --> 05:08:33,590
crafts to to get to even and try to
return home you mentioned that there's

17338
