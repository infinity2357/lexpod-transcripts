00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,830
the most important of which of course is
love

174
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
love
 

175
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,990
love
this is the lex friedman podcast and

176
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
this is the lex friedman podcast and
 

177
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,509
this is the lex friedman podcast and
here is my conversation

178
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
here is my conversation
 

179
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,670
here is my conversation
with jeff hawkins we previously

180
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
with jeff hawkins we previously
 

181
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,830
with jeff hawkins we previously
talked over two years ago do you think

182
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
talked over two years ago do you think
 

183
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,750
talked over two years ago do you think
there's still neurons in your brain

184
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
there's still neurons in your brain
 

185
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,390
there's still neurons in your brain
that uh remember that conversation that

186
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
that uh remember that conversation that
 

187
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,430
that uh remember that conversation that
uh remember me

188
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
uh remember me
 

189
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,190
uh remember me
and got excited like there's a lex

190
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
and got excited like there's a lex
 

191
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,790
and got excited like there's a lex
neuron in your brain that just like

192
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
neuron in your brain that just like
 

193
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,229
neuron in your brain that just like
finally has a purpose

194
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
finally has a purpose
 

195
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,149
finally has a purpose
i do remember our conversation or i have

196
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
i do remember our conversation or i have
 

197
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,509
i do remember our conversation or i have
some memories of it

198
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
some memories of it
 

199
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,910
some memories of it
and i formed additional memories of you

200
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
and i formed additional memories of you
 

201
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,270
and i formed additional memories of you
in the meantime

202
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
in the meantime
 

203
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,830
in the meantime
um i wouldn't say there's a neuron or a

204
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
um i wouldn't say there's a neuron or a
 

205
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,430
um i wouldn't say there's a neuron or a
neurons in my brain that know you

206
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
neurons in my brain that know you
 

207
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,229
neurons in my brain that know you
there are synapses in my brain that have

208
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
there are synapses in my brain that have
 

209
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,110
there are synapses in my brain that have
formed

210
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
formed
 

211
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,670
formed
that reflect my knowledge of you and the

212
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
that reflect my knowledge of you and the
 

213
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,070
that reflect my knowledge of you and the
model i have of you in the world and

214
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
model i have of you in the world and
 

215
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,830
model i have of you in the world and
whether the exact same synapses were

216
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
whether the exact same synapses were
 

217
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,270
whether the exact same synapses were
formed two years ago it's hard to say

218
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
formed two years ago it's hard to say
 

219
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,630
formed two years ago it's hard to say
because these things come and go all the

220
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
because these things come and go all the
 

221
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,910
because these things come and go all the
time but

222
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
time but
 

223
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,509
time but
we know from one thing to know about

224
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
we know from one thing to know about
 

225
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,270
we know from one thing to know about
brains is that when you think of things

226
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
brains is that when you think of things
 

227
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,630
brains is that when you think of things
you often erase the memory and rewrite

228
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
you often erase the memory and rewrite
 

229
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,750
you often erase the memory and rewrite
it again so

230
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
it again so
 

231
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,350
it again so
yes but i have a memory of you and i

232
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
yes but i have a memory of you and i
 

233
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,070
yes but i have a memory of you and i
have that's instantiated in synapses

234
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
have that's instantiated in synapses
 

235
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,429
have that's instantiated in synapses
there's a simpler way to think about it

236
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
there's a simpler way to think about it
 

237
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,229
there's a simpler way to think about it
like so you have we have a model

238
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
like so you have we have a model
 

239
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,309
like so you have we have a model
of the world in your head and that model

240
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
of the world in your head and that model
 

241
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,390
of the world in your head and that model
is continually being updated

242
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
is continually being updated
 

243
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,309
is continually being updated
i updated this morning you offered me

244
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
i updated this morning you offered me
 

245
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,070
i updated this morning you offered me
this water you said it was from the

246
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
this water you said it was from the
 

247
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,190
this water you said it was from the
refrigerator

248
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
refrigerator
 

249
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,910
refrigerator
i remember these things and so we and so

250
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
i remember these things and so we and so
 

251
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,750
i remember these things and so we and so
the model includes where we live the

252
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
the model includes where we live the
 

253
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,589
the model includes where we live the
places we know the words the

254
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
places we know the words the
 

255
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,350
places we know the words the
objects in the world it's a monstrous

256
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
objects in the world it's a monstrous
 

257
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,430
objects in the world it's a monstrous
model and it's constantly being updated

258
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
model and it's constantly being updated
 

259
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,349
model and it's constantly being updated
and people are just part of that model

260
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
and people are just part of that model
 

261
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,189
and people are just part of that model
so we're animals or other physical

262
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
so we're animals or other physical
 

263
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,069
so we're animals or other physical
objects

264
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
objects
 

265
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,909
objects
so our events we've done so um

266
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
so our events we've done so um
 

267
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,749
so our events we've done so um
it's there's no special in my mind

268
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
it's there's no special in my mind
 

269
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,749
it's there's no special in my mind
special place for the memories of humans

270
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
special place for the memories of humans
 

271
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,629
special place for the memories of humans
i mean

272
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
i mean
 

273
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,189
i mean
obviously i know you know i know a lot

274
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
obviously i know you know i know a lot
 

275
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,469
obviously i know you know i know a lot
about my wife

276
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
about my wife
 

277
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,150
about my wife
um but and friends uh and so on but

278
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
um but and friends uh and so on but
 

279
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,629
um but and friends uh and so on but
it's not like a special place for humans

280
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
it's not like a special place for humans
 

281
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,030
it's not like a special place for humans
over here but we model everything and we

282
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
over here but we model everything and we
 

283
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,950
over here but we model everything and we
model other people's behaviors too so if

284
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
model other people's behaviors too so if
 

285
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,150
model other people's behaviors too so if
i said you're a

286
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
i said you're a
 

287
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,670
i said you're a
copy of your mind in my mind it's just

288
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
copy of your mind in my mind it's just
 

289
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,510
copy of your mind in my mind it's just
because i know how humans

290
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
because i know how humans
 

291
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,390
because i know how humans
i've learned how humans behave and um

292
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
i've learned how humans behave and um
 

293
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,629
i've learned how humans behave and um
and i've learned some things about you

294
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
and i've learned some things about you
 

295
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,510
and i've learned some things about you
and that's part of my world model well i

296
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
and that's part of my world model well i
 

297
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,189
and that's part of my world model well i
just also mean

298
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
just also mean
 

299
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,110
just also mean
the collective intelligence of the human

300
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
the collective intelligence of the human
 

301
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,310
the collective intelligence of the human
species

302
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
species
 

303
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,670
species
i wonder if there's something

304
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
i wonder if there's something
 

305
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,909
i wonder if there's something
fundamental to the brain that enables

306
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
fundamental to the brain that enables
 

307
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,230
fundamental to the brain that enables
that so modeling other humans with their

308
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
that so modeling other humans with their
 

309
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,150
that so modeling other humans with their
ideas

310
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
ideas
 

311
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,430
ideas
you're actually jumping into a lot of

312
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
you're actually jumping into a lot of
 

313
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,189
you're actually jumping into a lot of
big topics like collective intelligence

314
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
big topics like collective intelligence
 

315
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,710
big topics like collective intelligence
is a separate topic that a lot of people

316
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
is a separate topic that a lot of people
 

317
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,990
is a separate topic that a lot of people
like to talk about we can talk about

318
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
like to talk about we can talk about
 

319
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,550
like to talk about we can talk about
that

320
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
that
 

321
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,070
that
uh but um and so that's interesting like

322
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
uh but um and so that's interesting like
 

323
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,749
uh but um and so that's interesting like
you know we're not just individuals we

324
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
you know we're not just individuals we
 

325
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,909
you know we're not just individuals we
live in society and so on

326
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
live in society and so on
 

327
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,310
live in society and so on
but from our research point of view and

328
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
but from our research point of view and
 

329
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,749
but from our research point of view and
so again let's just talk

330
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
so again let's just talk
 

331
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,670
so again let's just talk
we study the neocortex it's a sheet of

332
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
we study the neocortex it's a sheet of
 

333
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,670
we study the neocortex it's a sheet of
neural tissue it's about 75

334
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
neural tissue it's about 75
 

335
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,390
neural tissue it's about 75
of your brain it runs on this very

336
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
of your brain it runs on this very
 

337
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,590
of your brain it runs on this very
repetitive algorithm

338
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
repetitive algorithm
 

339
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,950
repetitive algorithm
it's a very repetitive circuit and so

340
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
it's a very repetitive circuit and so
 

341
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,590
it's a very repetitive circuit and so
you can apply that algorithm to lots of

342
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
you can apply that algorithm to lots of
 

343
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,110
you can apply that algorithm to lots of
different problems but it's all

344
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
different problems but it's all
 

345
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,230
different problems but it's all
underneath it's the same thing we're

346
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
underneath it's the same thing we're
 

347
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,749
underneath it's the same thing we're
just building this model

348
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
just building this model
 

349
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830
just building this model
so from our point of view we wouldn't

350
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
so from our point of view we wouldn't
 

351
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,830
so from our point of view we wouldn't
look for these special circuit someplace

352
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
look for these special circuit someplace
 

353
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,029
look for these special circuit someplace
buried in your brain that might be

354
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
buried in your brain that might be
 

355
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,830
buried in your brain that might be
related to

356
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
related to
 

357
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,510
related to
other you know understanding of the

358
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
other you know understanding of the
 

359
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,430
other you know understanding of the
humans it's more like

360
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
humans it's more like
 

361
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,629
humans it's more like
you know how do we build a model of

362
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
you know how do we build a model of
 

363
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,150
you know how do we build a model of
anything how do we understand anything

364
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
anything how do we understand anything
 

365
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,510
anything how do we understand anything
in the world and humans are just

366
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
in the world and humans are just
 

367
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,790
in the world and humans are just
another part of the things we understand

368
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
another part of the things we understand
 

369
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,270
another part of the things we understand
so there's nothing uh there's nothing to

370
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
so there's nothing uh there's nothing to
 

371
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,230
so there's nothing uh there's nothing to
the brain that

372
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
the brain that
 

373
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,749
the brain that
knows the emergent phenomena of

374
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
knows the emergent phenomena of
 

375
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,590
knows the emergent phenomena of
collecting the intelligence well i

376
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
collecting the intelligence well i
 

377
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,270
collecting the intelligence well i
certainly know about that i've heard the

378
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
certainly know about that i've heard the
 

379
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,390
certainly know about that i've heard the
terms i've read

380
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
terms i've read
 

381
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,749
terms i've read
no but that's right right well okay

382
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
no but that's right right well okay
 

383
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,749
no but that's right right well okay
right as an idea well i think we have

384
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
right as an idea well i think we have
 

385
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,110
right as an idea well i think we have
language which is is

386
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
language which is is
 

387
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,710
language which is is
sort of built into our brains and that's

388
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
sort of built into our brains and that's
 

389
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,110
sort of built into our brains and that's
a key part of collective intelligence so

390
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
a key part of collective intelligence so
 

391
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,590
a key part of collective intelligence so
there are some you know prior

392
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
there are some you know prior
 

393
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,110
there are some you know prior
assumptions about the world we're going

394
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
assumptions about the world we're going
 

395
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,629
assumptions about the world we're going
to live in when we're born we're not

396
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
to live in when we're born we're not
 

397
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,029
to live in when we're born we're not
just

398
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
just
 

399
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,309
just
a blank slate um and so you know did we

400
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
a blank slate um and so you know did we
 

401
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,270
a blank slate um and so you know did we
evolve

402
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
evolve
 

403
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,510
evolve
to take advantage of those situations

404
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
to take advantage of those situations
 

405
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,469
to take advantage of those situations
yes but again

406
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
yes but again
 

407
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,749
yes but again
we study only part of the brain the

408
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
we study only part of the brain the
 

409
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,110
we study only part of the brain the
neocortex there's other parts of the

410
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
neocortex there's other parts of the
 

411
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,150
neocortex there's other parts of the
brain are very much

412
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
brain are very much
 

413
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,870
brain are very much
involved in societal interactions and

414
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
involved in societal interactions and
 

415
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,469
involved in societal interactions and
human emotions and

416
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
human emotions and
 

417
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,830
human emotions and
um and how we interact and even societal

418
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
um and how we interact and even societal
 

419
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,110
um and how we interact and even societal
um

420
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
um
 

421
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,589
um
issues about you know how we are how we

422
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
issues about you know how we are how we
 

423
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,029
issues about you know how we are how we
interact with other people when we

424
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
interact with other people when we
 

425
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,309
interact with other people when we
support them when we're greedy and

426
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
support them when we're greedy and
 

427
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,390
support them when we're greedy and
things like that i mean certainly the

428
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
things like that i mean certainly the
 

429
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,270
things like that i mean certainly the
brain

430
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
brain
 

431
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,029
brain
is a great place where to study

432
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
is a great place where to study
 

433
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,870
is a great place where to study
intelligence i wonder if it's the

434
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
intelligence i wonder if it's the
 

435
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,790
intelligence i wonder if it's the
fundamental

436
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
fundamental
 

437
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,589
fundamental
uh atom of intelligence well i would say

438
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
uh atom of intelligence well i would say
 

439
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:07,909
uh atom of intelligence well i would say
it's

440
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
it's
 

441
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,589
it's
it's it's absolutely an essential

442
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
it's it's absolutely an essential
 

443
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,510
it's it's absolutely an essential
component even if you believe in

444
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
component even if you believe in
 

445
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,510
component even if you believe in
collective intelligence as

446
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
collective intelligence as
 

447
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,270
collective intelligence as
um hey that's where it's all happening

448
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
um hey that's where it's all happening
 

449
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,629
um hey that's where it's all happening
that's what we need to study which i

450
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
that's what we need to study which i
 

451
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,830
that's what we need to study which i
don't believe that by the way i think

452
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
don't believe that by the way i think
 

453
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,950
don't believe that by the way i think
it's really important but i don't think

454
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
it's really important but i don't think
 

455
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,150
it's really important but i don't think
that is the thing

456
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
that is the thing
 

457
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,270
that is the thing
um but even if you do believe that then

458
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
um but even if you do believe that then
 

459
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,430
um but even if you do believe that then
you have to understand how the brain

460
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
you have to understand how the brain
 

461
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,870
you have to understand how the brain
works in doing that

462
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
works in doing that
 

463
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,029
works in doing that
um it's you know it's more like we are

464
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
um it's you know it's more like we are
 

465
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,990
um it's you know it's more like we are
intelligent and

466
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
intelligent and
 

467
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
intelligent and
we are intelligent individuals and

468
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
we are intelligent individuals and
 

469
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,749
we are intelligent individuals and
together we are much more magnified our

470
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
together we are much more magnified our
 

471
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,110
together we are much more magnified our
intelligence we can do things that we

472
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
intelligence we can do things that we
 

473
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,550
intelligence we can do things that we
couldn't do individually

474
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
couldn't do individually
 

475
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,070
couldn't do individually
but even as individuals we're pretty

476
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
but even as individuals we're pretty
 

477
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,589
but even as individuals we're pretty
damn smart and

478
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
damn smart and
 

479
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,189
damn smart and
we can model things and understand the

480
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
we can model things and understand the
 

481
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,950
we can model things and understand the
world and interact with it

482
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
world and interact with it
 

483
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,790
world and interact with it
so um to me if you're going to start

484
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
so um to me if you're going to start
 

485
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,309
so um to me if you're going to start
some place you need to start

486
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
some place you need to start
 

487
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,390
some place you need to start
with the brain then you could say well

488
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
with the brain then you could say well
 

489
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,070
with the brain then you could say well
how do brains interact with each other

490
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
how do brains interact with each other
 

491
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,629
how do brains interact with each other
and what is the nature of language and

492
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
and what is the nature of language and
 

493
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,430
and what is the nature of language and
how do we

494
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
how do we
 

495
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,950
how do we
share models that i've learned something

496
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
share models that i've learned something
 

497
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,230
share models that i've learned something
about the world how do i share it with

498
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
about the world how do i share it with
 

499
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,550
about the world how do i share it with
you which is really what you know

500
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
you which is really what you know
 

501
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,309
you which is really what you know
sort of communal intelligence is i know

502
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
sort of communal intelligence is i know
 

503
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,150
sort of communal intelligence is i know
something you know something

504
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
something you know something
 

505
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,510
something you know something
we've had different experiences in the

506
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
we've had different experiences in the
 

507
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,110
we've had different experiences in the
world i've learned something about

508
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
world i've learned something about
 

509
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,629
world i've learned something about
brains maybe i can impart that to you

510
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
brains maybe i can impart that to you
 

511
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,670
brains maybe i can impart that to you
you've learned something about

512
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
you've learned something about
 

513
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,350
you've learned something about
you know whatever physics and you can

514
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
you know whatever physics and you can
 

515
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,670
you know whatever physics and you can
part that to me

516
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
part that to me
 

517
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,309
part that to me
but it also comes down to even just the

518
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
but it also comes down to even just the
 

519
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,830
but it also comes down to even just the
epistemological question of

520
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
epistemological question of
 

521
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,189
epistemological question of
well what is knowledge and how do you

522
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
well what is knowledge and how do you
 

523
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,110
well what is knowledge and how do you
represent it in the brain right

524
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
represent it in the brain right
 

525
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,029
represent it in the brain right
and it's not that's where it's going to

526
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
and it's not that's where it's going to
 

527
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,270
and it's not that's where it's going to
reside right or in our writings

528
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
reside right or in our writings
 

529
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,909
reside right or in our writings
it's obvious that human collaboration

530
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
it's obvious that human collaboration
 

531
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,270
it's obvious that human collaboration
human interaction

532
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
human interaction
 

533
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,070
human interaction
is how we build societies right but some

534
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
is how we build societies right but some
 

535
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,270
is how we build societies right but some
of the things you

536
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
of the things you
 

537
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,550
of the things you
talk about and work on

538
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
talk about and work on
 

539
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,790
talk about and work on
some of those elements of what makes up

540
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
some of those elements of what makes up
 

541
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,750
some of those elements of what makes up
an intelligent

542
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
an intelligent
 

543
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,550
an intelligent
entity is there with a single person oh

544
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
entity is there with a single person oh
 

545
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,509
entity is there with a single person oh
absolutely i mean

546
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
absolutely i mean
 

547
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,509
absolutely i mean
it'd be we can't deny that the brain is

548
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
it'd be we can't deny that the brain is
 

549
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,430
it'd be we can't deny that the brain is
the core element here in

550
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
the core element here in
 

551
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,030
the core element here in
in uh at least i can't i think it's

552
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
in uh at least i can't i think it's
 

553
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,190
in uh at least i can't i think it's
obvious the brain is the core element in

554
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
obvious the brain is the core element in
 

555
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,870
obvious the brain is the core element in
all theories of intelligence

556
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
all theories of intelligence
 

557
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,630
all theories of intelligence
uh it's where knowledge is represented

558
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
uh it's where knowledge is represented
 

559
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,110
uh it's where knowledge is represented
it's where knowledge is created

560
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
it's where knowledge is created
 

561
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,829
it's where knowledge is created
we interact we share we build upon each

562
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
we interact we share we build upon each
 

563
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,710
we interact we share we build upon each
other's work

564
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
other's work
 

565
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,870
other's work
but uh without a brain you'd have

566
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
but uh without a brain you'd have
 

567
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,470
but uh without a brain you'd have
nothing you know there would be no

568
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
nothing you know there would be no
 

569
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,910
nothing you know there would be no
intelligence without brains

570
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
intelligence without brains
 

571
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,110
intelligence without brains
and so um so that's where we start

572
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
and so um so that's where we start
 

573
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,870
and so um so that's where we start
i got into this field because i just was

574
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
i got into this field because i just was
 

575
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,630
i got into this field because i just was
curious as to who i am

576
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
curious as to who i am
 

577
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,230
curious as to who i am
you know how you know how do i think

578
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
you know how you know how do i think
 

579
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,670
you know how you know how do i think
what's going on in my head when i'm

580
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
what's going on in my head when i'm
 

581
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,190
what's going on in my head when i'm
what i'm thinking what does it mean to

582
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
what i'm thinking what does it mean to
 

583
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,269
what i'm thinking what does it mean to
know something you know i can ask what

584
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
know something you know i can ask what
 

585
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,470
know something you know i can ask what
it means for me to know something

586
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
it means for me to know something
 

587
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,550
it means for me to know something
independent of how i learned it from

588
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
independent of how i learned it from
 

589
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,790
independent of how i learned it from
you or from someone else or from society

590
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
you or from someone else or from society
 

591
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,389
you or from someone else or from society
so what does it mean for me to know that

592
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
so what does it mean for me to know that
 

593
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,910
so what does it mean for me to know that
i have a model of you in my head what

594
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
i have a model of you in my head what
 

595
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,110
i have a model of you in my head what
does it mean to know i know what this

596
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
does it mean to know i know what this
 

597
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,470
does it mean to know i know what this
microphone does and how it works

598
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
microphone does and how it works
 

599
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,750
microphone does and how it works
physically even though i can't see it

600
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
physically even though i can't see it
 

601
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,190
physically even though i can't see it
right now

602
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
right now
 

603
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,590
right now
how do i know that what does it mean how

604
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
how do i know that what does it mean how
 

605
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,030
how do i know that what does it mean how
the neurons do that at the

606
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
the neurons do that at the
 

607
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,310
the neurons do that at the
fundamental level of neurons and

608
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
fundamental level of neurons and
 

609
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,389
fundamental level of neurons and
synapses and so on those are

610
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
synapses and so on those are
 

611
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,110
synapses and so on those are
really fascinating questions and uh i'm

612
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
really fascinating questions and uh i'm
 

613
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,070
really fascinating questions and uh i'm
happy to

614
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
happy to
 

615
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
happy to
be just happy to understand those if i

616
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
be just happy to understand those if i
 

617
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,470
be just happy to understand those if i
could

618
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480

 

619
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,630

so in your um in your new book

620
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
so in your um in your new book
 

621
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,190
so in your um in your new book
you talk about our brain our mind as

622
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
you talk about our brain our mind as
 

623
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,670
you talk about our brain our mind as
being made up of many brains

624
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
being made up of many brains
 

625
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,509
being made up of many brains
uh so the book is called the thousand

626
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
uh so the book is called the thousand
 

627
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,670
uh so the book is called the thousand
brains a thousand brain theory of

628
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
brains a thousand brain theory of
 

629
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,190
brains a thousand brain theory of
intelligence what is the key idea of

630
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
intelligence what is the key idea of
 

631
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,389
intelligence what is the key idea of
this book

632
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
this book
 

633
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,670
this book
uh the book has three sections

634
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
uh the book has three sections
 

635
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,389
uh the book has three sections
and it has sort of maybe three big ideas

636
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
and it has sort of maybe three big ideas
 

637
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,910
and it has sort of maybe three big ideas
so the first section is all about what

638
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
so the first section is all about what
 

639
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,350
so the first section is all about what
we've learned about the neurocortex and

640
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
we've learned about the neurocortex and
 

641
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,110
we've learned about the neurocortex and
that's the thousand brains theory

642
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
that's the thousand brains theory
 

643
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,630
that's the thousand brains theory
just did we complete the picture the

644
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
just did we complete the picture the
 

645
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,990
just did we complete the picture the
second section is all about ai and the

646
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
second section is all about ai and the
 

647
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,030
second section is all about ai and the
third section is about the future of

648
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
third section is about the future of
 

649
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,110
third section is about the future of
humanity

650
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
humanity
 

651
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,230
humanity
so the thousand brains theory

652
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
so the thousand brains theory
 

653
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,509
so the thousand brains theory
the the big idea there if i had to

654
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
the the big idea there if i had to
 

655
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,790
the the big idea there if i had to
summarize into one big idea

656
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
summarize into one big idea
 

657
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,110
summarize into one big idea
is that we think of the the brain the

658
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
is that we think of the the brain the
 

659
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,710
is that we think of the the brain the
neocortex is learning this model of the

660
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
neocortex is learning this model of the
 

661
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,430
neocortex is learning this model of the
world

662
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
world
 

663
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,590
world
but what we learned is actually there's

664
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
but what we learned is actually there's
 

665
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,430
but what we learned is actually there's
tens of thousands of independent

666
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
tens of thousands of independent
 

667
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,069
tens of thousands of independent
modeling systems going on and so each

668
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
modeling systems going on and so each
 

669
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,750
modeling systems going on and so each
what we call a column in the cortex is

670
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
what we call a column in the cortex is
 

671
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,630
what we call a column in the cortex is
about 150

672
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
about 150
 

673
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,550
about 150
000 of them is a complete modeling

674
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
000 of them is a complete modeling
 

675
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,310
000 of them is a complete modeling
system so

676
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
system so
 

677
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,829
system so
it's a collective intelligence in your

678
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
it's a collective intelligence in your
 

679
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,750
it's a collective intelligence in your
head in some sense so the thousand

680
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
head in some sense so the thousand
 

681
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,710
head in some sense so the thousand
brains theory says

682
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
brains theory says
 

683
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,710
brains theory says
well where do i have knowledge about you

684
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
well where do i have knowledge about you
 

685
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,389
well where do i have knowledge about you
know this coffee cup where is the model

686
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
know this coffee cup where is the model
 

687
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:54,870
know this coffee cup where is the model
of this

688
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
of this
 

689
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,110
of this
cell phone it's not in one place it's in

690
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
cell phone it's not in one place it's in
 

691
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,550
cell phone it's not in one place it's in
thousands of separate models that are

692
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
thousands of separate models that are
 

693
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,990
thousands of separate models that are
complementary and they communicate

694
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
complementary and they communicate
 

695
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,829
complementary and they communicate
with each other through voting so this

696
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
with each other through voting so this
 

697
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,829
with each other through voting so this
idea that we have we feel like we're one

698
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
idea that we have we feel like we're one
 

699
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,949
idea that we have we feel like we're one
person

700
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
person
 

701
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,310
person
you know that's our experience we can

702
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
you know that's our experience we can
 

703
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,310
you know that's our experience we can
explain that but reality there's

704
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
explain that but reality there's
 

705
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,150
explain that but reality there's
lots of these like almost like little

706
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
lots of these like almost like little
 

707
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,670
lots of these like almost like little
brands like but they're

708
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
brands like but they're
 

709
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,670
brands like but they're
they're sophisticated modeling systems

710
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
they're sophisticated modeling systems
 

711
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,829
they're sophisticated modeling systems
about 150 000 of them in each of

712
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
about 150 000 of them in each of
 

713
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,230
about 150 000 of them in each of
the human brain and that's a totally

714
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
the human brain and that's a totally
 

715
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,750
the human brain and that's a totally
different way of thinking about

716
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
different way of thinking about
 

717
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,829
different way of thinking about
how the neural cortex is structured than

718
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
how the neural cortex is structured than
 

719
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,509
how the neural cortex is structured than
we or anyone else thought of even just

720
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
we or anyone else thought of even just
 

721
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,030
we or anyone else thought of even just
five years ago

722
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
five years ago
 

723
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,590
five years ago
so you mentioned you started this

724
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
so you mentioned you started this
 

725
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,550
so you mentioned you started this
journey

726
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
journey
 

727
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,389
journey
and just looking in the mirror trying to

728
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
and just looking in the mirror trying to
 

729
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,829
and just looking in the mirror trying to
understand who you are

730
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
understand who you are
 

731
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,030
understand who you are
so if you have many brains who are you

732
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
so if you have many brains who are you
 

733
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,829
so if you have many brains who are you
then

734
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
then
 

735
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,590
then
so it's interesting we have a singular

736
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
so it's interesting we have a singular
 

737
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,190
so it's interesting we have a singular
perception right you know we think oh

738
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
perception right you know we think oh
 

739
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,750
perception right you know we think oh
i'm just

740
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
i'm just
 

741
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,509
i'm just
here i'm looking at you but it's it's

742
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
here i'm looking at you but it's it's
 

743
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,710
here i'm looking at you but it's it's
composed of all these things like

744
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
composed of all these things like
 

745
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,829
composed of all these things like
there's sounds and there's

746
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
there's sounds and there's
 

747
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,910
there's sounds and there's
and there's uh this vision and there's

748
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
and there's uh this vision and there's
 

749
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,110
and there's uh this vision and there's
touch and

750
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
touch and
 

751
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,389
touch and
all kinds of inputs yeah we have the

752
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
all kinds of inputs yeah we have the
 

753
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,069
all kinds of inputs yeah we have the
singular perception and what the

754
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
singular perception and what the
 

755
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,590
singular perception and what the
thousand brain theory says we have these

756
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
thousand brain theory says we have these
 

757
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,949
thousand brain theory says we have these
models that are visual models we have a

758
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
models that are visual models we have a
 

759
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,550
models that are visual models we have a
lot of models of auditory models models

760
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
lot of models of auditory models models
 

761
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,150
lot of models of auditory models models
of toxin models and so on

762
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
of toxin models and so on
 

763
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,430
of toxin models and so on
but they vote and so um they send in the

764
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
but they vote and so um they send in the
 

765
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,670
but they vote and so um they send in the
cortex you can think about these columns

766
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
cortex you can think about these columns
 

767
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,190
cortex you can think about these columns
as that like little grains of

768
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
as that like little grains of
 

769
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,389
as that like little grains of
rice 150 000 stacked next to each other

770
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
rice 150 000 stacked next to each other
 

771
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,629
rice 150 000 stacked next to each other
and each one is its own little modeling

772
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
and each one is its own little modeling
 

773
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,590
and each one is its own little modeling
system

774
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
system
 

775
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,710
system
but they have these long-range

776
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
but they have these long-range
 

777
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,629
but they have these long-range
connections that go between them

778
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
connections that go between them
 

779
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,030
connections that go between them
and we call those voting connections or

780
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
and we call those voting connections or
 

781
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,310
and we call those voting connections or
voting neurons

782
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
voting neurons
 

783
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,829
voting neurons
um and so the different columns

784
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
um and so the different columns
 

785
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,509
um and so the different columns
try to reach the consensus like what am

786
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
try to reach the consensus like what am
 

787
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,949
try to reach the consensus like what am
i looking at okay you know

788
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
i looking at okay you know
 

789
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,470
i looking at okay you know
each one has some ambiguity but they

790
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
each one has some ambiguity but they
 

791
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,150
each one has some ambiguity but they
come to a consensus oh there's a water

792
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
come to a consensus oh there's a water
 

793
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,910
come to a consensus oh there's a water
bottle i'm looking at

794
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
bottle i'm looking at
 

795
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,629
bottle i'm looking at
um we are only consciously able to

796
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
um we are only consciously able to
 

797
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,990
um we are only consciously able to
perceive the voting

798
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
perceive the voting
 

799
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,430
perceive the voting
we're not able to perceive anything that

800
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
we're not able to perceive anything that
 

801
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,350
we're not able to perceive anything that
goes on under the hood

802
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
goes on under the hood
 

803
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,230
goes on under the hood
so the voting is what we're we're aware

804
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
so the voting is what we're we're aware
 

805
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,870
so the voting is what we're we're aware
of

806
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
of
 

807
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,150
of
the results of the vote yeah the

808
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
the results of the vote yeah the
 

809
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,829
the results of the vote yeah the
velocity well it's it's you can imagine

810
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
velocity well it's it's you can imagine
 

811
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,470
velocity well it's it's you can imagine
it this way

812
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
it this way
 

813
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,590
it this way
we were just talking about eye movements

814
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
we were just talking about eye movements
 

815
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,269
we were just talking about eye movements
a moment ago so as i'm looking at

816
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
a moment ago so as i'm looking at
 

817
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,710
a moment ago so as i'm looking at
something my eyes are moving about three

818
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
something my eyes are moving about three
 

819
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,910
something my eyes are moving about three
times a second

820
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
times a second
 

821
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,230
times a second
and with each movement a completely new

822
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
and with each movement a completely new
 

823
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,829
and with each movement a completely new
input is coming into the brain it's not

824
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
input is coming into the brain it's not
 

825
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,350
input is coming into the brain it's not
repetitive it's not shifting it around

826
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
repetitive it's not shifting it around
 

827
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,470
repetitive it's not shifting it around
it's completely new

828
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
it's completely new
 

829
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,389
it's completely new
i'm totally unaware of it i can't

830
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
i'm totally unaware of it i can't
 

831
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,310
i'm totally unaware of it i can't
perceive it but yet if i looked at the

832
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
perceive it but yet if i looked at the
 

833
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,509
perceive it but yet if i looked at the
neurons in your brain they're going on

834
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
neurons in your brain they're going on
 

835
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,949
neurons in your brain they're going on
and off i don't know

836
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
and off i don't know
 

837
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,190
and off i don't know
but the voting neurons are not the

838
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
but the voting neurons are not the
 

839
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,389
but the voting neurons are not the
voting neurons are saying you know

840
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
voting neurons are saying you know
 

841
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,590
voting neurons are saying you know
we all agree even though i'm looking at

842
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
we all agree even though i'm looking at
 

843
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,710
we all agree even though i'm looking at
different parts of this is a water

844
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
different parts of this is a water
 

845
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,829
different parts of this is a water
bottle right now

846
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
bottle right now
 

847
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,150
bottle right now
and that's not changing and it's in some

848
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
and that's not changing and it's in some
 

849
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,030
and that's not changing and it's in some
position and

850
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
position and
 

851
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,509
position and
and pose relative to me so i have this

852
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
and pose relative to me so i have this
 

853
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,949
and pose relative to me so i have this
perception of the water bottle about two

854
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
perception of the water bottle about two
 

855
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,310
perception of the water bottle about two
feet away from me at a certain pose to

856
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
feet away from me at a certain pose to
 

857
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,110
feet away from me at a certain pose to
me

858
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
me
 

859
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,269
me
um that is not changing that's the only

860
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
um that is not changing that's the only
 

861
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,790
um that is not changing that's the only
part i'm aware of i can't be aware of

862
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
part i'm aware of i can't be aware of
 

863
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,990
part i'm aware of i can't be aware of
the fact that the inputs

864
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
the fact that the inputs
 

865
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,590
the fact that the inputs
from the eyes are moving and changing

866
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
from the eyes are moving and changing
 

867
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,030
from the eyes are moving and changing
and all this others happening

868
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
and all this others happening
 

869
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,910
and all this others happening
so these long range connections are the

870
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
so these long range connections are the
 

871
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,590
so these long range connections are the
part we can be conscious of

872
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
part we can be conscious of
 

873
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,629
part we can be conscious of
the individual activity in each column

874
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
the individual activity in each column
 

875
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,710
the individual activity in each column
is doesn't go anywhere else it doesn't

876
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
is doesn't go anywhere else it doesn't
 

877
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,550
is doesn't go anywhere else it doesn't
get shared anywhere else it doesn't

878
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
get shared anywhere else it doesn't
 

879
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,310
get shared anywhere else it doesn't
there's no way to extract it

880
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
there's no way to extract it
 

881
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,790
there's no way to extract it
and talk about it or extract it and even

882
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
and talk about it or extract it and even
 

883
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,389
and talk about it or extract it and even
remember it to say oh

884
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399
remember it to say oh
 

885
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,590
remember it to say oh
yes i can recall that um so but these

886
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
yes i can recall that um so but these
 

887
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,870
yes i can recall that um so but these
long-range connections are the things

888
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
long-range connections are the things
 

889
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,790
long-range connections are the things
that are accessible to language

890
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
that are accessible to language
 

891
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,470
that are accessible to language
and to our you know it's like the

892
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
and to our you know it's like the
 

893
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,550
and to our you know it's like the
hippocampus or our memories you know

894
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
hippocampus or our memories you know
 

895
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,790
hippocampus or our memories you know
our short-term memory systems and so on

896
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
our short-term memory systems and so on
 

897
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,629
our short-term memory systems and so on
so we're not aware of

898
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
so we're not aware of
 

899
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,990
so we're not aware of
95 or maybe it's even 98 of what's going

900
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
95 or maybe it's even 98 of what's going
 

901
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,590
95 or maybe it's even 98 of what's going
on in your brain

902
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
on in your brain
 

903
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,829
on in your brain
we're only aware of this sort of stable

904
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
we're only aware of this sort of stable
 

905
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,509
we're only aware of this sort of stable
somewhat stable

906
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
somewhat stable

voting outcome of all these things that

908
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
voting outcome of all these things that
 

909
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,990
voting outcome of all these things that
are going on underneath the hood

910
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
are going on underneath the hood
 

911
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,069
are going on underneath the hood
so what would you say is the basic

912
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
so what would you say is the basic
 

913
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,829
so what would you say is the basic

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
when you think about it
 

923
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,350
when you think about it
is it the individual brains and then

924
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
is it the individual brains and then
 

925
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,470
is it the individual brains and then
what is a brain

what is a brain
 

927
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,230
what is a brain
well let's let's can we just talk about

928
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
well let's let's can we just talk about
 

929
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,829
well let's let's can we just talk about
what intelligence is first

930
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
what intelligence is first
 

931
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,269
what intelligence is first
and then and then we can talk about the

932
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
and then and then we can talk about the
 

933
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,110

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
to learn

everything you know
 

947
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,150
everything you know
to know what this is a table and that's

948
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
to know what this is a table and that's
 

949
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,670
to know what this is a table and that's
a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck

950
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck
 

951
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,710
a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck
lamp and all this

952
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
lamp and all this
 

953
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,389
lamp and all this
to know these things i have to have a

954
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
to know these things i have to have a
 

955
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,910
to know these things i have to have a
model in my head i just don't look at

956
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
model in my head i just don't look at
 

957
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,269
model in my head i just don't look at
them and go what is that

958
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
them and go what is that
 

959
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,509
them and go what is that
i already have internal representations

960
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
i already have internal representations
 

961
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,030
i already have internal representations
of these things in my head

962
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
of these things in my head
 

963
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,629
of these things in my head
and i had to learn them i wasn't born of

964
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
and i had to learn them i wasn't born of
 

965
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,310
and i had to learn them i wasn't born of
any of that knowledge

966
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
any of that knowledge
 

967
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,829
any of that knowledge
you were you know we have some lights in

968
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
you were you know we have some lights in
 

969
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,430
you were you know we have some lights in
the room here i you know that's not part

970
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
the room here i you know that's not part
 

971
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,949
the room here i you know that's not part
of my evolutionary heritage right it's

972
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
of my evolutionary heritage right it's
 

973
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,310
of my evolutionary heritage right it's
not in my genes

974
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
not in my genes
 

975
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,790
not in my genes
so um we have this incredible model and

976
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
so um we have this incredible model and
 

977
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,230
so um we have this incredible model and
the model includes not only what things

978
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
the model includes not only what things
 

979
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,829
the model includes not only what things
look like and feel like but where they

980
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
look like and feel like but where they
 

981
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,269
look like and feel like but where they
are relative to each other and how they

982
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
are relative to each other and how they
 

983
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,069
are relative to each other and how they
behave

984
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
behave
 

985
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,590
behave
i've never picked up this water bottle

986
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
i've never picked up this water bottle
 

987
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,189
i've never picked up this water bottle
before but i know that if i took my hand

988
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
before but i know that if i took my hand
 

989
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,550
before but i know that if i took my hand
on that blue thing and i turn it it'll

990
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
on that blue thing and i turn it it'll
 

991
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,990
on that blue thing and i turn it it'll
probably make a funny little sound as

992
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
probably make a funny little sound as
 

993
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,910
probably make a funny little sound as
the little plastic things detach

994
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
the little plastic things detach
 

995
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,430
the little plastic things detach
and then it'll rotate and it'll look a

996
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
and then it'll rotate and it'll look a
 

997
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,949
and then it'll rotate and it'll look a
certain way it'll come off how do i know

998
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
certain way it'll come off how do i know
 

999
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,150
certain way it'll come off how do i know
that right because i have this model in

1000
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
that right because i have this model in
 

1001
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,269
that right because i have this model in
my head

1002
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
my head
 

1003
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,430
my head
so the essence of intelligence as our

1004
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
so the essence of intelligence as our
 

1005
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,030
so the essence of intelligence as our
ability to learn a model and the more

1006
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
ability to learn a model and the more
 

1007
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,110
ability to learn a model and the more
sophisticated our model is

1008
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
sophisticated our model is
 

1009
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,829
sophisticated our model is
the smarter we are not that there is a

1010
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
the smarter we are not that there is a
 

1011
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,269
the smarter we are not that there is a
single intelligence because

1012
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
single intelligence because
 

1013
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,629
single intelligence because
you can know about you know a lot about

1014
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
you can know about you know a lot about
 

1015
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,590
you can know about you know a lot about
things that i don't know and i know

1016
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
things that i don't know and i know
 

1017
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,949
things that i don't know and i know
about things you don't know

1018
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
about things you don't know
 

1019
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,710
about things you don't know
and we can both be very smart but we

1020
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
and we can both be very smart but we
 

1021
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,150
and we can both be very smart but we
both learn the model of the world

1022
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
both learn the model of the world
 

1023
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,590
both learn the model of the world
through interacting with it

1024
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
through interacting with it
 

1025
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,509
through interacting with it
so that is the essence of intelligence

1026
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
so that is the essence of intelligence
 

1027
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,870
so that is the essence of intelligence
then we can ask ourselves what are the

1028
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
then we can ask ourselves what are the
 

1029
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,550
then we can ask ourselves what are the
mechanisms in the brain

1030
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
mechanisms in the brain
 

1031
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,069
mechanisms in the brain
that allow us to do that and what are

1032
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
that allow us to do that and what are
 

1033
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,670
that allow us to do that and what are
the mechanisms of learning not just the

1034
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
the mechanisms of learning not just the
 

1035
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,030
the mechanisms of learning not just the
neural mechanisms what is the general

1036
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
neural mechanisms what is the general
 

1037
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,790
neural mechanisms what is the general
process but how we learn a model

1038
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
process but how we learn a model
 

1039
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,389
process but how we learn a model
so that was a big insight for us it's

1040
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
so that was a big insight for us it's
 

1041
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,629
so that was a big insight for us it's
like what are the what is the actual

1042
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
like what are the what is the actual
 

1043
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,790
like what are the what is the actual
things that how do you learn this stuff

1044
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
things that how do you learn this stuff
 

1045
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,670
things that how do you learn this stuff
it turns out you have to learn it

1046
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
it turns out you have to learn it
 

1047
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,550
it turns out you have to learn it
through movement

1048
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
through movement
 

1049
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,790
through movement
um you can't learn it just by that's how

1050
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
um you can't learn it just by that's how
 

1051
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,150
um you can't learn it just by that's how
we learn we learn through movement we

1052
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
we learn we learn through movement we
 

1053
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,710
we learn we learn through movement we
learn

1054
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
learn
 

1055
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,629
learn
um so you build up this model by

1056
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
um so you build up this model by
 

1057
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,990
um so you build up this model by
observing things and touching them and

1058
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
observing things and touching them and
 

1059
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,710
observing things and touching them and
moving them and

1060
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
moving them and
 

1061
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,230
moving them and
walking around the world and so on so

1062
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
walking around the world and so on so
 

1063
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,389
walking around the world and so on so
either you move or the thing moves

1064
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
either you move or the thing moves
 

1065
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,710
either you move or the thing moves
somehow yeah you obviously can learn

1066
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
somehow yeah you obviously can learn
 

1067
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,150
somehow yeah you obviously can learn
things just by reading a book something

1068
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
things just by reading a book something
 

1069
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,790
things just by reading a book something
like that but

1070
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
like that but
 

1071
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,470
like that but
think about if i were to say oh here's a

1072
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
think about if i were to say oh here's a
 

1073
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,069
think about if i were to say oh here's a
new house yeah i want you to learn

1074
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
new house yeah i want you to learn
 

1075
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,910
new house yeah i want you to learn
you know what do you do you have to walk

1076
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
you know what do you do you have to walk
 

1077
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,509
you know what do you do you have to walk
you have to walk from room to the room

1078
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
you have to walk from room to the room
 

1079
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,030
you have to walk from room to the room
you have to open the doors

1080
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
you have to open the doors
 

1081
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,550
you have to open the doors
look around see what's on the left

1082
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
look around see what's on the left
 

1083
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,310
look around see what's on the left
what's on the right as you do this

1084
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
what's on the right as you do this
 

1085
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,910
what's on the right as you do this
you're building a model in your head

1086
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
you're building a model in your head
 

1087
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,670
you're building a model in your head
it's just that's what you're doing you

1088
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
it's just that's what you're doing you
 

1089
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,870
it's just that's what you're doing you
can't just sit there and say i'm going

1090
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
can't just sit there and say i'm going
 

1091
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,990
can't just sit there and say i'm going
gonna grock the house

1092
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
gonna grock the house
 

1093
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,910
gonna grock the house
no you know or you could you don't even

1094
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
no you know or you could you don't even
 

1095
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,870
no you know or you could you don't even
want to sit there and read some

1096
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
want to sit there and read some
 

1097
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,230
want to sit there and read some
description of it right

1098
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
description of it right
 

1099
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,670
description of it right
yeah you literally physically

1100
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
yeah you literally physically
 

1101
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,710
yeah you literally physically
interactive the same with like a

1102
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
interactive the same with like a
 

1103
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,829
interactive the same with like a
smartphone if i want to

1104
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
smartphone if i want to
 

1105
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,590
smartphone if i want to
learn a new app i touch it and i move

1106
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
learn a new app i touch it and i move
 

1107
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,350
learn a new app i touch it and i move
things around i see what happens when i

1108
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
things around i see what happens when i
 

1109
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,350
things around i see what happens when i
when i do things with it so that's the

1110
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
when i do things with it so that's the
 

1111
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,870
when i do things with it so that's the
basic way we learn in the world and by

1112
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
basic way we learn in the world and by
 

1113
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,389
basic way we learn in the world and by
the way when you say model

1114
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
the way when you say model
 

1115
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,790
the way when you say model
you mean something that can be used for

1116
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
you mean something that can be used for
 

1117
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,389
you mean something that can be used for
prediction in the future

1118
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
prediction in the future
 

1119
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,949
prediction in the future
it's it's used for prediction and for

1120
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
it's it's used for prediction and for
 

1121
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,670
it's it's used for prediction and for
behavior

1122
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
behavior
 

1123
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,550
behavior
and planning right um and does a pretty

1124
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
and planning right um and does a pretty
 

1125
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,630
and planning right um and does a pretty
good job in doing so

1126
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
good job in doing so
 

1127
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,230
good job in doing so
yeah here's the way to think about the

1128
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
yeah here's the way to think about the
 

1129
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,909
yeah here's the way to think about the
model a lot of people get hung up on

1130
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
model a lot of people get hung up on
 

1131
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,870
model a lot of people get hung up on
this so

1132
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
this so
 

1133
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,990
this so
um you can imagine an architect making a

1134
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
um you can imagine an architect making a
 

1135
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,429
um you can imagine an architect making a
model of a house

1136
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
model of a house
 

1137
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,350
model of a house
right so there's a physical model that's

1138
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
right so there's a physical model that's
 

1139
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,110
right so there's a physical model that's
small and why do they do that

1140
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
small and why do they do that
 

1141
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,789
small and why do they do that
well we do that because you can imagine

1142
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
well we do that because you can imagine
 

1143
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,909
well we do that because you can imagine
what it would look like from different

1144
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
what it would look like from different
 

1145
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,949
what it would look like from different
angles you could say okay

1146
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
angles you could say okay
 

1147
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,990
angles you could say okay
look at them here look in there and you

1148
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
look at them here look in there and you
 

1149
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,069
look at them here look in there and you
can also say well how how far to get

1150
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
can also say well how how far to get
 

1151
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,390
can also say well how how far to get
from

1152
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
from
 

1153
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,470
from
from the garage to the to the swimming

1154
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
from the garage to the to the swimming
 

1155
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,669
from the garage to the to the swimming
pool or something like that right you

1156
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
pool or something like that right you
 

1157
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,110
pool or something like that right you
can imagine looking at this you can say

1158
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
can imagine looking at this you can say
 

1159
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,070
can imagine looking at this you can say
what would be the view from this

1160
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
what would be the view from this
 

1161
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,430
what would be the view from this
location so we built these physical

1162
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
location so we built these physical
 

1163
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,470
location so we built these physical
models to let you

1164
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
models to let you
 

1165
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,549
models to let you
imagine the future and imagine that

1166
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
imagine the future and imagine that
 

1167
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,909
imagine the future and imagine that
behaviors

1168
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
behaviors

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,750
behaviors
now we can take that same model and put

1170
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
now we can take that same model and put
 

1171
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,270
now we can take that same model and put
it in a computer so we now

1172
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
it in a computer so we now
 

1173
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,750
it in a computer so we now
today they'll build models of houses and

1174
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
today they'll build models of houses and
 

1175
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,870
today they'll build models of houses and
a computer and they

1176
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
a computer and they
 

1177
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,310
a computer and they
and they do that using a set of um

1178
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
and they do that using a set of um
 

1179
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,669
and they do that using a set of um
we'll come back to this term in a moment

1180
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
we'll come back to this term in a moment
 

1181
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,190
we'll come back to this term in a moment
reference frames but eventually you

1182
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
reference frames but eventually you
 

1183
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,950
reference frames but eventually you
assign a reference frame for the house

1184
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
assign a reference frame for the house
 

1185
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,990
assign a reference frame for the house
and you assign different things for the

1186
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
and you assign different things for the
 

1187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,669
and you assign different things for the
house in different locations

1188
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
house in different locations
 

1189
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,350
house in different locations
and then the computer can generate an

1190
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
and then the computer can generate an
 

1191
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,630
and then the computer can generate an
image and say okay this is what it looks

1192
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
image and say okay this is what it looks
 

1193
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,590

that's what the model lets you do it

1246
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
that's what the model lets you do it
 

1247
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,350
that's what the model lets you do it
let's just plan the future and imagine

1248
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
let's just plan the future and imagine
 

1249
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,230
let's just plan the future and imagine
the

1250
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
the
 

1251
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,710
the
consequences of our actions prediction

1252
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
consequences of our actions prediction
 

1253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,310
consequences of our actions prediction
you asked about prediction

1254
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
you asked about prediction
 

1255
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,789
you asked about prediction
prediction is not the goal of the model

1256
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
prediction is not the goal of the model
 

1257
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,669
prediction is not the goal of the model
prediction is an inherent property of it

1258
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
prediction is an inherent property of it
 

1259
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,310
prediction is an inherent property of it
and it's how the model corrects itself

1260
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
and it's how the model corrects itself
 

1261
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,070
and it's how the model corrects itself
so prediction is fundamental to

1262
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
so prediction is fundamental to
 

1263
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,950
so prediction is fundamental to
intelligence

1264
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
intelligence
 

1265
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,590
intelligence
it's fundamental to building a model and

1266
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
it's fundamental to building a model and
 

1267
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,110
it's fundamental to building a model and
the model's intelligent

1268
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
the model's intelligent
 

1269
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,029
the model's intelligent
and let me go back and be very precise

1270
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
and let me go back and be very precise
 

1271
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,390
and let me go back and be very precise
about this prediction you can think of

1272
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
about this prediction you can think of
 

1273
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,750
about this prediction you can think of
prediction two ways one is like

1274
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
prediction two ways one is like
 

1275
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,190
prediction two ways one is like
hey what would happen if i did this

1276
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
hey what would happen if i did this
 

1277
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,270
hey what would happen if i did this
that's the type of prediction um

1278
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
that's the type of prediction um
 

1279
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,789
that's the type of prediction um
that's a key part of intelligence but

1280
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
that's a key part of intelligence but
 

1281
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,310
that's a key part of intelligence but
using predictions like oh what's this

1282
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
using predictions like oh what's this
 

1283
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,310
using predictions like oh what's this
this is this water bottle gonna feel

1284
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
this is this water bottle gonna feel
 

1285
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,510
this is this water bottle gonna feel
like when i pick it up

1286
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
like when i pick it up
 

1287
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,190
like when i pick it up
you know and that doesn't seem very

1288
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
you know and that doesn't seem very
 

1289
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,350
you know and that doesn't seem very
intelligent but the way to think one way

1290
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
intelligent but the way to think one way
 

1291
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,789
intelligent but the way to think one way
to think about intelligence prediction

1292
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
to think about intelligence prediction
 

1293
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,669
to think about intelligence prediction
is

1294
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
is
 

1295
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,909
is
it's a way for us to learn where our

1296
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
it's a way for us to learn where our
 

1297
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,110
it's a way for us to learn where our
model is wrong

1298
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
model is wrong
 

1299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,029
model is wrong
so if i picked up this water bottle and

1300
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
so if i picked up this water bottle and
 

1301
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,510
so if i picked up this water bottle and
it felt hot i'd be very surprised

1302
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
it felt hot i'd be very surprised
 

1303
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,950
it felt hot i'd be very surprised
or if i picked up was very light it

1304
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
or if i picked up was very light it
 

1305
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,950
or if i picked up was very light it
would be very i'd be surprised or

1306
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
would be very i'd be surprised or
 

1307
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,830
would be very i'd be surprised or
if i turned this top and it didn't i had

1308
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
if i turned this top and it didn't i had
 

1309
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,750
if i turned this top and it didn't i had
to turn the other way i'd be surprised

1310
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
to turn the other way i'd be surprised
 

1311
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,510
to turn the other way i'd be surprised
and so almost might have a prediction

1312
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
and so almost might have a prediction
 

1313
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,630
and so almost might have a prediction
like okay i'm gonna do it i'll drink

1314
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
like okay i'm gonna do it i'll drink
 

1315
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,190
like okay i'm gonna do it i'll drink
some water

1316
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
some water
 

1317
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,270
some water
i'm okay okay do this there it is i feel

1318
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
i'm okay okay do this there it is i feel
 

1319
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,789
i'm okay okay do this there it is i feel
opening right what if i had to turn it

1320
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
opening right what if i had to turn it
 

1321
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,390
opening right what if i had to turn it
the other way or what if it it split in

1322
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
the other way or what if it it split in
 

1323
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,870
the other way or what if it it split in
two

1324
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
two
 

1325
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,110
two
then i say oh my gosh i i misunderstood

1326
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,120
then i say oh my gosh i i misunderstood
 

1327
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,230
then i say oh my gosh i i misunderstood
this i didn't have the right model of

1328
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
this i didn't have the right model of
 

1329
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,870
this i didn't have the right model of
this thing

1330
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
this thing
 

1331
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,150
this thing
my attention would be drawn to i'll be

1332
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
my attention would be drawn to i'll be
 

1333
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,270
my attention would be drawn to i'll be
looking at it going well how the hell

1334
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
looking at it going well how the hell
 

1335
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,070
looking at it going well how the hell
did that happen

1336
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
did that happen
 

1337
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,470
did that happen
you know why did it open up that way and

1338
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
you know why did it open up that way and
 

1339
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,750
you know why did it open up that way and
i would update my model

1340
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
i would update my model
 

1341
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
i would update my model
by doing it just by looking at it and

1342
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
by doing it just by looking at it and
 

1343
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,150
by doing it just by looking at it and
playing around with that update and say

1344
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
playing around with that update and say
 

1345
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,830
playing around with that update and say
this is a new type of water bottle

1346
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
this is a new type of water bottle
 

1347
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,310
this is a new type of water bottle
but you so you're talking about sort of

1348
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:02,320
but you so you're talking about sort of
 

1349
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,950
but you so you're talking about sort of
uh

1350
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
uh
 

1351
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,110
uh
complicated things like a water bottle

1352
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
complicated things like a water bottle
 

1353
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,710
complicated things like a water bottle
but this also applies for just

1354
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
but this also applies for just
 

1355
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,909
but this also applies for just
basic vision just like seeing things

1356
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
basic vision just like seeing things
 

1357
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,390
basic vision just like seeing things
it's almost like a precondition of just

1358
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
it's almost like a precondition of just
 

1359
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,350
it's almost like a precondition of just
perceiving the world is predicting

1360
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
perceiving the world is predicting
 

1361
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,390
perceiving the world is predicting
it's just everything that you see is

1362
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
it's just everything that you see is
 

1363
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,029
it's just everything that you see is
first passed through your prediction

1364
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
first passed through your prediction
 

1365
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,750
first passed through your prediction
everything you

1366
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
everything you
 

1367
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,149
everything you
see and feel in fact this this is the

1368
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
see and feel in fact this this is the
 

1369
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,190
see and feel in fact this this is the
insight i had

1370
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
insight i had
 

1371
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,070
insight i had
uh back in the late 80s uh and excuse me

1372
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
uh back in the late 80s uh and excuse me
 

1373
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,950
uh back in the late 80s uh and excuse me
early 80s

1374
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
early 80s
 

1375
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,870
early 80s
and um another people reach the same

1376
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
and um another people reach the same
 

1377
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,230
and um another people reach the same
idea is that

1378
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
idea is that
 

1379
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,390
idea is that
every sensory input you get not just

1380
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
every sensory input you get not just
 

1381
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,669
every sensory input you get not just
vision but touch

1382
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
vision but touch
 

1383
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,310
vision but touch
and hearing you have an expectation

1384
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
and hearing you have an expectation
 

1385
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,350
and hearing you have an expectation
about it

1386
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
about it
 

1387
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,990
about it
and um a prediction sometimes you can

1388
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
and um a prediction sometimes you can
 

1389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,070
and um a prediction sometimes you can
pick very accurately sometimes you can't

1390
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
pick very accurately sometimes you can't
 

1391
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,510
pick very accurately sometimes you can't
i can't predict what next word is going

1392
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
i can't predict what next word is going
 

1393
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,029
i can't predict what next word is going
to come out of your mouth but as you

1394
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
to come out of your mouth but as you
 

1395
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:47,909
to come out of your mouth but as you
start talking about

1396
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
start talking about
 

1397
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,590
start talking about
better and better predictions and if you

1398
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
better and better predictions and if you
 

1399
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,950
better and better predictions and if you
talk about some topics i'd be very

1400
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
talk about some topics i'd be very
 

1401
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,549
talk about some topics i'd be very
surprised

1402
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
surprised
 

1403
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,070
surprised
so i have this sort of background

1404
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
so i have this sort of background
 

1405
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,990
so i have this sort of background
prediction that's going on all the time

1406
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
prediction that's going on all the time
 

1407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,590
prediction that's going on all the time
for all my senses again the way i think

1408
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
for all my senses again the way i think
 

1409
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,789
for all my senses again the way i think
about that

1410
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
about that
 

1411
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,190
about that
is this is how we learn it's it's more

1412
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
is this is how we learn it's it's more
 

1413
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,950
is this is how we learn it's it's more
about how we learn

1414
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
about how we learn
 

1415
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,710
about how we learn
it's the test of our understanding our

1416
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
it's the test of our understanding our
 

1417
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,149
it's the test of our understanding our
predictions are our test

1418
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
predictions are our test
 

1419
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,070
predictions are our test
did is this really a water bottle if it

1420
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
did is this really a water bottle if it
 

1421
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,590
did is this really a water bottle if it
is i shouldn't see

1422
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
is i shouldn't see
 

1423
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,950
is i shouldn't see
you know a little finger sticking out

1424
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
you know a little finger sticking out
 

1425
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,710
you know a little finger sticking out
the side and if i saw a little finger

1426
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
the side and if i saw a little finger
 

1427
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,669
the side and if i saw a little finger
stick and i was like what the hell is

1428
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
stick and i was like what the hell is
 

1429
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,230
stick and i was like what the hell is
going on

1430
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
going on
 

1431
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,430
going on
you know that's not normal um i mean

1432
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
you know that's not normal um i mean
 

1433
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,750
you know that's not normal um i mean
that's

1434
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
that's
 

1435
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,470
that's
fascinating that just let me linger on

1436
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
fascinating that just let me linger on
 

1437
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,669
fascinating that just let me linger on
this

1438
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
this
 

1439
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,789
this
for a second i it really honestly feels

1440
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
for a second i it really honestly feels
 

1441
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,029
for a second i it really honestly feels
that prediction is fundamental

1442
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
that prediction is fundamental
 

1443
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,510
that prediction is fundamental
to everything uh to the way our mind

1444
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
to everything uh to the way our mind
 

1445
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,070
to everything uh to the way our mind
operates

1446
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
operates
 

1447
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,430
operates
to intelligence so like it's just a

1448
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
to intelligence so like it's just a
 

1449
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,549
to intelligence so like it's just a
different way to see

1450
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
different way to see
 

1451
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,470
different way to see
intelligence which is like everything

1452
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
intelligence which is like everything
 

1453
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,830
intelligence which is like everything
starts at prediction

1454
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
starts at prediction
 

1455
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,149
starts at prediction
and prediction requires a model you

1456
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
and prediction requires a model you
 

1457
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,990
and prediction requires a model you
can't predict something unless you have

1458
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
can't predict something unless you have
 

1459
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,870
can't predict something unless you have
a model of it right but the action is

1460
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
a model of it right but the action is
 

1461
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,230
a model of it right but the action is
prediction it's like the

1462
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
prediction it's like the
 

1463
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,149
prediction it's like the
the thing the model does is prediction

1464
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
the thing the model does is prediction
 

1465
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,029
the thing the model does is prediction
and but it also yeah and you but

1466
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
and but it also yeah and you but
 

1467
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,430
and but it also yeah and you but
you can then extend it to things like uh

1468
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
you can then extend it to things like uh
 

1469
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,390
you can then extend it to things like uh
what would happen

1470
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
what would happen
 

1471
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,590
what would happen
if i took this today i went and did this

1472
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
if i took this today i went and did this
 

1473
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,870
if i took this today i went and did this
what would be like that

1474
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
what would be like that
 

1475
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,190
what would be like that
or how you can extend predictions like

1476
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
or how you can extend predictions like
 

1477
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
or how you can extend predictions like
oh i want to get a promotion at work

1478
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
oh i want to get a promotion at work
 

1479
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,350
oh i want to get a promotion at work
um what action should i take and you can

1480
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
um what action should i take and you can
 

1481
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,029
um what action should i take and you can
say if i did this i predict what might

1482
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
say if i did this i predict what might
 

1483
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,750
say if i did this i predict what might
happen if i

1484
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
happen if i
 

1485
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,270
happen if i
spoke to someone i predict what might

1486
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
spoke to someone i predict what might
 

1487
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,710
spoke to someone i predict what might
happen so it's not just low level

1488
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
happen so it's not just low level
 

1489
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,230
happen so it's not just low level
predictions yeah it's all prediction

1490
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
predictions yeah it's all prediction
 

1491
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,909
predictions yeah it's all prediction
it's all predictions like this

1492
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
it's all predictions like this
 

1493
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,669
it's all predictions like this
black box so you can ask basically any

1494
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
black box so you can ask basically any
 

1495
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,270
black box so you can ask basically any
question low level or highlight so we

1496
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
question low level or highlight so we
 

1497
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,270
question low level or highlight so we
start off with that observation it's all

1498
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
start off with that observation it's all
 

1499
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,990
start off with that observation it's all
it's like this non-stop prediction and i

1500
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
it's like this non-stop prediction and i
 

1501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,350
it's like this non-stop prediction and i
write about this in the book about

1502
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
write about this in the book about
 

1503
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,430
write about this in the book about
and then we ask how do neurons actually

1504
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
and then we ask how do neurons actually
 

1505
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,470
and then we ask how do neurons actually
make predictions

1506
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
make predictions
 

1507
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,070
make predictions
physically like what does the neuron do

1508
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
physically like what does the neuron do
 

1509
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,830
physically like what does the neuron do
when it makes a prediction and

1510
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
when it makes a prediction and
 

1511
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,909
when it makes a prediction and
um what the neural tissue does when it

1512
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
um what the neural tissue does when it
 

1513
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,510
um what the neural tissue does when it
makes predictions and then we ask what

1514
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
makes predictions and then we ask what
 

1515
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,190
makes predictions and then we ask what
are the mechanisms by how we build a

1516
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
are the mechanisms by how we build a
 

1517
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,789
are the mechanisms by how we build a
model that allows you to make prediction

1518
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
model that allows you to make prediction
 

1519
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,510
model that allows you to make prediction
so we started with prediction as sort of

1520
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
so we started with prediction as sort of
 

1521
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,350
so we started with prediction as sort of
the fundamental

1522
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
the fundamental
 

1523
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,149
the fundamental
research agenda if in some sense like

1524
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
research agenda if in some sense like
 

1525
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,830
research agenda if in some sense like
and say well we understand how the brain

1526
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
and say well we understand how the brain
 

1527
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,950
and say well we understand how the brain
makes predictions

1528
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
makes predictions
 

1529
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,230
makes predictions
we'll understand how it builds these

1530
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
we'll understand how it builds these
 

1531
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,230
we'll understand how it builds these
models and how it learns and that's core

1532
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
models and how it learns and that's core
 

1533
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,669
models and how it learns and that's core
of intelligence so it was like it was

1534
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
of intelligence so it was like it was
 

1535
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,669
of intelligence so it was like it was
the key that got us in the door

1536
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
the key that got us in the door
 

1537
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,750
the key that got us in the door
to say that is our research agenda

1538
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
to say that is our research agenda
 

1539
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,350
to say that is our research agenda
understand predictions

1540
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
understand predictions
 

1541
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,070
understand predictions
so in this whole process where does

1542
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
so in this whole process where does
 

1543
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,510
so in this whole process where does
intelligence

1544
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
intelligence
 

1545
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,870
intelligence
originate would you say so

1546
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
originate would you say so
 

1547
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,630
originate would you say so
it if we look at things that are

1548
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
it if we look at things that are
 

1549
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,950
it if we look at things that are
much less intelligent to humans and you

1550
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
much less intelligent to humans and you
 

1551
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,870
much less intelligent to humans and you
start to build up a human the process of

1552
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
start to build up a human the process of
 

1553
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,070
start to build up a human the process of
evolution

1554
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
evolution
 

1555
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,110
evolution
where is this magic thing that uh

1556
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
where is this magic thing that uh
 

1557
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,070
where is this magic thing that uh
has a prediction model or a model that's

1558
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
has a prediction model or a model that's
 

1559
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,510
has a prediction model or a model that's
able to predict

1560
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
able to predict
 

1561
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,110
able to predict
that starts to look a lot more like

1562
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
that starts to look a lot more like
 

1563
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,909
that starts to look a lot more like
intelligence is there a place where

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
get back to that place or an animal that
 

1623
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,789
get back to that place or an animal that
might

1624
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
might
 

1625
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,710
might
say oh there was a source of food

1626
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
say oh there was a source of food
 

1627
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,390
say oh there was a source of food
someplace how do i get to it or there

1628
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
someplace how do i get to it or there
 

1629
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,110
someplace how do i get to it or there
was a

1630
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
was a
 

1631
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,950
was a
danger how do i get to there was a mate

1632
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
danger how do i get to there was a mate
 

1633
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,470
danger how do i get to there was a mate
how do i get to them

1634
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
how do i get to them
 

1635
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,029
how do i get to them
um there was a big evolution advantage

1636
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
um there was a big evolution advantage
 

1637
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,870
um there was a big evolution advantage
to that so early on there was a pressure

1638
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
to that so early on there was a pressure
 

1639
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,510
to that so early on there was a pressure
to start

1640
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
to start
 

1641
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,590
to start
understanding your environment like

1642
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
understanding your environment like
 

1643
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,950
understanding your environment like
where am i

1644
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
where am i
 

1645
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,029
where am i
and where have i been and what happened

1646
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
and where have i been and what happened
 

1647
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,350
and where have i been and what happened
in those different places

1648
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
in those different places
 

1649
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,470
in those different places
so we still have this neural mechanism

1650
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
so we still have this neural mechanism
 

1651
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,590
so we still have this neural mechanism
in our brains um it's in in the in the

1652
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
in our brains um it's in in the in the
 

1653
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,269
in our brains um it's in in the in the
mammals it's in the

1654
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
mammals it's in the
 

1655
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,269
mammals it's in the
hippocampus and internal cortex these

1656
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
hippocampus and internal cortex these
 

1657
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,950
hippocampus and internal cortex these
are older parts of the brain

1658
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
are older parts of the brain
 

1659
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,149
are older parts of the brain
um and these are very well studied um

1660
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
um and these are very well studied um
 

1661
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,630
um and these are very well studied um
we build a map of the of our environment

1662
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
we build a map of the of our environment
 

1663
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,510
we build a map of the of our environment
so

1664
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
so
 

1665
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,789
so
these neurons in these parts of the

1666
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
these neurons in these parts of the
 

1667
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,789
these neurons in these parts of the
brain know where i am in this room and

1668
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
brain know where i am in this room and
 

1669
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,190
brain know where i am in this room and
where

1670
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
where
 

1671
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,669
where
the door was and things like that so a

1672
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
the door was and things like that so a
 

1673
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,390
the door was and things like that so a
lot of other

1674
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
lot of other
 

1675
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,549
lot of other
mammals have this all mammals have this

1676
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
mammals have this all mammals have this
 

1677
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,830
mammals have this all mammals have this
right and almost

1678
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
right and almost
 

1679
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,870
right and almost
any any animal that knows where it is

1680
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
any any animal that knows where it is
 

1681
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,630
any any animal that knows where it is
and get around must have some mapping

1682
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
and get around must have some mapping
 

1683
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,710
and get around must have some mapping
system must have some way of saying

1684
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
system must have some way of saying
 

1685
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,510
system must have some way of saying
i've learned a map of my environment i

1686
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
i've learned a map of my environment i
 

1687
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,029
i've learned a map of my environment i
have hummingbirds in my backyard and

1688
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
have hummingbirds in my backyard and
 

1689
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,350
have hummingbirds in my backyard and
they

1690
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
they
 

1691
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,110
they
and they go the same places all the time

1692
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
and they go the same places all the time
 

1693
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,950
and they go the same places all the time
they have to they must know where they

1694
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
they have to they must know where they
 

1695
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,310
they have to they must know where they
are they just know where they are when

1696
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
are they just know where they are when
 

1697
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,549
are they just know where they are when
they're

1698
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
they're
 

1699
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,830
they're
they're not just randomly flying around

1700
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
they're not just randomly flying around
 

1701
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,350
they're not just randomly flying around
they know they know particular flowers

1702
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
they know they know particular flowers
 

1703
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,630
they know they know particular flowers
they come back to

1704
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
they come back to
 

1705
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,830
they come back to
so we all have this and it turns out

1706
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
so we all have this and it turns out
 

1707
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,149
so we all have this and it turns out
it's

1708
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
it's
 

1709
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,190
it's
very tricky to get neurons to do this to

1710
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
very tricky to get neurons to do this to
 

1711
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,029
very tricky to get neurons to do this to
build a map of an environment it's just

1712
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
build a map of an environment it's just
 

1713
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,350
build a map of an environment it's just
and so we now know there's this these

1714
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
and so we now know there's this these
 

1715
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,029
and so we now know there's this these
famous studies that's still very active

1716
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
famous studies that's still very active
 

1717
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,750
famous studies that's still very active
about

1718
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
about
 

1719
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,430
about
place cells and grid cells and these

1720
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
place cells and grid cells and these
 

1721
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,789
place cells and grid cells and these
other types of cells in the older parts

1722
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:48,799
other types of cells in the older parts
 

1723
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,669
other types of cells in the older parts
of the brain

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:49,679
of the brain
 

1725
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,430
of the brain
and how they build these maps of the

1726
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
and how they build these maps of the
 

1727
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,350
and how they build these maps of the
world it's really clever it's obviously

been under a lot of evolutionary

1730
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
been under a lot of evolutionary
 

1731
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,310
been under a lot of evolutionary
pressure over a long period of time to

1732
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
pressure over a long period of time to
 

1733
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,750
pressure over a long period of time to
get good at this

1734
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
get good at this
 

1735
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,149
get good at this
so animals not know where they are what

1736
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
so animals not know where they are what
 

1737
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,669
so animals not know where they are what
we think has happened

1738
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
we think has happened
 

1739
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,110
we think has happened
uh and there's a lot of evidence to

1740
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
uh and there's a lot of evidence to
 

1741
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,430
uh and there's a lot of evidence to
digest this is that that mechanism we

1742
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
digest this is that that mechanism we
 

1743
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,710
digest this is that that mechanism we
learn to map

1744
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
learn to map
 

1745
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,990
learn to map
like a space is

1746
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000

was repackaged the same type of neurons

1748
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
was repackaged the same type of neurons
 

1749
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,830
was repackaged the same type of neurons
was repackaged into a more compact form

1750
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
was repackaged into a more compact form
 

1751
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,710
was repackaged into a more compact form
and that became the cortical column and

1752
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
and that became the cortical column and
 

1753
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,190
and that became the cortical column and
it was

1754
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
it was
 

1755
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,029
it was
it was in some sense genericized if

00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
it was in some sense genericized if
 

1757
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,789
it was in some sense genericized if
that's a word it was turned into a very

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
that's a word it was turned into a very
 

1759
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,470
that's a word it was turned into a very
specific thing about learning

1760
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
specific thing about learning
 

1761
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,029
specific thing about learning
maps of environments to learning maps of

your space but coffee cups and so on

1768
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
your space but coffee cups and so on
 

1769
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,510
your space but coffee cups and so on
and it got sort of repackaged

1770
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
and it got sort of repackaged
 

1771
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,510
and it got sort of repackaged
into a more compact version a more

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
into a more compact version a more
 

1773
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,269

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
and then replicate it so the reason
 

1777
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,750
and then replicate it so the reason
we're so flexible is we have a very

1778
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
we're so flexible is we have a very
 

1779
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,269
we're so flexible is we have a very
generic version of this

1780
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
generic version of this
 

1781
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,070
generic version of this
mapping algorithm and we have 150 000

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,110
mapping algorithm and we have 150 000
copies of it

1784
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
copies of it
 

1785
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,190
copies of it
sounds a lot like the progress of deep

1786
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
sounds a lot like the progress of deep
 

1787
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,470
sounds a lot like the progress of deep
learning

1788
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
learning
 

1789
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,070
learning
how so uh so take neural networks that

1790
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
how so uh so take neural networks that
 

1791
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,390
how so uh so take neural networks that
seem to work well for a specific task

1792
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
seem to work well for a specific task
 

1793
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,470
seem to work well for a specific task
compress them and multiply it

1794
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
compress them and multiply it
 

1795
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,710
compress them and multiply it
by a lot and then you just stack them on

1796
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
by a lot and then you just stack them on
 

1797
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,990
by a lot and then you just stack them on
top of it it's like the story of

1798
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
top of it it's like the story of
 

1799
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,390
top of it it's like the story of
transformers and uh yeah

1800
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
transformers and uh yeah
 

1801
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,669
transformers and uh yeah
but interesting networks they end up

1802
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
but interesting networks they end up
 

1803
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,750
but interesting networks they end up
you're replicating an element but you

1804
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
you're replicating an element but you
 

1805
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,430
you're replicating an element but you
still need the entire network to do

1806
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
still need the entire network to do
 

1807
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,990
still need the entire network to do
anything

1808
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
anything
 

1809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,950
anything
right here what what's going on each

1810
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
right here what what's going on each
 

1811
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,549
right here what what's going on each
individual element is a complete

1812
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
individual element is a complete
 

1813
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,909
individual element is a complete

1814
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
learning system
 

1815
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,590
learning system
this is why i can take a human brain cut

1816
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
this is why i can take a human brain cut
 

1817
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,070
this is why i can take a human brain cut
it in half and it still works

1818
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
it in half and it still works
 

1819
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,830
it in half and it still works
it's it's pretty amazing it's

1820
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
it's it's pretty amazing it's
 

1821
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,110
it's it's pretty amazing it's
fundamentally distributed it's

1822
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
fundamentally distributed it's
 

1823
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,470
fundamentally distributed it's
fundamentally distributed complete

1824
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
fundamentally distributed complete

modeling systems

1826
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
modeling systems
 

1827
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,310
modeling systems
so but that's that's our story we like

1828
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
so but that's that's our story we like
 

1829
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,950
so but that's that's our story we like
to tell

1830
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
to tell
 

1831
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,070
to tell
i i i would guess it's it's likely

1832
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
i i i would guess it's it's likely
 

1833
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,870
i i i would guess it's it's likely
largely right um but you know it's

1834
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
largely right um but you know it's
 

1835
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,310
largely right um but you know it's
there's a lot of evidence supporting

1836
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
there's a lot of evidence supporting
 

1837
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,590
there's a lot of evidence supporting
that story this evolutionary story

1838
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
that story this evolutionary story
 

1839
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,590
that story this evolutionary story
the thing which brought me to this idea

1840
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
the thing which brought me to this idea
 

1841
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,990
the thing which brought me to this idea
is that the human brain

1842
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
is that the human brain
 

1843
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,909
is that the human brain
got big very quickly so that that

1844
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
got big very quickly so that that
 

1845
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,230
got big very quickly so that that
led to the proposal a long time ago that

1846
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
led to the proposal a long time ago that
 

1847
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,669
led to the proposal a long time ago that
well there's this common element just

1848
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679
well there's this common element just
 

1849
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,310
well there's this common element just
instead of

1850
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320
instead of
 

1851
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,990
instead of
creating new things it just replicated

1852
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
creating new things it just replicated
 

1853
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,549
creating new things it just replicated
something we also are extremely flexible

1854
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
something we also are extremely flexible
 

1855
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,110
something we also are extremely flexible
we can learn things that we had no

1856
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
we can learn things that we had no
 

1857
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,549
we can learn things that we had no
history about right and so that tells it

1858
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
history about right and so that tells it
 

1859
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,110
history about right and so that tells it
that the

1860
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
that the
 

1861
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,110
that the
learning algorithm is very generic it's

1862
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
learning algorithm is very generic it's
 

1863
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,630
learning algorithm is very generic it's
very kind of universal

1864
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
very kind of universal
 

1865
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,870
very kind of universal
because it's it doesn't assume any prior

1866
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
because it's it doesn't assume any prior
 

1867
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,029
because it's it doesn't assume any prior
knowledge about what it's learning

1868
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
knowledge about what it's learning
 

1869
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,230
knowledge about what it's learning
and so you combine those things together

1870
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
and so you combine those things together
 

1871
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,669
and so you combine those things together
and you say okay well how did that come

1872
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
and you say okay well how did that come
 

1873
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,350
and you say okay well how did that come
about where did that universal algorithm

1874
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
about where did that universal algorithm
 

1875
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,630
about where did that universal algorithm
come from it had to come from something

1876
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
come from it had to come from something
 

1877
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,990
come from it had to come from something
that wasn't universal it came from

1878
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
that wasn't universal it came from
 

1879
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,669
that wasn't universal it came from
something that was more specific

1880
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
something that was more specific
 

1881
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,830
something that was more specific
and so anyway this led to our hypothesis

1882
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
and so anyway this led to our hypothesis
 

1883
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,590
and so anyway this led to our hypothesis
that you would find grid cells and place

1884
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
that you would find grid cells and place
 

1885
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,070
that you would find grid cells and place
cell equivalents in the neocortex

1886
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
cell equivalents in the neocortex
 

1887
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,070
cell equivalents in the neocortex
and when we first published our first

1888
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
and when we first published our first
 

1889
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,590
and when we first published our first
papers on this theory

1890
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
papers on this theory
 

1891
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,430
papers on this theory
we didn't know of evidence for that it

1892
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
we didn't know of evidence for that it
 

1893
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,710
we didn't know of evidence for that it
turns out there was some but we didn't

1894
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
turns out there was some but we didn't
 

1895
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,590
turns out there was some but we didn't
know about it

1896
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
know about it
 

1897
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,990
know about it
uh and since then um so then we became

1898
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
uh and since then um so then we became
 

1899
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,510
uh and since then um so then we became
aware of evidence for grid cells in

1900
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
aware of evidence for grid cells in
 

1901
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,630
aware of evidence for grid cells in
parts of the neural cortex

1902
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
parts of the neural cortex
 

1903
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,389
parts of the neural cortex
and then now there's been new evidence

1904
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
and then now there's been new evidence
 

1905
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,310
and then now there's been new evidence
coming out there's some

1906
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
coming out there's some
 

1907
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,430
coming out there's some
interesting papers that came out just

1908
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
interesting papers that came out just
 

1909
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,750
interesting papers that came out just
january of this year so our one of our

1910
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:57,760
january of this year so our one of our
 

1911
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,630
january of this year so our one of our
predictions was

1912
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
predictions was
 

1913
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,870
predictions was
if this evolutionary hypothesis is

1914
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
if this evolutionary hypothesis is
 

1915
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,630
if this evolutionary hypothesis is
correct we would see grid cell place

1916
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
correct we would see grid cell place
 

1917
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,230
correct we would see grid cell place
cell equivalents cells that work like

1918
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,240
cell equivalents cells that work like
 

1919
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,870
cell equivalents cells that work like
them

1920
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
them
 

1921
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,470
them
through every column in the near cortex

1922
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
through every column in the near cortex
 

1923
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,990
through every column in the near cortex
and that's starting to be seen

1924
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
and that's starting to be seen
 

1925
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,710
and that's starting to be seen
what does it mean that uh why is it

1926
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
what does it mean that uh why is it
 

1927
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,990
what does it mean that uh why is it
important that they're present

1928
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
important that they're present
 

1929
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
important that they're present
because it tells us well we're asking

1930
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
because it tells us well we're asking
 

1931
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,950
because it tells us well we're asking
about the evolutionary origin of

1932
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
about the evolutionary origin of
 

1933
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,070
about the evolutionary origin of
intelligence right

1934
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
intelligence right
 

1935
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,470
intelligence right
so our theory is that these columns in

1936
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
so our theory is that these columns in
 

1937
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,669
so our theory is that these columns in
the cortex

1938
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
the cortex
 

1939
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,710
the cortex
are working on the same principles

1940
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
are working on the same principles
 

1941
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,029
are working on the same principles
they're modeling systems and it's hard

1942
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
they're modeling systems and it's hard
 

1943
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,029
they're modeling systems and it's hard
to imagine how neurons do this and so we

1944
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
to imagine how neurons do this and so we
 

1945
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,590
to imagine how neurons do this and so we
said

1946
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
said
 

1947
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,669
said
hey it's really hard to imagine how

1948
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
hey it's really hard to imagine how
 

1949
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,190
hey it's really hard to imagine how
neurons could learn these models of

1950
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
neurons could learn these models of
 

1951
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,510
neurons could learn these models of
things

1952
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:31,520
things
 

1953
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,870
things
we can talk about the details of that if

1954
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
we can talk about the details of that if
 

1955
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,870
we can talk about the details of that if
you want but

1956
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
you want but
 

1957
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,110
you want but
let's um but there's this other part of

1958
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
let's um but there's this other part of
 

1959
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,950
let's um but there's this other part of
the brain we know that learns models of

1960
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
the brain we know that learns models of
 

1961
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,230
the brain we know that learns models of
environments so could that mechanism to

1962
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
environments so could that mechanism to
 

1963
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,510
environments so could that mechanism to
learn to model this room be used to

1964
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
learn to model this room be used to
 

1965
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,750
learn to model this room be used to
learn a model the water bottle

1966
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
learn a model the water bottle
 

1967
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,909
learn a model the water bottle
is it the same mechanism so we said it's

1968
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
is it the same mechanism so we said it's
 

1969
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,430
is it the same mechanism so we said it's
much more likely the brain is using the

1970
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
much more likely the brain is using the
 

1971
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,710
much more likely the brain is using the
same mechanism

1972
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
same mechanism
 

1973
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,549
same mechanism
which case it would have these

1974
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
which case it would have these
 

1975
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,149
which case it would have these
equivalent cell types

1976
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
equivalent cell types
 

1977
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,590
equivalent cell types
so it's basically the whole theory is

1978
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
so it's basically the whole theory is
 

1979
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,350
so it's basically the whole theory is
built on the idea that

1980
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
built on the idea that
 

1981
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,350
built on the idea that
um these columns have reference frames

1982
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
um these columns have reference frames
 

1983
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,630
um these columns have reference frames
and they're learning these models

1984
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
and they're learning these models
 

1985
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,230
and they're learning these models
and these these grid cells create these

1986
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
and these these grid cells create these
 

1987
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,950
and these these grid cells create these
reference frames so it's it's basically

1988
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
reference frames so it's it's basically
 

1989
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,830
reference frames so it's it's basically
the major in some sense the major

1990
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
the major in some sense the major
 

1991
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,990
the major in some sense the major
predictive

1992
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
predictive
 

1993
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,630
predictive
part of this theory is that we will find

1994
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
part of this theory is that we will find
 

1995
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,230
part of this theory is that we will find
these equivalent mechanisms in

1996
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
these equivalent mechanisms in
 

1997
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,909
these equivalent mechanisms in
each column in the near cortex which

1998
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
each column in the near cortex which
 

1999
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,350
each column in the near cortex which
tells us that's that

2000
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
tells us that's that
 

2001
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,470
tells us that's that
that that's what they're doing they're

2002
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
that that's what they're doing they're
 

2003
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,549
that that's what they're doing they're
learning these sensory motor models

2004
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
learning these sensory motor models
 

2005
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,590
learning these sensory motor models
of the world so just we're pretty

2006
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
of the world so just we're pretty
 

2007
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:21,990
of the world so just we're pretty
confident

2008
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
confident
 

2009
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,190
confident
that would happen but now we're seeing

2010
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
that would happen but now we're seeing
 

2011
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,590
that would happen but now we're seeing
the evidence so the evolutionary process

2012
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
the evidence so the evolutionary process
 

2013
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,590
the evidence so the evolutionary process
nature does a lot of copy and paste and

2014
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
nature does a lot of copy and paste and
 

2015
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,190
nature does a lot of copy and paste and
see what happens yeah

2016
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
see what happens yeah
 

2017
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,269
see what happens yeah
yeah there's no direction to it but but

2018
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:31,279
yeah there's no direction to it but but
 

2019
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,750
yeah there's no direction to it but but
um it just found out like hey if i

2020
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
um it just found out like hey if i
 

2021
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,909
um it just found out like hey if i
took this these elements and and made

2022
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
took this these elements and and made
 

2023
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,590
took this these elements and and made
more of them what happens and let's hook

2024
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,600
more of them what happens and let's hook
 

2025
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,870
more of them what happens and let's hook
them up to the eyes and let's look up

2026
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
them up to the eyes and let's look up
 

2027
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,990
them up to the eyes and let's look up
the ears and

2028
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
the ears and
 

2029
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,669
the ears and
and um and that seems to work pretty

2030
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
and um and that seems to work pretty
 

2031
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,269
and um and that seems to work pretty
well yeah like for us

2032
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
well yeah like for us
 

2033
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,590
well yeah like for us
again just to take a quick step back to

2034
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
again just to take a quick step back to
 

2035
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,549
again just to take a quick step back to
our

2036
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
our
 

2037
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,950
our
conversation of collective intelligence

2038
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
conversation of collective intelligence
 

2039
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,230
conversation of collective intelligence
do you sometimes

2040
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
do you sometimes
 

2041
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,909
do you sometimes
see that as just another copy and paste

2042
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
see that as just another copy and paste
 

2043
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,870
see that as just another copy and paste
aspect is copying pasting these uh

2044
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
aspect is copying pasting these uh
 

2045
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,990
aspect is copying pasting these uh
brains and

2046
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
brains and
 

2047
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,710
brains and
humans and making a lot of them and then

2048
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
humans and making a lot of them and then
 

2049
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,350
humans and making a lot of them and then
creating

2050
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360
creating
 

2051
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,389
creating
uh social structures that then almost

2052
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
uh social structures that then almost
 

2053
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,909
uh social structures that then almost
operates as a single brain

2054
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
operates as a single brain
 

2055
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,509
operates as a single brain
uh i wouldn't have said it but you said

2056
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
uh i wouldn't have said it but you said
 

2057
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,149
uh i wouldn't have said it but you said
it sounded pretty good

2058
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
it sounded pretty good
 

2059
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,789
it sounded pretty good
so to you the brain is fundamental is uh

2060
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
so to you the brain is fundamental is uh
 

2061
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,070
so to you the brain is fundamental is uh
is like uh

2062
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
is like uh
 

2063
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,950
is like uh
is its own thing right i mean our goal

2064
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:16,960
is its own thing right i mean our goal
 

2065
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,389
is its own thing right i mean our goal
is to understand how the neural cortex

2066
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
is to understand how the neural cortex
 

2067
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,029
is to understand how the neural cortex
works

2068
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
works
 

2069
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,750
works
we can argue how essential that is to

2070
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
we can argue how essential that is to
 

2071
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,029
we can argue how essential that is to
understand a human brain because it's

2072
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
understand a human brain because it's
 

2073
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,389
understand a human brain because it's
not the entire human brain

2074
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
not the entire human brain
 

2075
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,950
not the entire human brain
you can argue how essential that is to

2076
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
you can argue how essential that is to
 

2077
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,470
you can argue how essential that is to
understanding human intelligence

2078
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
understanding human intelligence
 

2079
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,590
understanding human intelligence
you can argue how essential it is to um

2080
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
you can argue how essential it is to um
 

2081
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,750
you can argue how essential it is to um
to uh you know a sort of communal

2082
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
to uh you know a sort of communal
 

2083
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,630
to uh you know a sort of communal
intelligence

2084
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
intelligence
 

2085
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,750
intelligence
um i i'm not i didn't our goal was to

2086
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
um i i'm not i didn't our goal was to
 

2087
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,430
um i i'm not i didn't our goal was to
understand the neocortex yeah so what is

2088
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
understand the neocortex yeah so what is
 

2089
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,590
understand the neocortex yeah so what is
the neural cortex and where does it fit

2090
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
the neural cortex and where does it fit
 

2091
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,990
the neural cortex and where does it fit
in um the various aspects of what the

2092
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
in um the various aspects of what the
 

2093
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,710
in um the various aspects of what the
brain does

2094
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
brain does
 

2095
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,870
brain does
like how important is it to you well

2096
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:46,880
like how important is it to you well
 

2097
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,830
like how important is it to you well
obviously

2098
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
obviously
 

2099
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,590
obviously
again we i mentioned again in the

2100
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
again we i mentioned again in the
 

2101
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,110
again we i mentioned again in the
beginning it's it's it's

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
beginning it's it's it's
 

2103
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,070
beginning it's it's it's
about 70 to 75 of the volume of a human

2104
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
about 70 to 75 of the volume of a human
 

2105
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,549
about 70 to 75 of the volume of a human

00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
brain
 

2107
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,310
brain
so it's you know it dominates our brain

2108
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
so it's you know it dominates our brain
 

2109
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,230
so it's you know it dominates our brain
in terms of size not in terms of number

2110
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
in terms of size not in terms of number
 

2111
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,110
in terms of size not in terms of number
of neurons but

2112
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,120
of neurons but
 

2113
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,990
of neurons but
in terms of size size isn't everything

2114
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
in terms of size size isn't everything
 

2115
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,389

in the new york cortex
 

2147
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,110
in the new york cortex
if i were to say you know what part of

2148
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120
if i were to say you know what part of
 

2149
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,549
if i were to say you know what part of
your brain designed a computer

2150
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
your brain designed a computer
 

2151
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,470
your brain designed a computer
and understands programming and and

2152
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
and understands programming and and
 

2153
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,029
and understands programming and and
creates music it's all the neural cortex

2154
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
creates music it's all the neural cortex
 

2155
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,870
creates music it's all the neural cortex
so then that's kind of undeniable fact

2156
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
so then that's kind of undeniable fact
 

2157
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,789
so then that's kind of undeniable fact
uh if but then there's other parts of

2158
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
uh if but then there's other parts of
 

2159
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,909
uh if but then there's other parts of
our brain are important too

2160
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
our brain are important too
 

2161
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,549
our brain are important too
right our emotional states uh our body

2162
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
right our emotional states uh our body
 

2163
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,909
right our emotional states uh our body
regulating our body

2164
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
regulating our body
 

2165
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,590
regulating our body
um so the way i like to look at it is

2166
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
um so the way i like to look at it is
 

2167
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,149
um so the way i like to look at it is
you know could you can you understand

2168
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
you know could you can you understand
 

2169
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,590
you know could you can you understand
the neocortex about the rest of the

2170
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,600
the neocortex about the rest of the
 

2171
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,070
the neocortex about the rest of the
brain

2172
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
brain
 

2173
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,669
brain
and some people say you can't and i

2174
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
and some people say you can't and i
 

2175
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,750
and some people say you can't and i
think absolutely you can

2176
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
think absolutely you can
 

2177
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,190
think absolutely you can
it's not that they're not interacting

2178
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
it's not that they're not interacting
 

2179
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,789
it's not that they're not interacting
but you can understand them can you

2180
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
but you can understand them can you
 

2181
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,149
but you can understand them can you
understand the neocortex without

2182
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
understand the neocortex without
 

2183
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,909
understand the neocortex without
understanding the emotions of fear yes

2184
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
understanding the emotions of fear yes
 

2185
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,269
understanding the emotions of fear yes
you can you can understand how the

2186
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
you can you can understand how the
 

2187
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,350
you can you can understand how the
system works it's just a modeling system

2188
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
system works it's just a modeling system
 

2189
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,430
system works it's just a modeling system
i make the analogy in the book that it's

2190
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
i make the analogy in the book that it's
 

2191
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,110
i make the analogy in the book that it's
it's like a map of the world

2192
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
it's like a map of the world
 

2193
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,669
it's like a map of the world
and how that map is used depends on

2194
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
and how that map is used depends on
 

2195
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,710
and how that map is used depends on
who's using it

2196
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
who's using it
 

2197
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,950
who's using it
so how our map of our world in our

2198
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
so how our map of our world in our
 

2199
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,909
so how our map of our world in our
neocortex

2200
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:15,919
neocortex
 

2201
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,310
neocortex
how we how we manifest as a human

2202
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
how we how we manifest as a human
 

2203
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,070
how we how we manifest as a human
depends on the rest of our brain what

2204
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
depends on the rest of our brain what
 

2205
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,750
depends on the rest of our brain what
are our motivations you know what are my

2206
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
are our motivations you know what are my
 

2207
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,509
are our motivations you know what are my
desires am i a nice guy or not a nice

2208
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
desires am i a nice guy or not a nice
 

2209
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:23,990
desires am i a nice guy or not a nice
guy

2210
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
guy
 

2211
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,990
guy
am i a cheater or a you know or not a

2212
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
am i a cheater or a you know or not a
 

2213
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,590
am i a cheater or a you know or not a
cheater um

2214
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
cheater um
 

2215
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,149
cheater um
uh you know how important different

2216
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
uh you know how important different
 

2217
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,509
uh you know how important different
things are in my life

2218
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
things are in my life
 

2219
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,549
things are in my life
so um so but the

2220
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
so um so but the
 

2221
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,230
so um so but the
new projects can be understood on its

2222
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
new projects can be understood on its
 

2223
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,870
new projects can be understood on its
own um and and i say that

2224
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
own um and and i say that
 

2225
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,630
own um and and i say that
as a neuroscientist i know there's all

2226
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
as a neuroscientist i know there's all
 

2227
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,710
as a neuroscientist i know there's all
these interactions and i want to

2228
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
these interactions and i want to
 

2229
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,149
these interactions and i want to
say i don't know them and we don't think

2230
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
say i don't know them and we don't think
 

2231
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,990
say i don't know them and we don't think
about them but from a layperson's point

2232
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
about them but from a layperson's point
 

2233
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,789
about them but from a layperson's point
of view you can say

2234
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
of view you can say
 

2235
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,230
of view you can say
it's a modeling system i don't tend to

2236
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
it's a modeling system i don't tend to
 

2237
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,830
it's a modeling system i don't tend to
think too much about the communal aspect

2238
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
think too much about the communal aspect
 

2239
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,110
think too much about the communal aspect
of intelligence which you brought a

2240
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
of intelligence which you brought a
 

2241
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,389
of intelligence which you brought a
number of times already

2242
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
number of times already
 

2243
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,710
number of times already
um so that's not really been my concern

2244
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
um so that's not really been my concern
 

2245
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,789
um so that's not really been my concern
i just wonder if there's a continuum

2246
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
i just wonder if there's a continuum
 

2247
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,830
i just wonder if there's a continuum
from the origin of the universe like

2248
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
from the origin of the universe like
 

2249
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,830
from the origin of the universe like
this com pockets of complexities that

2250
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:04,840
this com pockets of complexities that
 

2251
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,990
this com pockets of complexities that
form

2252
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
form
 

2253
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,790
form
yeah living organisms i wonder if if

2254
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:08,800
yeah living organisms i wonder if if
 

2255
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,990
yeah living organisms i wonder if if
we're just

2256
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,000
we're just
 

2257
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,069
we're just
if you look at humans we feel like we're

2258
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:12,079
if you look at humans we feel like we're
 

2259
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,109
if you look at humans we feel like we're
at the top

2260
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
at the top
 

2261
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,149
at the top
but i wonder if there's like just where

2262
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
but i wonder if there's like just where
 

2263
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,629
but i wonder if there's like just where
everybody probably every living type

2264
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
everybody probably every living type
 

2265
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,470
everybody probably every living type
pocket of complexity

2266
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
pocket of complexity
 

2267
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,430
pocket of complexity
is probably thinks they're the uh pardon

2268
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
is probably thinks they're the uh pardon
 

2269
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,990
is probably thinks they're the uh pardon

2270
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
the french
 

2271
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,349
the french
they're the yeah they're they're

2272
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:25,359
they're the yeah they're they're
 

2273
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,109
they're the yeah they're they're
they're at the top of the parent well

2274
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
they're at the top of the parent well
 

2275
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,750
they're at the top of the parent well
if they're thinking um well then then

2276
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
if they're thinking um well then then
 

2277
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,190
if they're thinking um well then then
what is thinking what the all right

2278
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
what is thinking what the all right
 

2279
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,829
what is thinking what the all right
in this sense the whole point is in

2280
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
in this sense the whole point is in

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,030
in this sense the whole point is in

00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
what is it turtle
 

2289
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,750
what is it turtle
but you're you're you're bringing up you

2290
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
but you're you're you're bringing up you
 

2291
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,669
but you're you're you're bringing up you
know the the problems of complexity and

2292
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
know the the problems of complexity and
 

2293
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,710
know the the problems of complexity and
complexity theory

2294
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:46,720
complexity theory
 

2295
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,270
complexity theory
are you know it's a huge interesting

2296
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
are you know it's a huge interesting
 

2297
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,629
are you know it's a huge interesting
problem in science

2298
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
problem in science
 

2299
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,589
problem in science
um and you know i think we've made

2300
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599
um and you know i think we've made
 

2301
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,510
um and you know i think we've made
surprisingly little progress in

2302
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
surprisingly little progress in
 

2303
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,869
surprisingly little progress in
understanding complex systems

2304
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
understanding complex systems
 

2305
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,230
understanding complex systems
right in general um and so you know the

2306
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
right in general um and so you know the
 

2307
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,910
right in general um and so you know the
santa fe institute was founded to to

2308
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
santa fe institute was founded to to
 

2309
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,589
santa fe institute was founded to to
study this and and even the scientists

2310
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
study this and and even the scientists
 

2311
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,870
study this and and even the scientists
there will say it's really hard we

2312
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
there will say it's really hard we
 

2313
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,870
there will say it's really hard we
haven't really been able to figure out

2314
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
haven't really been able to figure out
 

2315
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,190
haven't really been able to figure out
exactly you know that science isn't

2316
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
exactly you know that science isn't
 

2317
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,950
exactly you know that science isn't
really congealed yet we're still trying

2318
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
really congealed yet we're still trying
 

2319
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,550
really congealed yet we're still trying
to figure out the basic elements of that

2320
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
to figure out the basic elements of that
 

2321
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,109
to figure out the basic elements of that
science

2322
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
science
 

2323
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,910
science
uh what you know where does complexity

2324
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
uh what you know where does complexity
 

2325
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,430
uh what you know where does complexity
come from and what is it and how you

2326
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
come from and what is it and how you
 

2327
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,390
come from and what is it and how you
define it whether it's

2328
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
define it whether it's
 

2329
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,790
define it whether it's
dna creating bodies or phenotypes or if

2330
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
dna creating bodies or phenotypes or if
 

2331
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,990
dna creating bodies or phenotypes or if
it's

2332
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
it's
 

2333
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,829
it's
individuals creating societies or ants

2334
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
individuals creating societies or ants
 

2335
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,190
individuals creating societies or ants
and you know

2336
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
and you know
 

2337
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,030
and you know
markets and so on it's it's a very

2338
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
markets and so on it's it's a very
 

2339
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,109
markets and so on it's it's a very
complex thing i'm not a complexity

2340
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
complex thing i'm not a complexity
 

2341
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,589
complex thing i'm not a complexity
theorist

2342
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
theorist
 

2343
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,870
theorist
person right um and i i think

2344
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
person right um and i i think
 

2345
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,390
person right um and i i think
they ask well the brain itself is a

2346
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
they ask well the brain itself is a
 

2347
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,990
they ask well the brain itself is a
complex system so

2348
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
complex system so
 

2349
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,150
complex system so
can we understand that um i think we've

2350
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
can we understand that um i think we've
 

2351
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,589
can we understand that um i think we've
made a lot of progress understanding how

2352
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
made a lot of progress understanding how
 

2353
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,550
made a lot of progress understanding how
the brain works

2354
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
the brain works
 

2355
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,589
the brain works
so but i haven't brought it out to like

2356
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,599
so but i haven't brought it out to like
 

2357
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,270
so but i haven't brought it out to like
oh well where are we on the complexity

2358
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
oh well where are we on the complexity
 

2359
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,069
oh well where are we on the complexity
spectrum

2360
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
spectrum
 

2361
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,950
spectrum
you know it's like um that's a great

2362
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
you know it's like um that's a great
 

2363
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,069
you know it's like um that's a great
question

2364
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
question
 

2365
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,870
question
i'd prefer for that answer to be we're

2366
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
i'd prefer for that answer to be we're
 

2367
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,630
i'd prefer for that answer to be we're
not special

2368
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
not special
 

2369
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,589
not special
it seems like if we're honest most

2370
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:57,599
it seems like if we're honest most
 

2371
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,349
it seems like if we're honest most
likely we're not special so if there is

2372
00:35:59,349 --> 00:35:59,359
likely we're not special so if there is
 

2373
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,230
likely we're not special so if there is
a spectrum

2374
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
a spectrum
 

2375
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,990
a spectrum
we're probably not in some kind of

2376
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
we're probably not in some kind of
 

2377
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,670
we're probably not in some kind of
significant place there's one thing we

2378
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
significant place there's one thing we
 

2379
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,829
significant place there's one thing we
could say that we are special

2380
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
could say that we are special
 

2381
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,150
could say that we are special
and and again only here on earth i'm not

2382
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
and and again only here on earth i'm not
 

2383
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,270
and and again only here on earth i'm not
saying i'm bad

2384
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
saying i'm bad
 

2385
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,470
saying i'm bad
is that if we think about knowledge

2386
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
is that if we think about knowledge
 

2387
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,230
is that if we think about knowledge
what we know um we clearly

2388
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
what we know um we clearly
 

2389
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,750
what we know um we clearly
human brains have um the only brains

2390
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
human brains have um the only brains
 

2391
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,030
human brains have um the only brains
that have a certain types of knowledge

2392
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
that have a certain types of knowledge
 

2393
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,310
that have a certain types of knowledge
we're the only brains on

2394
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
we're the only brains on
 

2395
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,069
we're the only brains on
on this earth to understand uh what the

2396
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
on this earth to understand uh what the
 

2397
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,990
on this earth to understand uh what the
earth is how old it is

2398
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,000
earth is how old it is
 

2399
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,510
earth is how old it is
that the universe is a picture as a

2400
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
that the universe is a picture as a
 

2401
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,910
that the universe is a picture as a
whole the only organisms understand dna

2402
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
whole the only organisms understand dna
 

2403
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,109
whole the only organisms understand dna
and the origins of you know of species

2404
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
and the origins of you know of species
 

2405
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,990
and the origins of you know of species
uh no other species on on this planet

2406
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
uh no other species on on this planet
 

2407
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,630
uh no other species on on this planet
has that

2408
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
has that
 

2409
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,190
has that
knowledge so if we think about i like to

2410
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
knowledge so if we think about i like to
 

2411
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,310
knowledge so if we think about i like to
think about

2412
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
think about
 

2413
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,069
think about
you know one of the endeavors of

2414
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
you know one of the endeavors of
 

2415
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,430
you know one of the endeavors of
humanity is to

2416
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
humanity is to
 

2417
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,349
humanity is to
understand the universe as much as we

2418
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359
understand the universe as much as we
 

2419
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,510
understand the universe as much as we
can um

2420
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
can um
 

2421
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,349
can um
i think our species is further along in

2422
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
i think our species is further along in
 

2423
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,109
i think our species is further along in
that undeniably

2424
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
that undeniably
 

2425
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,710
that undeniably
um whether our theories are right or

2426
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
um whether our theories are right or
 

2427
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,470
um whether our theories are right or
wrong we can debate but at least we have

2428
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
wrong we can debate but at least we have
 

2429
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,349
wrong we can debate but at least we have
theories you know we

2430
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
theories you know we
 

2431
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,270
theories you know we
we know that what the sun is and how

2432
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
we know that what the sun is and how
 

2433
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,790
we know that what the sun is and how
it's fusion is and how

2434
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
it's fusion is and how
 

2435
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,190
it's fusion is and how
what black holes are and you know we

2436
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
what black holes are and you know we
 

2437
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,910
what black holes are and you know we
know

2438
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
know
 

2439
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,510
know
general theory relativity and no other

2440
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
general theory relativity and no other
 

2441
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,109
general theory relativity and no other
animal has any of this knowledge

2442
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
animal has any of this knowledge
 

2443
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,910
animal has any of this knowledge
so in that sense that we're special uh

2444
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
so in that sense that we're special uh
 

2445
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,510
so in that sense that we're special uh
are we special in terms of

2446
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
are we special in terms of
 

2447
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,990
are we special in terms of
the the hierarchy of complexity in in

2448
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
the the hierarchy of complexity in in
 

2449
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,550
the the hierarchy of complexity in in
the universe probably not

2450
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560

 

2451
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,069

can we look at a neuron yeah you say

2452
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:20,079
can we look at a neuron yeah you say
 

2453
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,950
can we look at a neuron yeah you say
that prediction

2454
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
that prediction
 

2455
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,950
that prediction
happens in the neuron what does that

2456
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
happens in the neuron what does that
 

2457
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,950
happens in the neuron what does that
mean so neuron traditionally seen as the

2458
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:24,960
mean so neuron traditionally seen as the
 

2459
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,910
mean so neuron traditionally seen as the
basic element

2460
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
basic element
 

2461
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,390
basic element
of the the brain so we i mentioned this

2462
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
of the the brain so we i mentioned this
 

2463
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,109
of the the brain so we i mentioned this
earlier

2464
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
earlier
 

2465
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,750
earlier
that prediction was our research agenda

2466
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
that prediction was our research agenda
 

2467
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,510
that prediction was our research agenda
yeah we said okay

2468
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
yeah we said okay
 

2469
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,510
yeah we said okay
um how does the brain make a prediction

2470
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
um how does the brain make a prediction
 

2471
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,829
um how does the brain make a prediction
like i i'm about to grab this water

2472
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
like i i'm about to grab this water
 

2473
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,310
like i i'm about to grab this water
bottle

2474
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
bottle
 

2475
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,750
bottle
and my brain is predicting what i'm

2476
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
and my brain is predicting what i'm
 

2477
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,069
and my brain is predicting what i'm
going to feel um on all my parts of my

2478
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
going to feel um on all my parts of my
 

2479
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,750
going to feel um on all my parts of my
fingers if i felt something really odd

2480
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
fingers if i felt something really odd
 

2481
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,270
fingers if i felt something really odd
on any part here i notice it

2482
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
on any part here i notice it
 

2483
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,550
on any part here i notice it
so my brain is predicting what it's

2484
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
so my brain is predicting what it's
 

2485
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,790
so my brain is predicting what it's
going to feel as i grab this thing

2486
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
going to feel as i grab this thing
 

2487
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,550
going to feel as i grab this thing
so what is that how does that manifest

2488
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
so what is that how does that manifest
 

2489
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,710
so what is that how does that manifest
itself in neural tissue right we got

2490
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
itself in neural tissue right we got
 

2491
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,349
itself in neural tissue right we got
brains made of neurons and there's

2492
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
brains made of neurons and there's
 

2493
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,190
brains made of neurons and there's
chemicals and there's neurons and

2494
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
chemicals and there's neurons and
 

2495
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,109
chemicals and there's neurons and
there's spikes and the connect you know

2496
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
there's spikes and the connect you know
 

2497
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,150
there's spikes and the connect you know
where where is the prediction going on

2498
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
where where is the prediction going on
 

2499
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,630
where where is the prediction going on
and one argument could be that well when

2500
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
and one argument could be that well when
 

2501
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,230
and one argument could be that well when
i'm predicting something

2502
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,240
i'm predicting something
 

2503
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,710
i'm predicting something
um a neuron must be firing in advance

2504
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:08,720
um a neuron must be firing in advance
 

2505
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,390
um a neuron must be firing in advance
it's like okay this neuron represents

2506
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
it's like okay this neuron represents
 

2507
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,510
it's like okay this neuron represents
what you're going to feel and it's

2508
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
what you're going to feel and it's
 

2509
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,589
what you're going to feel and it's
firing it's sending a spike

2510
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
firing it's sending a spike
 

2511
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,950
firing it's sending a spike
and certainly that happens to some

2512
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
and certainly that happens to some
 

2513
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,109
and certainly that happens to some
extent but our predictions are so

2514
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
extent but our predictions are so
 

2515
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,710
extent but our predictions are so
ubiquitous

2516
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
ubiquitous
 

2517
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,990
ubiquitous
that we're making so many of them which

2518
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
that we're making so many of them which
 

2519
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,829
that we're making so many of them which
we're totally unaware of just the vast

2520
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
we're totally unaware of just the vast
 

2521
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,109
we're totally unaware of just the vast
majority we have no idea that you're

2522
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
majority we have no idea that you're
 

2523
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,069

2524
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
doing this
 

2525
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,190
doing this
um that it wasn't really

2526
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
um that it wasn't really
 

2527
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,470
um that it wasn't really
we were trying to figure how could this

2528
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
we were trying to figure how could this
 

2529
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,990
we were trying to figure how could this
be where where is these where are these

2530
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
be where where is these where are these
 

2531
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,829
be where where is these where are these
happening

2532
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839
happening
 

2533
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,190
happening
right and i won't walk you through the

2534
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
right and i won't walk you through the
 

2535
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,230
right and i won't walk you through the
whole story unless you

2536
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,240
whole story unless you
 

2537
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,150
whole story unless you
insist upon it but we came to the

2538
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
insist upon it but we came to the
 

2539
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,670
insist upon it but we came to the
realization

2540
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
realization
 

2541
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,470
realization
that most of your predictions are

2542
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,480
that most of your predictions are
 

2543
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,950
that most of your predictions are
occurring

2544
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
occurring
 

2545
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,510
occurring
inside individual neurons especially

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
inside individual neurons especially
 

2547
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,790
inside individual neurons especially
these the most common are in the

00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:44,800
these the most common are in the
 

2549
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,390
these the most common are in the
pyramidal cells

2550
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
pyramidal cells
 

2551
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,069
pyramidal cells
and there are there's a property of

00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:48,079
and there are there's a property of
 

2553
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,510
and there are there's a property of

we everyone knows or most people know
 

2557
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,790
we everyone knows or most people know
that a neuron is a cell and it has this

spikes internal to the neuron
 

2569
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,510
spikes internal to the neuron
they're called dendritic spikes they

they're called dendritic spikes they
 

2571
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,670
they're called dendritic spikes they
travel along the branches of the neuron

travel along the branches of the neuron
and they don't leave the neuron they're

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:13,760
and
 

2585
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,670
and
what we came to understand that those

2586
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
what we came to understand that those
 

2587
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,270
what we came to understand that those
dendritic spikes the ones that are

2588
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
dendritic spikes the ones that are
 

2589
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,630
dendritic spikes the ones that are
occurring are actually a form of

2590
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
occurring are actually a form of
 

2591
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,589
occurring are actually a form of
prediction

2592
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
prediction
 

2593
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,270
prediction
they're telling the neuron the neuron is

2594
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,280
they're telling the neuron the neuron is
 

2595
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,030
they're telling the neuron the neuron is
saying i expect

2596
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,040
saying i expect
 

2597
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,670
saying i expect
that i might become active shortly and

2598
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
that i might become active shortly and
 

2599
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,870
that i might become active shortly and
that internal

2600
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
that internal
 

2601
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,430
that internal
so the internal spike is a way of saying

2602
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
so the internal spike is a way of saying
 

2603
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,950
so the internal spike is a way of saying
you're going to you might be generating

2604
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
you're going to you might be generating
 

2605
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,470
you're going to you might be generating
external spikes soon

2606
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
external spikes soon
 

2607
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,750
external spikes soon
i predicted you're going to become

2608
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
i predicted you're going to become
 

2609
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,550
i predicted you're going to become
active and and we we've we've

2610
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
active and and we we've we've
 

2611
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,790
active and and we we've we've
we wrote a paper in 2016 which explained

2612
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
we wrote a paper in 2016 which explained
 

2613
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,910
we wrote a paper in 2016 which explained
and how this

2614
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
and how this
 

2615
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,710
and how this
manifests itself in neural tissue and

2616
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
manifests itself in neural tissue and
 

2617
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,030
manifests itself in neural tissue and
how it is that this all works together

2618
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,040
how it is that this all works together
 

2619
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,270
how it is that this all works together
but the vast ma we think it's there's a

2620
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,280
but the vast ma we think it's there's a
 

2621
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,630
but the vast ma we think it's there's a
lot of evidence supporting it

2622
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640
lot of evidence supporting it
 

2623
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,030
lot of evidence supporting it
um so we that's where we think that most

2624
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
um so we that's where we think that most
 

2625
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,310
um so we that's where we think that most
of these predictions are internal that's

2626
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
of these predictions are internal that's
 

2627
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,030
of these predictions are internal that's
why you can't

2628
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,040
why you can't
 

2629
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,870
why you can't
be per their internal neuron you can't

2630
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:54,880
be per their internal neuron you can't
 

2631
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,030
be per their internal neuron you can't
perceive them

2632
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
perceive them
 

2633
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,790
perceive them
from understanding the the prediction

2634
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
from understanding the the prediction
 

2635
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,710
from understanding the the prediction
mechanism of a single neuron

2636
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
mechanism of a single neuron
 

2637
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,390
mechanism of a single neuron
do you think there's deep insights to be

2638
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
do you think there's deep insights to be
 

2639
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,910
do you think there's deep insights to be
gained about the prediction

2640
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:03,920
gained about the prediction
 

2641
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,550
gained about the prediction
capabilities of the mini brains within

2642
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
capabilities of the mini brains within
 

2643
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,069
capabilities of the mini brains within
the bigger brain and the brain oh yeah

2644
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:08,079
the bigger brain and the brain oh yeah
 

2645
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:08,630
the bigger brain and the brain oh yeah
yeah yeah

2646
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
yeah yeah
 

2647
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,150
yeah yeah
so having a prediction side of the

2648
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
so having a prediction side of the
 

2649
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,230
so having a prediction side of the
individual neuron is not that useful

2650
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
individual neuron is not that useful
 

2651
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,510
individual neuron is not that useful
you know what so what um the way it

2652
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
you know what so what um the way it
 

2653
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,790
you know what so what um the way it
manifests itself

2654
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
manifests itself
 

2655
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,390
manifests itself
in neural tissue is that

2656
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
in neural tissue is that
 

2657
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,910
in neural tissue is that
when a neuron a neuron emits these

2658
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
when a neuron a neuron emits these
 

2659
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,069
when a neuron a neuron emits these
spikes or a very singular type event

2660
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:24,079
spikes or a very singular type event
 

2661
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,910
spikes or a very singular type event
if a neuron is predicting that it's

2662
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
if a neuron is predicting that it's
 

2663
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,990
if a neuron is predicting that it's
going to be active it makes it spike

2664
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000
going to be active it makes it spike
 

2665
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,069
going to be active it makes it spike
very a little bit sooner just a few

2666
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
very a little bit sooner just a few
 

2667
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,349
very a little bit sooner just a few
milliseconds sooner than it would have

2668
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359
milliseconds sooner than it would have
 

2669
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,309
milliseconds sooner than it would have
otherwise it's like

2670
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
otherwise it's like
 

2671
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,510
otherwise it's like
i give the analogy in the book there's

2672
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
i give the analogy in the book there's
 

2673
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,190
i give the analogy in the book there's
like a sprinter on a on a starting

2674
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
like a sprinter on a on a starting
 

2675
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,910
like a sprinter on a on a starting
blocks in

2676
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:35,920
blocks in
 

2677
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,589
blocks in
a race and if someone says get ready set

2678
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
a race and if someone says get ready set
 

2679
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,430
a race and if someone says get ready set
you get up and you're ready to go

2680
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
you get up and you're ready to go
 

2681
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,950
you get up and you're ready to go
and then when your race starts you get a

2682
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
and then when your race starts you get a
 

2683
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,630
and then when your race starts you get a
little bit earlier start so that it's

2684
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
little bit earlier start so that it's
 

2685
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:44,950
little bit earlier start so that it's
that

2686
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:44,960
that
 

2687
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,390
that
that ready set is like the prediction

2688
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
that ready set is like the prediction
 

2689
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,589
that ready set is like the prediction
and the neuron's like ready to go

2690
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
and the neuron's like ready to go
 

2691
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,550
and the neuron's like ready to go
quicker

2692
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
quicker
 

2693
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,230
quicker
and what happens is when you have a

2694
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
and what happens is when you have a
 

2695
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,069
and what happens is when you have a
whole bunch of neurons together

2696
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
whole bunch of neurons together
 

2697
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,990
whole bunch of neurons together
and they're all getting these inputs the

2698
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
and they're all getting these inputs the
 

2699
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,349
and they're all getting these inputs the
ones that are in the predictive state

2700
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:55,359
ones that are in the predictive state
 

2701
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,390
ones that are in the predictive state
the ones that are

2702
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
the ones that are
 

2703
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,390
the ones that are
anticipating to become active if they do

2704
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,400
anticipating to become active if they do
 

2705
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,309
anticipating to become active if they do
become active they they happen sooner

2706
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:00,319
become active they they happen sooner
 

2707
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,670
become active they they happen sooner
they disable everything else and it

2708
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
they disable everything else and it
 

2709
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,109
they disable everything else and it
leads to different representations in

2710
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
leads to different representations in
 

2711
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,230
leads to different representations in
the brain so

2712
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
the brain so
 

2713
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,430
the brain so
you have to it's not isolated just to

2714
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
you have to it's not isolated just to
 

2715
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,950
you have to it's not isolated just to
the neuron the prediction occurs within

2716
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
the neuron the prediction occurs within
 

2717
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,589
the neuron the prediction occurs within
the neuron

2718
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
the neuron
 

2719
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,150
the neuron
but the network behavior changes so what

2720
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160
but the network behavior changes so what
 

2721
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,750
but the network behavior changes so what
happens under different predictions

2722
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
happens under different predictions
 

2723
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,430
happens under different predictions
different inputs have different

2724
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:15,440
different inputs have different
 

2725
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,589
different inputs have different
representations so how i

2726
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
representations so how i
 

2727
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,069
representations so how i
what i predict um it's going to be

2728
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
what i predict um it's going to be
 

2729
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,750
what i predict um it's going to be
different under different contexts

2730
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:21,760
different under different contexts
 

2731
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,430
different under different contexts
you know what my input will be is

2732
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
you know what my input will be is
 

2733
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,630
you know what my input will be is
different under different context so

2734
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
different under different context so
 

2735
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,670
different under different context so
this is this is a

2736
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
this is this is a
 

2737
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,630
this is this is a
key level theory how this works so the

2738
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
key level theory how this works so the
 

2739
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,550
key level theory how this works so the
theory of the thousand brains

2740
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
theory of the thousand brains
 

2741
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,069
theory of the thousand brains
if you were to count the number of

2742
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
if you were to count the number of
 

2743
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,710
if you were to count the number of
brains how would you do it

2744
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720
brains how would you do it
 

2745
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,069
brains how would you do it
the thousand main theory says that

2746
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
the thousand main theory says that
 

2747
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,390
the thousand main theory says that
basically every cortical column

2748
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
basically every cortical column
 

2749
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,109
basically every cortical column
in the in your neurocortex is a complete

2750
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
in the in your neurocortex is a complete
 

2751
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,309
in the in your neurocortex is a complete
modeling system

2752
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
modeling system
 

2753
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,390
modeling system
and that when i ask where do i have a

2754
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
and that when i ask where do i have a
 

2755
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,069
and that when i ask where do i have a
model of something like a coffee cup

2756
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
model of something like a coffee cup
 

2757
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,670
model of something like a coffee cup
it's not in one of those models it's in

2758
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
it's not in one of those models it's in
 

2759
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,430
it's not in one of those models it's in
thousands of those models there's

2760
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
thousands of those models there's
 

2761
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,870
thousands of those models there's
thousands of models of coffee cups

2762
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
thousands of models of coffee cups
 

2763
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,630
thousands of models of coffee cups
that's what the thousand brains there's

2764
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
that's what the thousand brains there's
 

2765
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,230
that's what the thousand brains there's
a voting mechanism then there's a voting

2766
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,240
a voting mechanism then there's a voting
 

2767
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,990
a voting mechanism then there's a voting
mechanism which leads which

2768
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
mechanism which leads which
 

2769
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,109
mechanism which leads which
is the thing you're which you're

2770
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
is the thing you're which you're
 

2771
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,230
is the thing you're which you're
conscious of which leads to your

2772
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
conscious of which leads to your
 

2773
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,230
conscious of which leads to your
singular perception

2774
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
singular perception
 

2775
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,109
singular perception
um that's why you perceive something so

2776
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
um that's why you perceive something so
 

2777
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,870
um that's why you perceive something so
that's the thousand brains theory

2778
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
that's the thousand brains theory
 

2779
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,390
that's the thousand brains theory
the details how we got to that theory

2780
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
the details how we got to that theory
 

2781
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,190
the details how we got to that theory
um are complicated it wasn't you just

2782
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
um are complicated it wasn't you just
 

2783
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,230
um are complicated it wasn't you just
thought of it one day

2784
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
thought of it one day
 

2785
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,670
thought of it one day
and one of those details is we had to

2786
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
and one of those details is we had to
 

2787
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,990
and one of those details is we had to
ask how does a a model make predictions

2788
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
ask how does a a model make predictions
 

2789
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,190
ask how does a a model make predictions
and we've talked about just these

2790
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
and we've talked about just these
 

2791
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,710
and we've talked about just these
predictive neurons

2792
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
predictive neurons
 

2793
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,470
predictive neurons
that's part of this theory it's like

2794
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
that's part of this theory it's like
 

2795
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,750
that's part of this theory it's like
saying oh it's a detail but

2796
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
saying oh it's a detail but
 

2797
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,190
saying oh it's a detail but
it was like a crack in the doors like

2798
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
it was like a crack in the doors like
 

2799
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,150
it was like a crack in the doors like
how are we going to figure out how these

2800
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
how are we going to figure out how these
 

2801
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,349
how are we going to figure out how these
neurons build do this

2802
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:25,359
neurons build do this
 

2803
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,270
neurons build do this
you know what is going on here so we

2804
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
you know what is going on here so we
 

2805
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,190
you know what is going on here so we
just looked at prediction as like

2806
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,200
just looked at prediction as like
 

2807
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,950
just looked at prediction as like
well we know that's ubiquitous we know

2808
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
well we know that's ubiquitous we know
 

2809
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,390
well we know that's ubiquitous we know
that every part of the cortex is making

2810
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
that every part of the cortex is making
 

2811
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,349
that every part of the cortex is making
predictions

2812
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
predictions
 

2813
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,349
predictions
therefore whatever the predictive system

2814
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
therefore whatever the predictive system
 

2815
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,950
therefore whatever the predictive system
is it's going to be everywhere

2816
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
is it's going to be everywhere
 

2817
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,630
is it's going to be everywhere
we know there's a gazillion predictions

2818
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:38,640
we know there's a gazillion predictions
 

2819
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,230
we know there's a gazillion predictions
happening at once so let's see if we can

2820
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
happening at once so let's see if we can
 

2821
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,750
happening at once so let's see if we can
start teasing apart

2822
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
start teasing apart
 

2823
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,150
start teasing apart
you know ask questions about you know

2824
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
you know ask questions about you know
 

2825
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,349
you know ask questions about you know
how could neurons be making these

2826
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:45,359
how could neurons be making these
 

2827
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,550
how could neurons be making these
predictions and that

2828
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
predictions and that
 

2829
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,309
predictions and that
sort of built up to now what we have the

2830
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
sort of built up to now what we have the
 

2831
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,589
sort of built up to now what we have the
thousand brains theory

2832
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:49,599
thousand brains theory
 

2833
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,109
thousand brains theory
which is complex you know it's just some

2834
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
which is complex you know it's just some
 

2835
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,190
which is complex you know it's just some
i can state it simply but we just didn't

2836
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
i can state it simply but we just didn't
 

2837
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,230
i can state it simply but we just didn't
think of it

2838
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,240
think of it
 

2839
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,790
think of it
we had to get there step by step very it

2840
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
we had to get there step by step very it
 

2841
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,990
we had to get there step by step very it
took years

2842
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
took years
 

2843
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,349
took years
uh to get there and where does uh

2844
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:01,359
uh to get there and where does uh
 

2845
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,550
uh to get there and where does uh
reference frames fit in so yeah

2846
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
reference frames fit in so yeah
 

2847
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,349
reference frames fit in so yeah
okay so again a reference frame i

2848
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
okay so again a reference frame i
 

2849
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:07,910
okay so again a reference frame i
mentioned

2850
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
mentioned
 

2851
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,309
mentioned
um earlier about the you know a model of

2852
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
um earlier about the you know a model of
 

2853
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,430
um earlier about the you know a model of
a house and i said if you're going to

2854
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
a house and i said if you're going to
 

2855
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,470
a house and i said if you're going to
build a model of a house

2856
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
build a model of a house
 

2857
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,150
build a model of a house
in a computer they have a reference

2858
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
in a computer they have a reference
 

2859
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,430
in a computer they have a reference
frame and you can then reference them

2860
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:15,440
frame and you can then reference them
 

2861
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,750
frame and you can then reference them
like

2862
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
like
 

2863
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,990
like
cartesian coordinates like x y and z

2864
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
cartesian coordinates like x y and z
 

2865
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,190
cartesian coordinates like x y and z
axes

2866
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
axes
 

2867
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,790
axes
so i can say oh i'm going to design a

2868
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:20,800
so i can say oh i'm going to design a
 

2869
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,230
so i can say oh i'm going to design a
house i can say well the

2870
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
house i can say well the
 

2871
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,710
house i can say well the
the front door is at this location xyz

2872
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,720
the front door is at this location xyz
 

2873
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,870
the front door is at this location xyz
and the roof is at this location xyz and

2874
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
and the roof is at this location xyz and
 

2875
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,349
and the roof is at this location xyz and
so on

2876
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
so on
 

2877
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,670
so on
that's a type of reference frame so it

2878
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
that's a type of reference frame so it
 

2879
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,470
that's a type of reference frame so it
turns out

2880
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,480
turns out
 

2881
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,230
turns out
for you to make a prediction and then i

2882
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
for you to make a prediction and then i
 

2883
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,430
for you to make a prediction and then i
walk you through the thought experiment

2884
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
walk you through the thought experiment
 

2885
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,790
walk you through the thought experiment
in the book where i was

2886
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800
in the book where i was
 

2887
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,150
in the book where i was
predicting what my finger was going to

2888
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
predicting what my finger was going to
 

2889
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,829
predicting what my finger was going to
feel when i touched the coffee cup

2890
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
feel when i touched the coffee cup
 

2891
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,430
feel when i touched the coffee cup
it was a ceramic coffee cup but this one

2892
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
it was a ceramic coffee cup but this one
 

2893
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,589
it was a ceramic coffee cup but this one
will do um

2894
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599
will do um
 

2895
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,790
will do um
and what i realized is that to make a

2896
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800
and what i realized is that to make a
 

2897
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,990
and what i realized is that to make a
prediction with my finger's going to

2898
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
prediction with my finger's going to
 

2899
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,109
prediction with my finger's going to
feel like it's just going to feel

2900
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
feel like it's just going to feel
 

2901
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,230
feel like it's just going to feel
different than this which would feel

2902
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
different than this which would feel
 

2903
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,670
different than this which would feel
different if i touch the hole or the

2904
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
different if i touch the hole or the
 

2905
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,109
different if i touch the hole or the
thing on the bottom

2906
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
thing on the bottom
 

2907
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,270
thing on the bottom
make that prediction the cortex needs to

2908
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
make that prediction the cortex needs to
 

2909
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,109
make that prediction the cortex needs to
know where the finger is the tip of the

2910
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
know where the finger is the tip of the
 

2911
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,150
know where the finger is the tip of the
finger

2912
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
finger
 

2913
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,030
finger
relative to the coffee cup and exactly

2914
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,040
relative to the coffee cup and exactly
 

2915
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,710
relative to the coffee cup and exactly
relative to the coffee cup

2916
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
relative to the coffee cup
 

2917
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,990
relative to the coffee cup
and to do that i have to have a

2918
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
and to do that i have to have a
 

2919
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,349
and to do that i have to have a
reference frame for the coffee up it has

2920
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
reference frame for the coffee up it has
 

2921
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,390
reference frame for the coffee up it has
to have a way of representing the

2922
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
to have a way of representing the
 

2923
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,150
to have a way of representing the
location of my finger

2924
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
location of my finger
 

2925
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,150
location of my finger
to the coffin up and then we realize of

2926
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
to the coffin up and then we realize of
 

2927
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,589
to the coffin up and then we realize of
course every part of your skin has to

2928
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
course every part of your skin has to
 

2929
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,030
course every part of your skin has to
have a reference frame relative things

2930
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
have a reference frame relative things
 

2931
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,829
have a reference frame relative things
to touch and then we

2932
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
to touch and then we
 

2933
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,990
to touch and then we
did the same thing with vision but so

2934
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
did the same thing with vision but so
 

2935
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,510
did the same thing with vision but so
the idea that a reference frame

2936
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520
the idea that a reference frame
 

2937
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,190
the idea that a reference frame
is necessary to make a prediction when

2938
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
is necessary to make a prediction when
 

2939
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,710
is necessary to make a prediction when
you're touching something or when you're

2940
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:18,720
you're touching something or when you're
 

2941
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,069
you're touching something or when you're
seeing something

2942
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079
seeing something
 

2943
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,270
seeing something
and you're moving your eyes you're

2944
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
and you're moving your eyes you're
 

2945
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,230
and you're moving your eyes you're
moving your fingers it's just a

2946
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
moving your fingers it's just a
 

2947
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,190
moving your fingers it's just a
requirement

2948
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
requirement
 

2949
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,750
requirement
to know what to predict if i have a if i

2950
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:25,760
to know what to predict if i have a if i
 

2951
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,870
to know what to predict if i have a if i
have a structure i'm going to make a

2952
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
have a structure i'm going to make a
 

2953
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,990
have a structure i'm going to make a
prediction i have to

2954
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,000
prediction i have to
 

2955
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,430
prediction i have to
i have to know where it is i'm looking

2956
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:29,440
i have to know where it is i'm looking
 

2957
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,109
i have to know where it is i'm looking
or touching it

2958
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
or touching it
 

2959
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,510
or touching it
so then we say well how do neurons make

2960
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
so then we say well how do neurons make
 

2961
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,510
so then we say well how do neurons make
reference frames it's not obvious

2962
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:35,520
reference frames it's not obvious
 

2963
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,670
reference frames it's not obvious
you know xyz coordinates don't exist in

2964
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
you know xyz coordinates don't exist in
 

2965
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,829
you know xyz coordinates don't exist in
the brain it's just not the way it works

2966
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
the brain it's just not the way it works
 

2967
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,430
the brain it's just not the way it works
so that's when we looked at the older

2968
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:41,440
so that's when we looked at the older
 

2969
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,710
so that's when we looked at the older
part of the brain the hippocampus and

2970
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
part of the brain the hippocampus and
 

2971
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,309
part of the brain the hippocampus and
the antorano cortex

2972
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
the antorano cortex
 

2973
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,870
the antorano cortex
where we knew that in that part of the

2974
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
where we knew that in that part of the
 

2975
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,430
where we knew that in that part of the
brain

2976
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,440
brain
 

2977
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,109
brain
there's a reference frame for a room or

2978
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:49,119
there's a reference frame for a room or
 

2979
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,710
there's a reference frame for a room or
reference name for environment remember

2980
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
reference name for environment remember
 

2981
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,069
reference name for environment remember
i talked earlier about how you could

2982
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
i talked earlier about how you could
 

2983
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,309
i talked earlier about how you could
know make a map of this room

2984
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
know make a map of this room
 

2985
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,510
know make a map of this room
so we said oh um that they are

2986
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
so we said oh um that they are
 

2987
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,270
so we said oh um that they are
implementing reference frames there so

2988
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
implementing reference frames there so
 

2989
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,030
implementing reference frames there so
we knew that reference frames needed to

2990
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:01,040
we knew that reference frames needed to
 

2991
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,270
we knew that reference frames needed to
exist in every cortical column

2992
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
exist in every cortical column
 

2993
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,309
exist in every cortical column
and so that was a deductive thing we

2994
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
and so that was a deductive thing we
 

2995
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,349
and so that was a deductive thing we
just deduced it

2996
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
just deduced it
 

2997
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,390
just deduced it
has to go so you take the old

2998
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
has to go so you take the old
 

2999
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,990
has to go so you take the old
mammalian ability to know where you are

3000
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
mammalian ability to know where you are
 

3001
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,910
mammalian ability to know where you are
in a particular space

3002
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
in a particular space
 

3003
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,510
in a particular space
and you start applying that to higher

3004
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
and you start applying that to higher
 

3005
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,030
and you start applying that to higher
and higher levels yeah you first you

3006
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
and higher levels yeah you first you
 

3007
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,390
and higher levels yeah you first you
apply it to physical like where your

3008
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
apply it to physical like where your
 

3009
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,109
apply it to physical like where your
finger is

3010
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:21,119
finger is
 

3011
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,870
finger is
so here's what i think about it the old

3012
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
so here's what i think about it the old
 

3013
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,390
so here's what i think about it the old
part of the brain says where's my body

3014
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
part of the brain says where's my body
 

3015
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,270
part of the brain says where's my body
in this room

3016
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
in this room
 

3017
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,790
in this room
yeah the new part of the brain says

3018
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
yeah the new part of the brain says
 

3019
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,390
yeah the new part of the brain says
where's my finger

3020
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
where's my finger
 

3021
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,430
where's my finger
relative to this this object yeah where

3022
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
relative to this this object yeah where
 

3023
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:31,910
relative to this this object yeah where
is

3024
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
is
 

3025
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,790
is
the a section of my retina relative to

3026
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800
the a section of my retina relative to
 

3027
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,230
the a section of my retina relative to
this object like where where is

3028
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
this object like where where is
 

3029
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,430
this object like where where is
i'm looking at one little corner where

3030
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
i'm looking at one little corner where
 

3031
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,870
i'm looking at one little corner where
is that relative to this patch of my

3032
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
is that relative to this patch of my
 

3033
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,990
is that relative to this patch of my
retina yeah

3034
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
retina yeah
 

3035
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,470
retina yeah
um and then we take the same thing and

3036
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
um and then we take the same thing and
 

3037
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,069
um and then we take the same thing and
apply it to concepts

3038
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079
apply it to concepts
 

3039
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,349
apply it to concepts
mathematics physics you know humanity

3040
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
mathematics physics you know humanity
 

3041
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,470
mathematics physics you know humanity
whatever you want to think eventually

3042
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
whatever you want to think eventually
 

3043
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,309
whatever you want to think eventually
you're pondering your own mortality

3044
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
you're pondering your own mortality
 

3045
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,670
you're pondering your own mortality
well whatever but the point is when we

3046
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
well whatever but the point is when we
 

3047
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,950
well whatever but the point is when we
think about the world when we have

3048
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
think about the world when we have
 

3049
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,470
think about the world when we have
knowledge about the world how is that

3050
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
knowledge about the world how is that
 

3051
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,589

00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
the book i go through examples like
 

3079
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,270
the book i go through examples like
mathematics

to think about
 

3097
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,750
to think about
it's interesting to think about how

3098
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
it's interesting to think about how
 

3099
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,589
it's interesting to think about how
different are the representations of

3100
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
different are the representations of
 

3101
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,069
different are the representations of
those

3102
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079
those
 

3103
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,349
those
higher dimensional concepts

higher dimensional concepts
 

3105
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,589
higher dimensional concepts
higher level concepts how different the

3106
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
higher level concepts how different the
 

3107
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,270
higher level concepts how different the
representation there is in terms of

3108
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
representation there is in terms of
 

3109
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,390
representation there is in terms of
reference frames

3110
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
reference frames
 

3111
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,790

it's it's

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
it's it's
 

3115
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,589
it's it's
it's a different application but it's

3116
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
it's a different application but it's
 

3117
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,750
it's a different application but it's
the exact same mechanism

3118
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
the exact same mechanism
 

3119
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,030
the exact same mechanism
but isn't there some aspect to uh

3120
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,040
but isn't there some aspect to uh
 

3121
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,349
but isn't there some aspect to uh
higher level concepts that they seem to

3122
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
higher level concepts that they seem to
 

3123
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,870
higher level concepts that they seem to
be hierarchical

3124
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
be hierarchical
 

3125
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,550
be hierarchical
like they just seem to integrate a lot

3126
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
like they just seem to integrate a lot
 

3127
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,309
like they just seem to integrate a lot
of information into so

3128
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
of information into so
 

3129
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,670
of information into so
is our physical objects so take this

3130
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
is our physical objects so take this
 

3131
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,190
is our physical objects so take this
water bottle

3132
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
water bottle
 

3133
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,349
water bottle
uh i'm not particular to this brand but

3134
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
uh i'm not particular to this brand but
 

3135
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,270
uh i'm not particular to this brand but
this is a fiji water bottle

3136
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
this is a fiji water bottle
 

3137
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,750
this is a fiji water bottle
and it has um a logo and i use this

3138
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
and it has um a logo and i use this
 

3139
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,109
and it has um a logo and i use this
example in my book

3140
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:17,119
example in my book
 

3141
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,430
example in my book
our company's coffee cup has a logo on

3142
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
our company's coffee cup has a logo on
 

3143
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,390
our company's coffee cup has a logo on
it but

3144
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
it but
 

3145
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,510
it but
this object is hierarchical it is

3146
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
this object is hierarchical it is
 

3147
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,270
this object is hierarchical it is
it's got like a cylinder and a cap but

3148
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
it's got like a cylinder and a cap but
 

3149
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,030
it's got like a cylinder and a cap but
then has this logo on it and the logo

3150
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
then has this logo on it and the logo
 

3151
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,710
then has this logo on it and the logo
has a word the word has letters the

3152
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
has a word the word has letters the
 

3153
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,710
has a word the word has letters the
letters of different features

3154
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
letters of different features
 

3155
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,030
letters of different features
and so i don't have to remember i don't

3156
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
and so i don't have to remember i don't
 

3157
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,470
and so i don't have to remember i don't
think about this so i said oh there's a

3158
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
think about this so i said oh there's a
 

3159
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,230
think about this so i said oh there's a
fiji logo on this water bottle i don't

3160
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
fiji logo on this water bottle i don't
 

3161
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,349
fiji logo on this water bottle i don't
have to go through and say

3162
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:37,359
have to go through and say
 

3163
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,270
have to go through and say
oh what is the fiji logo it's the f and

3164
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
oh what is the fiji logo it's the f and
 

3165
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,270
oh what is the fiji logo it's the f and
i and the j and i and there's a hibiscus

3166
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:41,280
i and the j and i and there's a hibiscus
 

3167
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,309
i and the j and i and there's a hibiscus
flower and

3168
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
flower and
 

3169
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,990
flower and
and uh oh it has the pest you know the

3170
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000
and uh oh it has the pest you know the
 

3171
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,349
and uh oh it has the pest you know the
stamen on it i don't have to do that i

3172
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
stamen on it i don't have to do that i
 

3173
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,549
stamen on it i don't have to do that i
just incorporate all of that

3174
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
just incorporate all of that
 

3175
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,750
just incorporate all of that
in some sort of hierarchical

3176
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
in some sort of hierarchical
 

3177
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,150
in some sort of hierarchical
representation i say um

3178
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,160
representation i say um
 

3179
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,990
representation i say um
you know put this logo on this water

3180
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
you know put this logo on this water
 

3181
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,270
you know put this logo on this water
bottle yeah and

3182
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
bottle yeah and
 

3183
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,190
bottle yeah and
and and then the logo has a word and the

3184
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
and and then the logo has a word and the
 

3185
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,470
and and then the logo has a word and the
word has letters

3186
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,480
word has letters
 

3187
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,390
word has letters
all hierarchical just all that stuff is

3188
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
all hierarchical just all that stuff is
 

3189
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,910
all hierarchical just all that stuff is
big it's amazing that the brain

3190
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
big it's amazing that the brain
 

3191
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,750
big it's amazing that the brain
instantly just does all that yeah the

3192
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
instantly just does all that yeah the
 

3193
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,750
instantly just does all that yeah the
idea that there's there's water it's

3194
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
idea that there's there's water it's
 

3195
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,589
idea that there's there's water it's
liquid and the idea that you can

3196
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
liquid and the idea that you can
 

3197
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,470
liquid and the idea that you can
uh drink it when you're thirsty the idea

3198
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
uh drink it when you're thirsty the idea
 

3199
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,589
uh drink it when you're thirsty the idea
that there's brands

3200
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,599
that there's brands
 

3201
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,910
that there's brands
yeah and then there's like all of that

3202
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
yeah and then there's like all of that
 

3203
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,870
yeah and then there's like all of that
information is

3204
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
information is
 

3205
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,510
information is
instantly like built into the whole

3206
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:15,520
instantly like built into the whole
 

3207
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:15,990
instantly like built into the whole
thing

3208
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
thing
 

3209
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,430
thing
once you proceed so i wanted to get back

3210
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,440
once you proceed so i wanted to get back
 

3211
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,790
once you proceed so i wanted to get back
to your point about hierarchical

3212
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
to your point about hierarchical
 

3213
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,510
to your point about hierarchical
representation

3214
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
representation
 

3215
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,150
representation
the world itself is hierarchical right

3216
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
the world itself is hierarchical right
 

3217
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,670
the world itself is hierarchical right
and i can take this microphone in front

3218
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
and i can take this microphone in front
 

3219
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,109
and i can take this microphone in front
of me i know inside there's going to be

3220
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
of me i know inside there's going to be
 

3221
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,390
of me i know inside there's going to be
some electronics i know there's going to

3222
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
some electronics i know there's going to
 

3223
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,510
some electronics i know there's going to
be some wires and i know there's going

3224
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
be some wires and i know there's going
 

3225
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,069
be some wires and i know there's going
to be a little

3226
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
to be a little
 

3227
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,470
to be a little
diaphragm that moves back and forth i

3228
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
diaphragm that moves back and forth i
 

3229
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,710
diaphragm that moves back and forth i
don't see that but i know it

3230
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
don't see that but i know it
 

3231
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,990
don't see that but i know it
so everything in the world is

3232
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
so everything in the world is
 

3233
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,990
so everything in the world is
hierarchical you just go into room it's

3234
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
hierarchical you just go into room it's
 

3235
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,589
hierarchical you just go into room it's
composed of other components the kitchen

3236
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
composed of other components the kitchen
 

3237
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,030
composed of other components the kitchen
has a refrigerator you know

3238
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
has a refrigerator you know
 

3239
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,630
has a refrigerator you know
the refrigerator has a door the door has

3240
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
the refrigerator has a door the door has
 

3241
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,390
the refrigerator has a door the door has
a hinge the hinge has screws and pin

3242
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:42,400
a hinge the hinge has screws and pin
 

3243
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,190
a hinge the hinge has screws and pin
yeah i mean

3244
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
yeah i mean
 

3245
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,910
yeah i mean
so anyway the the the modeling system

3246
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
so anyway the the the modeling system
 

3247
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,069
so anyway the the the modeling system
that exists in every cortical column

3248
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
that exists in every cortical column
 

3249
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,630
that exists in every cortical column
learns the hierarchical structure of

3250
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
learns the hierarchical structure of
 

3251
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,510
learns the hierarchical structure of
objects

3252
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,520
objects
 

3253
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,270
objects
so it's a very sophisticated modeling

3254
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
so it's a very sophisticated modeling
 

3255
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,710
so it's a very sophisticated modeling
system in this grain of rice it's hard

3256
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
system in this grain of rice it's hard
 

3257
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,230
system in this grain of rice it's hard
to imagine but this grain of ice can do

3258
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,240
to imagine but this grain of ice can do
 

3259
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,750
to imagine but this grain of ice can do
really sophisticated things it's got a

3260
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
really sophisticated things it's got a
 

3261
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,230
really sophisticated things it's got a
hundred thousand neurons in it

3262
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,240
hundred thousand neurons in it
 

3263
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,069
hundred thousand neurons in it
it's very sophisticated so that same

3264
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
it's very sophisticated so that same
 

3265
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,630
it's very sophisticated so that same
mechanism that can model a water bottle

3266
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:06,640
mechanism that can model a water bottle
 

3267
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,549
mechanism that can model a water bottle
or a coffee cup can model conceptual

3268
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
or a coffee cup can model conceptual
 

3269
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,430
or a coffee cup can model conceptual
objects as well

3270
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
objects as well
 

3271
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,470
objects as well
it's if that's the beauty of this

3272
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
it's if that's the beauty of this
 

3273
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,990
it's if that's the beauty of this

that
 

3279
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,230
that
there's there's a single cortical

3280
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
there's there's a single cortical
 

3281
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,670
there's there's a single cortical
algorithm underlying everything we're

3282
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:19,680
algorithm underlying everything we're
 

3283
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,870

doing
 

3285
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,829
doing
so so common sense concepts and higher

3286
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
so so common sense concepts and higher
 

3287
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,430
so so common sense concepts and higher
level concepts are all

3288
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
level concepts are all
 

3289
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,109

3291
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,950
represented in the same way they're set
in the same mechanisms yeah

3292
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
in the same mechanisms yeah
 

3293
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,630
in the same mechanisms yeah
it's a little bit like computers right

3294
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
it's a little bit like computers right
 

3295
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,230
it's a little bit like computers right
all computers are universal turing

3296
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
all computers are universal turing

00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
and the big one that's you know running
 

3305
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,589

some cloud server or someplace
 

3307
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,030
some cloud server or someplace
um they're all running on the same

3308
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
um they're all running on the same
 

3309
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,230
um they're all running on the same
principle they can apply different

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,630
things
so the brain is all built on the same

applied to
 

3325
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,549
applied to
something as simple as a water bottle in

3326
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
something as simple as a water bottle in
 

3327
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,150
something as simple as a water bottle in
a coffee cup and it can be just thinking

3328
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
a coffee cup and it can be just thinking
 

3329
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,069
a coffee cup and it can be just thinking
like what's the future of humanity and

3330
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
like what's the future of humanity and
 

3331
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,109
like what's the future of humanity and
you know why do you have a hedgehog on

3332
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:01,119
you know why do you have a hedgehog on
 

3333
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:01,430
you know why do you have a hedgehog on
your

3334
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
your
 

3335
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,510

on your desk i don't know nobody knows

3336
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:05,520
on your desk i don't know nobody knows
 

3337
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,349
on your desk i don't know nobody knows
i think it's hedgehog that's right it's

3338
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
i think it's hedgehog that's right it's
 

3339
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,349
i think it's hedgehog that's right it's
a hedgehog in the fog

3340
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
a hedgehog in the fog
 

3341
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,589
a hedgehog in the fog
it's a russian reference does it give

3342
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:11,599
it's a russian reference does it give
 

3343
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,069
it's a russian reference does it give
you any

3344
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:14,079
you any
 

3345
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,309
you any
inclination or hope about how difficult

it is to engineer

3348
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
it is to engineer
 

3349
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,990
it is to engineer
common sense reasoning so how

3350
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
common sense reasoning so how
 

3351
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,870
common sense reasoning so how
complicated this

3352
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:20,880
complicated this
 

3353
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,630
complicated this
is this whole process so looking at the

3354
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
is this whole process so looking at the
 

3355
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,549
is this whole process so looking at the
brain

3356
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:24,559
brain
 

3357
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,670
brain
is this a marvel of engineering or is it

3358
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
is this a marvel of engineering or is it
 

3359
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,670
is this a marvel of engineering or is it
pretty dumb stuff stacked on top of each

3360
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
pretty dumb stuff stacked on top of each
 

3361
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,230
pretty dumb stuff stacked on top of each
other over and over

3362
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,240
other over and over
 

3363
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,589
other over and over
can it be both can it be both right

3364
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599
can it be both can it be both right
 

3365
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,910
can it be both can it be both right
i don't know if it can be both because

3366
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
i don't know if it can be both because
 

3367
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,030
i don't know if it can be both because
uh

3368
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,040
uh
 

3369
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,510
uh
if it's an incredible engineering job

3370
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
if it's an incredible engineering job
 

3371
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,549
if it's an incredible engineering job
that means it's

3372
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:42,559
that means it's
 

3373
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,670
that means it's
v so evolution did a lot of work it

3374
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
v so evolution did a lot of work it
 

3375
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,069
v so evolution did a lot of work it
uh yeah but then but then it just copied

3376
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
uh yeah but then but then it just copied
 

3377
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,349
uh yeah but then but then it just copied
that

3378
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
that
 

3379
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,150
that
right so as i said earlier the figuring

3380
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
right so as i said earlier the figuring
 

3381
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,589
right so as i said earlier the figuring
out how to model something

3382
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
out how to model something
 

3383
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,910
out how to model something
like a space is really hard and

3384
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
like a space is really hard and
 

3385
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,430
like a space is really hard and
evolution had to go through a lot of

3386
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440
evolution had to go through a lot of
 

3387
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,430
evolution had to go through a lot of
trick and these these these cells i was

3388
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
trick and these these these cells i was
 

3389
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,549
trick and these these these cells i was
talking about these grid cells and place

3390
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
talking about these grid cells and place
 

3391
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,990
talking about these grid cells and place
cells they're really complicated this is

3392
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
cells they're really complicated this is
 

3393
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,030
cells they're really complicated this is
not simple stuff

3394
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,040
not simple stuff
 

3395
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,190
not simple stuff
this neural tissue works on these really

3396
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
this neural tissue works on these really
 

3397
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,710
this neural tissue works on these really
unexpected weird mechanisms um

3398
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
unexpected weird mechanisms um
 

3399
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,349
unexpected weird mechanisms um
but it did it it figured it out but but

3400
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
but it did it it figured it out but but
 

3401
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,030
but it did it it figured it out but but
now you can just make lots of copies of

3402
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
now you can just make lots of copies of
 

3403
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,589
now you can just make lots of copies of
it

3404
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:13,599
it
 

3405
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,069
it
but then finding yeah so it's a very

3406
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
but then finding yeah so it's a very
 

3407
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,309
but then finding yeah so it's a very
interesting idea that's a lot of copies

3408
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
interesting idea that's a lot of copies
 

3409
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,349
interesting idea that's a lot of copies
of a basic mini brain

3410
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
of a basic mini brain
 

3411
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,230
of a basic mini brain
but the question is how difficult it is

3412
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
but the question is how difficult it is
 

3413
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,670
but the question is how difficult it is
to find that mini brain that you can

3414
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
to find that mini brain that you can
 

3415
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,910
to find that mini brain that you can
copy and paste

3416
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
copy and paste
 

3417
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,109
copy and paste
uh effectively okay today we

3418
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:31,119
uh effectively okay today we
 

3419
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,230
uh effectively okay today we
know enough to build this i'm sitting

3420
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
know enough to build this i'm sitting
 

3421
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,870
know enough to build this i'm sitting
here with

3422
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
here with
 

3423
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,549
here with
you know i know the steps we have to go

3424
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
you know i know the steps we have to go
 

3425
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,910
you know i know the steps we have to go
there's still some engineering problems

3426
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
there's still some engineering problems
 

3427
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,790
there's still some engineering problems
to solve

3428
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:38,800
to solve
 

3429
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,069
to solve
but we know enough and this is not like

3430
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
but we know enough and this is not like
 

3431
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,510
but we know enough and this is not like
oh this is an interesting idea

3432
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
oh this is an interesting idea
 

3433
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,870
oh this is an interesting idea
we have to go think about it for another

3434
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
we have to go think about it for another
 

3435
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,710
we have to go think about it for another
few decades no we actually understand in

3436
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
few decades no we actually understand in
 

3437
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,150
few decades no we actually understand in
pretty well details

3438
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
pretty well details
 

3439
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,829
pretty well details
so not all the details but most of them

3440
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
so not all the details but most of them
 

3441
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,069
so not all the details but most of them
so it's complicated but it is an

3442
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,079
so it's complicated but it is an
 

3443
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,349
so it's complicated but it is an
engineering problem

3444
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
engineering problem
 

3445
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,510
engineering problem
so in my company we are working on that

3446
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
so in my company we are working on that
 

3447
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,630
so in my company we are working on that
we are basically

3448
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
we are basically
 

3449
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,829
we are basically
a road map how we do this um it's not

3450
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:01,839
a road map how we do this um it's not
 

3451
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:02,870
a road map how we do this um it's not
going to take decades

3452
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
going to take decades
 

3453
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,910
going to take decades
it's better a few years um

3454
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:04,920
it's better a few years um
 

3455
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,230
it's better a few years um
[Music]

3456
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
[Music]
 

3457
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,589
[Music]
optimistically but i think that's

3458
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
optimistically but i think that's
 

3459
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,750
optimistically but i think that's
possible um

3460
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
possible um
 

3461
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,270
possible um
it's you know complex things if you

3462
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
it's you know complex things if you
 

3463
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,790
it's you know complex things if you
understand them you can build them

3464
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
understand them you can build them
 

3465
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,549
understand them you can build them
so in which domain do you think it's

3466
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
so in which domain do you think it's
 

3467
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,470
so in which domain do you think it's
best to

3468
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
best to
 

3469
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,670
best to
build them are we talking about robotics

3470
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
build them are we talking about robotics
 

3471
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,630
build them are we talking about robotics
like

3472
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
like
 

3473
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,950
like
uh entities that operate in the physical

3474
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
uh entities that operate in the physical
 

3475
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,309
uh entities that operate in the physical
world that are able to interact with

3476
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319
world that are able to interact with
 

3477
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,150
world that are able to interact with
that world are we talking about entities

3478
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
that world are we talking about entities
 

3479
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,910
that world are we talking about entities
that operate in the digital world

3480
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,920
that operate in the digital world
 

3481
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,710
that operate in the digital world
are we talking about something more like

3482
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
are we talking about something more like
 

3483
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,030
are we talking about something more like
uh

3484
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:31,040
uh
 

3485
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,190
uh
more specific like is done in the uh

3486
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
more specific like is done in the uh
 

3487
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,630
more specific like is done in the uh
machine learning community where you

3488
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
machine learning community where you
 

3489
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,470
machine learning community where you
look at natural language

3490
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
look at natural language
 

3491
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,670
look at natural language
or computer vision where do you think is

3492
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
or computer vision where do you think is
 

3493
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,390
or computer vision where do you think is
easiest it's the first it's the first

3494
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,400
easiest it's the first it's the first
 

3495
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,829
easiest it's the first it's the first
two more than the third one i would say

3496
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
two more than the third one i would say
 

3497
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,390
two more than the third one i would say
um again again let's just use computers

3498
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
um again again let's just use computers
 

3499
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,150
um again again let's just use computers
as an analogy

3500
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
as an analogy
 

3501
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,069
as an analogy
um the pioneers of computing people like

3502
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:52,079
um the pioneers of computing people like
 

3503
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,190
um the pioneers of computing people like
john van noyman and

3504
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
john van noyman and
 

3505
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,109
john van noyman and
um turing they created this thing you

3506
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:55,119
um turing they created this thing you
 

3507
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,030
um turing they created this thing you
know we now call the universal turing

3508
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,040
know we now call the universal turing
 

3509
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,190
know we now call the universal turing
machine which is the computer right

3510
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
machine which is the computer right
 

3511
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,309
machine which is the computer right
did they know how it was going to be

3512
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
did they know how it was going to be
 

3513
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,910
did they know how it was going to be
applied where it was going to be used

3514
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
applied where it was going to be used
 

3515
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,870
applied where it was going to be used
you know could they

3516
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
you know could they
 

3517
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,630
you know could they
envision any of the future no they just

3518
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
envision any of the future no they just
 

3519
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,470
envision any of the future no they just
said this is like a really interesting

3520
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
said this is like a really interesting
 

3521
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,589
said this is like a really interesting
computational idea about algorithms

3522
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
computational idea about algorithms
 

3523
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,150
computational idea about algorithms
and how you can implement them in in a

3524
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,160
and how you can implement them in in a
 

3525
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,589
and how you can implement them in in a
machine

3526
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:13,599
machine
 

3527
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,069
machine
and we're doing something similar to

3528
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
and we're doing something similar to
 

3529
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,670
and we're doing something similar to
that today like we are

3530
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
that today like we are
 

3531
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,349
that today like we are
we are building this sort of universal

3532
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,359
we are building this sort of universal
 

3533
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,190
we are building this sort of universal
learning principle

3534
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,200
learning principle
 

3535
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,950
learning principle
that can be applied to many many

3536
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
that can be applied to many many
 

3537
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,470
that can be applied to many many
different things

3538
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
different things
 

3539
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,870
different things
but the the robotics piece of that okay

3540
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
but the the robotics piece of that okay
 

3541
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,549
but the the robotics piece of that okay
the interactive okay all right let's

3542
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
the interactive okay all right let's
 

3543
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,309
the interactive okay all right let's
be specific you can think of this

3544
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:30,319
be specific you can think of this
 

3545
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,910
be specific you can think of this
cortical column as this what we call a

3546
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
cortical column as this what we call a
 

3547
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,510
cortical column as this what we call a

do you think there's going to be some
kind of impact

3706
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
kind of impact
 

3707
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,510
kind of impact
okay let me ask it another way what do

3708
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
okay let me ask it another way what do
 

3709
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,549
okay let me ask it another way what do
uh increasingly intelligent ai systems

uh increasingly intelligent ai systems
 

3711
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,750
uh increasingly intelligent ai systems
do with us humans in the following way

3712
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
do with us humans in the following way
 

3713
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,710
do with us humans in the following way
like how hard is the human in the loop

so how hard is it to fit into our little

3726
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
so how hard is it to fit into our little
 

3727

human world
 

3729
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,829
human world
uh i don't i think it's a lot of

3730
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:21,839
uh i don't i think it's a lot of
 

3731
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,670
uh i don't i think it's a lot of
engineering problems i don't think it's

3732
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
engineering problems i don't think it's
 

3733
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,990
engineering problems i don't think it's
a fundamental problem i could ask you

3734
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
a fundamental problem i could ask you
 

3735
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,270
a fundamental problem i could ask you
the same question how hard is for

3736
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:27,280
the same question how hard is for
 

3737
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,430
the same question how hard is for
computers to fit into a human world

3738

00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
right that i mean that's essentially
 

3741
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,270
right that i mean that's essentially
what i'm asking like how

3742
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:33,280
what i'm asking like how
 

3743
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,190
what i'm asking like how
um much are we uh elitist are we as

3744
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
um much are we uh elitist are we as
 

3745
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,230
um much are we uh elitist are we as
humans

humans
 

3747
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,589
humans
like we try to keep out uh systems

3748
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:41,599
like we try to keep out uh systems
 

3749
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,870
like we try to keep out uh systems
i don't know i i sure i think i'm not

3750
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
i don't know i i sure i think i'm not
 

3751
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,710
i don't know i i sure i think i'm not
sure that's the right question

3752
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
sure that's the right question
 

3753
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,230
sure that's the right question
let's let's look at computers as an

00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:48,240
let's let's look at computers as an
 

3755
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,390
let's let's look at computers as an
analogy computers are million times

3756
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
analogy computers are million times
 

3757
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,069
analogy computers are million times
faster than us they do things we can't

3758
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
faster than us they do things we can't
 

3759
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,349
faster than us they do things we can't
understand most people have no idea

00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
understand most people have no idea
 

3761
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,030
understand most people have no idea
what's going on when they use computers

3762
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
what's going on when they use computers
 

3763
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,349
what's going on when they use computers
right how do we integrate them in our

3764
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
right how do we integrate them in our
 

3765
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,069
right how do we integrate them in our
society

3766
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
society
 

3767
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,710
society
um well they're that we don't think of

3768
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
um well they're that we don't think of
 

3769
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,910
um well they're that we don't think of
them as their own entities

3770
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
them as their own entities
 

3771
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,630
them as their own entities
they're not living things um we don't

3772
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:04,640
they're not living things um we don't
 

3773
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,230
they're not living things um we don't
afford them rights

3774
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
afford them rights
 

3775
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,349
afford them rights
um we uh we rely on them

3776
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
um we uh we rely on them
 

3777
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,470
um we uh we rely on them
our survival as a seven billion people

3778
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,480
our survival as a seven billion people
 

3779
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,270
our survival as a seven billion people
or something like that

3780
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280
or something like that
 

3781
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,309
or something like that
is relying on computers now um don't you

3782
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
is relying on computers now um don't you
 

3783
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,309
is relying on computers now um don't you
think that's a fundamental problem

3784
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
think that's a fundamental problem
 

3785
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,109
think that's a fundamental problem
that we see them as something we can't

3786
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
that we see them as something we can't
 

3787
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,390
that we see them as something we can't
we don't give rights to

3788
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
we don't give rights to
 

3789
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,109
we don't give rights to
so computers so yeah computers so uh

3790
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:25,119
so computers so yeah computers so uh
 

3791
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,270
so computers so yeah computers so uh
robots computers intelligence systems it

3792
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,280
robots computers intelligence systems it
 

3793
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,789
robots computers intelligence systems it
feels like for them to operate

3794
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
feels like for them to operate
 

3795
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,990
feels like for them to operate
successfully

3796
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
successfully
 

3797
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,870
successfully
they would need to have a lot of the

3798
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:32,880
they would need to have a lot of the
 

3799
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,750
they would need to have a lot of the
elements

3800
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
elements
 

3801
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,470
elements
that we would start having to think

3802
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
that we would start having to think
 

3803
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,829
that we would start having to think
about like

3804
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
about like
 

3805
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,230
about like
should this entity have rights i i don't

3806
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
should this entity have rights i i don't
 

3807
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,950
should this entity have rights i i don't
think so i

3808
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:40,960
think so i
 

3809
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,390
think so i
i think it's tempting to think that way

3810
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:44,400
i think it's tempting to think that way
 

3811
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,829
i think it's tempting to think that way
personally i don't think anyone hardly

3812
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
personally i don't think anyone hardly
 

3813
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,670
personally i don't think anyone hardly
anyone thinks that for computers today

3814
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
anyone thinks that for computers today
 

3815
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,030
anyone thinks that for computers today
no one says oh this thing

3816
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:49,040
no one says oh this thing
 

3817
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,309
no one says oh this thing
needs a right i shouldn't be able to

3818
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
needs a right i shouldn't be able to
 

3819
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,390
needs a right i shouldn't be able to
turn it off or you know if i throw it in

3820
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,400
turn it off or you know if i throw it in
 

3821
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,109
turn it off or you know if i throw it in
the trash can

3822
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
the trash can
 

3823
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,470
the trash can
you know and hit it with a sledgehammer

3824
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
you know and hit it with a sledgehammer
 

3825
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,870
you know and hit it with a sledgehammer
i might perform a criminal act no no one

3826
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:56,880
i might perform a criminal act no no one
 

3827
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,990
i might perform a criminal act no no one
thinks that

3828
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,000
thinks that
 

3829
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,470
thinks that
um and now we think about intelligent

3830
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
um and now we think about intelligent
 

3831
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,349
um and now we think about intelligent
machines

3832
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:01,359
machines
 

3833
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,470
machines
which is where you're going um

3834
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,480
which is where you're going um
 

3835
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,109
which is where you're going um
and and all of a sudden like well now we

3836
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
and and all of a sudden like well now we
 

3837
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,230
and and all of a sudden like well now we
can't do that

3838
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:08,240
can't do that
 

3839
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,069
can't do that
i think the basic problem we have here

3840
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
i think the basic problem we have here
 

3841
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,030
i think the basic problem we have here
is that people think intelligent

3842
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
is that people think intelligent
 

3843
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,549
is that people think intelligent
machines will be like us

3844
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
machines will be like us
 

3845
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,990
machines will be like us
they're going to have the same emotions

3846
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
they're going to have the same emotions
 

3847
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,309
they're going to have the same emotions
as we do the same feelings as we do

3848
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
as we do the same feelings as we do
 

3849
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,510
as we do the same feelings as we do
what if i can build an intelligent

3850
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:17,520
what if i can build an intelligent
 

3851
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,589
what if i can build an intelligent
machine that have absolutely could care

3852
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
machine that have absolutely could care
 

3853
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,109
machine that have absolutely could care
less about whether it was on or off or

3854
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
less about whether it was on or off or
 

3855
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,069
less about whether it was on or off or
destroyed or not

3856
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
destroyed or not
 

3857
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,430
destroyed or not
it just doesn't care it's just like a

3858
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:23,440
it just doesn't care it's just like a
 

3859
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,430
it just doesn't care it's just like a
map it's just a modeling system

3860
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:25,440
map it's just a modeling system
 

3861
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,470
map it's just a modeling system
it has no desires to live nothing

3862
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
it has no desires to live nothing
 

3863
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,750
it has no desires to live nothing
is it possible to create a system that

3864
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
is it possible to create a system that
 

3865
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,349
is it possible to create a system that
can model the world deeply and not care

3866
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
can model the world deeply and not care
 

3867
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,789
can model the world deeply and not care
about whether it lives or dies

3868
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
about whether it lives or dies
 

3869
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,630
about whether it lives or dies
absolutely no question about it

3870
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
absolutely no question about it
 

3871
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,270
absolutely no question about it
to me that's not 100 percent obvious

3872
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
to me that's not 100 percent obvious
 

3873
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,710
to me that's not 100 percent obvious
it's obvious to me so okay

3874
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720
it's obvious to me so okay
 

3875
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,870
it's obvious to me so okay
we can debate it if you want yeah where

3876
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
we can debate it if you want yeah where
 

3877
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,030
we can debate it if you want yeah where
does your where does your desire to live

3878
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,040
does your where does your desire to live
 

3879
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,230
does your where does your desire to live
come from

3880
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,240
come from
 

3881
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,750
come from
it's an old evolutionary design

3882
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
it's an old evolutionary design
 

3883
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,030
it's an old evolutionary design
i mean we could argue does it really

3884
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
i mean we could argue does it really
 

3885
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,470
i mean we could argue does it really
matter if we live or not objectively no

3886
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,480
matter if we live or not objectively no
 

3887
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,630
matter if we live or not objectively no
right we're all going to die eventually

3888
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:58,640
right we're all going to die eventually
 

3889
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,549
right we're all going to die eventually
um

3890
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
um
 

3891
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,030
um
but evolution makes us want to live

3892
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
but evolution makes us want to live
 

3893
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,109
but evolution makes us want to live
evolution makes us want to fight to live

3894
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
evolution makes us want to fight to live
 

3895
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,870
evolution makes us want to fight to live
evolutionists want to care and love one

3896
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
evolutionists want to care and love one
 

3897
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,190
evolutionists want to care and love one
another and to care for our children

3898
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,200
another and to care for our children
 

3899
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,670
another and to care for our children
and our relatives and our family and and

3900
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
and our relatives and our family and and
 

3901
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,950
and our relatives and our family and and
so on

3902
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
so on
 

3903
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,589
so on
and those are all good things but they

3904
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
and those are all good things but they
 

3905
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,670
and those are all good things but they
come about not because we're smart

3906
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
come about not because we're smart
 

3907
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,670
come about not because we're smart
because we're animals that grew up you

3908
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
because we're animals that grew up you
 

3909
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,510
because we're animals that grew up you
know the the hummingbird in my backyard

3910
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
know the the hummingbird in my backyard
 

3911
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,950
know the the hummingbird in my backyard
cares about its offspring

3912
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
cares about its offspring
 

3913
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,510
cares about its offspring
you know the every living thing in some

3914
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,520
you know the every living thing in some
 

3915
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,109
you know the every living thing in some
sense cares about you know

3916
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
sense cares about you know
 

3917
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,750
sense cares about you know
surviving but when we talk about

3918
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:29,760
surviving but when we talk about
 

3919
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,030
surviving but when we talk about
creating intelligent machines we're not

3920
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,040
creating intelligent machines we're not
 

3921
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,589
creating intelligent machines we're not
creating

3922
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
creating
 

3923
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,589
creating
life we're not creating evolving

3924
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
life we're not creating evolving
 

3925
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,950
life we're not creating evolving
creatures we're not creating

3926
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
creatures we're not creating
 

3927
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,950
creatures we're not creating
living things we're just creating a

3928
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
living things we're just creating a
 

3929
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,470
living things we're just creating a
machine that can learn

3930
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
machine that can learn
 

3931
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,150
machine that can learn
really sophisticated stuff and that

3932
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
really sophisticated stuff and that
 

3933
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,670
really sophisticated stuff and that
machine it may even be able to talk to

3934
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
machine it may even be able to talk to
 

3935
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,549
machine it may even be able to talk to
us

3936
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:42,559
us
 

3937
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,230
us
but it doesn't it's not going to have a

3938
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:44,240
but it doesn't it's not going to have a
 

3939
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,670
but it doesn't it's not going to have a
desire to live

3940
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
desire to live
 

3941
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,670
desire to live
unless somehow we put it into that

3942
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
unless somehow we put it into that
 

3943
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,950
unless somehow we put it into that
system well

3944
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
system well
 

3945
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,270
system well
there's learning right the the thing is

3946
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
there's learning right the the thing is
 

3947
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,190
there's learning right the the thing is
but you don't learn to like want to live

3948
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
but you don't learn to like want to live
 

3949
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,309
but you don't learn to like want to live
that's built into you it's wow people

3950
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:56,319
that's built into you it's wow people
 

3951
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,309
that's built into you it's wow people
like ernest becker argue

3952
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
like ernest becker argue
 

3953
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,549
like ernest becker argue
so okay uh there's the fact the

3954
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
so okay uh there's the fact the
 

3955
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,710
so okay uh there's the fact the
finiteness of life

3956
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,720
finiteness of life
 

3957
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,430
finiteness of life
the way we think about it is something

3958
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
the way we think about it is something
 

3959
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,710
the way we think about it is something
we learn

3960
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:06,720
we learn
 

3961
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,510
we learn
uh perhaps so okay yeah and some people

3962
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
uh perhaps so okay yeah and some people
 

3963
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,030
uh perhaps so okay yeah and some people
decide they don't want to live

3964
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,040
decide they don't want to live
 

3965
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,270
decide they don't want to live
and some people decide you know you can

3966
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
and some people decide you know you can
 

3967
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,270
and some people decide you know you can
but the desire to live is built in dna

3968
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:15,280
but the desire to live is built in dna
 

3969
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:15,589
but the desire to live is built in dna
right

3970
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
right
 

3971
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,910
right
but i think what i'm trying to get to is

3972
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
but i think what i'm trying to get to is
 

3973
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,910
but i think what i'm trying to get to is
uh in order to accomplish goals

3974
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:19,920
uh in order to accomplish goals
 

3975
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,829
uh in order to accomplish goals
it's useful to have the urgency of

3976
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
it's useful to have the urgency of
 

3977
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,510
it's useful to have the urgency of
mortality is what the stoics talked

3978
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
mortality is what the stoics talked
 

3979
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,069
mortality is what the stoics talked
about

3980
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:24,079
about
 

3981
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,470
about
is meditating in your mortality yeah it

3982
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,480
is meditating in your mortality yeah it
 

3983
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,710
is meditating in your mortality yeah it
might be a very useful

3984
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,720
might be a very useful
 

3985
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,549
might be a very useful
thing to do to die and have the urgency

3986
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
thing to do to die and have the urgency
 

3987
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,510
thing to do to die and have the urgency
of death

3988
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
of death
 

3989
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,910
of death
and to realize that to uh conceive

3990
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
and to realize that to uh conceive
 

3991
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,829
and to realize that to uh conceive
yourself as an entity

3992
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
yourself as an entity
 

3993
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,430
yourself as an entity
that operates in this world that

3994
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
that operates in this world that
 

3995
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,270
that operates in this world that
eventually will no longer be a part of

3996
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
eventually will no longer be a part of
 

3997
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,030
eventually will no longer be a part of
this world and actually conceive of

3998
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
this world and actually conceive of
 

3999
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,030
this world and actually conceive of
yourself as a conscious entity might be

4000
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:45,040
yourself as a conscious entity might be
 

4001
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,309
yourself as a conscious entity might be
very useful

4002
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:46,319
very useful
 

4003
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,349
very useful
for you to be a system that makes sense

4004
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:49,359
for you to be a system that makes sense
 

4005
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,230
for you to be a system that makes sense
of the world

4006
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
of the world
 

4007
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,270
of the world
otherwise you might get lazy well okay

4008
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
otherwise you might get lazy well okay
 

4009
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,710
otherwise you might get lazy well okay
we're going to build these machines

4010
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
we're going to build these machines
 

4011
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,470
we're going to build these machines
right and so we're talking about

4012
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
right and so we're talking about
 

4013
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,109
right and so we're talking about
building

4014
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
building
 

4015
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,589
building
ais what but we're we're building the uh

4016
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
ais what but we're we're building the uh
 

4017
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,430
ais what but we're we're building the uh
uh the the the equivalent of the

4018
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
uh the the the equivalent of the
 

4019
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,829
uh the the the equivalent of the
cortical columns the uh the neocortex

4020
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:05,839
cortical columns the uh the neocortex
 

4021
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,470
cortical columns the uh the neocortex
the neocortex and the the question is

4022
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
the neocortex and the the question is
 

4023
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,349
the neocortex and the the question is
where do they

4024
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
where do they
 

4025
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,789
where do they
arrive at because we're not hard-coding

4026
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
arrive at because we're not hard-coding
 

4027
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:13,910
arrive at because we're not hard-coding
everything in

where uh well well in terms of if you
 

4031
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,230
where uh well well in terms of if you
build the neocortex equivalent

4032
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
build the neocortex equivalent
 

4033
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,470
build the neocortex equivalent
it will not have any of these desires or

4034
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
it will not have any of these desires or
 

4035
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,829
it will not have any of these desires or
emotional states now you can

4036
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
emotional states now you can
 

4037
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,630
emotional states now you can
argue that that neocortex won't be

4038
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
argue that that neocortex won't be
 

4039
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,510
argue that that neocortex won't be

why is that obvious to you why why why

why is that obvious to you why why why
 

4069
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,549
why is that obvious to you why why why
don't do you think it's

4070
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
don't do you think it's
 

4071
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,470
don't do you think it's
okay let me ask it this way do you think

4072
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,480
okay let me ask it this way do you think
 

4073
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,829
okay let me ask it this way do you think
it's possible

it's possible
 

4075
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,870
it's possible
it will at least assign to itself

01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:54,880
it will at least assign to itself
 

4077
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,870
it will at least assign to itself
agency and perceive

and and to make sense of the world
 

4087
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,710
and and to make sense of the world
i think intelligent machine could be

4088
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
i think intelligent machine could be
 

4089
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,630
i think intelligent machine could be
conscious but that doesn't not

4090
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,640
conscious but that doesn't not
 

4091
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,109
conscious but that doesn't not
again imply any of these um these

4092
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
again imply any of these um these
 

4093
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,309
again imply any of these um these
desires and goals and

4094
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
desires and goals and
 

4095
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,109
desires and goals and
and that you're worried about it we can

4096
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119
and that you're worried about it we can
 

4097
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,150
and that you're worried about it we can
i have a

4098
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,160
i have a
 

4099
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,270
i have a
we can talk about what it means for the

4100
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
we can talk about what it means for the
 

4101
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,029
we can talk about what it means for the
machine to be conscious and by the way

4102
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
machine to be conscious and by the way
 

4103
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,029
machine to be conscious and by the way
not worry about but get excited about

4104
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:23,039
not worry about but get excited about
 

4105
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,309
not worry about but get excited about
it's not necessarily that we should

4106
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:24,319
it's not necessarily that we should
 

4107
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,069
it's not necessarily that we should
worry about it so i think there's a

4108
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
worry about it so i think there's a
 

4109
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,270
worry about it so i think there's a
legitimate

4110
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
legitimate
 

4111
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,190
legitimate
problem or not problem a question asked

4112
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
problem or not problem a question asked
 

4113
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,029
problem or not problem a question asked
if you build this modeling system what's

4114
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:31,039
if you build this modeling system what's
 

4115
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,230
if you build this modeling system what's
it gonna model

4116
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
it gonna model
 

4117
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,950
it gonna model
yes right what's it what's its desire

4118
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
yes right what's it what's its desire
 

4119
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,309
yes right what's it what's its desire
what is it what's its goal what are we

4120
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
what is it what's its goal what are we
 

4121
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,430
what is it what's its goal what are we
applying it to

4122
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
applying it to
 

4123
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,670
applying it to
right so that's an interesting question

4124
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
right so that's an interesting question
 

4125
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,950
right so that's an interesting question
um

4126
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
um
 

4127
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,950
um
one thing if it and it depends on the

4128
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:42,960
one thing if it and it depends on the
 

4129
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,150
one thing if it and it depends on the
application

4130
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
application
 

4131
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,750
application
it's not something that inherent to the

4132
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
it's not something that inherent to the
 

4133
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,349
it's not something that inherent to the
modeling system it's something we apply

4134
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:47,359
modeling system it's something we apply
 

4135
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,950
modeling system it's something we apply
to the modeling system in a particular

4136
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
to the modeling system in a particular
 

4137
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,510
to the modeling system in a particular
way

4138
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
way
 

4139
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,109
way
so if i wanted to make a really smart

4140
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
so if i wanted to make a really smart
 

4141
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,750
so if i wanted to make a really smart
car it would have to know

4142
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
car it would have to know
 

4143
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,470
car it would have to know
about driving in cars and what's

4144
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
about driving in cars and what's
 

4145
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,309
about driving in cars and what's
important in driving in cars

4146
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
important in driving in cars
 

4147
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,670
important in driving in cars
it's not going to figure that out on its

4148
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
it's not going to figure that out on its
 

4149
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,710
it's not going to figure that out on its
own it's not going to sit there and say

4150
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
own it's not going to sit there and say
 

4151
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,390
own it's not going to sit there and say
you know i've understood the world

4152
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
you know i've understood the world
 

4153
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,950
you know i've understood the world
and i've decided you know no no no we

4154
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:04,960
and i've decided you know no no no we
 

4155
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,990
and i've decided you know no no no we
have to tell it we're going to have to

4156
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
have to tell it we're going to have to
 

4157
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,710
have to tell it we're going to have to
say like

4158
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:06,720
say like
 

4159
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,390
say like
so i imagine i make this car really

4160
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,400
so i imagine i make this car really
 

4161
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,230
so i imagine i make this car really
smart it learns about your driving

4162
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
smart it learns about your driving
 

4163
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,150
smart it learns about your driving
habits it learns about the world

4164
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,160
habits it learns about the world
 

4165
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,230
habits it learns about the world
and it's just you know is it one day

4166
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,240
and it's just you know is it one day
 

4167
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,670
and it's just you know is it one day
going to wake up and say

4168
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:15,680
going to wake up and say
 

4169
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,990
going to wake up and say
you know what i'm tired of driving and

4170
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,000
you know what i'm tired of driving and
 

4171
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,870
you know what i'm tired of driving and
doing what you want

4172
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
doing what you want
 

4173
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,549
doing what you want
i think i have better ideas about how to

4174
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:20,559
i think i have better ideas about how to
 

4175
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,069
i think i have better ideas about how to
spend my time well

4176

spend my time well
 

4177
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,230
spend my time well
okay no it's not going to do that part

4178
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240
okay no it's not going to do that part
 

4179
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,829
okay no it's not going to do that part
of me is playing a little bit of devil's

of me is playing a little bit of devil's
 

4181
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,029
of me is playing a little bit of devil's
advocate but part of me

4182
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039
advocate but part of me
 

4183
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,270
advocate but part of me
is also trying to think through this

4184
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
is also trying to think through this
 

4185
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,069
is also trying to think through this
because

4186
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
because
 

4187
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,789
because
i've studied cars quite a bit and i

4188
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:32,799
i've studied cars quite a bit and i
 

4189
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:34,549
i've studied cars quite a bit and i
studied pedestrians and cyclists quite a

4190
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
studied pedestrians and cyclists quite a
 

4191
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,270
studied pedestrians and cyclists quite a
bit

4192
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
bit
 

4193
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,549
bit
and there's part of me that thinks

4194
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
and there's part of me that thinks
 

4195
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,750
and there's part of me that thinks
that there needs to be

4196
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:41,760

 

4197
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,750

more intelligence than we realize in

4198
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
more intelligence than we realize in
 

4199
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,230
more intelligence than we realize in
order to drive successfully

4200
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
order to drive successfully
 

4201
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,910
order to drive successfully
that game theory of human interaction

4202
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
that game theory of human interaction
 

4203
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,309
that game theory of human interaction
seems to require some deep understanding

4204
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
seems to require some deep understanding
 

4205
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,829
seems to require some deep understanding
of

4206
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
of
 

4207
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:58,390
of
of human nature that

4208
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:58,400
of human nature that
 

4209
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,309
of human nature that
okay when a pedestrian crosses the

4210
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:00,319
okay when a pedestrian crosses the
 

4211
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,789
okay when a pedestrian crosses the
street there's some sense

4212
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
street there's some sense
 

4213
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,829
street there's some sense
they they look at a car usually and then

4214
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
they they look at a car usually and then
 

4215
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,349
they they look at a car usually and then
they look away

4216
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:07,359
they look away
 

4217
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,230
they look away
there's some sense in which they say i

4218
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
there's some sense in which they say i
 

4219
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,069
there's some sense in which they say i
believe that you're not going to murder

4220
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:12,079
believe that you're not going to murder
 

4221
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:12,549
believe that you're not going to murder
me

4222
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:12,559
me
 

4223
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,630
me
you don't have the guts to murder me

4224
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
you don't have the guts to murder me
 

4225
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,630
you don't have the guts to murder me
this is the little dance of pedestrian

4226
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:16,640
this is the little dance of pedestrian
 

4227
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,750
this is the little dance of pedestrian
car interaction

4228
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
car interaction
 

4229
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,829
car interaction
yeah is saying i'm going to look away

4230
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:19,839
yeah is saying i'm going to look away
 

4231
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,270
yeah is saying i'm going to look away
and i'm going to put my

4232
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
and i'm going to put my
 

4233
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,069
and i'm going to put my
life in your hands because i think

4234
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
life in your hands because i think
 

4235
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,150
life in your hands because i think
you're human you're not gonna kill me

4236
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
you're human you're not gonna kill me
 

4237
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,990
you're human you're not gonna kill me
and then the car in order to

4238
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
and then the car in order to
 

4239
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,430
and then the car in order to
successfully operate in

4240
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
successfully operate in
 

4241
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,309
successfully operate in
like manhattan streets has to say no no

4242
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
like manhattan streets has to say no no
 

4243
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:32,789
like manhattan streets has to say no no
no

4244
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
no
 

4245
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,109
no
i am going to kill you like a little bit

4246
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
i am going to kill you like a little bit
 

4247
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,390
i am going to kill you like a little bit
there's a little bit of this weird

4248
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:36,400
there's a little bit of this weird
 

4249
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,589
there's a little bit of this weird
inkling of

4250
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
inkling of
 

4251
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,750
inkling of
mutual murder yeah yeah and that's a

4252
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
mutual murder yeah yeah and that's a
 

4253
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,029
mutual murder yeah yeah and that's a
dance and then somehow

4254
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
dance and then somehow
 

4255
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,710
dance and then somehow
successfully operate through do you

4256
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
successfully operate through do you
 

4257
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,829
successfully operate through do you
think you were born of that did you

4258
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
think you were born of that did you
 

4259
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,549
think you were born of that did you
learn that social interaction

4260
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559
learn that social interaction
 

4261
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,750
learn that social interaction
uh i think it might have a lot of the

4262
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
uh i think it might have a lot of the
 

4263
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,190
uh i think it might have a lot of the
same elements that you're talking about

4264
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
same elements that you're talking about
 

4265
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,870
same elements that you're talking about
which is we're leveraging

4266
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
which is we're leveraging
 

4267
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,950
which is we're leveraging
things we were born with and applying

4268
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
things we were born with and applying
 

4269
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,870
things we were born with and applying
them in the context

4270
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
them in the context
 

4271
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,349
them in the context
that uh all right i would i would answer

4272
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
that uh all right i would i would answer
 

4273
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,789
that uh all right i would i would answer
that i would have said that that kind of

4274
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
that i would have said that that kind of
 

4275
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:01,670
that i would have said that that kind of
interaction

4276
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
interaction
 

4277
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,589
interaction
is learned because you know people in

4278
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:03,599
is learned because you know people in
 

4279
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,710
is learned because you know people in
different cultures have different

4280
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
different cultures have different
 

4281
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,670
different cultures have different
interactions like that

4282
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
interactions like that
 

4283
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,789
interactions like that
if you cross the street in different

4284
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
if you cross the street in different
 

4285
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:07,990
if you cross the street in different
cities and different around the world

4286
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
cities and different around the world
 

4287
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,829
cities and different around the world
they have different ways of interacting

4288
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:09,839
they have different ways of interacting
 

4289
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,029
they have different ways of interacting
i would say that's learned and i would

4290
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
i would say that's learned and i would
 

4291
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,309
i would say that's learned and i would
say an intelligent system could learn

4292
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
say an intelligent system could learn
 

4293
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,510
say an intelligent system could learn
that too

4294
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:13,520
that too
 

4295
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,349
that too
but that does not lead and the

4296
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
but that does not lead and the
 

4297
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:19,109
but that does not lead and the
intelligent system can understand

4298
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
intelligent system can understand
 

4299
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,150
intelligent system can understand
humans it could understand that you know

4300
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
humans it could understand that you know
 

4301
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,390
humans it could understand that you know
just like i can study an animal and

4302
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
just like i can study an animal and
 

4303
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,829
just like i can study an animal and
learn something about that animal

4304
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
learn something about that animal
 

4305
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,190
learn something about that animal
you know i could study apes and learn

4306
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
you know i could study apes and learn
 

4307
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,029
you know i could study apes and learn
something about their culture and so on

4308
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:29,039
something about their culture and so on
 

4309
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,510
something about their culture and so on
i'd have to be an ape to know that um i

4310
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:31,520
i'd have to be an ape to know that um i
 

4311
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,230
i'd have to be an ape to know that um i
may not be

4312
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
may not be
 

4313
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,510
may not be
completely but i can understand

4314
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
completely but i can understand
 

4315
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,510
completely but i can understand
something so intel's machine can model

4316
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
something so intel's machine can model
 

4317
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,870
something so intel's machine can model
that that's this part of the world is

4318
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
that that's this part of the world is
 

4319
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,390
that that's this part of the world is
this part of the interactions

4320
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
this part of the interactions
 

4321
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,390
this part of the interactions
the question we're trying to get at will

4322
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
the question we're trying to get at will
 

4323
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,589
the question we're trying to get at will
the intelligent machine

4324
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:41,599
the intelligent machine
 

4325
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,510
the intelligent machine
have its own personal agency that's

4326
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
have its own personal agency that's
 

4327
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,670
have its own personal agency that's
beyond you know what we assign to it or

4328
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
beyond you know what we assign to it or
 

4329
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,270
beyond you know what we assign to it or
it's its own personal

4330
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
it's its own personal
 

4331
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,190
it's its own personal
you know goals or will it evolve and

4332
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
you know goals or will it evolve and
 

4333
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,789
you know goals or will it evolve and
create these things

4334
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
create these things
 

4335
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,270
create these things
my confidence comes from understanding

4336
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
my confidence comes from understanding
 

4337
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,309
my confidence comes from understanding
the mechanisms

4338
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:54,319
the mechanisms
 

4339
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,789
the mechanisms
i'm talking about creating this is not

4340
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
i'm talking about creating this is not
 

4341
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:57,829
i'm talking about creating this is not
hand wave stuff

4342
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
hand wave stuff
 

4343
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,829
hand wave stuff
it's down in the details we i'm going to

4344
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
it's down in the details we i'm going to
 

4345
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,349
it's down in the details we i'm going to
build it and i know what it's going to

4346
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:01,359
build it and i know what it's going to
 

4347
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,390
build it and i know what it's going to
look like and i know it's

4348
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
look like and i know it's
 

4349
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,589
look like and i know it's
going to behave i know what the kind of

4350
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:03,599
going to behave i know what the kind of
 

4351
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,710
going to behave i know what the kind of
things it could do and the kind of

4352
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:04,720
things it could do and the kind of
 

4353
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,829
things it could do and the kind of
things it can't do

4354
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
things it can't do
 

4355
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,910
things it can't do
just like when i build a computer i know

4356
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
just like when i build a computer i know
 

4357
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,589
just like when i build a computer i know
it's not going to on its own decide to

4358
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:09,599
it's not going to on its own decide to
 

4359
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,390
it's not going to on its own decide to
put another

4360
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
put another
 

4361
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,870
put another
register inside of it it can't do that

4362
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
register inside of it it can't do that
 

4363
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,510
register inside of it it can't do that
no way

4364
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
no way
 

4365
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,710
no way
no matter what your software does it

4366
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
no matter what your software does it
 

4367
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,630
no matter what your software does it
can't add a register to the computer

4368
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
can't add a register to the computer
 

4369
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,589
can't add a register to the computer
um so in this way when we build ai

4370
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
um so in this way when we build ai
 

4371
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:20,870
um so in this way when we build ai
systems

4372
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
systems
 

4373
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,990
systems
we have to make choices about the the

4374
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
we have to make choices about the the
 

4375
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,789
we have to make choices about the the
the under the how we embed them so i

4376
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
the under the how we embed them so i
 

4377
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:27,829
the under the how we embed them so i
talked about this in the book i said you

4378
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
talked about this in the book i said you
 

4379
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,309
talked about this in the book i said you
know

4380
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
know
 

4381
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,910
know
it's a brain intelligence system is not

4382
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:29,920
it's a brain intelligence system is not
 

4383
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,670
it's a brain intelligence system is not
just the neocortex equivalent

4384
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
just the neocortex equivalent
 

4385
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,230
just the neocortex equivalent
you have to have that but it has to have

4386
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
you have to have that but it has to have
 

4387
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,150
you have to have that but it has to have
some kind of embodiment physical a

4388
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
some kind of embodiment physical a
 

4389
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,789
some kind of embodiment physical a
virtual

4390
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:36,799
virtual
 

4391
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,390
virtual
it has to have some sort of goals it has

4392
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
it has to have some sort of goals it has
 

4393
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,470
it has to have some sort of goals it has
to have some sort of uh ideas about

4394
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480
to have some sort of uh ideas about
 

4395
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,150
to have some sort of uh ideas about
dangers about things it shouldn't do

4396
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
dangers about things it shouldn't do
 

4397
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,309
dangers about things it shouldn't do
like you know like we

4398
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
like you know like we
 

4399
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,710
like you know like we
we build in safeguards into systems uh

4400
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
we build in safeguards into systems uh
 

4401
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,069
we build in safeguards into systems uh
we have them in our bodies we have put

4402
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:48,079
we have them in our bodies we have put
 

4403
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,190
we have them in our bodies we have put
them into cars

4404
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
them into cars
 

4405
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,270
them into cars
right you know my car follows my

4406
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,280
right you know my car follows my
 

4407
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,789
right you know my car follows my
directions until the day it sees

4408
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
directions until the day it sees
 

4409
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,069
directions until the day it sees
i'm about to hit something and it

4410
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:54,079
i'm about to hit something and it
 

4411
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,430
i'm about to hit something and it
ignores my directions and puts the

4412
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:55,440
ignores my directions and puts the
 

4413
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,470
ignores my directions and puts the
brakes on

4414
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
brakes on
 

4415
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,390
brakes on
so we can build those things in so

4416
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
so we can build those things in so
 

4417
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,470
so we can build those things in so
that's a very interesting problem

4418
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
that's a very interesting problem
 

4419
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,670
that's a very interesting problem
um how to build those in i think my

4420
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,680
um how to build those in i think my
 

4421
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,789
um how to build those in i think my
my my differing opinion about the risks

4422
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:06,799
my my differing opinion about the risks
 

4423
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,549
my my differing opinion about the risks
of ai for most people

4424
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
of ai for most people
 

4425
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,549
of ai for most people
is that people assume that somehow those

4426
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
is that people assume that somehow those
 

4427
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,990
is that people assume that somehow those
things will just appear automatically

4428
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
things will just appear automatically
 

4429
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,190
things will just appear automatically
it'll evolve and intelligence itself

4430
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200
it'll evolve and intelligence itself
 

4431
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,829
it'll evolve and intelligence itself
begets that stuff or requires it but

4432
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:17,839
begets that stuff or requires it but
 

4433
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:18,710
begets that stuff or requires it but
it's not intelligence

4434
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
it's not intelligence
 

4435
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,990
it's not intelligence
of the neural cortex equipment doesn't

4436
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,000
of the neural cortex equipment doesn't
 

4437
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,349
of the neural cortex equipment doesn't
require this the new cartridge equipment

4438
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
require this the new cartridge equipment
 

4439
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,069
require this the new cartridge equipment
just says

4440
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
just says
 

4441
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,990
just says
i'm a learning system tell me what you

4442
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,000
i'm a learning system tell me what you
 

4443
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,150
i'm a learning system tell me what you
want me to learn and i'll tell you

4444
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
want me to learn and i'll tell you
 

4445
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,510
want me to learn and i'll tell you
ask me questions i'll tell you the

4446
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
ask me questions i'll tell you the
 

4447
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,589
ask me questions i'll tell you the
answers but

4448
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
answers but
 

4449
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,510
answers but
in that again it's again like a map it

4450
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
in that again it's again like a map it
 

4451
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,950
in that again it's again like a map it
doesn't a map has no

4452
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
doesn't a map has no
 

4453
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,349
doesn't a map has no
intent about things but you can use it

4454
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:35,359
intent about things but you can use it
 

4455
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:35,990
intent about things but you can use it
um

4456
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
um
 

4457
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,190
um
to solve problems okay so the building

4458
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,200
to solve problems okay so the building
 

4459
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,630
to solve problems okay so the building
engineering the neural cortex in itself

4460
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
engineering the neural cortex in itself
 

4461
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,829
engineering the neural cortex in itself
is just creating

4462
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
is just creating
 

4463
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,829
is just creating
an intelligent prediction system

4464
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:45,839
an intelligent prediction system
 

4465
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,109
an intelligent prediction system
modeling system

4466
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
modeling system
 

4467
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,670
modeling system
sorry modeling system yeah uh you can

4468
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
sorry modeling system yeah uh you can
 

4469
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,470
sorry modeling system yeah uh you can
use it to then make predictions and then

4470
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:52,480
use it to then make predictions and then
 

4471
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,549
use it to then make predictions and then
but you can also put it inside a thing

4472
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:54,559
but you can also put it inside a thing
 

4473
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,870
but you can also put it inside a thing
that's actually acting in this world

4474
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
that's actually acting in this world
 

4475
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,589
that's actually acting in this world
you have to put it inside something it's

4476
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
you have to put it inside something it's
 

4477
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,510
you have to put it inside something it's
again think of the map analogy right map

4478
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:01,520
again think of the map analogy right map
 

4479
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,750
again think of the map analogy right map
on its own doesn't do anything right

4480
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
on its own doesn't do anything right
 

4481
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,510
on its own doesn't do anything right
it's just inert it's just it can learn

4482
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
it's just inert it's just it can learn
 

4483
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,430
it's just inert it's just it can learn
but it's just so we have to embed it

4484
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
but it's just so we have to embed it
 

4485
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,430
but it's just so we have to embed it
somehow in something to do something

4486
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
somehow in something to do something
 

4487
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,069
somehow in something to do something
so so what's your intuition here you had

4488
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
so so what's your intuition here you had
 

4489
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,190
so so what's your intuition here you had
a conversation

4490
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
a conversation
 

4491
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,910
a conversation
with sam harris recently that was uh

4492
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
with sam harris recently that was uh
 

4493
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,829
with sam harris recently that was uh
sort of um

4494
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
sort of um
 

4495
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,749
sort of um
you've had a bit of a disagreement and

4496
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
you've had a bit of a disagreement and
 

4497
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,189
you've had a bit of a disagreement and
you're sticking on this point

4498
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
you're sticking on this point
 

4499
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,550
you're sticking on this point
you know elon musk stuart russell

4500
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,560
you know elon musk stuart russell
 

4501
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,550
you know elon musk stuart russell
kind of have us worry existential

4502
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
kind of have us worry existential
 

4503
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,550
kind of have us worry existential
threats of ai what's your intuition why

4504
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560
threats of ai what's your intuition why
 

4505
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,789
threats of ai what's your intuition why
if we engineer an increasingly

4506
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
if we engineer an increasingly
 

4507
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,430
if we engineer an increasingly
intelligent neural cortex type of system

4508
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
intelligent neural cortex type of system
 

4509
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,990
intelligent neural cortex type of system
in the computer why that shouldn't be a

4510
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,000
in the computer why that shouldn't be a
 

4511
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,950
in the computer why that shouldn't be a
thing that we

4512
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:40,960
thing that we
 

4513
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,309
thing that we
it was interesting we used the word

4514
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:42,319
it was interesting we used the word
 

4515
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,229
it was interesting we used the word
intuition and sam harris used the word

4516
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:44,239
intuition and sam harris used the word
 

4517
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:44,950
intuition and sam harris used the word
intuition too

4518
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:44,960
intuition too
 

4519
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,189
intuition too
and and when he used that intuition that

4520
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:47,199
and and when he used that intuition that
 

4521
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:48,630
and and when he used that intuition that
word i immediately stopped and said oh

4522
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
word i immediately stopped and said oh
 

4523
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,510
word i immediately stopped and said oh
that's the

4524
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
that's the
 

4525
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,229
that's the
problem he's using intuition i'm not

4526
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:52,239
problem he's using intuition i'm not
 

4527
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:53,430
problem he's using intuition i'm not
speaking about my intuition

4528
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:53,440
speaking about my intuition
 

4529
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,709
speaking about my intuition
yes i'm speaking about something i

4530
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
yes i'm speaking about something i
 

4531
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,229
yes i'm speaking about something i
understand something i'm going to build

4532
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239
understand something i'm going to build
 

4533
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,349
understand something i'm going to build
something i am building

4534
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
something i am building
 

4535
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,669
something i am building
something i understand completely or at

4536
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
something i understand completely or at
 

4537
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,430
something i understand completely or at
least well enough to know what it's all

4538
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,440
least well enough to know what it's all
 

4539
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,189
least well enough to know what it's all
i'm guessing i know what this thing's

4540
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
i'm guessing i know what this thing's
 

4541
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:04,789
i'm guessing i know what this thing's
going to do and

4542
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
going to do and
 

4543
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,990
going to do and
i think most people who are worried they

4544
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
i think most people who are worried they
 

4545
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,630
i think most people who are worried they
have trouble

4546
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
have trouble
 

4547
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,309
have trouble
separating out they don't have they

4548
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:10,319
separating out they don't have they
 

4549
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,510
separating out they don't have they
don't have the um knowledge or the

4550
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
don't have the um knowledge or the
 

4551
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,229
don't have the um knowledge or the
understanding

4552
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
understanding
 

4553
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,990
understanding
about like what is intelligence how is

4554
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
about like what is intelligence how is
 

4555
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,349
about like what is intelligence how is
it manifest in the brain how is it

4556
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:15,359
it manifest in the brain how is it
 

4557
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,789
it manifest in the brain how is it
separate from these other functions in

4558
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:16,799
separate from these other functions in
 

4559
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:17,749
separate from these other functions in
the brain

4560
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
the brain
 

4561
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,030
the brain
and so they imagine it's going to be

4562
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:19,040
and so they imagine it's going to be
 

4563
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,870
and so they imagine it's going to be
human-like or animal-like it's going to

4564
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,880
human-like or animal-like it's going to
 

4565
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,189
human-like or animal-like it's going to
have it's going to have the same sort of

4566
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
have it's going to have the same sort of
 

4567
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,349
have it's going to have the same sort of
drives and emotions we have but there's

4568
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
drives and emotions we have but there's
 

4569
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,030
drives and emotions we have but there's
no reason for that

4570
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:27,040
no reason for that
 

4571
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,470
no reason for that
that's just because there's there's

4572
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:28,480
that's just because there's there's
 

4573
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,390
that's just because there's there's
unknown if you're if the unknown is like

4574
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:30,400
unknown if you're if the unknown is like
 

4575
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,669
unknown if you're if the unknown is like
oh my god you know i don't know what

4576
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
oh my god you know i don't know what
 

4577
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:32,470
oh my god you know i don't know what
this is going to do we have to be

4578
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
this is going to do we have to be
 

4579
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,910
this is going to do we have to be
careful it could be like us but really

4580
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
careful it could be like us but really
 

4581
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,110
careful it could be like us but really
smarter

4582
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,120
smarter
 

4583
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,789
smarter
i'm saying no it won't be like us it'll

4584
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:36,799
i'm saying no it won't be like us it'll
 

4585
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,309
i'm saying no it won't be like us it'll
be really smart but it won't be like us

4586
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
be really smart but it won't be like us
 

4587
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,269
be really smart but it won't be like us
at all

4588
01:09:39,269 --> 01:09:39,279
at all
 

4589
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,070
at all
and um and but i i'm coming from that

4590
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,080
and um and but i i'm coming from that
 

4591
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,030
and um and but i i'm coming from that
not because i just

4592
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
not because i just
 

4593
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,269
not because i just
guessing i'm not intuitive using

4594
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:45,279
guessing i'm not intuitive using
 

4595
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,870
guessing i'm not intuitive using
intuition i'm basically like okay i

4596
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:46,880
intuition i'm basically like okay i
 

4597
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,990
intuition i'm basically like okay i
understand this thing works this is what

4598
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
understand this thing works this is what
 

4599
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,470
understand this thing works this is what
it does

4600
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
it does
 

4601
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,510
it does
let me explain it to you okay but uh to

4602
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
let me explain it to you okay but uh to
 

4603
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,550
let me explain it to you okay but uh to
push back

4604
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,560
push back
 

4605
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,709
push back
so i also disagree with the the

4606
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
so i also disagree with the the
 

4607
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,630
so i also disagree with the the
intuitions that sam has

4608
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
intuitions that sam has
 

4609
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,830
intuitions that sam has
but but i also disagree with what you

4610
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
but but i also disagree with what you
 

4611
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,790
but but i also disagree with what you
just said

4612
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
just said
 

4613
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,350
just said
which you know what's a good uh analogy

4614
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
which you know what's a good uh analogy
 

4615
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,630
which you know what's a good uh analogy
so if you look at the

4616
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
so if you look at the
 

4617
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,750
so if you look at the
twitter algorithm in in the early days

4618
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760
twitter algorithm in in the early days
 

4619
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,669
twitter algorithm in in the early days
just recommender systems you can

4620
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:09,679
just recommender systems you can
 

4621
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,950
just recommender systems you can
understand how recommender systems work

4622
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
understand how recommender systems work
 

4623
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,950
understand how recommender systems work
what you can't understand in the early

4624
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:14,960
what you can't understand in the early
 

4625
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,870
what you can't understand in the early
days is when you apply that recommender

4626
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
days is when you apply that recommender
 

4627
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,830
days is when you apply that recommender
system at scale

4628
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
system at scale
 

4629
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,070
system at scale
to thousands and millions of people how

4630
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:20,080
to thousands and millions of people how
 

4631
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,830
to thousands and millions of people how
that can change societies

4632
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
that can change societies
 

4633
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,030
that can change societies
yeah so the question is yes

4634
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
yeah so the question is yes
 

4635
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,110
yeah so the question is yes
you're just saying this is how an

4636
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
you're just saying this is how an
 

4637
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,870
you're just saying this is how an
engineer in neurocortex

4638
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:28,880
engineer in neurocortex
 

4639
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,030
engineer in neurocortex
works but the ques like when you have a

4640
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,040
works but the ques like when you have a
 

4641
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,550
works but the ques like when you have a
very useful

4642
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
very useful
 

4643
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,510
very useful
uh tic toc type of service that goes

4644
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
uh tic toc type of service that goes
 

4645
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,270
uh tic toc type of service that goes
viral when your neural cortex

4646
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
viral when your neural cortex
 

4647
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,590
viral when your neural cortex
goes viral and then millions of people

4648
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,600
goes viral and then millions of people

start using it cannot destroy the world

4650
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
start using it cannot destroy the world
 

4651
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:41,990
start using it cannot destroy the world
no

4652
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
no
 

4653
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,910
no
uh well first of all this is back one

4654
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:43,920
uh well first of all this is back one
 

4655

uh well first of all this is back one
thing i want to say is that uh

4656
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
thing i want to say is that uh
 

4657
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,590
thing i want to say is that uh
ai is a dangerous technology i don't i'm

4658
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
ai is a dangerous technology i don't i'm
 

4659
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,270
ai is a dangerous technology i don't i'm
not denying that all technology is

4660
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:49,280
not denying that all technology is
 

4661
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,390
not denying that all technology is
dangerous well an ai

4662
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
dangerous well an ai
 

4663
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,669
dangerous well an ai
maybe particularly so yeah okay so um

4664
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
maybe particularly so yeah okay so um
 

4665
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,030
maybe particularly so yeah okay so um
am i worried about it yeah i'm totally

4666
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
am i worried about it yeah i'm totally
 

4667
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,110
am i worried about it yeah i'm totally
worried about it the the thing where

4668
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,120
worried about it the the thing where
 

4669
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,630
worried about it the the thing where
the narrow component we're talking about

4670
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
the narrow component we're talking about
 

4671
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,350
the narrow component we're talking about
now is the existential risk of ai

4672
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
now is the existential risk of ai
 

4673
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,189
now is the existential risk of ai
right so i want to make that distinction

4674
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
right so i want to make that distinction
 

4675
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,910
right so i want to make that distinction
because i think ai can be applied poorly

4676
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,920
because i think ai can be applied poorly
 

4677
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,910
because i think ai can be applied poorly
it can be applied in ways that you know

4678
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
it can be applied in ways that you know
 

4679
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,950
it can be applied in ways that you know
people are going to

4680
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:08,960
people are going to
 

4681
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,149
people are going to
understand the consequences of it

4682
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:12,159
understand the consequences of it
 

4683
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,790
understand the consequences of it
these are all potentially very bad

4684
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:14,800
these are all potentially very bad
 

4685
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,070
these are all potentially very bad
things

4686
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,080
things
 

4687
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,630
things
but they're not the ai system creating

4688
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640
but they're not the ai system creating
 

4689
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,709
but they're not the ai system creating
this existential risk on its own

4690
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
this existential risk on its own
 

4691
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,390
this existential risk on its own
and that's the only place i disagree

4692
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
and that's the only place i disagree
 

4693
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,910
and that's the only place i disagree
with other people right so

4694
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
with other people right so
 

4695
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,149
with other people right so
so i i think the existential risk thing

4696
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
so i i think the existential risk thing
 

4697
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:26,950
so i i think the existential risk thing
is um

4698
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:26,960
is um
 

4699
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,270
is um
humans are really damn good at surviving

4700
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
humans are really damn good at surviving
 

4701
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,990
humans are really damn good at surviving
so to kill off the human race

4702
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
so to kill off the human race
 

4703
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,470
so to kill off the human race
it'd be very very difficult you can even

4704
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
it'd be very very difficult you can even
 

4705
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,470
it'd be very very difficult you can even
yes but you can even i'll go further i

4706
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
yes but you can even i'll go further i
 

4707
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,310
yes but you can even i'll go further i
don't think ai systems are ever going to

4708
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
don't think ai systems are ever going to
 

4709
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,390
don't think ai systems are ever going to
try to i don't think ar systems are ever

4710
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
try to i don't think ar systems are ever
 

4711

01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:41,520
going to like say
 

4713
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,030

i'm going to ignore you i'm going to do

4714
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,040
i'm going to ignore you i'm going to do
 

4715
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,350
i'm going to ignore you i'm going to do
what i think is best

01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
what i think is best
 

4717
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,030
what i think is best
i don't think that's going to happen at

01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
i don't think that's going to happen at
 

4719
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,870
i don't think that's going to happen at
least not in the way

4720
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
least not in the way
 

4721
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,550

i'm talking about it so you the twitter

4722
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
i'm talking about it so you the twitter
 

4723
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,830
i'm talking about it so you the twitter
recommendation algorithm this

4724
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:53,840
recommendation algorithm this
 

4725
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,750
recommendation algorithm this
interesting example

4726
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:55,760
interesting example
 

4727
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,669
interesting example
let's let's use computer as an analogy

4728
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
let's let's use computer as an analogy
 

4729
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,430
let's let's use computer as an analogy
again right

4730
01:11:59,430 --> 01:11:59,440
again right
 

4731
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,950
again right
i build a computer it's a universal

4732
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
i build a computer it's a universal
 

4733
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,630
i build a computer it's a universal
computing machine i can't predict what

4734
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
computing machine i can't predict what
 

4735
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,910
computing machine i can't predict what
people are going to use it for they can

4736
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
people are going to use it for they can
 

4737
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,830
people are going to use it for they can
build all kinds of things they can

4738
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
build all kinds of things they can
 

4739
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,590
build all kinds of things they can
they can even create computer viruses

4740
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
they can even create computer viruses
 

4741
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,990
they can even create computer viruses
it's you know all kinds of stuff

4742
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
it's you know all kinds of stuff
 

4743
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,990
it's you know all kinds of stuff
so there's some unknown about its

4744
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
so there's some unknown about its
 

4745
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,070
so there's some unknown about its
utility about where it's going to go

4746
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,080
utility about where it's going to go
 

4747
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,510
utility about where it's going to go
but on the other hand i pointed out that

4748
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,520
but on the other hand i pointed out that
 

4749
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,189
but on the other hand i pointed out that
once i build a computer

4750
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
once i build a computer
 

4751
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,189
once i build a computer
it's not going to fundamentally change

4752
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
it's not going to fundamentally change
 

4753
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,310
it's not going to fundamentally change
how it computes

4754
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:20,320
how it computes
 

4755
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,510
how it computes
it's like i use the example of a

4756
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:21,520
it's like i use the example of a
 

4757
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,110
it's like i use the example of a
register which is a part internal part

4758
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
register which is a part internal part
 

4759
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,070
register which is a part internal part
of a computer

4760
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
of a computer
 

4761
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,550
of a computer
um you know i say it can't just say

4762
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
um you know i say it can't just say
 

4763
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,910
um you know i say it can't just say
because computers don't evolve

4764
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
because computers don't evolve
 

4765
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,590
because computers don't evolve
they don't replicate they don't evolve

4766
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:29,600
they don't replicate they don't evolve
 

4767
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,790
they don't replicate they don't evolve
they don't you know the physical

4768
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:30,800
they don't you know the physical
 

4769
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,390
they don't you know the physical
manifestation of the computer itself

4770
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
manifestation of the computer itself
 

4771
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,229
manifestation of the computer itself
is not gonna there's certain things it

4772
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
is not gonna there's certain things it
 

4773
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,310
is not gonna there's certain things it
can't do right so we can

4774
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320
can't do right so we can
 

4775
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,830
can't do right so we can
break into things like things that are

4776
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
break into things like things that are
 

4777
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,590
break into things like things that are
possible to happen we can't predict

4778
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
possible to happen we can't predict
 

4779
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,830
possible to happen we can't predict
and things are just impossible to happen

4780
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
and things are just impossible to happen
 

4781
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,270
and things are just impossible to happen
unless we go out of our way to make them

4782
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
unless we go out of our way to make them
 

4783
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,550
unless we go out of our way to make them
happen they're not going to happen

4784
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
happen they're not going to happen
 

4785
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,390
happen they're not going to happen
unless somebody makes them happen yeah

4786
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
unless somebody makes them happen yeah
 

4787
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,830
unless somebody makes them happen yeah
so there's there's a bunch of things to

4788
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840
so there's there's a bunch of things to
 

4789
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,470
so there's there's a bunch of things to
say one

4790
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
say one
 

4791
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,630
say one
is the physical aspect which you're

4792
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
is the physical aspect which you're
 

4793
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,830
is the physical aspect which you're
absolutely right

4794
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
absolutely right
 

4795
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,310
absolutely right
we have to build a thing for it to

4796
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
we have to build a thing for it to
 

4797
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,750
we have to build a thing for it to
operate in the physical world

4798
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
operate in the physical world
 

4799
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,870
operate in the physical world
and you can just stop building them uh

4800
01:12:58,870 --> 01:12:58,880
and you can just stop building them uh
 

4801
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,750
and you can just stop building them uh
you know the moment they're not doing

4802
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
you know the moment they're not doing
 

4803
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,270
you know the moment they're not doing
the thing you want them to do or just

4804
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:03,280
the thing you want them to do or just
 

4805
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,229
the thing you want them to do or just
change the design

4806
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
change the design
 

4807
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,229
change the design
or change the design the question is i

4808
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
or change the design the question is i
 

4809
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,669
or change the design the question is i
mean there's it's possible in the

4810
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
mean there's it's possible in the
 

4811
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:08,470
mean there's it's possible in the
physical world

4812
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
physical world
 

4813
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,790
physical world
this is probably longer term is you

4814
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:10,800
this is probably longer term is you
 

4815
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,550
this is probably longer term is you
automate the building

4816
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:12,560
automate the building
 

4817
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,149
automate the building
it makes it makes a lot of sense to

4818
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
it makes it makes a lot of sense to
 

4819
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,430
it makes it makes a lot of sense to
automate the building there's a lot of

4820
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
automate the building there's a lot of
 

4821
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,709
automate the building there's a lot of
factories that are doing more and more

4822
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:16,719
factories that are doing more and more
 

4823
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:17,189
factories that are doing more and more
and more

4824
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:17,199
and more
 

4825
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,149
and more
automation to go from raw resources to

4826
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
automation to go from raw resources to
 

4827
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,350
automation to go from raw resources to
the final product

4828
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
the final product
 

4829
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,270
the final product
it's possible to imagine that it's

4830
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
it's possible to imagine that it's
 

4831
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,110
it's possible to imagine that it's
obviously much more efficient to keep

4832
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
obviously much more efficient to keep
 

4833
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,229
obviously much more efficient to keep
to create a factory that's creating

4834
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:28,239
to create a factory that's creating
 

4835
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:31,030
to create a factory that's creating
robots that do something you know do

4836
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:31,040
robots that do something you know do
 

4837
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,870
robots that do something you know do
something extremely useful for society

4838
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
something extremely useful for society
 

4839
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,669
something extremely useful for society
it could be uh

4840
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
it could be uh
 

4841
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,910
it could be uh
personal assistance it could be uh it

4842
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:35,920
personal assistance it could be uh it
 

4843
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,830
personal assistance it could be uh it
could be it could be your toaster but a

4844
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
could be it could be your toaster but a
 

4845
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,030
could be it could be your toaster but a
toaster that's much

4846
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,040
toaster that's much
 

4847
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,870
toaster that's much
has deeper knowledge of your culinary

4848
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
has deeper knowledge of your culinary
 

4849
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,790
has deeper knowledge of your culinary
preferences yeah

4850
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
preferences yeah
 

4851
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,030
preferences yeah
and and that could uh well i think now

4852
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
and and that could uh well i think now
 

4853
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,070
and and that could uh well i think now
you've hit on the right thing the real

4854
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:46,080
you've hit on the right thing the real
 

4855
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,590
you've hit on the right thing the real
thing we need to be worried about lex

4856
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
thing we need to be worried about lex
 

4857
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,310
thing we need to be worried about lex
is self-replication right that is the

4858
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
is self-replication right that is the
 

4859
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,070
is self-replication right that is the
thing that we're in the physical world

4860
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:52,080
thing that we're in the physical world
 

4861
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,229
thing that we're in the physical world
yeah or even the virtual world

4862
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
yeah or even the virtual world
 

4863
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,510
yeah or even the virtual world
self-replication

4864
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
self-replication
 

4865
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,430
self-replication
because self-replication is dangerous

4866
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:57,440
because self-replication is dangerous
 

4867
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,790
because self-replication is dangerous
it's probably more likely to be killed

4868
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
it's probably more likely to be killed
 

4869
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,950
it's probably more likely to be killed
by a virus you know or a human

4870
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
by a virus you know or a human
 

4871
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,310
by a virus you know or a human
engineered virus

4872
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
engineered virus
 

4873
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,070
engineered virus
anybody can create you know this the

4874
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
anybody can create you know this the
 

4875
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,830
anybody can create you know this the
technology is getting so almost anybody

4876
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
technology is getting so almost anybody
 

4877
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,950
technology is getting so almost anybody
but not anybody but

4878
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:06,960
but not anybody but
 

4879
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,709
but not anybody but
a lot of people could create a

4880
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:08,719
a lot of people could create a
 

4881
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,470
a lot of people could create a
human-engineered virus that could wipe

4882
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:10,480
human-engineered virus that could wipe
 

4883
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,149
human-engineered virus that could wipe
out humanity

4884
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
out humanity
 

4885
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,750
out humanity
that is really dangerous no intelligence

4886
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,760
that is really dangerous no intelligence
 

4887
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,709
that is really dangerous no intelligence
required just self-replication

4888
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
required just self-replication
 

4889
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,910
required just self-replication
so um so we need to be careful about

4890
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:19,920
so um so we need to be careful about
 

4891
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,550
so um so we need to be careful about
that

4892
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
that
 

4893
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,590
that
so when i think about you know ai

4894
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
so when i think about you know ai
 

4895
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,270
so when i think about you know ai
i'm not thinking about robots building

4896
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,280
i'm not thinking about robots building
 

4897
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,270
i'm not thinking about robots building
robots don't do that don't build a

4898
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
robots don't do that don't build a
 

4899
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,430
robots don't do that don't build a
you know just well that's because you're

4900
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:29,440
you know just well that's because you're
 

4901
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,590
you know just well that's because you're
interested in creating intelligence

4902
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
interested in creating intelligence
 

4903
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,630
interested in creating intelligence
it seems like self-replication

4904
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640
it seems like self-replication
 

4905
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,870
it seems like self-replication
is a good way to make a lot of money

4906
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
is a good way to make a lot of money
 

4907
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,750
is a good way to make a lot of money
well fine but

4908
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:37,760
well fine but
 

4909
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,790
well fine but
so is you know maybe editing viruses is

4910
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
so is you know maybe editing viruses is
 

4911
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,070
so is you know maybe editing viruses is
a good way to i don't know

4912
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
a good way to i don't know
 

4913
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,470
a good way to i don't know
the point is if as a society when we

4914
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
the point is if as a society when we
 

4915
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,950
the point is if as a society when we
want to look at existential risks

4916
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
want to look at existential risks
 

4917
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,910
want to look at existential risks
the existential risks we face that that

4918
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
the existential risks we face that that
 

4919
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,189
the existential risks we face that that
we can control

4920
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
we can control
 

4921
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,790
we can control
almost all evolve around

4922
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:52,800
almost all evolve around
 

4923
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,709
almost all evolve around
self-replication yes

4924
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
self-replication yes
 

4925
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,910
self-replication yes
the question is i don't see a good uh

4926
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
the question is i don't see a good uh
 

4927
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,189
the question is i don't see a good uh
way to make a lot of money by

4928
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
way to make a lot of money by
 

4929
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,110
way to make a lot of money by
engineering viruses and deploying them

4930
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
engineering viruses and deploying them
 

4931
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,070
engineering viruses and deploying them
in the world

4932
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
in the world
 

4933
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,110
in the world
there could be there will be

4934
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
there could be there will be
 

4935
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,709
there could be there will be
applications that are useful but let's

4936
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
applications that are useful but let's
 

4937
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:05,830
applications that are useful but let's
separate out let's

4938
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
separate out let's
 

4939
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,750
separate out let's
separate out i mean you don't need to

4940
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:07,760
separate out i mean you don't need to
 

4941
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,189
separate out i mean you don't need to
you only need some you know terrorists

4942
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:09,199
you only need some you know terrorists
 

4943
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:10,149
you only need some you know terrorists
who wants to do it because it doesn't

4944
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:10,159
who wants to do it because it doesn't
 

4945
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,070
who wants to do it because it doesn't
take a lot of money to make viruses

4946
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,080
take a lot of money to make viruses
 

4947
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,030
take a lot of money to make viruses
um let's just separate out what's risky

4948
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,040
um let's just separate out what's risky
 

4949
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,630
um let's just separate out what's risky
and what's not risky

4950
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
and what's not risky
 

4951
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,390
and what's not risky
i'm arguing that the intelligence side

4952
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
i'm arguing that the intelligence side
 

4953
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,669
i'm arguing that the intelligence side
of this equation is not risky it's not

4954
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
of this equation is not risky it's not
 

4955
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,270
of this equation is not risky it's not
risky it's not risky at all

4956
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:21,280
risky it's not risky at all
 

4957
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,630
risky it's not risky at all
it's the self-replication side of the

4958
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:22,640
it's the self-replication side of the
 

4959
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,790
it's the self-replication side of the
equation is risky and

4960
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
equation is risky and
 

4961
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,709
equation is risky and
i'm not dismissing that i'm scared as

4962
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:26,719
i'm not dismissing that i'm scared as
 

4963
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,870
i'm not dismissing that i'm scared as
hell it's like the paperclip

4964
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
hell it's like the paperclip
 

4965
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,310
hell it's like the paperclip
maximizer thing yeah those are often

4966
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:32,320
maximizer thing yeah those are often
 

4967
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:32,870
maximizer thing yeah those are often
like

4968
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
like
 

4969
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,310
like
talked about in the same conversation um

4970
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:36,320
talked about in the same conversation um
 

4971
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,550
talked about in the same conversation um
i think you're right like creating

4972
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,560
i think you're right like creating
 

4973
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,709
i think you're right like creating
ultra-intelligent super-intelligent

4974
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:40,719
ultra-intelligent super-intelligent
 

4975
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,390
ultra-intelligent super-intelligent

01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,280
self-replicating systems
 

4981
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,709
self-replicating systems
yeah and you don't get evolution unless

4982
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
yeah and you don't get evolution unless
 

4983
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,470
yeah and you don't get evolution unless
you're self-replicating yeah

4984
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,480
you're self-replicating yeah
 

4985
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,790
you're self-replicating yeah
and so i think that's the gist of this

4986
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
and so i think that's the gist of this
 

4987
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,310
and so i think that's the gist of this
argument that people have trouble

4988
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
argument that people have trouble
 

4989
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,709
argument that people have trouble
separating those two out they just think

4990
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
separating those two out they just think
 

4991
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,470
separating those two out they just think
oh yeah intelligence is like us

4992
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480
oh yeah intelligence is like us
 

4993
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,910
oh yeah intelligence is like us
and look how look at the damage we've

4994
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
and look how look at the damage we've
 

4995
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,910
and look how look at the damage we've
done to this planet like how we've

4996
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
done to this planet like how we've
 

4997
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,110
done to this planet like how we've
you know destroyed all these other

4998
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
you know destroyed all these other
 

4999
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,189
you know destroyed all these other
species yeah well we replicate we're

5000
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:05,199
species yeah well we replicate we're
 

5001
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,709
species yeah well we replicate we're
eight billion of us are seven million of

5002
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
eight billion of us are seven million of
 

5003
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,790
eight billion of us are seven million of
us now so um

5004
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
us now so um
 

5005
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,270
us now so um
i think the idea is that the the more

5006
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
i think the idea is that the the more
 

5007
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,229
i think the idea is that the the more
intelligent

5008
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
intelligent
 

5009
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,390
intelligent
we're able to build systems the more

5010
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
we're able to build systems the more
 

5011
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,669
we're able to build systems the more
tempting

5012
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:15,679
tempting
 

5013
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,590
tempting
it becomes from a capitalist perspective

5014
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
it becomes from a capitalist perspective
 

5015
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,270
it becomes from a capitalist perspective
of creating products the more tempting

5016
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:19,280
of creating products the more tempting
 

5017
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,070
of creating products the more tempting
it becomes to create

5018
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:20,080
it becomes to create
 

5019
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,189
it becomes to create
self uh reproduction systems all right

5020
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:23,199
self uh reproduction systems all right
 

5021
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,430
self uh reproduction systems all right
so let's say that's true so does that

5022
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
so let's say that's true so does that
 

5023
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,709
so let's say that's true so does that
mean we don't build intelligent systems

5024
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
mean we don't build intelligent systems
 

5025
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,149
mean we don't build intelligent systems
no that means we regulate

5026
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
no that means we regulate
 

5027
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,870
no that means we regulate
we we understand the risks uh we

5028
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:30,880
we we understand the risks uh we
 

5029
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,990
we we understand the risks uh we
regulate them

5030
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
regulate them
 

5031
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,470
regulate them
yeah uh you know look there's a lot of

5032
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
yeah uh you know look there's a lot of
 

5033
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,310
yeah uh you know look there's a lot of
things we could do a society which have

5034
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
things we could do a society which have
 

5035
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,669
things we could do a society which have
some sort of financial benefit to

5036
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
some sort of financial benefit to
 

5037
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,310
some sort of financial benefit to
someone

5038
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:38,320
someone
 

5039
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,950
someone
which could do a lot of harm and we have

5040
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
which could do a lot of harm and we have
 

5041
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,550
which could do a lot of harm and we have
to learn how to regulate those things

5042
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:42,560
to learn how to regulate those things
 

5043
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,830
to learn how to regulate those things
we have to learn how to deal with those

5044
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
we have to learn how to deal with those
 

5045
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,750
we have to learn how to deal with those
things i will argue this i would say the

5046
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
things i will argue this i would say the
 

5047
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,310
things i will argue this i would say the
opposite

5048
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:46,320
opposite
 

5049
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,550
opposite
i would say having intelligent machines

5050
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
i would say having intelligent machines
 

5051
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,910
i would say having intelligent machines
at our disposal

5052
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
at our disposal
 

5053
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,990
at our disposal
will actually help us in the end more

5054
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
will actually help us in the end more
 

5055
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,510
will actually help us in the end more
because it'll help us understand these

5056
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
because it'll help us understand these
 

5057
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,870
because it'll help us understand these
risks better and help us mitigate these

5058
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
risks better and help us mitigate these
 

5059
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,310
risks better and help us mitigate these
risk riders there might be ways of

5060
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
risk riders there might be ways of
 

5061
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:56,870
risk riders there might be ways of
saying oh

5062
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:56,880
saying oh
 

5063
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,390
saying oh
well how do we solve climate change

5064
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
well how do we solve climate change
 

5065
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,830
well how do we solve climate change
problems you know how do we do this or

5066
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
problems you know how do we do this or
 

5067
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,910
problems you know how do we do this or
how do we do that

5068
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
how do we do that
 

5069
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,110
how do we do that
that just like computers are dangerous

5070
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
that just like computers are dangerous
 

5071
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,390
that just like computers are dangerous
in the hands of the wrong people but

5072
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
in the hands of the wrong people but
 

5073
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,990
in the hands of the wrong people but
they've been so great for so many other

5074
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,000
they've been so great for so many other
 

5075
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,830
they've been so great for so many other
things we live with those dangers

5076
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:09,840
things we live with those dangers
 

5077
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,189
things we live with those dangers
and i think we have to do the same with

5078
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:11,199
and i think we have to do the same with
 

5079
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,189
and i think we have to do the same with
intelligent machines we just but we have

5080
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
intelligent machines we just but we have
 

5081
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,189
intelligent machines we just but we have
to be constantly vigilant about

5082
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
to be constantly vigilant about
 

5083
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,750
to be constantly vigilant about
this idea of a bad actors doing bad

5084
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
this idea of a bad actors doing bad
 

5085
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,350
this idea of a bad actors doing bad
things with them and b

5086
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
things with them and b
 

5087
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,590
things with them and b
um don't ever ever create a

5088
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
um don't ever ever create a
 

5089
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,189
um don't ever ever create a
self-replicating system

5090
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:23,199
self-replicating system
 

5091
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,669
self-replicating system
um and by the way i don't even know if

5092
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
um and by the way i don't even know if
 

5093
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,110
um and by the way i don't even know if
you could create a self-replicating

5094
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
you could create a self-replicating
 

5095
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,669
you could create a self-replicating
system

5096
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679
system
 

5097
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,350
system
that uses a factory that's really

5098
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
that uses a factory that's really
 

5099
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,030
that uses a factory that's really
dangerous you know

5100
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
dangerous you know
 

5101
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,030
dangerous you know
nature's way of self-replicating is so

5102
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
nature's way of self-replicating is so
 

5103
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,070
nature's way of self-replicating is so
amazing

5104
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
amazing
 

5105
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,390
amazing
um you know it doesn't require anything

5106
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
um you know it doesn't require anything
 

5107
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,270
um you know it doesn't require anything
it just me know

5108
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
it just me know
 

5109
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,350
it just me know
the thing and resources and it goes

5110
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
the thing and resources and it goes
 

5111
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,950
the thing and resources and it goes
right yeah

5112
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
right yeah
 

5113
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,709
right yeah
if i said to you you know what we have

5114
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
if i said to you you know what we have
 

5115
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:43,990
if i said to you you know what we have
to build uh

5116
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
to build uh
 

5117
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,590
to build uh
our goal is to build a factory that can

5118
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
our goal is to build a factory that can
 

5119
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,910
our goal is to build a factory that can
make that builds new factories

5120
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:47,920
make that builds new factories
 

5121
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,110
make that builds new factories
and it has to end to end supply chain

5122
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
and it has to end to end supply chain
 

5123
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,990
and it has to end to end supply chain
it has to mine the resources get the

5124
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
it has to mine the resources get the
 

5125
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,510
it has to mine the resources get the
energy

5126
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
energy
 

5127
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,550
energy
i mean that's really hard it's you know

5128
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
i mean that's really hard it's you know
 

5129
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,750
i mean that's really hard it's you know
no one's doing that in the next

5130
01:17:59,750 --> 01:17:59,760
no one's doing that in the next
 

5131
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,149
no one's doing that in the next
you know 100 years i've been extremely

5132
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
you know 100 years i've been extremely
 

5133
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:02,790
you know 100 years i've been extremely
impressed

5134
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
impressed
 

5135
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,910
impressed
by the efforts of elon musk and tesla to

5136
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
by the efforts of elon musk and tesla to
 

5137
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,270
by the efforts of elon musk and tesla to
try to do exactly that

5138
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
try to do exactly that
 

5139
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,229
try to do exactly that
not not from raw resource well he

5140
01:18:10,229 --> 01:18:10,239
not not from raw resource well he
 

5141
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,110
not not from raw resource well he
actually i think

5142
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
actually i think
 

5143
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,030
actually i think
states the goal is to go from raw

5144
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
states the goal is to go from raw
 

5145
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,390
states the goal is to go from raw
resource to the

5146
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
resource to the
 

5147
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,510
resource to the
uh the final car in one factory yeah

5148
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,520
uh the final car in one factory yeah
 

5149
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,430
uh the final car in one factory yeah
that's that's the main goal of course

5150
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
that's that's the main goal of course
 

5151
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,030
that's that's the main goal of course
it's not currently possible

5152
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
it's not currently possible
 

5153
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,790
it's not currently possible
but they're taking huge leaps well he's

5154
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:22,800
but they're taking huge leaps well he's
 

5155
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,149
but they're taking huge leaps well he's
not the only one to do that

5156
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
not the only one to do that
 

5157
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,750
not the only one to do that
this has been a goal for many uh

5158
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:25,760
this has been a goal for many uh
 

5159
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,590
this has been a goal for many uh
industries for a long long time

5160
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:27,600
industries for a long long time
 

5161
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,669
industries for a long long time
um it's difficult to do well a lot of

5162
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:29,679
um it's difficult to do well a lot of
 

5163
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,430
um it's difficult to do well a lot of
people what they do is instead they have

5164
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
people what they do is instead they have
 

5165
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,149
people what they do is instead they have
like

5166
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
like
 

5167
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,709
like
a million suppliers and then they like

5168
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
a million suppliers and then they like
 

5169
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:35,350
a million suppliers and then they like
there's

5170
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,360
there's
 

5171
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,990
there's
everybody's men they all co-locate them

5172
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:38,000
everybody's men they all co-locate them
 

5173
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,550
everybody's men they all co-locate them
and

5174
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
and
 

5175
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,630
and
they tie the systems together it's it's

5176
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
they tie the systems together it's it's
 

5177
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,390
they tie the systems together it's it's
a fundamentally distributed even

5178
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
a fundamentally distributed even
 

5179
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,550
a fundamentally distributed even
i think that's that also is not getting

5180
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
i think that's that also is not getting
 

5181
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,310
i think that's that also is not getting
at the issue i was just talking about um

5182
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,320
at the issue i was just talking about um
 

5183
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,430
at the issue i was just talking about um
which is self-replication it's

5184
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
which is self-replication it's
 

5185
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,830
which is self-replication it's
um i mean self-replication means there's

5186
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:52,840
um i mean self-replication means there's
 

5187
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,510
um i mean self-replication means there's
no entity involved other than the entity

5188
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,520
no entity involved other than the entity
 

5189
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,950
no entity involved other than the entity
that's replicating

5190
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:56,960
that's replicating
 

5191
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,270
that's replicating
um right and so if there's humans in

5192
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
um right and so if there's humans in
 

5193
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,310
um right and so if there's humans in
this in the loop

5194
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
this in the loop
 

5195
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,149
this in the loop
that's not really self-replicating right

5196
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:02,159
that's not really self-replicating right
 

5197
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,510
that's not really self-replicating right
it's unless

5198
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
it's unless
 

5199
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,790
it's unless
somehow we're duped but

5200
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
somehow we're duped but
 

5201
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,910
somehow we're duped but
it's also i i don't necessarily

5202
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920

 

5203
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,270

agree with you because you've kind of

5204
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
agree with you because you've kind of
 

5205
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,310
agree with you because you've kind of
mentioned that ai will not say no to us

5206
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
mentioned that ai will not say no to us
 

5207
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,030
mentioned that ai will not say no to us
i i just think they will yeah yeah so

5208
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
i i just think they will yeah yeah so
 

5209
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,430
i i just think they will yeah yeah so
like

5210
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:19,440
like
 

5211
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,790
like
uh i think it's a useful feature to

5212
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
uh i think it's a useful feature to
 

5213
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,870
uh i think it's a useful feature to
build in i'm just trying to like

5214
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
build in i'm just trying to like
 

5215
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,669
build in i'm just trying to like
uh put myself in the mind of engineers

5216
01:19:27,669 --> 01:19:27,679
uh put myself in the mind of engineers
 

5217
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,750
uh put myself in the mind of engineers
to sometimes say no

5218
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
to sometimes say no
 

5219
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,870
to sometimes say no
you know if you you yeah well i gave an

5220
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
you know if you you yeah well i gave an
 

5221
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,390
you know if you you yeah well i gave an
example earlier right i get an example

5222
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
example earlier right i get an example
 

5223
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,270
example earlier right i get an example
of my car

5224
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
of my car
 

5225
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,229
of my car
yeah right my car turns the wheel and

5226
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
yeah right my car turns the wheel and
 

5227
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,630
yeah right my car turns the wheel and
and

5228
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
and
 

5229
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,630
and
applies the accelerator and the brake as

5230
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:40,640
applies the accelerator and the brake as
 

5231
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,750
applies the accelerator and the brake as
i say until

5232
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
i say until
 

5233
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,750
i say until
it decides there's something dangerous

5234
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
it decides there's something dangerous
 

5235
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,430
it decides there's something dangerous
yes and then it doesn't do that

5236
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
yes and then it doesn't do that
 

5237
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,470
yes and then it doesn't do that
yeah now that was something

5238
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:48,480
yeah now that was something
 

5239
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,630
yeah now that was something
it didn't decide to do is something we

5240
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:50,640
it didn't decide to do is something we
 

5241
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,310
it didn't decide to do is something we
programmed into the car

5242
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,320
programmed into the car
 

5243
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,910
programmed into the car
uh and so good it was a good idea right

5244
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
uh and so good it was a good idea right
 

5245
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,910
uh and so good it was a good idea right
the question again isn't like if we

5246
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:57,920
the question again isn't like if we
 

5247
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,270
the question again isn't like if we
create an intelligent system will it

5248
01:19:59,270 --> 01:19:59,280
create an intelligent system will it
 

5249
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,709
create an intelligent system will it
ever

5250
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
ever
 

5251
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,630
ever
ignore our commands of course it will on

5252
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:02,640
ignore our commands of course it will on
 

5253
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,310
ignore our commands of course it will on
sometimes is it going to do it because

5254
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,320
sometimes is it going to do it because
 

5255
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:04,790
sometimes is it going to do it because
it came

5256
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
it came
 

5257
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,669
it came
up came up with its own goals that serve

5258
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
up came up with its own goals that serve
 

5259
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,550
up came up with its own goals that serve
its purposes

5260
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,560
its purposes
 

5261
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,310
its purposes
and it doesn't care about our purposes

5262
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:10,320
and it doesn't care about our purposes
 

5263
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,470
and it doesn't care about our purposes
no i don't think that's going to happen

5264
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
no i don't think that's going to happen
 

5265
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,390
no i don't think that's going to happen
okay so let me ask you about these uh

5266
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
okay so let me ask you about these uh
 

5267
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,070
okay so let me ask you about these uh
super intelligent cortical systems that

5268
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
super intelligent cortical systems that
 

5269
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,950
super intelligent cortical systems that
we engineer

5270
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:16,960
we engineer
 

5271
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,070
we engineer
and us humans

5272
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080

 

5273
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,470

do you think uh with these entities

5274
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
do you think uh with these entities
 

5275
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,310
do you think uh with these entities
operating out there in the world

5276
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:24,320
operating out there in the world
 

5277
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,149
operating out there in the world
what does the future most promising

5278
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
what does the future most promising
 

5279
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,669
what does the future most promising
future look like is it

5280
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
future look like is it
 

5281
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,870
future look like is it
us merging with them

5282
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:30,880
us merging with them
 

5283
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,149
us merging with them
or is it us like how do we keep

5284
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
or is it us like how do we keep
 

5285
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,310
or is it us like how do we keep
us humans around when you have

5286
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,320
us humans around when you have
 

5287
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,149
us humans around when you have
increasingly intelligent beings is it

5288
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:38,159
increasingly intelligent beings is it
 

5289
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,629
increasingly intelligent beings is it
uh one of the dreams is to upload our

5290
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
uh one of the dreams is to upload our
 

5291
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,229
uh one of the dreams is to upload our
minds in the digital space

5292
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
minds in the digital space
 

5293
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:45,590
minds in the digital space
so can we just give our minds

5294
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
so can we just give our minds
 

5295
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,910
so can we just give our minds
to these uh systems yeah so they can

5296
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:47,920
to these uh systems yeah so they can
 

5297
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,870
to these uh systems yeah so they can
operate on them

5298
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
operate on them
 

5299
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,310
operate on them
is there some kind of more interesting

5300
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
is there some kind of more interesting
 

5301
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,910
is there some kind of more interesting
merger or is there more more

5302
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
merger or is there more more
 

5303
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,189
merger or is there more more
in the third part of my book i talked

5304
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
in the third part of my book i talked
 

5305
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,790
in the third part of my book i talked
about all these scenarios and let me

5306
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:54,800
about all these scenarios and let me
 

5307
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,669
about all these scenarios and let me
just walk through them

5308
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
just walk through them
 

5309
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,870
just walk through them
sure um the uploading the mind one yes

5310
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:00,880
sure um the uploading the mind one yes
 

5311
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,669
sure um the uploading the mind one yes
extremely really difficult to do like

5312
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
extremely really difficult to do like
 

5313
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,669
extremely really difficult to do like
like we have no idea how to do this even

5314
01:21:05,669 --> 01:21:05,679
like we have no idea how to do this even
 

5315
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,870
like we have no idea how to do this even
remotely right now um so it would be a

5316
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
remotely right now um so it would be a
 

5317
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,390
remotely right now um so it would be a
very long way away

5318
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:10,400
very long way away
 

5319
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,910
very long way away
but i make the argument you wouldn't

5320
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
but i make the argument you wouldn't
 

5321
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,590
but i make the argument you wouldn't
like the result

5322
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
like the result
 

5323
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,750
like the result
um and you wouldn't be pleased with the

5324
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,760
um and you wouldn't be pleased with the
 

5325
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,189
um and you wouldn't be pleased with the
result it's really not what you think

5326
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:17,199
result it's really not what you think
 

5327
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,149
result it's really not what you think
it's going to be

5328
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
it's going to be
 

5329
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,750
it's going to be
um imagine i could upload your brain

5330
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:19,760
um imagine i could upload your brain
 

5331
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,510
um imagine i could upload your brain
into into a computer right now and now

5332
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
into into a computer right now and now
 

5333
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,629
into into a computer right now and now
the computer's sitting there going hey

5334
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:22,639
the computer's sitting there going hey
 

5335
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,350
the computer's sitting there going hey
i'm over here

5336
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
i'm over here
 

5337
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,590
i'm over here
great get rid of that old bio person i

5338
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
great get rid of that old bio person i
 

5339
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,790
great get rid of that old bio person i
don't need them you're still sitting

don't need them you're still sitting
 

5341
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,510
don't need them you're still sitting
here

5342
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520

feel satisfied
 

5349
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,390
feel satisfied
that then you but people imagine look

5350
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
that then you but people imagine look
 

5351
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,830
that then you but people imagine look
i'm on my deathbed and

5352
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
i'm on my deathbed and
 

5353
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,830
i'm on my deathbed and
i'm about to you know expire and i push

5354
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
i'm about to you know expire and i push
 

5355
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,830
i'm about to you know expire and i push
the button and now i'm uploaded but

5356
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
the button and now i'm uploaded but
 

5357
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,430
the button and now i'm uploaded but
think about it a little differently and

5358
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
think about it a little differently and
 

5359
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,750
think about it a little differently and
and so i don't think it's going to be a

5360
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:43,760
and so i don't think it's going to be a
 

5361
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,709
and so i don't think it's going to be a
thing because people

5362
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
thing because people
 

5363
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,870
thing because people
by the time we're able to do this if

5364
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
by the time we're able to do this if
 

5365
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:47,910
by the time we're able to do this if
ever

5366
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:47,920
ever
 

5367
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,430
ever
because you have to replicate the entire

5368
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
because you have to replicate the entire
 

5369
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,030
because you have to replicate the entire
body not just the brain it's

5370
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
body not just the brain it's
 

5371
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,629
body not just the brain it's
it's really it's i walk through the

5372
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
it's really it's i walk through the
 

5373
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,830
it's really it's i walk through the
issues it's really substantial

5374
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:54,840
issues it's really substantial
 

5375
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,430
issues it's really substantial
um do you have a sense of what makes us

5376
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:57,440
um do you have a sense of what makes us
 

5377
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:57,830
um do you have a sense of what makes us
us

5378
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
us
 

5379
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,950
us
is there is there a shortcut to what can

5380
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
is there is there a shortcut to what can
 

5381
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,790
is there is there a shortcut to what can
only save a certain part

5382
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800
only save a certain part
 

5383
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,270
only save a certain part
that makes us truly ours no but i think

5384
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,280
that makes us truly ours no but i think
 

5385
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,470
that makes us truly ours no but i think
that machine would feel like it's you

5386
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:06,480
that machine would feel like it's you
 

5387
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,270
that machine would feel like it's you
too

5388
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
too
 

5389
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,350
too
right right if you people just like i

5390
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
right right if you people just like i
 

5391
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,110
right right if you people just like i
have a child i have a child right i have

5392
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,120
have a child i have a child right i have
 

5393
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,390
have a child i have a child right i have
two daughters

5394
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
two daughters
 

5395
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,910
two daughters
they're independent people i created

5396
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
they're independent people i created
 

5397
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,430
they're independent people i created
them well partly yeah

5398
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,440
them well partly yeah
 

5399
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,189
them well partly yeah
and um uh i don't

5400
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:19,199
and um uh i don't
 

5401
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,189
and um uh i don't
just because they're somewhat like me i

5402
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
just because they're somewhat like me i
 

5403
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,629
just because they're somewhat like me i
don't feel i'm them and they don't feel

5404
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
don't feel i'm them and they don't feel
 

5405
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,229
don't feel i'm them and they don't feel
like i'm me so if you split it apart you

5406
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
like i'm me so if you split it apart you
 

5407
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,189
like i'm me so if you split it apart you
have two people so

5408
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
have two people so
 

5409
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,270
have two people so
we can come back to what what makes what

5410
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
we can come back to what what makes what
 

5411
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,870
we can come back to what what makes what
consciousness we want we can talk about

5412
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
consciousness we want we can talk about
 

5413
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,510
consciousness we want we can talk about
that

5414
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
that
 

5415
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,270
that
but we don't have a remote consciousness

5416
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,280
but we don't have a remote consciousness
 

5417
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,470
but we don't have a remote consciousness
i'm not sitting there going oh i'm

5418
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480
i'm not sitting there going oh i'm
 

5419
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,229
i'm not sitting there going oh i'm
conscious of that you know i mean that

5420
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
conscious of that you know i mean that
 

5421
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,629
conscious of that you know i mean that
system over there so let's say let's

5422
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:36,639
system over there so let's say let's
 

5423
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,229
system over there so let's say let's
let's stay on our topic okay so

5424
01:22:38,229 --> 01:22:38,239
let's stay on our topic okay so
 

5425
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,950
let's stay on our topic okay so
one was uploading a brand yep ain't

5426
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
one was uploading a brand yep ain't
 

5427
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,470
one was uploading a brand yep ain't
gonna happen in a hundred years

5428
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
gonna happen in a hundred years
 

5429
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,470
gonna happen in a hundred years
maybe a thousand but i don't think

5430
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
maybe a thousand but i don't think
 

5431
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,990
maybe a thousand but i don't think
people are gonna wanna do it

5432
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
people are gonna wanna do it
 

5433
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,030
people are gonna wanna do it
the merging your mind with uh

5434
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,040
the merging your mind with uh
 

5435
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,830
the merging your mind with uh
you know the neural link thing right

5436
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:50,840
you know the neural link thing right
 

5437
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,709
you know the neural link thing right
like again

5438
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
like again
 

5439
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,310
like again
really really difficult it's it's one

5440
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
really really difficult it's it's one
 

5441
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,149
really really difficult it's it's one
thing to make progress to control a

5442
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:56,159
thing to make progress to control a
 

5443
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,830
thing to make progress to control a
prosthetic arm it's another to have like

5444
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
prosthetic arm it's another to have like
 

5445
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,550
prosthetic arm it's another to have like
a billion

5446
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
a billion
 

5447
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,629
a billion
or several billion you know things and

5448
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:00,639
or several billion you know things and
 

5449
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,709
or several billion you know things and
understanding what those signals mean

5450
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:02,719
understanding what those signals mean
 

5451
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:03,990
understanding what those signals mean
like it's the one thing they're like

5452
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
like it's the one thing they're like
 

5453
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,070
like it's the one thing they're like
okay i can learn to think some patterns

5454
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,080
okay i can learn to think some patterns
 

5455
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,510
okay i can learn to think some patterns
to make something happen

5456
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
to make something happen
 

5457
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,110
to make something happen
it's quite another thing to have a

5458
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
it's quite another thing to have a
 

5459
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,189
it's quite another thing to have a
system a computer which actually knows

5460
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
system a computer which actually knows
 

5461
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,790
system a computer which actually knows
exactly which cells it's talking to and

5462
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,800
exactly which cells it's talking to and
 

5463
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,310
exactly which cells it's talking to and
how it's talking to them and interacting

5464
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
how it's talking to them and interacting
 

5465
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,750
how it's talking to them and interacting
in a way like that

5466
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
in a way like that
 

5467
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,270
in a way like that
very very difficult we're not getting

5468
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
very very difficult we're not getting
 

5469
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,870
very very difficult we're not getting
anywhere closer to that

5470
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
anywhere closer to that
 

5471
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,669
anywhere closer to that
um interesting can i uh can i ask a

5472
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
um interesting can i uh can i ask a
 

5473
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,430
um interesting can i uh can i ask a
question here

5474
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
question here
 

5475
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,070
question here
what so for me what makes that merger

5476
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
what so for me what makes that merger
 

5477
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,950
what so for me what makes that merger
very difficult

5478
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:26,960
very difficult
 

5479
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,229
very difficult
practically in the next 10 20 50 years

5480
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:30,239
practically in the next 10 20 50 years
 

5481
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,870
practically in the next 10 20 50 years
is like literally the biology side of it

5482
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
is like literally the biology side of it
 

5483
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,070
is like literally the biology side of it
which is like

5484
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
which is like
 

5485
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,350
which is like
it's just hard to do that kind of

5486
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:35,360
it's just hard to do that kind of
 

5487
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,669
it's just hard to do that kind of
surgery in a safe way

5488
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
surgery in a safe way
 

5489
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,830
surgery in a safe way
but your intuition is even the machine

5490
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
but your intuition is even the machine
 

5491
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,189
but your intuition is even the machine
learning

5492
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
learning
 

5493
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,870
learning
part of it where the machine has to

5494
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:42,880
part of it where the machine has to
 

5495
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,950
part of it where the machine has to
learn what the heck it's talking to

5496
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:44,960
learn what the heck it's talking to
 

5497
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,750
learn what the heck it's talking to
that's even hard

5498
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
that's even hard
 

5499
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,149
that's even hard
i think it's even harder and it's not

5500
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
i think it's even harder and it's not
 

5501
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:49,830
i think it's even harder and it's not
it's it's easy to do when you're talking

5502
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
it's it's easy to do when you're talking
 

5503
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,669
it's it's easy to do when you're talking
about hundreds of signals

5504
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:51,679
about hundreds of signals
 

5505
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,910
about hundreds of signals
it's it's a totally different thing to

5506
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:53,920
it's it's a totally different thing to
 

5507
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,950
it's it's a totally different thing to
say you're talking about billions of

5508
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
say you're talking about billions of
 

5509
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,590
say you're talking about billions of
signals

5510
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
signals
 

5511
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,149
signals
so you don't think it's the raw it's a

5512
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
so you don't think it's the raw it's a
 

5513
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,270
so you don't think it's the raw it's a
machine learning problem you don't think

5514
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,280
machine learning problem you don't think
 

5515
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,149
machine learning problem you don't think
it could be learned

5516
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
it could be learned
 

5517
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,070
it could be learned
well i'm just saying no i think you'd

5518
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
well i'm just saying no i think you'd
 

5519
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,590
well i'm just saying no i think you'd
have to have detailed knowledge

5520
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
have to have detailed knowledge
 

5521
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,110
have to have detailed knowledge
you'd have to know exactly what the

5522
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,120
you'd have to know exactly what the
 

5523
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,110
you'd have to know exactly what the
types of neurons you're connecting to

5524
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
types of neurons you're connecting to
 

5525
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,310
types of neurons you're connecting to
i mean in the brain there's these

5526
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
i mean in the brain there's these
 

5527
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,430
i mean in the brain there's these
they're neurons that do all different

5528
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
they're neurons that do all different
 

5529
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,550
they're neurons that do all different
types of things it's not like a neural

5530
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
types of things it's not like a neural
 

5531
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,470
types of things it's not like a neural
network it's a very complex organism

5532
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
network it's a very complex organism
 

5533
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,149
network it's a very complex organism
system up here we talked about the grid

5534
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:14,159
system up here we talked about the grid
 

5535
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,750
system up here we talked about the grid
cells or the place cells you know you

5536
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:15,760
cells or the place cells you know you
 

5537
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,709
cells or the place cells you know you
have to know what kind of cells you're

5538
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
have to know what kind of cells you're
 

5539
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:17,910
have to know what kind of cells you're
talking to and what they're doing and

5540
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
talking to and what they're doing and
 

5541
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,669
talking to and what they're doing and
how their timing works and all

5542
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
how their timing works and all
 

5543
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,750
how their timing works and all
all this stuff which you can't today

5544
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
all this stuff which you can't today
 

5545
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,350
all this stuff which you can't today
there's no way of doing that right

5546
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
there's no way of doing that right
 

5547
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,189
there's no way of doing that right
but i think it's i think it's a i think

5548
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
but i think it's i think it's a i think
 

5549
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,629
but i think it's i think it's a i think
the problem you're right that the

5550
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
the problem you're right that the
 

5551
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:27,350
the problem you're right that the
biological

5552
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360
biological
 

5553
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,790
biological
aspect of like who wants to have surgery

5554
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
aspect of like who wants to have surgery
 

5555
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,149
aspect of like who wants to have surgery
and have this stuff inserted in your

5556
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:30,159
and have this stuff inserted in your
 

5557
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:30,709
and have this stuff inserted in your
brain

5558
01:24:30,709 --> 01:24:30,719
brain
 

5559
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,629
brain
that's a problem but this is when we

5560
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
that's a problem but this is when we
 

5561
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:33,990
that's a problem but this is when we
solve that problem

5562
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
solve that problem
 

5563
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,830
solve that problem
i think the the information coding

5564
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:35,840
i think the the information coding
 

5565
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,430
i think the the information coding
aspect is much worse

5566
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
aspect is much worse
 

5567
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,870
aspect is much worse
i think that's much more it's not like

5568
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
i think that's much more it's not like
 

5569
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,390
i think that's much more it's not like
what they're doing today today it's

5570
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,400
what they're doing today today it's
 

5571
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,149
what they're doing today today it's
simple machine learning stuff

5572
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
simple machine learning stuff
 

5573
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,070
simple machine learning stuff
because you're doing simple things but

5574
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,080
because you're doing simple things but
 

5575
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,990
because you're doing simple things but
if you want to merge your brain like i'm

5576
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
if you want to merge your brain like i'm
 

5577
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,550
if you want to merge your brain like i'm
thinking

5578
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
thinking
 

5579
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,550
thinking
on the internet i'm merge my brain with

5580
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
on the internet i'm merge my brain with
 

5581
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,070
on the internet i'm merge my brain with
the machine and we're both doing

5582
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
the machine and we're both doing
 

5583
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,910
the machine and we're both doing
i that's a totally different issue

5584
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
i that's a totally different issue
 

5585
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,070
i that's a totally different issue
that's interesting i i tend to think if

5586
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,080
that's interesting i i tend to think if
 

5587
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,750
that's interesting i i tend to think if
okay if you have a super clean signal

5588
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
okay if you have a super clean signal
 

5589
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,629
okay if you have a super clean signal
from a bunch of neurons at the start you

5590
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
from a bunch of neurons at the start you
 

5591
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,629
from a bunch of neurons at the start you
don't know what those neurons are

5592
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:02,639
don't know what those neurons are
 

5593
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,830
don't know what those neurons are
i think that's much easier than

5594
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,840
i think that's much easier than
 

5595
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,149
i think that's much easier than
the getting of the clean signal i think

5596
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
the getting of the clean signal i think
 

5597
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,110
the getting of the clean signal i think
if you

5598
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,120
if you
 

5599
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,870
if you
think about today's machine learning

5600
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:10,880
think about today's machine learning
 

5601
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,470
think about today's machine learning
that's what you would conclude

5602
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
that's what you would conclude
 

5603
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,229
that's what you would conclude
right i'm thinking about what's going on

5604
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:14,239
right i'm thinking about what's going on
 

5605
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,750
right i'm thinking about what's going on
in the brain and i don't reach that

5606
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
in the brain and i don't reach that
 

5607
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,350
in the brain and i don't reach that
conclusion so we'll have to see

5608
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,360
conclusion so we'll have to see
 

5609
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,229
conclusion so we'll have to see
sure but i don't think even even then i

5610
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
sure but i don't think even even then i
 

5611
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,510
sure but i don't think even even then i
think there's kind of a sad

5612
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
think there's kind of a sad
 

5613
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,110
think there's kind of a sad
future like you know do i do i have to

5614
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
future like you know do i do i have to
 

5615
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,510
future like you know do i do i have to
like

5616
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:25,520
like
 

5617
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,270
like
plug my brain into a computer i'm still

5618
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
plug my brain into a computer i'm still
 

5619
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,950
plug my brain into a computer i'm still
a biological organism i assume i'm still

5620
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
a biological organism i assume i'm still
 

5621
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,990
a biological organism i assume i'm still
going to die

5622
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,000
going to die
 

5623
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,070
going to die
so what what have i achieved right you

5624
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:32,080
so what what have i achieved right you
 

5625
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,669
so what what have i achieved right you
know what have i achieved to do some

5626
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
know what have i achieved to do some
 

5627
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:34,229
know what have i achieved to do some
sort of oh

5628
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:34,239
sort of oh
 

5629
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:37,270
sort of oh
i i disagree we don't know what those

5630
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
i i disagree we don't know what those
 

5631
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,629
i i disagree we don't know what those
are but it seems like there could be a

5632
01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:38,639
are but it seems like there could be a
 

5633
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,149
are but it seems like there could be a
lot of different applications

5634
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
lot of different applications
 

5635
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,270
lot of different applications
it's like virtual reality is to expand

5636
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,280
it's like virtual reality is to expand
 

5637
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,189
it's like virtual reality is to expand
your brain's capability to uh

5638
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
your brain's capability to uh
 

5639
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,750
your brain's capability to uh
to to like to read wikipedia yeah but

5640
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
to to like to read wikipedia yeah but
 

5641
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,189
to to like to read wikipedia yeah but
but fine but but you're still a

5642
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
but fine but but you're still a
 

5643
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,870
but fine but but you're still a
biological organization yes yes you know

5644
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:50,880
biological organization yes yes you know
 

5645
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,350
biological organization yes yes you know
you're still

5646
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
you're still
 

5647
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,629
you're still
you're still mortal you're still all

5648
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
you're still mortal you're still all
 

5649
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,629
you're still mortal you're still all
right so what are you accomplishing

5650
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:54,639
right so what are you accomplishing
 

5651
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,070
right so what are you accomplishing
you're making your life in this

5652
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,080
you're making your life in this
 

5653
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,149
you're making your life in this
short period of time better right just

5654
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
short period of time better right just
 

5655
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,350
short period of time better right just
like uh

5656
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
like uh
 

5657
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,030
like uh
having the internet made our life better

5658
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
having the internet made our life better
 

5659
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,550
having the internet made our life better
yeah yeah okay so i

5660
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
yeah yeah okay so i
 

5661
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,790
yeah yeah okay so i
i think that's of of if i think about

5662
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
i think that's of of if i think about
 

5663
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,550
i think that's of of if i think about
all the possible gains we can have here

5664
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
all the possible gains we can have here
 

5665
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,070
all the possible gains we can have here
that's a marginal one

5666
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,080
that's a marginal one
 

5667
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,110
that's a marginal one
it's an individual hey i'm better you

5668
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
it's an individual hey i'm better you
 

5669
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,550
it's an individual hey i'm better you
know i'm smarter

5670
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,560
know i'm smarter
 

5671
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,270
know i'm smarter
um but you know fine i'm not against it

5672
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
um but you know fine i'm not against it
 

5673
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,950
um but you know fine i'm not against it
i just don't think it's earth-changing

5674
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
i just don't think it's earth-changing
 

5675
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,750
i just don't think it's earth-changing
i but so this is the true of the

5676
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
i but so this is the true of the
 

5677
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,229
i but so this is the true of the
internet

5678
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:20,239
internet
 

5679
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,550
internet
when each of us individuals are smarter

5680
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:22,560
when each of us individuals are smarter
 

5681
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,990
when each of us individuals are smarter
we get a chance to then share our

5682
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,000
we get a chance to then share our
 

5683
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,790
we get a chance to then share our
smartness

5684
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
smartness
 

5685
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,470
smartness
we get smarter and smarter together as

5686
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,480
we get smarter and smarter together as
 

5687
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,149
we get smarter and smarter together as
like as a collective this is kind of

5688
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
like as a collective this is kind of
 

5689
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:29,270
like as a collective this is kind of
like this ant colony

5690
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:29,280
like this ant colony
 

5691
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,390
like this ant colony
but why don't i just create an

5692
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:30,400
but why don't i just create an
 

5693
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,510
but why don't i just create an
intelligent machine that doesn't have

5694
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
intelligent machine that doesn't have
 

5695
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,510
intelligent machine that doesn't have
any of this biological nonsense

5696
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
any of this biological nonsense
 

5697
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,669
any of this biological nonsense
this is all the same it's it's

5698
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
this is all the same it's it's
 

5699
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:36,709
this is all the same it's it's
everything except

5700
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
everything except
 

5701
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,590
everything except
don't burden it with my brain yeah right

5702
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
don't burden it with my brain yeah right
 

5703
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:39,910
don't burden it with my brain yeah right
it

5704
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
it
 

5705
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,590
it
has a brain it is smart it's like my

5706
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:41,600
has a brain it is smart it's like my
 

5707
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,669
has a brain it is smart it's like my
child but it's much much smarter than me

5708
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:43,679
child but it's much much smarter than me
 

5709
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,830
child but it's much much smarter than me
so i have a choice between doing some

5710
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
so i have a choice between doing some
 

5711
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,750
so i have a choice between doing some
implant doing some hybrid weird you know

5712
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
implant doing some hybrid weird you know
 

5713
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,430
implant doing some hybrid weird you know
biological thing that bleeding and all

5714
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
biological thing that bleeding and all
 

5715
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,070
biological thing that bleeding and all
these problems

5716
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
these problems
 

5717
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:53,430
these problems
and limited by my brain or creating a

5718
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:53,440
and limited by my brain or creating a
 

5719
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,189
and limited by my brain or creating a
system which is super smart that i can

5720
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
system which is super smart that i can
 

5721
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,310
system which is super smart that i can
talk to

5722
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
talk to
 

5723
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,990
talk to
um that helps me understand the world

5724
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
um that helps me understand the world
 

5725
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,189
um that helps me understand the world
they can read the inter you know read

5726
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
they can read the inter you know read
 

5727
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,709
they can read the inter you know read
wikipedia and talk to me

5728
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
wikipedia and talk to me
 

5729
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,590
wikipedia and talk to me
i i guess my uh the open questions there

5730
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
i i guess my uh the open questions there
 

5731
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,629
i i guess my uh the open questions there
are

5732
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
are
 

5733
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,350
are
what does the manifestation of super

5734
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
what does the manifestation of super
 

5735
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,270
what does the manifestation of super
intelligence look like so

5736
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
intelligence look like so
 

5737
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,270
intelligence look like so
like what are we going to you talked

5738
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
like what are we going to you talked
 

5739
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,270
like what are we going to you talked
about why do i want to merge with ai

5740
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:13,280
about why do i want to merge with ai
 

5741
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:13,990
about why do i want to merge with ai
like what

5742
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,000
like what
 

5743
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,870
like what
what's the actual marginal benefit here

5744
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880
what's the actual marginal benefit here
 

5745
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,350
what's the actual marginal benefit here
if i

5746
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:17,360
if i
 

5747
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,709
if i
if we have a super intelligent system

5748
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719
if we have a super intelligent system
 

5749
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,470
if we have a super intelligent system
yeah how will it make our life better

5750
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
yeah how will it make our life better
 

5751
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,470
yeah how will it make our life better
so let's let's that's a great question

5752
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
so let's let's that's a great question
 

5753
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,070
so let's let's that's a great question
but let's break it down to little pieces

5754
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,080
but let's break it down to little pieces
 

5755
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,709
but let's break it down to little pieces
all right

5756
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:28,719
all right
 

5757
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,629
all right
on the one hand it can make our life

5758
01:27:30,629 --> 01:27:30,639
on the one hand it can make our life
 

5759
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:31,990
on the one hand it can make our life
better in lots of simple ways

5760
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:32,000
better in lots of simple ways
 

5761
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,830
better in lots of simple ways
you mentioned like a care robot or

5762
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,840
you mentioned like a care robot or
 

5763
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,510
you mentioned like a care robot or
something that helps me do things it

5764
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
something that helps me do things it
 

5765
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,950
something that helps me do things it
cooks i don't know what it does right

5766
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
cooks i don't know what it does right
 

5767
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,229
cooks i don't know what it does right
little things like that we have soup

5768
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:38,239
little things like that we have soup
 

5769
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,709
little things like that we have soup
better smarter cars we can have

5770
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
better smarter cars we can have
 

5771
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,430
better smarter cars we can have
you know better agents and aids helping

5772
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
you know better agents and aids helping
 

5773
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,870
you know better agents and aids helping
us in our work environment and things

5774
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880
us in our work environment and things
 

5775
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,310
us in our work environment and things
like that to me that's like the easy

5776
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:46,320
like that to me that's like the easy
 

5777
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,350
like that to me that's like the easy
stuff the

5778
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,360
stuff the
 

5779
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,390
stuff the
simple stuff in the beginning um

5780
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
simple stuff in the beginning um
 

5781
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,070
simple stuff in the beginning um
and so in the same way that computers

5782
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
and so in the same way that computers
 

5783
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,669
and so in the same way that computers
made our lives better in

5784
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:53,679
made our lives better in
 

5785
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:55,830
made our lives better in
ways many many ways i will have those

5786
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
ways many many ways i will have those
 

5787
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,590
ways many many ways i will have those
kind of things

5788
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
kind of things
 

5789
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,550
kind of things
to me the really exciting thing about ai

5790
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
to me the really exciting thing about ai
 

5791
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,110
to me the really exciting thing about ai
is

5792
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,120
is
 

5793
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,189
is
sort of its transcendent transcendent

5794
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
sort of its transcendent transcendent
 

5795
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,270
sort of its transcendent transcendent
quality in terms of humanity

5796
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
quality in terms of humanity
 

5797
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,189
quality in terms of humanity
we're still biological organisms we're

5798
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:07,199
we're still biological organisms we're
 

5799
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,629
we're still biological organisms we're
still stuck here on earth

5800
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
still stuck here on earth
 

5801
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:09,750
still stuck here on earth
it's going to be hard for us to live

5802
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
it's going to be hard for us to live
 

5803
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,830
it's going to be hard for us to live
anywhere else i don't think

5804
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
anywhere else i don't think
 

5805
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,870
anywhere else i don't think
you and i are going to want to live on

5806
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:12,880
you and i are going to want to live on
 

5807
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,590
you and i are going to want to live on
mars anytime soon

5808
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:15,600
mars anytime soon
 

5809
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,790
mars anytime soon
and um and we're flawed

5810
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
and um and we're flawed
 

5811
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,470
and um and we're flawed
you know we may end up destroying

5812
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:20,480
you know we may end up destroying
 

5813
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,830
you know we may end up destroying
ourselves it's

5814
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
ourselves it's
 

5815
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,950
ourselves it's
totally possible uh we if not completely

5816
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
totally possible uh we if not completely
 

5817
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,470
totally possible uh we if not completely
we could destroy our civilizations

5818
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
we could destroy our civilizations
 

5819
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,470
we could destroy our civilizations
you know it's let's face the fact we

5820
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480
you know it's let's face the fact we
 

5821
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,149
you know it's let's face the fact we
have issues here

5822
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:30,159
have issues here
 

5823
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:32,070
have issues here
but we can create intelligent machines

5824
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
but we can create intelligent machines
 

5825
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,669
but we can create intelligent machines
that can help us in various ways for

5826
01:28:33,669 --> 01:28:33,679
that can help us in various ways for
 

5827
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,030
that can help us in various ways for
example one example i gave

5828
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:35,040
example one example i gave
 

5829
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,709
example one example i gave
another sounds a little sci-fi but i

5830
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
another sounds a little sci-fi but i
 

5831
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,629
another sounds a little sci-fi but i
believe this if we really wanted to live

5832
01:28:38,629 --> 01:28:38,639
believe this if we really wanted to live
 

5833
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:39,510
believe this if we really wanted to live
on mars

5834
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:39,520
on mars
 

5835
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,030
on mars
we'd have to have intelligent systems

5836
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,040
we'd have to have intelligent systems
 

5837
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,350
we'd have to have intelligent systems
that go there and build the habitat for

5838
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
that go there and build the habitat for
 

5839
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,750
that go there and build the habitat for
us

5840
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:43,760
us
 

5841
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,590
us
not humans humans are never going to do

5842
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
not humans humans are never going to do
 

5843
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,270
not humans humans are never going to do
this it's just too hard

5844
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
this it's just too hard
 

5845
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,350
this it's just too hard
um but could we have a thousand or ten

5846
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:49,360
um but could we have a thousand or ten
 

5847
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,550
um but could we have a thousand or ten
thousand you know

5848
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:50,560
thousand you know
 

5849
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,229
thousand you know
engineer workers up there doing this

5850
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:52,239
engineer workers up there doing this
 

5851
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,990
engineer workers up there doing this
stuff building things terraforming mars

5852
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
stuff building things terraforming mars
 

5853
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,470
stuff building things terraforming mars
sure

5854
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,480
sure
 

5855
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,709
sure
maybe we can move to mars but then if we

5856
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:56,719
maybe we can move to mars but then if we
 

5857
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:57,990
maybe we can move to mars but then if we
want to if we want to go around the

5858
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
want to if we want to go around the
 

5859
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,629
want to if we want to go around the
universe

5860
01:28:58,629 --> 01:28:58,639
universe
 

5861
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,070
universe
should i send my children around the

5862
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,080
should i send my children around the
 

5863
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,510
should i send my children around the
universe or should i send some

5864
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
universe or should i send some
 

5865
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,030
universe or should i send some
intelligent machine which is like a

5866
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
intelligent machine which is like a
 

5867
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,990
intelligent machine which is like a
child

5868
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,000
child
 

5869
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,070
child
that represents me and understands our

5870
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
that represents me and understands our
 

5871
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,110
that represents me and understands our
needs here on earth

5872
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,120
needs here on earth
 

5873
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,910
needs here on earth
that could travel through space so it's

5874
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:09,920
that could travel through space so it's
 

5875
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,470
that could travel through space so it's
sort of

5876
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:10,480
sort of
 

5877
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,390
sort of
it in some sense intelligence allows us

5878
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:12,400
it in some sense intelligence allows us
 

5879
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,750
it in some sense intelligence allows us
to transcend our

5880
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
to transcend our
 

5881
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,430
to transcend our
the limitations of our biology uh

5882
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
the limitations of our biology uh
 

5883
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,189
the limitations of our biology uh
with and and don't think of it as a

5884
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:19,199
with and and don't think of it as a
 

5885
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,790
with and and don't think of it as a
negative thing it's in some sense

5886
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:20,800
negative thing it's in some sense
 

5887
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,910
negative thing it's in some sense
my children transcend my the my biology

5888
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:23,920
my children transcend my the my biology
 

5889
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,229
my children transcend my the my biology
too

5890
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:24,239
too
 

5891
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:27,110
too
because they they live beyond me yeah um

5892
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,120
because they they live beyond me yeah um
 

5893
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:27,910
because they they live beyond me yeah um
and we impart

5894
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:27,920
and we impart
 

5895
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,350
and we impart
they represent me and they also have

5896
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:29,360
they represent me and they also have
 

5897
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,790
they represent me and they also have
their own knowledge and i can impart

5898
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,800
their own knowledge and i can impart
 

5899
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,830
their own knowledge and i can impart
knowledge to them so intelligent

5900
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
knowledge to them so intelligent
 

5901
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,030
knowledge to them so intelligent
machines will be like that too

5902
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040
machines will be like that too
 

5903
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,830
machines will be like that too
but not limited like us but the question

5904
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
but not limited like us but the question
 

5905
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,110
but not limited like us but the question
is um

5906
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,120
is um
 

5907
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,270
is um
there's so many ways that transcendence

5908
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,280
there's so many ways that transcendence
 

5909
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,310
there's so many ways that transcendence
can happen

5910
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
can happen
 

5911
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,110
can happen
and the merger with ai and humans is one

5912
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
and the merger with ai and humans is one
 

5913
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,149
and the merger with ai and humans is one
of those ways so

5914
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
of those ways so
 

5915
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:48,149
of those ways so
you said intelligent basically beings or

5916
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:48,159
you said intelligent basically beings or
 

5917
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:49,030
you said intelligent basically beings or
systems

5918
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:49,040
systems
 

5919
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,629
systems
propagating throughout the universe

5920
01:29:50,629 --> 01:29:50,639
propagating throughout the universe
 

5921
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,189
propagating throughout the universe
representing us humans

5922
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
representing us humans
 

5923
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,790
representing us humans
they represent us humans in the sense

5924
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:54,800
they represent us humans in the sense
 

5925
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,149
they represent us humans in the sense
they represent our knowledge and our

5926
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
they represent our knowledge and our
 

5927
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,189
they represent our knowledge and our
history

5928
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
history
 

5929
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:00,629
history
not us individually right

5930
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:00,639
not us individually right
 

5931
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,750
not us individually right
right but i mean the question is is it

5932
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,760
right but i mean the question is is it
 

5933
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,590
right but i mean the question is is it
just the database

5934
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
just the database
 

5935
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,470
just the database

5939
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,030
model
no they're conscious conscious just like

5940
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
no they're conscious conscious just like
 

5941
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,310
no they're conscious conscious just like
us okay

5942
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
us okay
 

5943
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,550
us okay
but just different they're different

5944
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
but just different they're different
 

5945
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,149
but just different they're different
just like my children are different

5946
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:16,159
just like my children are different
 

5947
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,390
just like my children are different
they're like me but they're different um

5948
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:18,400
they're like me but they're different um
 

5949
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,990
they're like me but they're different um
these are more different

5950
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:20,000
these are more different
 

5951
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,110
these are more different
i guess maybe i've already i kind of

5952
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
i guess maybe i've already i kind of
 

5953
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,830
i guess maybe i've already i kind of
i take a very broad view of our life

5954
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
i take a very broad view of our life
 

5955
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,310
i take a very broad view of our life
here on

5956
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,320
here on
 

5957
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,550
here on
on earth i say you know why are we

5958
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
on earth i say you know why are we
 

5959
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,750
on earth i say you know why are we
living here are we just living because

5960
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,760
living here are we just living because
 

5961
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,950
living here are we just living because
we live

5962
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:30,960
we live
 

5963
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,550
we live
is are we surviving because we can

5964
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:32,560
is are we surviving because we can
 

5965
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,709
is are we surviving because we can
survive are we fighting just because

5966
01:30:34,709 --> 01:30:34,719
survive are we fighting just because
 

5967
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,550
survive are we fighting just because
we want to just keep going what's the

5968
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:36,560
we want to just keep going what's the
 

5969
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,390
we want to just keep going what's the
point of it yeah right

5970
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
point of it yeah right
 

5971
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,470
point of it yeah right
so to me the point if i ask myself

5972
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:40,480
so to me the point if i ask myself
 

5973
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,629
so to me the point if i ask myself
what's the point of life is

5974
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,639
what's the point of life is
 

5975
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,149
what's the point of life is
what transcends that ephemeral sort of

5976
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
what transcends that ephemeral sort of
 

5977
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,229
what transcends that ephemeral sort of
biological experience

5978
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:48,239
biological experience
 

5979
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,590
biological experience
is to me this is my answer is

5980
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
is to me this is my answer is
 

5981
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,350
is to me this is my answer is
the acquisition of knowledge to

5982
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
the acquisition of knowledge to
 

5983
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,750
the acquisition of knowledge to
understand more about the universe

5984
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:55,760
understand more about the universe
 

5985
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,229
understand more about the universe
and to explore and that's partly to

5986
01:30:58,229 --> 01:30:58,239
and to explore and that's partly to
 

5987
01:30:58,239 --> 01:30:58,870
and to explore and that's partly to
learn more

5988
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
learn more
 

5989
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,709
learn more
right i don't view it as

5990
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:02,719
right i don't view it as
 

5991
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,830
right i don't view it as
a terrible thing if the ultimate

5992
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
a terrible thing if the ultimate
 

5993
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,870
a terrible thing if the ultimate
outcome of humanity is we create systems

5994
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
outcome of humanity is we create systems
 

5995
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,910
outcome of humanity is we create systems
that are intelligent

5996
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:09,920
that are intelligent
 

5997
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,510
that are intelligent
that are our offspring but are not like

5998
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
that are our offspring but are not like
 

5999
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,270
that are our offspring but are not like
us at all and we stay

6000
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:13,280
us at all and we stay
 

6001
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,870
us at all and we stay
we stay here and live on earth as long

6002
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:14,880
we stay here and live on earth as long
 

6003
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,510
we stay here and live on earth as long
as we can which won't be forever

6004
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:17,520
as we can which won't be forever
 

6005
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,790
as we can which won't be forever
but as long as we can and

6006
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:20,800
but as long as we can and
 

6007
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,950
but as long as we can and
but that would be a great thing to do

6008
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
but that would be a great thing to do
 

6009
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,470
but that would be a great thing to do
it's not a it's not like a

6010
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
it's not a it's not like a
 

6011
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,149
it's not a it's not like a
negative thing well would uh

6012
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:28,159
negative thing well would uh
 

6013
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:31,910
negative thing well would uh
you'd be okay then if uh the human

6014
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:31,920
you'd be okay then if uh the human
 

6015
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,629
you'd be okay then if uh the human
species vanishes but our knowledge is

6016
01:31:34,629 --> 01:31:34,639
species vanishes but our knowledge is
 

6017
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:35,510
species vanishes but our knowledge is
preserved

6018
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520
preserved
 

6019
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,070
preserved
and keeps being expanded by intelligent

6020
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:38,080
and keeps being expanded by intelligent
 

6021
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,430
and keeps being expanded by intelligent
systems

6022
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:39,440
systems
 

6023
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,669
systems
i want our knowledge to be preserved and

6024
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
i want our knowledge to be preserved and
 

6025
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:42,709
i want our knowledge to be preserved and
expanded

6026
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:42,719
expanded
 

6027
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,510
expanded
yeah am i okay with humans dying no i

6028
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,520
yeah am i okay with humans dying no i
 

6029
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,870
yeah am i okay with humans dying no i
don't want that to happen

6030
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:46,880
don't want that to happen
 

6031
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,669
don't want that to happen
but if if if it does happen what if we

6032
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
but if if if it does happen what if we
 

6033
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,950
but if if if it does happen what if we
we were sitting here and this is uh

6034
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:50,960
we were sitting here and this is uh
 

6035
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,310
we were sitting here and this is uh
we're the last two people on earth we're

6036
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
we're the last two people on earth we're
 

6037
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,669
we're the last two people on earth we're
saying lex we blew it

6038
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
saying lex we blew it
 

6039
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,990
saying lex we blew it
it's all over right yeah wouldn't i feel

6040
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,000
it's all over right yeah wouldn't i feel
 

6041
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,870
it's all over right yeah wouldn't i feel
better if i

6042
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:56,880
better if i
 

6043
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,629
better if i
knew that our knowledge was preserved

6044
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
knew that our knowledge was preserved
 

6045
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,070
knew that our knowledge was preserved
and that we had agents

6046
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,080
and that we had agents
 

6047
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,830
and that we had agents
represent that knew about that that were

6048
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:01,840
represent that knew about that that were
 

6049
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,149
represent that knew about that that were
trans you know they were that left earth

6050
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:04,159
trans you know they were that left earth
 

6051
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,149
trans you know they were that left earth
i would want that it's better than not

6052
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:06,159
i would want that it's better than not
 

6053
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,750
i would want that it's better than not
having that you know i make the analogy

6054
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:07,760
having that you know i make the analogy
 

6055
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,189
having that you know i make the analogy
of like you know the dinosaurs the poor

6056
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:09,199
of like you know the dinosaurs the poor
 

6057
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,629
of like you know the dinosaurs the poor
dinosaurs they live for you know tens of

6058
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
dinosaurs they live for you know tens of
 

6059
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:11,510
dinosaurs they live for you know tens of
millions of years

6060
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,520
millions of years
 

6061
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,189
millions of years
they raised their kids they you know

6062
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
they raised their kids they you know
 

6063
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,950
they raised their kids they you know
they they fought to survive they were

6064
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:14,960
they they fought to survive they were
 

6065
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:15,830
they they fought to survive they were
hungry they

6066
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,840
hungry they
 

6067
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,229
hungry they
they they did everything we do and then

6068
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
they they did everything we do and then
 

6069
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,270
they they did everything we do and then
they're all gone

6070
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:19,280
they're all gone
 

6071
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,950
they're all gone
yeah like you know and and if we didn't

6072
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:20,960
yeah like you know and and if we didn't
 

6073
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,110
yeah like you know and and if we didn't
discover their bones

6074
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,120
discover their bones
 

6075
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,590
discover their bones
nobody would ever know that they ever

6076
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:25,600
nobody would ever know that they ever
 

6077
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,790
nobody would ever know that they ever
existed right

6078
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:26,800
existed right
 

6079
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,149
existed right
do we want to be like that i don't want

6080
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
do we want to be like that i don't want
 

6081
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,390
do we want to be like that i don't want
to be like that but there's a sad aspect

6082
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:30,400
to be like that but there's a sad aspect
 

6083
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,030
to be like that but there's a sad aspect
to it and

6084
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,040
to it and
 

6085
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,669
to it and
it's kind of it's jarring to think about

6086
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:33,679
it's kind of it's jarring to think about
 

6087
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:34,070
it's kind of it's jarring to think about
that

6088
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
that
 

6089
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,110
that
it's possible that a human-like

6090
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,120
it's possible that a human-like
 

6091
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,189
it's possible that a human-like
intelligent civilization has previously

6092
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:39,199
intelligent civilization has previously
 

6093
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:40,310
intelligent civilization has previously
existed on earth

6094
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
existed on earth
 

6095
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,270
existed on earth
oh yeah the reason i say this is like it

6096
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:43,280
oh yeah the reason i say this is like it
 

6097
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:43,830
oh yeah the reason i say this is like it
is

6098
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,840
is
 

6099
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,149
is
jarring to think that we would not if

6100
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
jarring to think that we would not if
 

6101
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,910
jarring to think that we would not if
they weren't extinct we wouldn't be able

6102
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
they weren't extinct we wouldn't be able
 

6103
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,030
they weren't extinct we wouldn't be able
to find evidence of them

6104
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
to find evidence of them
 

6105
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,430
to find evidence of them
after a sufficient amount after a

6106
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:51,440
after a sufficient amount after a
 

6107
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,709
after a sufficient amount after a
sufficient amount of time

6108
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
sufficient amount of time
 

6109
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,870
sufficient amount of time
of course there's like look basically

6110
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:54,880
of course there's like look basically
 

6111
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,070
of course there's like look basically
humans like if we destroy ourselves now

6112
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
humans like if we destroy ourselves now
 

6113
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,910
humans like if we destroy ourselves now
human civilization destroy ourselves now

6114
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
human civilization destroy ourselves now
 

6115
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,350
human civilization destroy ourselves now
after a sufficient amount of time we

6116
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
after a sufficient amount of time we
 

6117
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,149
after a sufficient amount of time we
would not be

6118
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,159
would not be
 

6119
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,470
would not be
we'd find the evidence of the dinosaurs

6120
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:04,480
we'd find the evidence of the dinosaurs
 

6121
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,830
we'd find the evidence of the dinosaurs
we would not find evidence

6122
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
we would not find evidence
 

6123
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,510
we would not find evidence
of those humans yeah that's kind of an

6124
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
of those humans yeah that's kind of an
 

6125
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,830
of those humans yeah that's kind of an
odd thing to think about although

6126
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:09,840
odd thing to think about although
 

6127
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,310
odd thing to think about although
i'm not sure if we have enough knowledge

6128
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
i'm not sure if we have enough knowledge
 

6129
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,030
i'm not sure if we have enough knowledge
about

6130
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
about
 

6131
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,870
about
species going back for billions of years

6132
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
species going back for billions of years
 

6133
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,149
species going back for billions of years
that we could we could

6134
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
that we could we could
 

6135
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,430
that we could we could
we might be able to eliminate that

6136
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440
we might be able to eliminate that
 

6137
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,030
we might be able to eliminate that
possibility but it's an interesting

6138
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:19,040
possibility but it's an interesting
 

6139
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:19,590
possibility but it's an interesting
question

6140
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
question
 

6141
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,510
question
of course this is a similar question to

6142
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,520
of course this is a similar question to
 

6143
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,189
of course this is a similar question to
you know there were lots of intelligent

6144
01:33:23,189 --> 01:33:23,199
you know there were lots of intelligent
 

6145
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,550
you know there were lots of intelligent
species throughout the without our

6146
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
species throughout the without our
 

6147
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,189
species throughout the without our
galaxy

6148
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
galaxy
 

6149
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,270
galaxy
that have all disappeared yeah that's

6150
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:27,280
that have all disappeared yeah that's
 

6151
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,229
that have all disappeared yeah that's
super sad that

6152
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:28,239
super sad that
 

6153
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,590
super sad that
um there exactly that

6154
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:31,600
um there exactly that
 

6155
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,350
um there exactly that
there may have been much more

6156
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
there may have been much more
 

6157
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,510
there may have been much more
intelligent alien civilizations in our

6158
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
intelligent alien civilizations in our
 

6159
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:35,990
intelligent alien civilizations in our
galaxy

6160
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
galaxy
 

6161
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,790
galaxy
that are no longer there yeah um you

6162
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
that are no longer there yeah um you
 

6163
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,709
that are no longer there yeah um you
actually talked about this

6164
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:40,719
actually talked about this
 

6165
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,189
actually talked about this
um that humans might destroy ourselves

6166
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:43,199
um that humans might destroy ourselves
 

6167
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:43,910
um that humans might destroy ourselves
yeah

6168
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
yeah
 

6169
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,070
yeah
and how we might preserve our knowledge

6170
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
and how we might preserve our knowledge
 

6171
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,910
and how we might preserve our knowledge
yeah and advertise that knowledge

6172
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
yeah and advertise that knowledge
 

6173
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,910
yeah and advertise that knowledge
to other advertisers a funny word to use

6174
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:55,920
to other advertisers a funny word to use
 

6175
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,590
to other advertisers a funny word to use
from a pr person there's no financial

6176
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
from a pr person there's no financial
 

6177
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,149
from a pr person there's no financial
gain in this

6178
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159

 

6179
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,070

uh you know like make it like from a

6180
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,080
uh you know like make it like from a
 

6181
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,229
uh you know like make it like from a
tourism perspective make it interesting

6182
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:04,239
tourism perspective make it interesting
 

6183
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,229
tourism perspective make it interesting
can you describe how well there's a

6184
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:06,239
can you describe how well there's a
 

6185
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,070
can you describe how well there's a
couple things i broke it down to the two

6186
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,080
couple things i broke it down to the two
 

6187
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:08,790
couple things i broke it down to the two
parts

6188
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800
parts
 

6189
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,229
parts
actually three parts one is um

6190
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,239
actually three parts one is um
 

6191
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,629
actually three parts one is um
you know there's a lot of things we know

6192
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:14,639
you know there's a lot of things we know
 

6193
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,310
you know there's a lot of things we know
that what if what if we were to what if

6194
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
that what if what if we were to what if
 

6195
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,030
that what if what if we were to what if
we ended

6196
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:17,040
we ended
 

6197
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,110
we ended
up our civilization collapsed yeah i'm

6198
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,120
up our civilization collapsed yeah i'm
 

6199
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,950
up our civilization collapsed yeah i'm
not talking tomorrow yeah we could be a

6200
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:20,960
not talking tomorrow yeah we could be a
 

6201
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,229
not talking tomorrow yeah we could be a
thousand years from now alex you know we

6202
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:22,239
thousand years from now alex you know we
 

6203
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,510
thousand years from now alex you know we
don't really know but

6204
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
don't really know but
 

6205
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,590
don't really know but
but historically would be likely at some

6206
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,600
but historically would be likely at some
 

6207
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,350
but historically would be likely at some
point time flies when you're having fun

6208
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
point time flies when you're having fun
 

6209
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,390
point time flies when you're having fun
yeah that's a good way to put it um

6210
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,400
yeah that's a good way to put it um
 

6211
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,550
yeah that's a good way to put it um
you know could we and then then

6212
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:32,560
you know could we and then then
 

6213
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,070
you know could we and then then
intelligent life evolved again on this

6214
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,080
intelligent life evolved again on this
 

6215
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,110
intelligent life evolved again on this
planet

6216
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:35,120
planet
 

6217
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,470
planet
wouldn't they want to know a lot about

6218
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
wouldn't they want to know a lot about
 

6219
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,990
wouldn't they want to know a lot about
us and what we knew when they wouldn't

6220
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
us and what we knew when they wouldn't
 

6221
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,870
us and what we knew when they wouldn't
be able to ask us

6222
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
be able to ask us
 

6223
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,950
be able to ask us
questions so one very simple thing i

6224
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
questions so one very simple thing i
 

6225
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,950
questions so one very simple thing i
said how would we archive what we know

6226
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:42,960
said how would we archive what we know
 

6227
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,470
said how would we archive what we know
that was a very simple idea i said you

6228
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,480
that was a very simple idea i said you
 

6229
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,070
that was a very simple idea i said you
know what that wouldn't be that hard but

6230
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080
know what that wouldn't be that hard but
 

6231
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,950
know what that wouldn't be that hard but
a few satellites

6232
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:46,960
a few satellites
 

6233
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,310
a few satellites
you know going around this the sun and

6234
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
you know going around this the sun and
 

6235
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,550
you know going around this the sun and
we upload wikipedia every day and

6236
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:50,560
we upload wikipedia every day and
 

6237
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,950
we upload wikipedia every day and
um that kind of thing uh so you know we

6238
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:52,960
um that kind of thing uh so you know we
 

6239
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,550
um that kind of thing uh so you know we
can end up killing ourselves well it's

6240
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
can end up killing ourselves well it's
 

6241
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,910
can end up killing ourselves well it's
up there and the next intelligence piece

6242
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
up there and the next intelligence piece
 

6243
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,950
up there and the next intelligence piece
will find it and learn something that

6244
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
will find it and learn something that
 

6245
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,149
will find it and learn something that
would be they would like that they would

6246
01:34:58,149 --> 01:34:58,159
would be they would like that they would
 

6247
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,189
would be they would like that they would
appreciate that

6248
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199

 

6249
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,550

so that's one thing the next thing i

6250
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
so that's one thing the next thing i
 

6251
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,550
so that's one thing the next thing i
said well what if you know

6252
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
said well what if you know
 

6253
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,510
said well what if you know
how to outside of our solar system we

6254
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:07,520
how to outside of our solar system we
 

6255
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,109
how to outside of our solar system we
have the seti program we're looking for

6256
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:09,119
have the seti program we're looking for
 

6257
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,950
have the seti program we're looking for
these intelligent signals from everybody

6258
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
these intelligent signals from everybody
 

6259
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,790
these intelligent signals from everybody
and if you do a little bit of math which

6260
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:12,800
and if you do a little bit of math which
 

6261
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,709
and if you do a little bit of math which
i did in the book uh and you say well

6262
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:14,719
i did in the book uh and you say well
 

6263
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:15,669
i did in the book uh and you say well
what if intelligent

6264
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
what if intelligent
 

6265
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,229
what if intelligent
species only live for 10 000 years

6266
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
species only live for 10 000 years
 

6267
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,590
species only live for 10 000 years
before you know technologically

6268
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:19,600
before you know technologically
 

6269
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,270
before you know technologically
intelligent species like ones are really

6270
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,280
intelligent species like ones are really
 

6271
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,070
intelligent species like ones are really
able to do this

6272
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080
able to do this
 

6273
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,470
able to do this
we're just starting to be able to do um

6274
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:24,480
we're just starting to be able to do um
 

6275
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,830
we're just starting to be able to do um
well the chances are we wouldn't be able

6276
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
well the chances are we wouldn't be able
 

6277
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,870
well the chances are we wouldn't be able
to see any of them because they would

6278
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
to see any of them because they would
 

6279
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,990
to see any of them because they would
have all been disappeared by

6280
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
have all been disappeared by
 

6281
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,229
have all been disappeared by
now um they would they've lived for 10

6282
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
now um they would they've lived for 10
 

6283
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,070
now um they would they've lived for 10
000 years and now they're gone

6284
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
000 years and now they're gone
 

6285
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,430
000 years and now they're gone
and so we're not going to find these

6286
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,440
and so we're not going to find these
 

6287
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,030
and so we're not going to find these
signals being sent from these people

6288
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
signals being sent from these people
 

6289
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,149
signals being sent from these people
because

6290
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:36,159
because
 

6291
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,669
because
i said what kind of signal could you

6292
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:37,679
i said what kind of signal could you
 

6293
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,750
i said what kind of signal could you
create that would last a million years

6294
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:39,760
create that would last a million years
 

6295
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,109
create that would last a million years
or a billion years

6296
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:41,119
or a billion years
 

6297
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,669
or a billion years
that someone would say damn it someone

6298
01:35:43,669 --> 01:35:43,679
that someone would say damn it someone
 

6299
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:44,790
that someone would say damn it someone
smart lived there

6300
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
smart lived there
 

6301
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,070
smart lived there
we know that that would be a

6302
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
we know that that would be a
 

6303
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,910
we know that that would be a
life-changing event for us to figure

6304
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:47,920
life-changing event for us to figure
 

6305
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,109
life-changing event for us to figure
that out well what we're looking for

6306
01:35:49,109 --> 01:35:49,119
that out well what we're looking for
 

6307
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,470
that out well what we're looking for
today in the study program isn't that

6308
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,480
today in the study program isn't that
 

6309
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,590
today in the study program isn't that
we're looking for very

6310
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:51,600
we're looking for very
 

6311
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,149
we're looking for very
coded signals in some sense and so i

6312
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,159
coded signals in some sense and so i
 

6313
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,270
coded signals in some sense and so i
asked myself what would be a different

6314
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:55,280
asked myself what would be a different
 

6315
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,430
asked myself what would be a different
type of signal one could create

6316
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
type of signal one could create
 

6317
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,310
type of signal one could create
i've always thought about this

6318
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
i've always thought about this
 

6319
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,669
i've always thought about this
throughout my life and in the book i

6320
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
throughout my life and in the book i
 

6321
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:00,470
throughout my life and in the book i
gave one

6322
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:00,480
gave one
 

6323
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,470
gave one
one possible suggestion which was um

6324
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
one possible suggestion which was um
 

6325
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,950
one possible suggestion which was um
we now detect planets going around other

6326
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:06,960
we now detect planets going around other
 

6327
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,310
we now detect planets going around other
other suns

6328
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
other suns
 

6329
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,350
other suns
other stars excuse me and we do that by

6330
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
other stars excuse me and we do that by
 

6331
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,229
other stars excuse me and we do that by
seeing this the

6332
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
seeing this the
 

6333
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,669
seeing this the
the slight dimming of the light as the

6334
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
the slight dimming of the light as the
 

6335
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,910
the slight dimming of the light as the
planets move in front of them that's how

6336
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:15,920
planets move in front of them that's how
 

6337
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,390
planets move in front of them that's how
we detect uh planets elsewhere in our

6338
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:18,400
we detect uh planets elsewhere in our
 

6339
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,510
we detect uh planets elsewhere in our
galaxy

6340
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,520
galaxy
 

6341
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,270

um what if we created something like

6342
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:21,280
um what if we created something like
 

6343
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,390
um what if we created something like
that that just rotated around our

6344
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:24,400
that that just rotated around our
 

6345
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,310
that that just rotated around our
around the sun and it blocked out a

6346
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,320
around the sun and it blocked out a
 

6347
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,669
around the sun and it blocked out a
little bit of light in a particular

6348
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:27,679
little bit of light in a particular

little bit of light in a particular
pattern that someone said hey

6350
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:29,360
pattern that someone said hey
 

6351
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,990
pattern that someone said hey
that's not a planet that is a sign that

that's not a planet that is a sign that
someone was once there you can say

01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,510
someone was once there you can say
what if it's beating up pi you know

01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,189
what if it's beating up pi you know
three point whatever

three point whatever
 

6359
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,990
three point whatever
um so the idea of a distance you can

6360
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
um so the idea of a distance you can
 

6361
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,270
um so the idea of a distance you can
from a distance

6362
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
from a distance
 

6363

no one has to be seen here running a

and and i argue that part of the study

6376
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:54,880
and and i argue that part of the study
 

6377
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,310
and and i argue that part of the study
program should be looking for signals

6378
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:56,320
program should be looking for signals
 

6379

program should be looking for signals
like that

6380
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:57,199
like that
 

6381
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,550
like that
and to look for signals like that you

6382
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560
and to look for signals like that you
 

6383
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,990
and to look for signals like that you
ought to figure out what the how would

6384
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
ought to figure out what the how would
 

6385
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,109
ought to figure out what the how would
we create a signal

6386
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:01,119
we create a signal
 

6387
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,030
we create a signal
like what would we create that would be

like what would we create that would be
 

6389
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,629
like what would we create that would be
like that that would persist for

01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:04,639
like that that would persist for
 

6391
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:05,669
like that that would persist for
millions of years

millions of years
that would be broadcast broadly you

01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
that would be broadcast broadly you
 

6395
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,629
that would be broadcast broadly you

gave that one example
 

6403
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,590

01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,550
think
it's possible if at all possible we'll

6418
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:30,560
it's possible if at all possible we'll
 

6419
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,830
it's possible if at all possible we'll
have to create intelligent machines that

6420
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
have to create intelligent machines that
 

6421
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,590
have to create intelligent machines that
travel throughout this throughout the

6422
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:33,600
travel throughout this throughout the
 

6423
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,109
travel throughout this throughout the
the solar system or throughout the

6424
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:35,119
the solar system or throughout the
 

6425
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,030
the solar system or throughout the
galaxy and i don't think that's going to

6426
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
galaxy and i don't think that's going to
 

6427
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:37,669
galaxy and i don't think that's going to
be humans

6428
01:37:37,669 --> 01:37:37,679
be humans
 

6429
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:38,310
be humans
i don't think it's going to be

6430
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
i don't think it's going to be
 

6431
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,709
i don't think it's going to be
biological organisms so these are just

6432
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
biological organisms so these are just
 

6433
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:41,990
biological organisms so these are just
things to think about you know like

6434
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
things to think about you know like
 

6435
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,550
things to think about you know like
what's the

6436
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
what's the
 

6437
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,990
what's the
you know like i don't i don't want to be

6438
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:44,000
you know like i don't i don't want to be
 

6439
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,030
you know like i don't i don't want to be
like the dinosaurs i don't want to just

6440
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:45,040
like the dinosaurs i don't want to just
 

6441
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,709
like the dinosaurs i don't want to just
live and okay that was it we're done you

6442
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:46,719
live and okay that was it we're done you
 

6443
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:47,590
live and okay that was it we're done you
know

6444
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:47,600
know
 

6445
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,030
know
well there is a kind of presumption that

6446
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:49,040
well there is a kind of presumption that
 

6447
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,709
well there is a kind of presumption that
we're going to live forever which

6448
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
we're going to live forever which
 

6449
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,629
we're going to live forever which
uh i i think it is a bit sad

6450
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
uh i i think it is a bit sad
 

6451
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,109
uh i i think it is a bit sad
to imagine that the message we send as

6452
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
to imagine that the message we send as
 

6453
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:58,629
to imagine that the message we send as
as you talk about

6454
01:37:58,629 --> 01:37:58,639
as you talk about
 

6455
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,669
as you talk about
is that we were once here

6456
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
is that we were once here
 

6457
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,470
is that we were once here
instead of we are here well it could be

6458
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
instead of we are here well it could be
 

6459
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,510
instead of we are here well it could be
we are still here

6460
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520
we are still here
 

6461
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,709
we are still here
uh but it's more of a it's more of an

6462
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:08,719
uh but it's more of a it's more of an
 

6463
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,629
uh but it's more of a it's more of an
insurance policy in case we're not here

6464
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:10,639
insurance policy in case we're not here
 

6465
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:13,830
insurance policy in case we're not here
you know well i don't know but there's

6466
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
you know well i don't know but there's
 

6467
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,350
you know well i don't know but there's
something

6468
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
something
 

6469
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,270
something
i think about we as humans don't often

6470
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
i think about we as humans don't often
 

6471
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,830
i think about we as humans don't often

01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
crazy ideas about you know storing our
 

6577
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,990
crazy ideas about you know storing our
knowledge and

6578
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
knowledge and
 

6579
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,430
knowledge and
and you know merging our brains of

6580
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:03,440
and you know merging our brains of
 

6581
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,030
and you know merging our brains of
computers and sending

6582
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
computers and sending
 

6583
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,870
computers and sending
you know our machine down to space is

6584
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
you know our machine down to space is
 

6585
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,870
you know our machine down to space is
not going to happen in my lifetime

6586
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:08,880
not going to happen in my lifetime
 

6587
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,270
not going to happen in my lifetime
um and they may not have been happening

6588
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,280
um and they may not have been happening
 

6589
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,870
um and they may not have been happening
the next 100 years it may not happen for

6590
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:12,880
the next 100 years it may not happen for
 

6591
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,629
the next 100 years it may not happen for
a thousand years who knows

6592
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:14,639
a thousand years who knows
 

6593
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,350
a thousand years who knows
uh but we have the unique opportunity

6594
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:17,360
uh but we have the unique opportunity
 

6595
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,229
uh but we have the unique opportunity
right now

6596
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:18,239
right now
 

6597
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:21,109
right now
we you me and other people like this um

6598
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:21,119
we you me and other people like this um
 

6599
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:21,510
we you me and other people like this um
to

6600
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:21,520
to
 

6601
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,709
to
sort of at least propose the agenda

6602
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:24,719
sort of at least propose the agenda
 

6603
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,790
sort of at least propose the agenda
um that might impact the future like

6604
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:26,800
um that might impact the future like
 

6605
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,790
um that might impact the future like
that that's a fascinating way to think

6606
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:28,800
that that's a fascinating way to think
 

6607
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,149
that that's a fascinating way to think
uh both like writing or creating

6608
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
uh both like writing or creating
 

6609
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:35,430
uh both like writing or creating
try to make try to create ideas

6610
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:35,440
try to make try to create ideas
 

6611
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,550
try to make try to create ideas
try to create things that uh hold up in

6612
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,560
try to create things that uh hold up in
 

6613
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,510
try to create things that uh hold up in
time yeah

6614
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:39,520
time yeah
 

6615
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,950
time yeah
you know understanding how the brain

6616
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:40,960
you know understanding how the brain
 

6617
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,629
you know understanding how the brain
works we're gonna figure that at once

6618
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
works we're gonna figure that at once
 

6619
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,550
works we're gonna figure that at once
that's it it's gonna be figured out once

6620
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:44,560
that's it it's gonna be figured out once
 

6621
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,750
that's it it's gonna be figured out once
and after that

6622
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:45,760
and after that
 

6623
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,510
and after that
that's the answer and people will people

6624
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,520
that's the answer and people will people
 

6625
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,790
that's the answer and people will people
will study that

6626
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:48,800
will study that
 

6627
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,109
will study that
thousands of years now we still we still

6628
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119
thousands of years now we still we still
 

6629
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,669
thousands of years now we still we still
you know venerate newton and einstein

6630
01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:53,679
you know venerate newton and einstein
 

6631
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,109
you know venerate newton and einstein
and um and you know because

6632
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:57,119
and um and you know because
 

6633
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,070
and um and you know because
because ideas are exciting even well

6634
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,080
because ideas are exciting even well
 

6635
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,430
because ideas are exciting even well
into the future

6636
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,440
into the future
 

6637
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,870
into the future
well the interesting thing is like big

6638
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:02,880
well the interesting thing is like big
 

6639
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,510
well the interesting thing is like big
ideas even if they're wrong

6640
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
ideas even if they're wrong
 

6641
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,430
ideas even if they're wrong
are still useful like

6642
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
are still useful like
 

6643
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:10,790
are still useful like
yeah especially if they're not

6644
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800
yeah especially if they're not
 

6645
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,550
yeah especially if they're not
completely wrong like

6646
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:12,560
completely wrong like
 

6647
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,310
completely wrong like
right newton's laws are not wrong

6648
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:14,320
right newton's laws are not wrong
 

6649
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,830
right newton's laws are not wrong
they're just einsteins they're

6650
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:16,840
they're just einsteins they're
 

6651
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,030
they're just einsteins they're
better um well it's

6652
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:19,040
better um well it's
 

6653
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,550
better um well it's
so yeah i mean but we're talking with

6654
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:20,560
so yeah i mean but we're talking with
 

6655
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,830
so yeah i mean but we're talking with
newton and einstein we're talking about

6656
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
newton and einstein we're talking about
 

6657
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:22,870
newton and einstein we're talking about
physics i wonder

6658
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:22,880
physics i wonder
 

6659
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,310
physics i wonder
if we'll ever achieve that kind of

6660
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
if we'll ever achieve that kind of
 

6661
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,270
if we'll ever achieve that kind of
clarity but understanding um

6662
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,280
clarity but understanding um
 

6663
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,310
clarity but understanding um
like complex systems and the this

6664
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
like complex systems and the this
 

6665
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,149
like complex systems and the this
particular manifestation of complex

6666
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
particular manifestation of complex
 

6667
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,270
particular manifestation of complex
systems which is the

6668
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:33,280
systems which is the
 

6669
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,910
systems which is the
human brain i'm totally optimistic we

6670
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:35,920
human brain i'm totally optimistic we
 

6671
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,709
human brain i'm totally optimistic we
can do that i mean

6672
01:41:36,709 --> 01:41:36,719
can do that i mean
 

6673
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,870
can do that i mean
we're making progress at it i don't see

6674
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:38,880
we're making progress at it i don't see
 

6675
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,149
we're making progress at it i don't see
any reasons why we can't

6676
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:40,159
any reasons why we can't
 

6677
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,229
any reasons why we can't
completely i mean completely understand

6678
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:42,239
completely i mean completely understand
 

6679
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,669
completely i mean completely understand
in the sense um

6680
01:41:43,669 --> 01:41:43,679
in the sense um
 

6681
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:44,950
in the sense um
you know we don't really completely

6682
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:44,960
you know we don't really completely
 

6683
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,709
you know we don't really completely
understand what all the molecules in

6684
01:41:46,709 --> 01:41:46,719
understand what all the molecules in
 

6685
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,990
understand what all the molecules in
this water bottle are doing

6686
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
this water bottle are doing
 

6687
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,669
this water bottle are doing
but you know we have laws that sort of

6688
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:49,679
but you know we have laws that sort of
 

6689
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,669
but you know we have laws that sort of
capture it pretty good um

6690
01:41:51,669 --> 01:41:51,679
capture it pretty good um
 

6691
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:53,510
capture it pretty good um
and uh so we'll have that kind of

6692
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
and uh so we'll have that kind of
 

6693
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,870
and uh so we'll have that kind of
understanding i mean it's not like

6694
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:54,880
understanding i mean it's not like
 

6695
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,070
understanding i mean it's not like
you're gonna have to know what every

6696
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:56,080
you're gonna have to know what every
 

6697
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,870
you're gonna have to know what every
neuron in your brain is doing um but

6698
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
neuron in your brain is doing um but
 

6699
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,390
neuron in your brain is doing um but
enough to uh

6700
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
enough to uh
 

6701
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,870
enough to uh
first of all to build it and second of

6702
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:02,880
first of all to build it and second of
 

6703
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,149
first of all to build it and second of
all to do you know

6704
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:04,159
all to do you know
 

6705
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,070
all to do you know
do what physics does which is like have

6706
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,080
do what physics does which is like have
 

6707
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,470
do what physics does which is like have
uh concrete experiments where we can

6708
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:08,480
uh concrete experiments where we can
 

6709
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,189
uh concrete experiments where we can
validate we're we're this is happening

6710
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:11,199
validate we're we're this is happening
 

6711
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:11,990
validate we're we're this is happening
right now like

6712
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:12,000
right now like
 

6713
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,310
right now like
it's not this is not some future thing

6714
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:14,320
it's not this is not some future thing
 

6715
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,030
it's not this is not some future thing
um

6716
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:15,040
um
 

6717
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,470
um
you know i'm very optimistic about

6718
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,480
you know i'm very optimistic about
 

6719
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,310
you know i'm very optimistic about
because i know about art our work and

6720
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
because i know about art our work and
 

6721
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,270
because i know about art our work and
what we're doing

6722
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,280
what we're doing
 

6723
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:24,470
what we're doing
i have to prove it to people um but um

6724
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480

 

6725
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,350

i i consider myself a rational person

6726
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:27,360
i i consider myself a rational person
 

6727
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:27,990
i i consider myself a rational person
and

6728
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,000
and
 

6729
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,709
and
um you know until fairly recently i

6730
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:30,719
um you know until fairly recently i
 

6731
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:31,990
um you know until fairly recently i
wouldn't have said that but right now

6732
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,000
wouldn't have said that but right now
 

6733
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,270
wouldn't have said that but right now
i'm where i'm sitting right now i'm

6734
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
i'm where i'm sitting right now i'm
 

6735
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,870
i'm where i'm sitting right now i'm
saying you know we can this is going to

6736
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:34,880
saying you know we can this is going to
 

6737
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,430
saying you know we can this is going to
happen

6738
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:35,440
happen
 

6739
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,470
happen
there's no big obstacles to it um

6740
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
there's no big obstacles to it um
 

6741
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,750
there's no big obstacles to it um
we finally have a framework for

6742
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
we finally have a framework for
 

6743
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,790
we finally have a framework for
understanding what's going on in the

6744
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:40,800
understanding what's going on in the
 

6745
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,149
understanding what's going on in the
cortex and

6746
01:42:42,149 --> 01:42:42,159
cortex and
 

6747
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:45,430
cortex and
um and that's liberating it's it's like

6748
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:45,440
um and that's liberating it's it's like
 

6749
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,870
um and that's liberating it's it's like
oh it's happening

6750
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:46,880
oh it's happening
 

6751
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,950
oh it's happening
so i i can't see why we wouldn't be able

6752
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:48,960
so i i can't see why we wouldn't be able
 

6753
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,870
so i i can't see why we wouldn't be able
to understand it i just can't

6754
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
to understand it i just can't
 

6755
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,109
to understand it i just can't
okay oh so i mean on that topic let me

6756
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:53,119
okay oh so i mean on that topic let me
 

6757
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,990
okay oh so i mean on that topic let me
ask you to play devil's advocate

6758
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
ask you to play devil's advocate
 

6759
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,350
ask you to play devil's advocate
is it possible for you to imagine

6760
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
is it possible for you to imagine
 

6761
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,310
is it possible for you to imagine
luck look a hundred years from now and

6762
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,320
luck look a hundred years from now and
 

6763
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,390
luck look a hundred years from now and
looking at your book

6764
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,400
looking at your book
 

6765
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:08,229
looking at your book
uh in which ways might your ideas be

6766
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:08,239
uh in which ways might your ideas be
 

6767
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,629
uh in which ways might your ideas be
wrong oh i worry about this all the time

6768
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
wrong oh i worry about this all the time
 

6769
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,350
wrong oh i worry about this all the time
um

6770
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,360

 

6771
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:18,950

yeah it's still useful yeah yeah

6772
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960

 

6773
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,229

i think there's you know um well

6774
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239
i think there's you know um well
 

6775
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,070
i think there's you know um well
i can i can best relate it to like

6776
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,080
i can i can best relate it to like
 

6777
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,310
i can i can best relate it to like
things i'm worried about right now

6778
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,320
things i'm worried about right now
 

6779
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,470
things i'm worried about right now
so we talk about this voting idea right

6780
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
so we talk about this voting idea right
 

6781
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,910
so we talk about this voting idea right
it's happening there's no question

6782
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:29,920
it's happening there's no question
 

6783
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,629
it's happening there's no question
that's happening

6784
01:43:30,629 --> 01:43:30,639
that's happening
 

6785
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,140
that's happening
but it could be far more

6786
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,150
but it could be far more
 

6787
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:34,229
but it could be far more

6788

[Music]
 

6789
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:35,910
[Music]
there's there's enough things i don't

6790
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
there's there's enough things i don't
 

6791
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,709
there's there's enough things i don't
know about it that it might be

6792
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:38,719
know about it that it might be
 

6793
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,149
know about it that it might be
working in ways differently i'm thinking

6794
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:40,159
working in ways differently i'm thinking
 

6795
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,830
working in ways differently i'm thinking
about the kind of what's voting who's

6796
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:41,840
about the kind of what's voting who's
 

6797
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,550
about the kind of what's voting who's
voting

6798
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:42,560
voting
 

6799
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,229
voting
you know where are representations i

6800
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:44,239
you know where are representations i
 

6801
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,669
you know where are representations i
talked about you have a thousand models

6802
01:43:45,669 --> 01:43:45,679
talked about you have a thousand models
 

6803
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:46,709
talked about you have a thousand models
of a coffee cup

6804
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:46,719
of a coffee cup
 

6805
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,790
of a coffee cup
like that that could turn out to be

6806
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
like that that could turn out to be
 

6807
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,830
like that that could turn out to be
wrong

6808
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,840
wrong
 

6809
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,310
wrong
because it may be maybe there are a

6810
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,320
because it may be maybe there are a
 

6811
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:52,870
because it may be maybe there are a
thousand

6812
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
thousand
 

6813
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,390
thousand
models that are sub models but not

6814
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
models that are sub models but not
 

6815
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,149
models that are sub models but not
really a single model the coffee cup

6816
01:43:56,149 --> 01:43:56,159
really a single model the coffee cup
 

6817
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,550
really a single model the coffee cup
um i mean there's things these are all

6818
01:43:58,550 --> 01:43:58,560
um i mean there's things these are all
 

6819
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,470
um i mean there's things these are all
sort of on the edges

6820
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,480
sort of on the edges
 

6821
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,310
sort of on the edges
things that i i present as like oh it's

6822
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,320
things that i i present as like oh it's
 

6823
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,990
things that i i present as like oh it's
so simple and clean well it's not that

6824
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
so simple and clean well it's not that
 

6825
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,990
so simple and clean well it's not that
it's always going to be more complex

6826
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,000
it's always going to be more complex
 

6827
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,189
it's always going to be more complex
and um and there's

6828
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:09,199
and um and there's
 

6829
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,109
and um and there's
parts of the theory which i don't

6830
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:11,119
parts of the theory which i don't
 

6831
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,030
parts of the theory which i don't
understand the complexity well

6832
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040
understand the complexity well
 

6833
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,229
understand the complexity well
so i think i think the idea is brain is

6834
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,239
so i think i think the idea is brain is
 

6835
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:17,669
so i think i think the idea is brain is
a distributed modeling system is

6836
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:17,679
a distributed modeling system is
 

6837
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,590
a distributed modeling system is
not controversial at all right that's

6838
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:19,600
not controversial at all right that's
 

6839
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,109
not controversial at all right that's
not that's well understood by many

6840
01:44:21,109 --> 01:44:21,119
not that's well understood by many
 

6841
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:21,669
not that's well understood by many
people

6842
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:21,679
people
 

6843
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:23,510
people
the question then is are each quarter of

6844
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,520
the question then is are each quarter of
 

6845
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,350
the question then is are each quarter of
a column an independent modeling system

6846
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:25,360
a column an independent modeling system
 

6847
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:29,750
a column an independent modeling system
right um i could be wrong about that

6848
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:29,760
right um i could be wrong about that
 

6849
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,790
right um i could be wrong about that
um i don't think so but i worry about it

6850
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
um i don't think so but i worry about it
 

6851
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,430
um i don't think so but i worry about it
my intuition not even thinking why you

6852
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,440
my intuition not even thinking why you
 

6853
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,470
my intuition not even thinking why you
could be wrong

6854
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
could be wrong
 

6855
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,550
could be wrong
is the same intuition i have about any

6856
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:38,560
is the same intuition i have about any
 

6857
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,470
is the same intuition i have about any
sort of physicist

6858
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,480
sort of physicist
 

6859
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,910
sort of physicist
like strength theory that we as humans

6860
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
like strength theory that we as humans
 

6861
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,470
like strength theory that we as humans
desire for a clean explanation

6862
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:46,480
desire for a clean explanation
 

6863
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,750
desire for a clean explanation
and uh 100 years from now

6864
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:49,760
and uh 100 years from now
 

6865
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,830
and uh 100 years from now
uh intelligent systems might look back

6866
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
uh intelligent systems might look back
 

6867
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,109
uh intelligent systems might look back
at us and

6868
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
at us and
 

6869
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,510
at us and
laugh at how we try to get rid of the

6870
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:55,520
laugh at how we try to get rid of the
 

6871
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,629
laugh at how we try to get rid of the
whole mess

6872
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:56,639
whole mess
 

6873
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,629
whole mess
by having simple explanation when the

6874
01:44:58,629 --> 01:44:58,639
by having simple explanation when the
 

6875
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,229
by having simple explanation when the
reality is it's

6876
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:00,239
reality is it's
 

6877
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,030
reality is it's
it's way messier and in fact it's

6878
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
it's way messier and in fact it's
 

6879
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,950
it's way messier and in fact it's
impossible to understand you can only

6880
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:04,960
impossible to understand you can only
 

6881
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,790
impossible to understand you can only
build it it's like this idea of complex

6882
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:06,800
build it it's like this idea of complex
 

6883
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,750
build it it's like this idea of complex
systems and

6884
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:07,760
systems and
 

6885
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,669
systems and
cellular automata yeah you can only

6886
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
cellular automata yeah you can only
 

6887
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,350
cellular automata yeah you can only
launch the thing you cannot understand

6888
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:11,360
launch the thing you cannot understand
 

6889
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:11,750
launch the thing you cannot understand
it

6890
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:11,760
it
 

6891
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,229
it
yeah i think that you know the history

6892
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:14,239
yeah i think that you know the history
 

6893
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,510
yeah i think that you know the history
of science suggests that's

6894
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:15,520
of science suggests that's
 

6895
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,629
of science suggests that's

01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,149
science suggests that
look as a theorist and we're theorists

6900
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
look as a theorist and we're theorists
 

6901
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,790
look as a theorist and we're theorists
you look for simple explanations right

6902
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:24,800
you look for simple explanations right
 

6903
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,870
you look for simple explanations right
fully knowing that whatever simple

6904
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880
fully knowing that whatever simple
 

6905
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,709
fully knowing that whatever simple
explanation you're going to come up with

6906
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:28,719
explanation you're going to come up with
 

6907
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,709
explanation you're going to come up with
is not going to be completely correct i

6908
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:30,719
is not going to be completely correct i
 

6909
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:31,830
is not going to be completely correct i
mean it can't be

6910
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:31,840
mean it can't be
 

6911
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,109
mean it can't be
i mean it's just it's just more

6912
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:33,119
i mean it's just it's just more
 

6913
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,350
i mean it's just it's just more
complexity but that's the role of

6914
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:35,360
complexity but that's the role of
 

6915
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,350
complexity but that's the role of
theorists play they they sort of they

6916
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:37,360
theorists play they they sort of they
 

6917
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,030
theorists play they they sort of they
give you a framework

6918
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
give you a framework
 

6919
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,870
give you a framework
on which you now can talk about a

6920
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:40,880
on which you now can talk about a
 

6921
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,310
on which you now can talk about a
problem and figure out

6922
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:42,320
problem and figure out
 

6923
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,830
problem and figure out
okay now we can start dig in more

6924
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:43,840
okay now we can start dig in more
 

6925
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,310
okay now we can start dig in more
details the best frameworks stick around

6926
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:46,320
details the best frameworks stick around
 

6927
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,149
details the best frameworks stick around
while the details change

6928
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:48,159
while the details change
 

6929
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:51,669
while the details change
you know again you know the classic

6930
01:45:51,669 --> 01:45:51,679
you know again you know the classic
 

6931
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,430
you know again you know the classic
example is newton and einstein right you

6932
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:53,440
example is newton and einstein right you
 

6933
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,629
example is newton and einstein right you
know

6934
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639
know
 

6935
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,910
know
um newton's theories are still used

6936
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:57,920
um newton's theories are still used
 

6937
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,550
um newton's theories are still used
they're still

6938
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
they're still
 

6939
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,070
they're still
valuable they're still practical they're

6940
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:00,080
valuable they're still practical they're
 

6941
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,070
valuable they're still practical they're
not like wrong it's just they've been

6942
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080
not like wrong it's just they've been
 

6943
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,270
not like wrong it's just they've been
refined yeah but that's

6944
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,280
refined yeah but that's
 

6945
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,830
refined yeah but that's
in physics it's not obvious by the way

6946
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:05,840
in physics it's not obvious by the way
 

6947
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,669
in physics it's not obvious by the way
it's not obvious for physics either

6948
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
it's not obvious for physics either
 

6949
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,590
it's not obvious for physics either
that the universe should be such that

6950
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:09,600
that the universe should be such that
 

6951
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,350
that the universe should be such that
it's amenable to these

6952
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
it's amenable to these
 

6953
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,390
it's amenable to these
simple but so far it appears to be as

6954
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:14,400
simple but so far it appears to be as
 

6955
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,990
simple but so far it appears to be as
far as we can tell

6956
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:16,000
far as we can tell
 

6957
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,350
far as we can tell
um yeah i mean but as far as we could

6958
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:19,360
um yeah i mean but as far as we could
 

6959
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:19,669
um yeah i mean but as far as we could
tell

6960
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:19,679
tell
 

6961
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,350
tell
and but it's also an open question

6962
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,360
and but it's also an open question
 

6963
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,590
and but it's also an open question
whether the brain is amenable to such

6964
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,600
whether the brain is amenable to such
 

6965
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,830
whether the brain is amenable to such
clean theories that's the uh not the

6966
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
clean theories that's the uh not the
 

6967
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,189
clean theories that's the uh not the
brain but intelligence

6968
01:46:27,189 --> 01:46:27,199
brain but intelligence
 

6969
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,109
brain but intelligence
well i i i don't know i would take

6970
01:46:29,109 --> 01:46:29,119
well i i i don't know i would take
 

6971
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:31,350
well i i i don't know i would take
intelligence out of it just say you know

6972
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:31,360
intelligence out of it just say you know
 

6973
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:35,109
intelligence out of it just say you know
um well okay

6974
01:46:35,109 --> 01:46:35,119
um well okay
 

6975
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:37,270
um well okay
um the evidence we have suggests that

6976
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,280
um the evidence we have suggests that
 

6977
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,830
um the evidence we have suggests that
the human brain

6978
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:38,840
the human brain
 

6979
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,830
the human brain
is a at the one time extremely messy and

6980
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:41,840
is a at the one time extremely messy and
 

6981
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,669
is a at the one time extremely messy and
complex but there's some parts that are

6982
01:46:43,669 --> 01:46:43,679
complex but there's some parts that are
 

6983
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,430
complex but there's some parts that are
very regular and structured

6984
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:45,440
very regular and structured
 

6985
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,109
very regular and structured
that's why we started the neocortex it's

6986
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
that's why we started the neocortex it's
 

6987
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:49,669
that's why we started the neocortex it's
extremely regular in its structure

6988
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
extremely regular in its structure
 

6989
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,910
extremely regular in its structure
yeah and unbelievably so and then i

6990
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:51,920
yeah and unbelievably so and then i
 

6991
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,510
yeah and unbelievably so and then i
mentioned earlier the other thing is

6992
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,520
mentioned earlier the other thing is
 

6993
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,870
mentioned earlier the other thing is
it's it's universal abilities it is so

6994
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:56,880
it's it's universal abilities it is so
 

6995
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,750
it's it's universal abilities it is so
flexible to learn so many things we

6996
01:46:59,750 --> 01:46:59,760
flexible to learn so many things we
 

6997
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,229
flexible to learn so many things we
don't

6998
01:47:00,229 --> 01:47:00,239
don't
 

6999
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:01,350
don't
we haven't figured out what it can't

7000
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,360
we haven't figured out what it can't
 

7001
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,790
we haven't figured out what it can't
learn yet we don't know but we haven't

7002
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:02,800
learn yet we don't know but we haven't
 

7003
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,229
learn yet we don't know but we haven't
figured out yet but to learn things that

7004
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:04,239
figured out yet but to learn things that
 

7005
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:05,990
figured out yet but to learn things that
it never was evolved to learn

7006
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
it never was evolved to learn
 

7007
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,109
it never was evolved to learn
so those give us hope um that's why i

7008
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:09,119
so those give us hope um that's why i
 

7009
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,550
so those give us hope um that's why i
went into this field because i said you

7010
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:10,560
went into this field because i said you
 

7011
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,430
went into this field because i said you
know

7012
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:11,440
know
 

7013
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,550
know
this regular structure it's doing this

7014
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:14,560
this regular structure it's doing this
 

7015
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,990
this regular structure it's doing this
amazing number of things there's got to

7016
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:16,000
amazing number of things there's got to
 

7017
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,590
amazing number of things there's got to
be some underlying principles that are

7018
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:17,600
be some underlying principles that are
 

7019
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,910
be some underlying principles that are
that are common and other other

7020
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
that are common and other other
 

7021
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,030
that are common and other other
scientists have come up with the same

7022
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,040
scientists have come up with the same
 

7023
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,229
scientists have come up with the same
conclusions

7024
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:22,239
conclusions
 

7025
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:25,270
conclusions
um and so it's promising it's promising

7026
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
um and so it's promising it's promising
 

7027
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,990
um and so it's promising it's promising
and um and that's and whether the

7028
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:28,000
and um and that's and whether the
 

7029
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,709
and um and that's and whether the
theories

7030
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:28,719
theories
 

7031
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,830
theories
play out exactly this way or not that is

7032
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:31,840
play out exactly this way or not that is
 

7033
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,910
play out exactly this way or not that is
the role that theorists play

7034
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:33,920
the role that theorists play
 

7035
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,830
the role that theorists play
and so far it's worked out well even

7036
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
and so far it's worked out well even
 

7037
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,270
and so far it's worked out well even
though you know maybe

7038
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
though you know maybe
 

7039
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,629
though you know maybe
you know we don't understand all the

7040
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:38,639
you know we don't understand all the
 

7041
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,629
you know we don't understand all the
laws of physics but so far it's been

7042
01:47:40,629 --> 01:47:40,639
laws of physics but so far it's been
 

7043
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:42,550
laws of physics but so far it's been
pretty damn useful the ones we have

7044
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:42,560
pretty damn useful the ones we have
 

7045
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,510
pretty damn useful the ones we have
are our theories are pretty bit useful

7046
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520
are our theories are pretty bit useful
 

7047
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,310
are our theories are pretty bit useful
you mentioned

7048
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
you mentioned
 

7049
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,910
you mentioned
that uh we should not necessarily be at

7050
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:49,920
that uh we should not necessarily be at
 

7051
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,590
that uh we should not necessarily be at
least to the degree that we are

7052
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,600
least to the degree that we are
 

7053
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,350
least to the degree that we are
worried about the existential risks of

7054
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,360

one is how it's difficult for us to

one is how it's difficult for us to
 

7081
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:27,990
one is how it's difficult for us to
separate our rational

evolutionary heritage which is
 

7087
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,790
evolutionary heritage which is
you know not always pretty you know

is a good strategy for reproduction it's
 

7103
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,910
is a good strategy for reproduction it's
just and it's just and

just and it's just and
 

7105
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,550
just and it's just and
and so now that we know that and yet we

7106
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:52,560
and so now that we know that and yet we
 

7107
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,830
and so now that we know that and yet we
have this sort of you know we and i can

7108
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:53,840
have this sort of you know we and i can
 

7109
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,030
have this sort of you know we and i can
have this very rational discussion

7110
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:55,040
have this very rational discussion
 

7111
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,990
have this very rational discussion
talking about you know

7112
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:56,000
talking about you know
 

7113
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,510
talking about you know
intelligence and brains and life and so

7114
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:57,520
intelligence and brains and life and so
 

7115
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,350
intelligence and brains and life and so
on so

7116
01:48:59,350 --> 01:48:59,360
on so
 

7117
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,350
on so
it seems like it's so hard it's just a

7118
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
it seems like it's so hard it's just a
 

7119
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,790
it seems like it's so hard it's just a
big transition to get

7120
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:02,800
big transition to get
 

7121
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,510
big transition to get
humans all humans to to to make the

humans all humans to to to make the
 

7123
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,950
humans all humans to to to make the
transition from be like let's

7124
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
transition from be like let's
 

7125
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,590
transition from be like let's
pay no attention to all that ugly stuff

7126
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:09,600
pay no attention to all that ugly stuff
 

7127
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,470
pay no attention to all that ugly stuff
over here

01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:10,480
over here
 

7129
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,709
over here
let's just focus on the instances what's

7130
01:49:12,709 --> 01:49:12,719
let's just focus on the instances what's
 

7131
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,390
let's just focus on the instances what's
unique about humanity is our knowledge

7132
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
unique about humanity is our knowledge
 

7133
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,189
unique about humanity is our knowledge
and our

7134
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:15,199
and our
 

7135
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:17,109
and our
intellect but the fact that we're

7136
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,119
intellect but the fact that we're
 

7137
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,669
intellect but the fact that we're
striving is in itself amazing right

7138
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
striving is in itself amazing right
 

7139
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:21,750
striving is in itself amazing right
the fact that we're able to overcome

7140
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:21,760
the fact that we're able to overcome
 

7141
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,790
the fact that we're able to overcome
that part and

7142
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:22,800
that part and
 

7143
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,390
that part and
it seems like we are more and more

7144
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:26,400
it seems like we are more and more
 

7145
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,310
it seems like we are more and more
becoming successful and overcoming that

7146
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
becoming successful and overcoming that
 

7147
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,830
becoming successful and overcoming that
that is the optimistic view and i agree

7148
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:29,840
that is the optimistic view and i agree
 

7149
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,229
that is the optimistic view and i agree
with you

7150
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239
with you
 

7151
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:33,109
with you

7153
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,310
yeah but i worry about it i'm not saying
i'm worrying about i think maybe that

7154
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
i'm worrying about i think maybe that
 

7155
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,669
i'm worrying about i think maybe that
was your question i still worry about it

7156
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:35,679
was your question i still worry about it
 

7157
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:36,229
was your question i still worry about it
yes

7158
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
yes
 

7159
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,070
yes
um you know we could be end tomorrow

7160
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
um you know we could be end tomorrow
 

7161
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,430
um you know we could be end tomorrow
because some terrorists could get

7162
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,440
because some terrorists could get
 

7163
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,350
because some terrorists could get
nuclear bombs and you know blow us all

7164
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
nuclear bombs and you know blow us all
 

7165
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:41,990
nuclear bombs and you know blow us all
up who knows

7166
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
up who knows
 

7167
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,990
up who knows
right the other thing i think i'm

7168
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
right the other thing i think i'm
 

7169
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,030
right the other thing i think i'm
disappointed is

7170
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,040
disappointed is
 

7171
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,189
disappointed is
uh and it's just i understand it it's i

7172
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:47,199
uh and it's just i understand it it's i
 

7173
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:48,390
uh and it's just i understand it it's i
guess you can't really be disappointed

7174
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,400
guess you can't really be disappointed
 

7175
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,669
guess you can't really be disappointed
it's just a fact

7176
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
it's just a fact
 

7177
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,310
it's just a fact
is that we're so prone to false beliefs

7178
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:52,320
is that we're so prone to false beliefs
 

7179
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,070
is that we're so prone to false beliefs
that we you know we have a model in our

7180
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,080
that we you know we have a model in our
 

7181
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,350
that we you know we have a model in our
head

7182
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
head
 

7183
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,830
head
the things we can interact with directly

7184
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:57,840
the things we can interact with directly
 

7185
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,270
the things we can interact with directly
physical objects

7186
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
physical objects
 

7187
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,669
physical objects
people that model is pretty good and we

7188
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:01,679
people that model is pretty good and we
 

7189
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,270
people that model is pretty good and we
can test it all the time

7190
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:03,280
can test it all the time
 

7191
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,790
can test it all the time
right i touch something i look at it i

7192
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:04,800
right i touch something i look at it i
 

7193
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,709
right i touch something i look at it i
talk to you see my model's correct

7194
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:06,719
talk to you see my model's correct
 

7195
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,709
talk to you see my model's correct
but so much of what we know is stuff i

7196
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:08,719
but so much of what we know is stuff i
 

7197
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:09,830
but so much of what we know is stuff i
can't directly

7198
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
can't directly
 

7199
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,109
can't directly
interact with i can't i don't know

7200
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:11,119
interact with i can't i don't know
 

7201
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,790
interact with i can't i don't know
because someone told me about it yeah

7202
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
because someone told me about it yeah
 

7203
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,589
because someone told me about it yeah
and so

7204
01:50:13,589 --> 01:50:13,599
and so
 

7205
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,790
and so
so we're prone inherently prone to

7206
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
so we're prone inherently prone to
 

7207
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:17,510
so we're prone inherently prone to
having

7208
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:17,520
having
 

7209
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,189
having
false beliefs because if i'm told

7210
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:19,199
false beliefs because if i'm told
 

7211
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:20,310
false beliefs because if i'm told
something how am i going to know it's

7212
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:20,320
something how am i going to know it's
 

7213
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,910
something how am i going to know it's
right or wrong right

7214
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
right or wrong right
 

7215
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,589
right or wrong right
and so then we have the scientific

7216
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
and so then we have the scientific
 

7217
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:25,030
and so then we have the scientific
process which says

7218
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:25,040
process which says
 

7219
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,669
process which says
we are inherently flawed so the only way

7220
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:27,679
we are inherently flawed so the only way
 

7221
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:28,870
we are inherently flawed so the only way
we can

7222
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:28,880
we can
 

7223
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,950
we can
get closer to the truth is by looking

7224
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
get closer to the truth is by looking
 

7225
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,790
get closer to the truth is by looking
for

7226
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:32,800
for
 

7227
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,629
for
um contrary evidence yeah um like this

7228
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
um contrary evidence yeah um like this
 

7229
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,750
um contrary evidence yeah um like this
uh conspiracy theory this this theory

7230
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:39,760
uh conspiracy theory this this theory
 

7231
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,270
uh conspiracy theory this this theory
that scientists keep telling me about

7232
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
that scientists keep telling me about
 

7233
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,950
that scientists keep telling me about
that the earth is round

7234
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
that the earth is round
 

7235
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,910
that the earth is round
uh as far as i can tell when i look out

7236
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:45,920
uh as far as i can tell when i look out
 

7237
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,030
uh as far as i can tell when i look out
it looks pretty flat

7238
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,040
it looks pretty flat
 

7239
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,589
it looks pretty flat
yeah so yeah there is there's a tension

7240
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:49,599
yeah so yeah there is there's a tension
 

7241
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,790
yeah so yeah there is there's a tension
but it's also um

7242
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
but it's also um
 

7243
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,109
but it's also um
um i tend to believe that we haven't

7244
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:55,119
um i tend to believe that we haven't
 

7245
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,709
um i tend to believe that we haven't
figured out most of this thing

7246
01:50:56,709 --> 01:50:56,719
figured out most of this thing
 

7247
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:00,390
figured out most of this thing
right most of nature around us is a

7248
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
right most of nature around us is a
 

7249
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,270
right most of nature around us is a
mystery

7250
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,280
mystery
 

7251
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,030
mystery
and so it um but that doesn't work does

7252
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:03,040
and so it um but that doesn't work does
 

7253
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,030
and so it um but that doesn't work does
that worry you i mean it's like oh

7254
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:05,040
that worry you i mean it's like oh
 

7255
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,310
that worry you i mean it's like oh
that's that's like a pleasure more to

7256
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
that's that's like a pleasure more to
 

7257
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:06,950
that's that's like a pleasure more to
figure out

7258
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:06,960
figure out
 

7259
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,270
figure out
right yeah that's exciting but i'm

7260
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
right yeah that's exciting but i'm
 

7261
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,109
right yeah that's exciting but i'm
saying like there's going to be a lot of

7262
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:11,119
saying like there's going to be a lot of
 

7263
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,070
saying like there's going to be a lot of
quote unquote wrong ideas i mean i've

7264
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
quote unquote wrong ideas i mean i've
 

7265
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:14,950
quote unquote wrong ideas i mean i've
been

7266
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:14,960
been
 

7267
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,589
been
thinking a lot about engineering systems

7268
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:17,599
thinking a lot about engineering systems
 

7269
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,270
thinking a lot about engineering systems
like social networks and so on

7270
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
like social networks and so on
 

7271
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,830
like social networks and so on
and i've been worried about censorship

7272
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:21,840
and i've been worried about censorship
 

7273
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,950
and i've been worried about censorship
and thinking through all that kind of

7274
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:22,960
and thinking through all that kind of
 

7275
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,709
and thinking through all that kind of
stuff because there's a lot of wrong

7276
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719
stuff because there's a lot of wrong
 

7277
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,830
stuff because there's a lot of wrong
ideas there's a lot of dangerous ideas

7278
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:27,840
ideas there's a lot of dangerous ideas
 

7279
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,950
ideas there's a lot of dangerous ideas
but then i also read a history

7280
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
but then i also read a history
 

7281
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,350
but then i also read a history
read history and see when you censor

7282
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
read history and see when you censor
 

7283
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,950
read history and see when you censor
ideas that are wrong

7284
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
ideas that are wrong
 

7285
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,350
ideas that are wrong
now this could be a small-scale

7286
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,360
now this could be a small-scale
 

7287
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,229
now this could be a small-scale
censorship

7288
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:38,239
censorship
 

7289
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,709
censorship
like a young grad student who comes up

7290
01:51:40,709 --> 01:51:40,719
like a young grad student who comes up
 

7291
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:42,550
like a young grad student who comes up
who like raises their hand and says some

7292
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:42,560
who like raises their hand and says some
 

7293
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,750
who like raises their hand and says some
crazy idea

7294
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:43,760
crazy idea
 

7295
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,550
crazy idea
yes a form of censorship could be i

7296
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
yes a form of censorship could be i
 

7297
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,070
yes a form of censorship could be i
shouldn't use the word censorship but

7298
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
shouldn't use the word censorship but
 

7299
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,990
shouldn't use the word censorship but
i think you may uh just like like

7300
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:50,000
i think you may uh just like like
 

7301
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,229
i think you may uh just like like
de-incentivize them from no no no this

7302
01:51:52,229 --> 01:51:52,239
de-incentivize them from no no no this
 

7303
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,109
de-incentivize them from no no no this
is the way it's been

7304
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
is the way it's been
 

7305
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:54,629
is the way it's been
yeah yeah you're you're a foolish kid

7306
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:54,639
yeah yeah you're you're a foolish kid
 

7307
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,390
yeah yeah you're you're a foolish kid
don't do it yeah yeah yeah foolish uh

7308
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
don't do it yeah yeah yeah foolish uh
 

7309
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,750
don't do it yeah yeah yeah foolish uh
so in some sense uh

7310
01:51:59,750 --> 01:51:59,760
so in some sense uh
 

7311
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,790
so in some sense uh
those wrong ideas most of the time end

7312
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:02,800
those wrong ideas most of the time end
 

7313
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,830
those wrong ideas most of the time end
up being

7314
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:03,840
up being
 

7315
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,709
up being
wrong but sometimes i agree with you so

wrong but sometimes i agree with you so
 

7317
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,229
wrong but sometimes i agree with you so
i don't like the word censorship

7318
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
i don't like the word censorship
 

7319
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:12,229
i don't like the word censorship
um at the very end of the book i i

7320
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239
um at the very end of the book i i
 

7321
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,430
um at the very end of the book i i
ended up with a sort of a a plea or a

7322
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:15,440
ended up with a sort of a a plea or a
 

7323
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,470
ended up with a sort of a a plea or a
recommended course of action and

7324
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:18,480
recommended course of action and
 

7325
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,430
recommended course of action and
the best way i could i know how to deal

7326
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:21,440
the best way i could i know how to deal
 

7327
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,430
the best way i could i know how to deal
with this issue that you bring up

7328
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:23,440
with this issue that you bring up
 

7329
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,229
with this issue that you bring up
is if everybody understood as part of

7330
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:26,239
is if everybody understood as part of
 

7331
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:26,629
is if everybody understood as part of
your

7332
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
your
 

7333
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,870
your
upbringing in life something about how

7334
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:28,880
upbringing in life something about how
 

7335
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,669
upbringing in life something about how
your brain works

7336
01:52:29,669 --> 01:52:29,679
your brain works
 

7337
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:32,709
your brain works
that it builds a model of the world uh

7338
01:52:32,709 --> 01:52:32,719
that it builds a model of the world uh
 

7339
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:33,910
that it builds a model of the world uh
how it works you know how basically

7340
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:33,920
how it works you know how basically
 

7341
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,669
how it works you know how basically
builds that model the world and that the

7342
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
builds that model the world and that the
 

7343
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:36,470
builds that model the world and that the
model

7344
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:36,480
model
 

7345
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,870
model
is not the real world it's just a model

7346
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:38,880
is not the real world it's just a model
 

7347
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,310
is not the real world it's just a model
and it's never going to reflect the

7348
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
and it's never going to reflect the
 

7349
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,070
and it's never going to reflect the
entire world and it can be wrong and

7350
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
entire world and it can be wrong and
 

7351
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,550
entire world and it can be wrong and
it's

7352
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:42,560
it's
 

7353
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,550
it's
easy to be wrong and here's all the ways

7354
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:44,560
easy to be wrong and here's all the ways
 

7355
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,310
easy to be wrong and here's all the ways
you can get the wrong model in your head

7356
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
you can get the wrong model in your head
 

7357
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,589
you can get the wrong model in your head
right it's not prescribed what's right

7358
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
right it's not prescribed what's right
 

7359
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:50,149
right it's not prescribed what's right
or wrong

7360
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:50,159
or wrong
 

7361
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:52,550
or wrong
just understand that process if we all

7362
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
just understand that process if we all
 

7363
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,589
just understand that process if we all
understood the process

7364
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:53,599
understood the process
 

7365
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,030
understood the process
then i got together and you say i

7366
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,040
then i got together and you say i
 

7367
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,550
then i got together and you say i
disagree with you jeff and i said lex i

7368
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
disagree with you jeff and i said lex i
 

7369
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,990
disagree with you jeff and i said lex i
disagree with you that

7370
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,000
disagree with you that
 

7371
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,470
disagree with you that
at least we understand that we're both

7372
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
at least we understand that we're both
 

7373
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,070
at least we understand that we're both
trying to model something

7374
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:02,080
trying to model something
 

7375
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,669
trying to model something
we both have different information which

7376
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
we both have different information which
 

7377
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,109
we both have different information which
leads to our different models

7378
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
leads to our different models
 

7379
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,070
leads to our different models
and therefore i shouldn't hold it

7380
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:06,080
and therefore i shouldn't hold it
 

7381
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:07,189
and therefore i shouldn't hold it
against you and you shouldn't hold it

7382
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
against you and you shouldn't hold it
 

7383
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:08,149
against you and you shouldn't hold it
against me

7384
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,159
against me
 

7385
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,149
against me
and we can at least agree that well what

7386
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159
and we can at least agree that well what
 

7387
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,589
and we can at least agree that well what
can we look for in in

7388
01:53:11,589 --> 01:53:11,599
can we look for in in
 

7389
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:13,270
can we look for in in
its common ground to test our our

7390
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,280
its common ground to test our our
 

7391
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,510
its common ground to test our our
beliefs as opposed to so much

7392
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520
beliefs as opposed to so much
 

7393
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,629
beliefs as opposed to so much
uh as our we raise our kids on dogma

7394
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
uh as our we raise our kids on dogma
 

7395
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,550
uh as our we raise our kids on dogma
which is this is a fact and this is a

7396
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:20,560
which is this is a fact and this is a
 

7397
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,310
which is this is a fact and this is a
fact and these people are bad

7398
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:22,320
fact and these people are bad
 

7399
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,910
fact and these people are bad
and and you know where ever if everyone

7400
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:25,920
and and you know where ever if everyone
 

7401
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,709
and and you know where ever if everyone
knew just

7402
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
knew just
 

7403
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:30,550
knew just
to to be skeptical of every belief

7404
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:30,560
to to be skeptical of every belief
 

7405
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,390
to to be skeptical of every belief
and why and how their brains do that i

7406
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:32,400
and why and how their brains do that i
 

7407
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,950
and why and how their brains do that i
think we might have a better world

7408
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:34,960
think we might have a better world
 

7409
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,990
think we might have a better world
do you think the human mind is able to

7410
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,000
do you think the human mind is able to
 

7411
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,030
do you think the human mind is able to
comprehend

7412
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
comprehend
 

7413
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,870
comprehend
reality so you talk about sort of this

7414
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
reality so you talk about sort of this
 

7415
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,550
reality so you talk about sort of this
creating models that are better and

7416
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:44,560
creating models that are better and
 

7417
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,109
creating models that are better and
better how close do you think we get to

7418
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:47,119
better how close do you think we get to
 

7419
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,310
better how close do you think we get to
uh to reality there's so the wildest

7420
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
uh to reality there's so the wildest
 

7421
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,070
uh to reality there's so the wildest
ideas is like donald hoffman saying

7422
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:52,080
ideas is like donald hoffman saying
 

7423
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:54,310
ideas is like donald hoffman saying
we're very far away from reality

7424
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:54,320
we're very far away from reality
 

7425
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,910
we're very far away from reality
uh do you think we're getting close to

7426
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:55,920
uh do you think we're getting close to
 

7427
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,229
uh do you think we're getting close to
reality well i guess it depends on what

7428
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239
reality well i guess it depends on what
 

7429
01:53:58,239 --> 01:53:59,910
reality well i guess it depends on what
you define reality

7430
01:53:59,910 --> 01:53:59,920
you define reality
 

7431
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,669
you define reality
uh we are getting we have a model of the

7432
01:54:01,669 --> 01:54:01,679
uh we are getting we have a model of the
 

7433
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:03,990
uh we are getting we have a model of the
world that's very useful

7434
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,000
world that's very useful
 

7435
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,030
world that's very useful
right for basic well for our survival

7436
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
right for basic well for our survival
 

7437
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:07,430
right for basic well for our survival
and

7438
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:07,440
and
 

7439
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,790
and
our the pleasure whatever right

7440
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
our the pleasure whatever right
 

7441
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,669
our the pleasure whatever right
um so that's useful um i mean it's

7442
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
um so that's useful um i mean it's
 

7443
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,109
um so that's useful um i mean it's
really useful oh we can build planes we

7444
01:54:15,109 --> 01:54:15,119
really useful oh we can build planes we
 

7445
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:16,149
really useful oh we can build planes we
can build computers we can do these

7446
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
can build computers we can do these
 

7447
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,270
can build computers we can do these
things right

7448
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
things right
 

7449
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,470
things right
uh i don't think i i don't know the

7450
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:20,480
uh i don't think i i don't know the
 

7451
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,030
uh i don't think i i don't know the
answer to that question um

7452
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
answer to that question um
 

7453
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,390
answer to that question um
i think that's part of the question

7454
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:24,400
i think that's part of the question
 

7455
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,310
i think that's part of the question
we're trying to figure out right like

7456
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
we're trying to figure out right like
 

7457
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,589
we're trying to figure out right like
you know obviously if you end up with a

7458
01:54:27,589 --> 01:54:27,599
you know obviously if you end up with a
 

7459
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:29,910
you know obviously if you end up with a
theory of everything that

7460
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:29,920
theory of everything that
 

7461
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,589
theory of everything that
really is a theory of everything and all

7462
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
really is a theory of everything and all
 

7463
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:32,950
really is a theory of everything and all
of a sudden everything comes into play

7464
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
of a sudden everything comes into play
 

7465
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,870
of a sudden everything comes into play
and there's no room for something else

7466
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
and there's no room for something else
 

7467
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,070
and there's no room for something else
then you might feel like we have a good

7468
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080
then you might feel like we have a good
 

7469
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,910
then you might feel like we have a good
model of the world yeah but we if we

7470
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920
model of the world yeah but we if we
 

7471
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,830
model of the world yeah but we if we
have a theory of everything and somehow

7472
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:39,840
have a theory of everything and somehow
 

7473
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,430
have a theory of everything and somehow
first of all you'll never be able to

7474
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:41,440
first of all you'll never be able to
 

7475
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,030
first of all you'll never be able to
really conclusively say it's a theory of

7476
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,040
really conclusively say it's a theory of
 

7477
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,470
really conclusively say it's a theory of
everything but say somehow

7478
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:44,480
everything but say somehow
 

7479
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,629
everything but say somehow
we are very damn sure it's the theory of

7480
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:46,639
we are very damn sure it's the theory of
 

7481
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,229
we are very damn sure it's the theory of
everything we understand

7482
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
everything we understand
 

7483
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:50,470
everything we understand
what happened at the big bang and how

7484
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,480
what happened at the big bang and how
 

7485
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,070
what happened at the big bang and how
just the entirety of the physical

7486
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:52,080
just the entirety of the physical
 

7487
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,750
just the entirety of the physical
process i'm still not sure that

7488
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:53,760
process i'm still not sure that
 

7489
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,229
process i'm still not sure that
gives us an understanding of uh the next

7490
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
gives us an understanding of uh the next
 

7491
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:01,350
gives us an understanding of uh the next
many layers of the hierarchy yeah

7492
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
many layers of the hierarchy yeah
 

7493
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,030
many layers of the hierarchy yeah
abstractions that form well also what if

7494
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:03,040
abstractions that form well also what if
 

7495
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,950
abstractions that form well also what if
string theory turns out to be true

7496
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
string theory turns out to be true
 

7497
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,149
string theory turns out to be true
and then you say well we have no reality

7498
01:55:08,149 --> 01:55:08,159
and then you say well we have no reality
 

7499
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:09,510
and then you say well we have no reality
no modeling what's going on in those

7500
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:09,520
no modeling what's going on in those
 

7501
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,030
no modeling what's going on in those
other dimensions that are wrapped into

7502
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,040
other dimensions that are wrapped into
 

7503
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:11,910
other dimensions that are wrapped into
it on each other

7504
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:11,920
it on each other
 

7505
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,030
it on each other
you're right or or the multiverse you

7506
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
you're right or or the multiverse you
 

7507
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:15,430
you're right or or the multiverse you
know

7508
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:15,440
know
 

7509
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,709
know
i i honestly don't know how for us

7510
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:18,719
i i honestly don't know how for us
 

7511
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:20,390
i i honestly don't know how for us
for human interaction for ideas of

7512
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:20,400
for human interaction for ideas of
 

7513
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,470
for human interaction for ideas of
intelligence how it helps us to

7514
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:22,480
intelligence how it helps us to
 

7515
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,310
intelligence how it helps us to
understand that we're made up of

7516
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:24,320
understand that we're made up of
 

7517
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,790
understand that we're made up of
vibrating strings that are

7518
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:26,800
vibrating strings that are
 

7519
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,950
vibrating strings that are
like tend to the whatever times smaller

7520
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:28,960
like tend to the whatever times smaller
 

7521
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:29,830
like tend to the whatever times smaller
than us

7522
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
than us
 

7523
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,470
than us
yeah i don't you know you could probably

7524
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
yeah i don't you know you could probably
 

7525
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,229
yeah i don't you know you could probably
build better weapons and better rockets

7526
01:55:34,229 --> 01:55:34,239
build better weapons and better rockets
 

7527
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:35,750
build better weapons and better rockets
but you're not going to be able to

7528
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:35,760
but you're not going to be able to
 

7529
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,589
but you're not going to be able to
understand intelligence i guess i guess

7530
01:55:37,589 --> 01:55:37,599
understand intelligence i guess i guess
 

7531
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,189
understand intelligence i guess i guess
maybe better computers no you won't be

7532
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:39,199
maybe better computers no you won't be
 

7533
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:39,430
maybe better computers no you won't be
able

7534
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:39,440
able
 

7535
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,669
able
i think it's just more purely knowledge

7536
01:55:41,669 --> 01:55:41,679
i think it's just more purely knowledge
 

7537
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:42,950
i think it's just more purely knowledge
you might lead to a better

7538
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
you might lead to a better
 

7539
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,790
you might lead to a better
understanding of the of the beginning of

7540
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:44,800
understanding of the of the beginning of
 

7541
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,229
understanding of the of the beginning of
the universe

7542
01:55:46,229 --> 01:55:46,239
the universe
 

7543
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:47,510
the universe
right it might lead to a better

7544
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:47,520
right it might lead to a better
 

7545
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,990
right it might lead to a better
understanding of uh

7546
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
understanding of uh
 

7547
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,070
understanding of uh
i don't know i guess i think the

7548
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,080
i don't know i guess i think the
 

7549
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,750
i don't know i guess i think the
acquisition of knowledge has always been

7550
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
acquisition of knowledge has always been
 

7551
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,030
acquisition of knowledge has always been
one where

7552
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,040
one where
 

7553
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,189
one where
you you pursue it for its own pleasure

7554
01:55:59,189 --> 01:55:59,199
you you pursue it for its own pleasure
 

7555
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:02,390
you you pursue it for its own pleasure
um and you don't always know what is

7556
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
um and you don't always know what is
 

7557
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,270
um and you don't always know what is
going to make a difference

7558
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:03,280
going to make a difference
 

7559
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,390
going to make a difference
yeah you're pleasantly surprised by the

7560
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:06,400
yeah you're pleasantly surprised by the
 

7561
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,669
yeah you're pleasantly surprised by the
the weird things you find

7562
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:07,679
the weird things you find
 

7563
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,149
the weird things you find
do you think uh for the for the

7564
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:10,159
do you think uh for the for the
 

7565
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,750
do you think uh for the for the
neocortex in general

7566
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:11,760
neocortex in general
 

7567
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,189
neocortex in general
do you think there's a lot of innovation

7568
01:56:13,189 --> 01:56:13,199
do you think there's a lot of innovation
 

7569
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,109
do you think there's a lot of innovation
to be done on the machine

7570
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:15,119
to be done on the machine
 

7571
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:18,149
to be done on the machine
side you know you use the computer as a

7572
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:18,159
side you know you use the computer as a
 

7573
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:18,790
side you know you use the computer as a
metaphor

7574
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
metaphor
 

7575
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,709
metaphor
quite a bit is there a different types

7576
01:56:20,709 --> 01:56:20,719
quite a bit is there a different types
 

7577
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,470
quite a bit is there a different types
of computer that would help us build i

7578
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:22,480
of computer that would help us build i
 

7579
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,589
of computer that would help us build i
mean what are the intelligences like the

7580
01:56:23,589 --> 01:56:23,599
mean what are the intelligences like the
 

7581
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:25,270
mean what are the intelligences like the
manifestations of intelligent machines

7582
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:25,280
manifestations of intelligent machines
 

7583
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,270
manifestations of intelligent machines
yeah or is it oh no it's going to be

7584
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,280
yeah or is it oh no it's going to be
 

7585
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,310
yeah or is it oh no it's going to be
totally

7586
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,320
totally
 

7587
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,109
totally
crazy uh we have no idea how this is

7588
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:31,119
crazy uh we have no idea how this is
 

7589
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:32,470
crazy uh we have no idea how this is
going to look out yet

7590
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:32,480
going to look out yet
 

7591
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:35,430
going to look out yet
but you can already see this today we of

7592
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
but you can already see this today we of
 

7593
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,350
but you can already see this today we of
course remodel these things on

7594
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
course remodel these things on
 

7595
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:40,310
course remodel these things on
traditional computers and now now gpus

7596
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:40,320
traditional computers and now now gpus
 

7597
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,510
traditional computers and now now gpus
are really popular with

7598
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:41,520
are really popular with
 

7599
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,470
are really popular with
with you know neural networks and so on

7600
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:44,480
with you know neural networks and so on
 

7601
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:44,950
with you know neural networks and so on
um

7602
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
um
 

7603
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,390
um
but there are companies coming up with

7604
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:46,400
but there are companies coming up with
 

7605
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,390
but there are companies coming up with
fundamentally new physical substrates

7606
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:50,400
fundamentally new physical substrates
 

7607
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,990
fundamentally new physical substrates
that are just really cool i don't know

7608
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000
that are just really cool i don't know
 

7609
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,229
that are just really cool i don't know
if they're going to work or not

7610
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
if they're going to work or not
 

7611
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,629
if they're going to work or not
but i think there'll be decades of

7612
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
but i think there'll be decades of
 

7613
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:57,430
but i think there'll be decades of
innovation here

7614
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:57,440
innovation here
 

7615
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,589
innovation here
yeah totally do you think the final

7616
01:56:59,589 --> 01:56:59,599
yeah totally do you think the final
 

7617
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:00,709
yeah totally do you think the final
thing will

7618
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
thing will
 

7619
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,589
thing will
be messy like our biology is messy or do

7620
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
be messy like our biology is messy or do
 

7621
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:04,070
be messy like our biology is messy or do
you think

7622
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:04,080
you think
 

7623
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,950
you think
um it's it's the it's the old bird

7624
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:06,960
um it's it's the it's the old bird
 

7625
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,550
um it's it's the it's the old bird
versus airplane question

7626
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,560
versus airplane question
 

7627
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,070
versus airplane question
or do you think we could just uh

7628
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
or do you think we could just uh
 

7629
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,270
or do you think we could just uh
build airplanes yeah that

7630
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
build airplanes yeah that
 

7631
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,030
build airplanes yeah that
that fly way better than birds in the

7632
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:17,040
that fly way better than birds in the
 

7633
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,550
that fly way better than birds in the
same way we can build

7634
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:18,560
same way we can build
 

7635
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:21,669
same way we can build
uh uh electrical and

7636
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:21,679
uh uh electrical and
 

7637
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:24,390
uh uh electrical and
yeah yeah you know can i can i can i

7638
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:24,400
yeah yeah you know can i can i can i
 

7639
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,669
yeah yeah you know can i can i can i
refund the bird thing a bit because i

7640
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:25,679
refund the bird thing a bit because i
 

7641
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,030
refund the bird thing a bit because i
think it's interesting

7642
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
think it's interesting
 

7643
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,030
think it's interesting
people ability misunderstand this the

7644
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:29,040
people ability misunderstand this the
 

7645
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,470
people ability misunderstand this the
wright brothers

7646
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
wright brothers
 

7647
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,589
wright brothers
um the problem they were trying to solve

7648
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
um the problem they were trying to solve
 

7649
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:34,790
um the problem they were trying to solve
was controlled flight

7650
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
was controlled flight
 

7651
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,109
was controlled flight
how to turn an airplane not how to

7652
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
how to turn an airplane not how to
 

7653
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,390
how to turn an airplane not how to
propel an airplane

7654
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
propel an airplane
 

7655
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,189
propel an airplane
they weren't worried about that

7656
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:39,199
they weren't worried about that
 

7657
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,790
they weren't worried about that
interesting yeah they already had at

7658
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:40,800
interesting yeah they already had at
 

7659
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,589
interesting yeah they already had at
that time

7660
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
that time
 

7661
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,270
that time
there was already wing shapes which they

7662
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:43,280
there was already wing shapes which they
 

7663
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,709
there was already wing shapes which they
had from studying birds there was

7664
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
had from studying birds there was
 

7665
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:46,629
had from studying birds there was
already gliders that carry people

7666
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
already gliders that carry people
 

7667
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:47,990
already gliders that carry people
the problem is if you put a rudder on

7668
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
the problem is if you put a rudder on
 

7669
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,589
the problem is if you put a rudder on
the back of a glider and you turn it the

7670
01:57:49,589 --> 01:57:49,599
the back of a glider and you turn it the
 

7671
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,270
the back of a glider and you turn it the
plane falls out of the sky

7672
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:51,280
plane falls out of the sky
 

7673
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,270
plane falls out of the sky
so the problem was how do you control

7674
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:53,280
so the problem was how do you control
 

7675
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,030
so the problem was how do you control
flight and

7676
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
flight and
 

7677
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,350
flight and
they studied birds and they actually had

7678
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
they studied birds and they actually had
 

7679
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,950
they studied birds and they actually had
birds in captivity they watched birds in

7680
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:58,960
birds in captivity they watched birds in
 

7681
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,669
birds in captivity they watched birds in
wind tunnels

7682
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
wind tunnels
 

7683
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,030
wind tunnels
they observed in the wild and they

7684
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:01,040
they observed in the wild and they
 

7685
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,030
they observed in the wild and they
discovered the secret was the birds

7686
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:03,040
discovered the secret was the birds
 

7687
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,229
discovered the secret was the birds
twist their wings

7688
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:04,239
twist their wings
 

7689
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:05,910
twist their wings
when they turn and so that's what they

7690
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:05,920
when they turn and so that's what they
 

7691
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,030
when they turn and so that's what they
did on the wright brothers flyer they

7692
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,040
did on the wright brothers flyer they
 

7693
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:07,430
did on the wright brothers flyer they
had these

7694
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:07,440
had these
 

7695
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,109
had these
sticks you would twist the wing and that

7696
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:09,119
sticks you would twist the wing and that
 

7697
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:10,870
sticks you would twist the wing and that
was that was their innovation

7698
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:10,880
was that was their innovation
 

7699
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,750
was that was their innovation
not their propeller and today airplanes

7700
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:13,760
not their propeller and today airplanes
 

7701
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,430
not their propeller and today airplanes
still twist their wings we don't twist

7702
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,440
still twist their wings we don't twist
 

7703
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,109
still twist their wings we don't twist
the entire wing we just just the tail

7704
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:17,119
the entire wing we just just the tail
 

7705
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:17,990
the entire wing we just just the tail
end of it

7706
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
end of it
 

7707
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,070
end of it
the the the flaps which is the same

7708
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:20,080
the the the flaps which is the same
 

7709
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,990
the the the flaps which is the same
thing so today's airplanes fly on the

7710
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,000
thing so today's airplanes fly on the
 

7711
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,109
thing so today's airplanes fly on the
same principles as

7712
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:23,119
same principles as
 

7713
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:24,790
same principles as
birds which is observed by so everyone

7714
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:24,800
birds which is observed by so everyone
 

7715
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,149
birds which is observed by so everyone
get that analogy wrong

7716
01:58:26,149 --> 01:58:26,159
get that analogy wrong
 

7717
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:28,550
get that analogy wrong
but let's step back from that right once

7718
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
but let's step back from that right once
 

7719
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,070
but let's step back from that right once
you understand

7720
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,080
you understand
 

7721
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,629
you understand
the principles of flight you can choose

7722
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
the principles of flight you can choose
 

7723
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:33,990
the principles of flight you can choose
how to implement them yeah

7724
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,000
how to implement them yeah
 

7725
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,070
how to implement them yeah
no one's going to use bones and feathers

7726
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:36,080
no one's going to use bones and feathers
 

7727
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,189
no one's going to use bones and feathers
and muscles

7728
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
and muscles
 

7729
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,990
and muscles
um but they do have wings and uh we

7730
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,000
um but they do have wings and uh we
 

7731
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,589
um but they do have wings and uh we
don't flap them we have propellers so

7732
01:58:41,589 --> 01:58:41,599
don't flap them we have propellers so
 

7733
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,030
don't flap them we have propellers so
when we have the principles

7734
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:43,040
when we have the principles
 

7735
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,589
when we have the principles
of of computation that goes on to

7736
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
of of computation that goes on to
 

7737
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:47,990
of of computation that goes on to
modeling the world in the brain we

7738
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
modeling the world in the brain we
 

7739
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,149
modeling the world in the brain we
understand those principles very clearly

7740
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:50,159
understand those principles very clearly
 

7741
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:51,830
understand those principles very clearly
we have choices on how to implement them

7742
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
we have choices on how to implement them
 

7743
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,189
we have choices on how to implement them
and some of them will be biologically

7744
01:58:53,189 --> 01:58:53,199
and some of them will be biologically
 

7745
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:54,390
and some of them will be biologically
like and some won't

7746
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:54,400
like and some won't
 

7747
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,589
like and some won't
and um but i do think there's going to

7748
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:57,599
and um but i do think there's going to
 

7749
01:58:57,599 --> 01:58:59,589
and um but i do think there's going to
be a huge amount of innovation here

7750
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
be a huge amount of innovation here
 

7751
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,629
be a huge amount of innovation here
just think about the innovation we're in

7752
01:59:00,629 --> 01:59:00,639
just think about the innovation we're in
 

7753
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,870
just think about the innovation we're in
the computers they had to invent the the

7754
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:02,880
the computers they had to invent the the
 

7755
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,669
the computers they had to invent the the
transistor they invented the the silicon

7756
01:59:05,669 --> 01:59:05,679
transistor they invented the the silicon
 

7757
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:06,310
transistor they invented the the silicon
ship

7758
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:06,320
ship
 

7759
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,310
ship
they had the invent you know then this

7760
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:08,320
they had the invent you know then this
 

7761
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,430
they had the invent you know then this
software i mean

7762
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:09,440
software i mean
 

7763
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,870
software i mean
zillions of things they had to do memory

7764
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
zillions of things they had to do memory
 

7765
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,950
zillions of things they had to do memory
systems um we're gonna do

7766
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
systems um we're gonna do
 

7767
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,550
systems um we're gonna do
it's gonna be similar well it's

7768
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:14,560
it's gonna be similar well it's
 

7769
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,149
it's gonna be similar well it's
interesting that the deep

7770
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
interesting that the deep
 

7771
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:18,950
interesting that the deep
learning um the effectiveness of deep

7772
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
learning um the effectiveness of deep
 

7773
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,669
learning um the effectiveness of deep
learning for

7774
01:59:19,669 --> 01:59:19,679
learning for
 

7775
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:21,830
learning for
a specific task is driving a lot of

7776
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:21,840
a specific task is driving a lot of
 

7777
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,109
a specific task is driving a lot of
innovation in the hardware

7778
01:59:23,109 --> 01:59:23,119
innovation in the hardware
 

7779
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:26,229
innovation in the hardware
which may have effects for uh

7780
01:59:26,229 --> 01:59:26,239
which may have effects for uh
 

7781
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,870
which may have effects for uh
actually allowing us to discover

7782
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:28,880
actually allowing us to discover
 

7783
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,470
actually allowing us to discover
intelligent systems that operate very

7784
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
intelligent systems that operate very
 

7785
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,109
intelligent systems that operate very
differently

7786
01:59:31,109 --> 01:59:31,119
differently
 

7787
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:32,550
differently
or that's much bigger than deep learning

7788
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:32,560
or that's much bigger than deep learning
 

7789
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,149
or that's much bigger than deep learning
yeah interesting so

7790
01:59:34,149 --> 01:59:34,159
yeah interesting so
 

7791
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,550
yeah interesting so
ultimately it's good to have an

7792
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:36,560
ultimately it's good to have an
 

7793
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,910
ultimately it's good to have an
application that's making our life

7794
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
application that's making our life
 

7795
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,030
application that's making our life
better now

7796
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:39,040
better now
 

7797
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,750
better now
because the the the capitalist process

7798
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
because the the the capitalist process
 

7799
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,950
because the the the capitalist process
if you can make money

7800
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:42,960
if you can make money
 

7801
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,030
if you can make money
yeah yeah that works i mean the other

7802
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,040
yeah yeah that works i mean the other
 

7803
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,229
yeah yeah that works i mean the other
way i mean

7804
01:59:46,229 --> 01:59:46,239
way i mean
 

7805
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:48,229
way i mean
neil degrasse tyson writes about this is

7806
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:48,239
neil degrasse tyson writes about this is
 

7807
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:49,910
neil degrasse tyson writes about this is
the other way we fund science of course

7808
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:49,920
the other way we fund science of course
 

7809
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,430
the other way we fund science of course
is through military

7810
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,440
is through military
 

7811
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,390
is through military
so like yeah uh conquest so here here's

7812
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:54,400
so like yeah uh conquest so here here's
 

7813
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,430
so like yeah uh conquest so here here's
an interesting thing we're doing on this

7814
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:55,440
an interesting thing we're doing on this
 

7815
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,229
an interesting thing we're doing on this
regard

7816
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
regard
 

7817
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,149
regard
so we've decided we we used to have a

7818
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:58,159
so we've decided we we used to have a
 

7819
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:59,669
so we've decided we we used to have a
series these biological principles and

7820
01:59:59,669 --> 01:59:59,679
series these biological principles and
 

7821
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:00,550
series these biological principles and
we can see how to build these

7822
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:00,560
we can see how to build these
 

7823
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:01,990
we can see how to build these
intelligent machines

7824
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,000
intelligent machines
 

7825
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,390
intelligent machines
but we've decided to apply some of these

7826
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:04,400
but we've decided to apply some of these
 

7827
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,070
but we've decided to apply some of these
principles to today's machine learning

7828
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
principles to today's machine learning
 

7829
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,270
principles to today's machine learning
techniques

7830
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,280
techniques
 

7831
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:08,950
techniques
so uh one of the we didn't talk about

7832
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:08,960
so uh one of the we didn't talk about
 

7833
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,470
so uh one of the we didn't talk about
this principle one is uh

7834
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:10,480
this principle one is uh
 

7835
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:12,550
this principle one is uh
sparsity in the brain um most of the

7836
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
sparsity in the brain um most of the
 

7837
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,910
sparsity in the brain um most of the
neurons are active at any point in time

7838
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:13,920
neurons are active at any point in time
 

7839
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,510
neurons are active at any point in time
as far as and the connectivity is sparse

7840
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:15,520
as far as and the connectivity is sparse
 

7841
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,790
as far as and the connectivity is sparse
and that's different than deep learning

7842
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:16,800
and that's different than deep learning
 

7843
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,750
and that's different than deep learning
networks

7844
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:17,760
networks
 

7845
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:20,390
networks
um so we've already shown that we can

7846
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:20,400
um so we've already shown that we can
 

7847
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,790
um so we've already shown that we can
speed up existing deep learning networks

7848
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:22,800
speed up existing deep learning networks
 

7849
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,149
speed up existing deep learning networks
uh anywhere from 10 to a factor of 100

7850
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
uh anywhere from 10 to a factor of 100
 

7851
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,870
uh anywhere from 10 to a factor of 100
i mean literally 100 and make it more

7852
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:28,880
i mean literally 100 and make it more
 

7853
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,510
i mean literally 100 and make it more
robust

7854
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:29,520
robust
 

7855
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,589
robust
at the same time so this is commercially

7856
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
at the same time so this is commercially
 

7857
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,030
at the same time so this is commercially
very very valuable

7858
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,040
very very valuable
 

7859
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,950
very very valuable
um and so you know if we can prove this

7860
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:36,960
um and so you know if we can prove this
 

7861
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:39,109
um and so you know if we can prove this
actually in the larger systems that are

7862
02:00:39,109 --> 02:00:39,119
actually in the larger systems that are
 

7863
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:40,790
actually in the larger systems that are
commercially applied today

7864
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:40,800
commercially applied today
 

7865
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,350
commercially applied today
there's a big commercial desire to do

7866
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:43,360
there's a big commercial desire to do
 

7867
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,310
there's a big commercial desire to do
this well

7868
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:44,320
this well
 

7869
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:47,910
this well
sparsity is something that doesn't run

7870
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:47,920
sparsity is something that doesn't run
 

7871
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,990
sparsity is something that doesn't run
really well on existing hardware it

7872
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:50,000
really well on existing hardware it
 

7873
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,669
really well on existing hardware it
doesn't really run really well

7874
02:00:51,669 --> 02:00:51,679
doesn't really run really well
 

7875
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,910
doesn't really run really well
on gpus um and on cpus

7876
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:55,920
on gpus um and on cpus
 

7877
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,310
on gpus um and on cpus
and so that would be a way of sort of

7878
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
and so that would be a way of sort of
 

7879
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,510
and so that would be a way of sort of
bringing more and

7880
02:00:59,510 --> 02:00:59,520
bringing more and
 

7881
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,109
bringing more and
more brain principles into the existing

7882
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:01,119
more brain principles into the existing
 

7883
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:03,270
more brain principles into the existing
system on a on a commercially valuable

7884
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
system on a on a commercially valuable
 

7885
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:03,910
system on a on a commercially valuable
basis

7886
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920
basis
 

7887
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,270
basis
another thing we can think we can do is

7888
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
another thing we can think we can do is
 

7889
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,589
another thing we can think we can do is
we're going to use the dendrites

7890
02:01:07,589 --> 02:01:07,599
we're going to use the dendrites
 

7891
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,030
we're going to use the dendrites
models of we i talked earlier about the

7892
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:11,040
models of we i talked earlier about the
 

7893
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,470
models of we i talked earlier about the
the prediction occurring inside of

7894
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:12,480
the prediction occurring inside of
 

7895
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,870
the prediction occurring inside of
neuron that that basic property can be

7896
02:01:14,870 --> 02:01:14,880
neuron that that basic property can be
 

7897
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,669
neuron that that basic property can be
applied to

7898
02:01:15,669 --> 02:01:15,679
applied to
 

7899
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:17,830
applied to
existing neural networks and allow them

7900
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:17,840
existing neural networks and allow them
 

7901
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,350
existing neural networks and allow them
to learn continuously which something

7902
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:19,360
to learn continuously which something
 

7903
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,709
to learn continuously which something
they don't do today

7904
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:20,719
they don't do today
 

7905
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:24,070
they don't do today
and so yeah well

7906
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,080
and so yeah well
 

7907
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:25,430
and so yeah well
we wouldn't model this spikes but the

7908
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:25,440
we wouldn't model this spikes but the
 

7909
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,350
we wouldn't model this spikes but the
idea that you have that

7910
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360
idea that you have that
 

7911
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,870
idea that you have that
neuro today's neural networks have

7912
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:28,880
neuro today's neural networks have
 

7913
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,990
neuro today's neural networks have
something called the point neuron which

7914
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
something called the point neuron which
 

7915
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,910
something called the point neuron which
is a very simple model of a neuron

7916
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
is a very simple model of a neuron
 

7917
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,390
is a very simple model of a neuron
and uh by adding dendrites to them with

7918
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:34,400
and uh by adding dendrites to them with
 

7919
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,629
and uh by adding dendrites to them with
just one more level of complexity

7920
02:01:36,629 --> 02:01:36,639
just one more level of complexity
 

7921
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:38,310
just one more level of complexity
that's in biological systems you can

7922
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:38,320
that's in biological systems you can
 

7923
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,709
that's in biological systems you can
solve problems in continuous learning

7924
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:40,719
solve problems in continuous learning
 

7925
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,229
solve problems in continuous learning
um and rapid learning so we're trying to

7926
02:01:44,229 --> 02:01:44,239
um and rapid learning so we're trying to
 

7927
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:44,629
um and rapid learning so we're trying to
take

7928
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
take
 

7929
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,750
take
we're trying to bring the existing field

7930
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:47,760
we're trying to bring the existing field
 

7931
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,870
we're trying to bring the existing field
and we'll see if we can do it we're

7932
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:48,880
and we'll see if we can do it we're
 

7933
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,990
and we'll see if we can do it we're
trying to bring the existing field of

7934
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
trying to bring the existing field of
 

7935
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,229
trying to bring the existing field of
machine learning

7936
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:52,239

commercially along with us you brought

7938
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:53,760
commercially along with us you brought
 

7939
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,270
commercially along with us you brought
up this idea of keeping you know paying

7940
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
up this idea of keeping you know paying
 

7941
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:55,990
up this idea of keeping you know paying
for it

7942
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:56,000
for it
 

7943
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,589
for it
commercially along with us as we move

7944
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
commercially along with us as we move
 

7945
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:59,350
commercially along with us as we move
towards the ultimate goal of a true ai

7946
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,360
towards the ultimate goal of a true ai

02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:01,760
even small innovations on neural
 

7951
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,990
even small innovations on neural
networks are really really exciting

7952
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
networks are really really exciting
 

7953
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,149
networks are really really exciting
yeah because it seems like such a

7954
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:06,159
yeah because it seems like such a
 

7955
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:07,510
yeah because it seems like such a
trivial model

7956
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,520
trivial model
 

7957
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,390

7960
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:11,920
insights
 

7961
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:14,149
insights
that just even like you said continuous

7962
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
that just even like you said continuous
 

7963
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:15,189
that just even like you said continuous
uh learning

7964
02:02:15,189 --> 02:02:15,199
uh learning
 

7965
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:19,350
uh learning
or uh making it more asynchronous

7966
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:19,360
or uh making it more asynchronous
 

7967
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,550
or uh making it more asynchronous
or maybe making more dynamic or

7968
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
or maybe making more dynamic or
 

7969
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,510
or maybe making more dynamic or
like uh incentivizing making it fast

7970
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:25,520
like uh incentivizing making it fast
 

7971
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,589
like uh incentivizing making it fast
even just from robots

7972
02:02:27,589 --> 02:02:27,599
even just from robots
 

7973
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:31,189
even just from robots
and making it somehow much better

7974
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
and making it somehow much better
 

7975
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:34,470
and making it somehow much better
incentivizing sparsity uh somehow yeah

7976
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,480
incentivizing sparsity uh somehow yeah
 

7977
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,310
incentivizing sparsity uh somehow yeah
uh well if you can make things 100 times

7978
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:36,320
uh well if you can make things 100 times
 

7979
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:39,589
uh well if you can make things 100 times
faster then there's plenty of incentive

7980
02:02:39,589 --> 02:02:39,599
faster then there's plenty of incentive
 

7981
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:41,189
faster then there's plenty of incentive
people people spending millions of

02:02:41,189 --> 02:02:41,199
people people spending millions of
 

7983
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:42,790
people people spending millions of
dollars you know just training some of

these networks now these

7986
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:44,000
these networks now these
 

7987
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,350
these networks now these
uh these transformer networks let me ask

7988
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:47,360
uh these transformer networks let me ask
 

7989
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,550
uh these transformer networks let me ask
you a big question

7990
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
you a big question
 

7991
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,189
you a big question
how for young people uh listening to

7992
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:51,199
how for young people uh listening to
 

7993
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:52,149
how for young people uh listening to
this today

7994
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:52,159
this today
 

7995
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:54,229
this today
in high school and college what advice

7996
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
in high school and college what advice
 

7997
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:55,350
in high school and college what advice
would you give them

7998
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:55,360
would you give them
 

7999
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,870
would you give them
in terms of uh which career path to take

8000
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:58,880
in terms of uh which career path to take
 

8001
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:03,109
in terms of uh which career path to take
and um maybe just about life in general

8002
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:03,119
and um maybe just about life in general
 

8003
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:06,149
and um maybe just about life in general
well in my case um

8004
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:06,159
well in my case um
 

8005
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:07,589
well in my case um
i didn't start life with any kind of

8006
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:07,599
i didn't start life with any kind of
 

8007
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:09,990
i didn't start life with any kind of
goals i was when i was going to college

8008
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
goals i was when i was going to college
 

8009
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,589
goals i was when i was going to college
i was like oh what did i say well maybe

8010
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:11,599
i was like oh what did i say well maybe
 

8011
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:11,910
i was like oh what did i say well maybe
i'll do

8012
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:11,920
i'll do
 

8013
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,109
i'll do
electrical engineering stuff you know um

8014
02:03:15,109 --> 02:03:15,119
electrical engineering stuff you know um
 

8015
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:16,310
electrical engineering stuff you know um
it wasn't like you know today you see

8016
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,320
it wasn't like you know today you see
 

8017
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,189
it wasn't like you know today you see
some of these young kids are so

8018
02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:17,199

brains work you'd build telescope
 

8045
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,189
brains work you'd build telescope
machines and they could figure out

8046
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
machines and they could figure out
 

8047
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:40,470
machines and they could figure out
all the other big questions of the world

02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:31,910
have been 17 or 18.
i made a list of the most interesting

8178
02:05:31,910 --> 02:05:31,920
i made a list of the most interesting
 

8179
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:34,069
i made a list of the most interesting
problems i could think of

8180
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:34,079
problems i could think of
 

8181
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:36,069
problems i could think of
first was why does the universe exist it

8182
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:36,079
first was why does the universe exist it
 

8183
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:38,470
first was why does the universe exist it
seems like not existing is more likely

8184
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,480
seems like not existing is more likely
 

8185
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,069
seems like not existing is more likely
yeah the second one was well given

8186
02:05:40,069 --> 02:05:40,079
yeah the second one was well given
 

8187
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:41,189
yeah the second one was well given
exists why does it behave the way it

8188
02:05:41,189 --> 02:05:41,199
exists why does it behave the way it
 

8189
02:05:41,199 --> 02:05:41,589
exists why does it behave the way it
does

8190
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:41,599
does
 

8191
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:43,350
does
you know it's laws of physics y is equal

8192
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:43,360
you know it's laws of physics y is equal
 

8193
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,109
you know it's laws of physics y is equal
to m c squared not m c cubed you know

8194
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:45,119
to m c squared not m c cubed you know
 

8195
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:46,950
to m c squared not m c cubed you know
attention question i don't know

8196
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:46,960
attention question i don't know
 

8197
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,550
attention question i don't know
third one was like what's the origin of

8198
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
third one was like what's the origin of
 

8199
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,149
third one was like what's the origin of
life um

8200
02:05:50,149 --> 02:05:50,159
life um
 

8201
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:51,669
life um
and the fourth one was what's

8202
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:51,679
and the fourth one was what's
 

8203
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:53,750
and the fourth one was what's
intelligence and i stopped there

8204
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:53,760
intelligence and i stopped there
 

8205
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,030
intelligence and i stopped there
i said well that's probably the most

8206
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,040
i said well that's probably the most
 

8207
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,669
i said well that's probably the most
interesting one and i put that aside

8208
02:05:57,669 --> 02:05:57,679
interesting one and i put that aside
 

8209
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:01,510
interesting one and i put that aside
um as a teenager but then when i was 22

8210
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:01,520
um as a teenager but then when i was 22

taken his interest to studying the brain
 

8235
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:27,430
taken his interest to studying the brain
now and he said you know

8236
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:27,440
now and he said you know
 

8237
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,430
now and he said you know
there's something wrong here he says we

8238

there's something wrong here he says we
 

8239
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,669
there's something wrong here he says we
got all this data

got all this data
 

8241
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:34,069
got all this data
oh this fact this is 1979 all these

8242
02:06:34,069 --> 02:06:34,079
oh this fact this is 1979 all these
 

8243
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:35,669
oh this fact this is 1979 all these
facts about the brain tons and tons of

8244
02:06:35,669 --> 02:06:35,679
facts about the brain tons and tons of
 

8245
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,510
facts about the brain tons and tons of
facts about the brain

facts about the brain
 

8247
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,750
facts about the brain
do we need more facts or do we just need

8248
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
do we need more facts or do we just need
 

8249
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,109
do we need more facts or do we just need
to think about a way of rearranging the

8250
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:41,119
to think about a way of rearranging the
 

8251
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:42,470
to think about a way of rearranging the
facts we have maybe we're just not

8252
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
facts we have maybe we're just not
 

8253
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,709
facts we have maybe we're just not
thinking about the problem correctly

8254
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
thinking about the problem correctly
 

8255
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:47,109
thinking about the problem correctly
you know because he says this shouldn't

8256

8265
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,870
i said i don't have to become like an
experimental neuroscientist

8266
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880
experimental neuroscientist
 

8267
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,990
experimental neuroscientist
i could just look at all those facts and

8268
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
i could just look at all those facts and
 

8269
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,470
i could just look at all those facts and
try to

8270

try to
 

8271
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:02,149
try to
and become a theoretician and try to

8272
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,159
and become a theoretician and try to
 

8273
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:03,589
and become a theoretician and try to
figure it out

8274
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
figure it out
 

8275
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:05,669

i said i wouldn't be a good
 

8281
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,109
i said i wouldn't be a good
experimentalist i don't have the

8282
02:07:09,109 --> 02:07:09,119
experimentalist i don't have the
 

8283
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:10,470
experimentalist i don't have the
patience for it

8284
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
patience for it
 

8285

as big as one of those four questions

8324
02:07:47,669 --> 02:07:47,679
as big as one of those four questions
 

8325

8335
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,669
be unborable i'm
i think i think it's very possible to

8336
02:07:59,669 --> 02:07:59,679
i think i think it's very possible to
 

8337
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:00,470
i think i think it's very possible to
find that

8338
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:00,480
find that
 

8339
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,310
find that
intensity of joy in the smallest

8340
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:02,320
intensity of joy in the smallest
 

8341
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,229
intensity of joy in the smallest
absolutely i'm just you asked me my

8342
02:08:04,229 --> 02:08:04,239
absolutely i'm just you asked me my

those four
you happen to get excited by one of the

8352
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:11,040
you happen to get excited by one of the
 

8353

you happen to get excited by one of the
bigger questions of

bigger questions of
 

8355
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:16,470
bigger questions of
in the universe but uh but that even the

in the universe but uh but that even the
 

8357
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,750
in the universe but uh but that even the
smallest things and watching the

smallest things and watching the
 

8359

smallest things and watching the
olympics now

olympics now
 

8361
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,470
olympics now
just uh just giving yourself life uh

8362
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,480
just uh just giving yourself life uh
 

8363
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,709
just uh just giving yourself life uh
giving your life over to the study and

8364
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:24,719
giving your life over to the study and
 

8365
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:26,470
giving your life over to the study and
the mastery of a particular sport is

8366
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
the mastery of a particular sport is
 

8367
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,510
the mastery of a particular sport is
fascinating

8368
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,520
fascinating
 

8369
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:30,550
fascinating
and and uh if if it sparks

8370
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:30,560
and and uh if if it sparks
 

8371
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,310
and and uh if if it sparks
joy and passion you're able to in the

8372
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,320
joy and passion you're able to in the
 

8373
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,669
joy and passion you're able to in the
case of the olympics

8374
02:08:33,669 --> 02:08:33,679
case of the olympics
 

8375
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:35,589
case of the olympics
basically suffer for like a couple of

8376
02:08:35,589 --> 02:08:35,599
basically suffer for like a couple of
 

8377
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:37,189
basically suffer for like a couple of
decades to achieve i mean you can find

8378
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:37,199
decades to achieve i mean you can find
 

8379
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:39,189
decades to achieve i mean you can find
joint passion just being a parent i mean

8380
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
joint passion just being a parent i mean
 

8381
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:41,350
joint passion just being a parent i mean
yeah yeah the the parenting one is funny

8382
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:41,360
yeah yeah the the parenting one is funny
 

8383
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,550
yeah yeah the the parenting one is funny
so i always

8384
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:42,560
so i always
 

8385
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,950
so i always
uh not always but for a long time wanted

8386
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:44,960
uh not always but for a long time wanted
 

8387
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,830
uh not always but for a long time wanted
kids and

8388
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:45,840
kids and
 

8389
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,669
kids and
get married and stuff and especially

8390

get married and stuff and especially
 

8391
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:49,589
get married and stuff and especially
that has to do with the fact that

8392
02:08:49,589 --> 02:08:49,599
that has to do with the fact that
 

8393
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:53,430
that has to do with the fact that
i've seen a lot of people that i respect

8394
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:53,440
i've seen a lot of people that i respect
 

8395
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:57,350
i've seen a lot of people that i respect
get a whole other level of joy from kids

8396
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
get a whole other level of joy from kids
 

8397
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:00,390
get a whole other level of joy from kids
and you know at first is like

8398
02:09:00,390 --> 02:09:00,400
and you know at first is like
 

8399
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,270
and you know at first is like
your thinking is well like i don't have

8400
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:03,280
your thinking is well like i don't have
 

8401
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,030
your thinking is well like i don't have
enough time in the day

8402
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
enough time in the day
 

8403
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,750
enough time in the day
right if i have this passion which is

8404
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
right if i have this passion which is
 

8405
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:08,470
right if i have this passion which is
true

8406
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:08,480
true
 

8407
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,550
true
yes but like if i want to solve

8408
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:10,560
yes but like if i want to solve
 

8409
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,069
yes but like if i want to solve
intelligence how is this

8410
02:09:12,069 --> 02:09:12,079
intelligence how is this
 

8411
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:14,550
intelligence how is this
kids situation gonna help me but then

8412
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:14,560
kids situation gonna help me but then
 

8413
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:15,990
kids situation gonna help me but then
you realize

8414
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:16,000
you realize
 

8415
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,109
you realize
that uh

8416
02:09:19,109 --> 02:09:19,119
that uh
 

8417
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,950
that uh
you know like you said the things that

8418
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:20,960
you know like you said the things that
 

8419
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,510
you know like you said the things that
sparks joy and it's very possible that

8420
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:23,520
sparks joy and it's very possible that
 

8421
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,310
sparks joy and it's very possible that
kids can provide even a greater or

8422
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:26,320
kids can provide even a greater or
 

8423
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,910
kids can provide even a greater or
deeper more meaningful

8424
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:27,920
deeper more meaningful
 

8425
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,149
deeper more meaningful
joy than those bigger questions yeah

8426
02:09:30,149 --> 02:09:30,159
joy than those bigger questions yeah
 

8427
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:31,990
joy than those bigger questions yeah
when they they enrich each other and

8428
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,000
when they they enrich each other and
 

8429
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,589
when they they enrich each other and
that that seemed like um

8430
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:33,599
that that seemed like um
 

8431
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:34,709
that that seemed like um
obviously when i was younger it's

8432
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:34,719
obviously when i was younger it's
 

8433
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:36,470
obviously when i was younger it's
probably a counter-intuitive notion

8434
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:36,480
probably a counter-intuitive notion
 

8435
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:37,830
probably a counter-intuitive notion
because there's only so many hours in

8436
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:37,840
because there's only so many hours in
 

8437
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:38,550
because there's only so many hours in
the day

8438
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:38,560
the day
 

8439
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,189
the day
but then life is finite and you have to

8440
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:41,199
but then life is finite and you have to
 

8441
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:42,950
but then life is finite and you have to
pick the things that give

8442
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:42,960
pick the things that give
 

8443
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:45,990
pick the things that give
give you joy yeah but you know also

8444
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,000
give you joy yeah but you know also
 

8445
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,390
give you joy yeah but you know also
you understand you you can be patient

8446
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:48,400
you understand you you can be patient
 

8447
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:49,830
you understand you you can be patient
too i mean it's finite

8448
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:49,840
too i mean it's finite
 

8449
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,669
too i mean it's finite
but we do have you know whatever 50

8450
02:09:51,669 --> 02:09:51,679
but we do have you know whatever 50
 

8451
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:53,350
but we do have you know whatever 50
years or so it's not so long yeah

8452
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,360
years or so it's not so long yeah
 

8453
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,990
years or so it's not so long yeah
so so in my case you know in my case i

8454
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:56,000
so so in my case you know in my case i
 

8455
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,430
so so in my case you know in my case i
had to give up on my dream of the

8456
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:57,440
had to give up on my dream of the
 

8457
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:58,470
had to give up on my dream of the
neuroscience

8458
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,480
neuroscience
 

8459
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,229
neuroscience
because i i was a graduate student at

8460
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:00,239
because i i was a graduate student at
 

8461
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:01,510
because i i was a graduate student at
berkeley and they told me i couldn't do

8462
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,520
berkeley and they told me i couldn't do
 

8463
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:03,189
berkeley and they told me i couldn't do
this and i couldn't get funded and

8464
02:10:03,189 --> 02:10:03,199
this and i couldn't get funded and
 

8465
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:06,550
this and i couldn't get funded and
you know and and so i went back in

8466
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:06,560
you know and and so i went back in
 

8467
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:07,990
you know and and so i went back in
and went back in the computing industry

8468
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:08,000
and went back in the computing industry
 

8469
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,510
and went back in the computing industry
for a number of years i thought it would

8470
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:09,520
for a number of years i thought it would
 

8471
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,270
for a number of years i thought it would
be four but it turned out to be more

8472
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:11,280
be four but it turned out to be more
 

8473
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,589
be four but it turned out to be more
but i said but i said i'll come back you

8474
02:10:13,589 --> 02:10:13,599

8479
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:17,109
come back i know i'm gonna do this
computer stuff for a while but i'm

8480
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:17,119
computer stuff for a while but i'm
 

8481
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:18,470
computer stuff for a while but i'm
definitely coming back everyone knows

8482
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:18,480
definitely coming back everyone knows
 

8483
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,270
definitely coming back everyone knows
that

8484
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,280
that
 

8485
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,790
that
and it's they moved like raising kids

you have to give up on other dreams it
 

8495
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:29,510

just means that you may have to wait a
 

8497

just means that you may have to wait a
week or two

week or two
 

8499
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,830
week or two
to work on that next idea well

8500
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:33,840
to work on that next idea well
 

8501
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,350

you talked about the the the darker side

8502
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
you talked about the the the darker side
 

8503
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,870
you talked about the the the darker side
of me disappointing sides of human

02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:38,880
of me disappointing sides of human
 

8505
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,790

nature that we're

8506
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:40,800
nature that we're
 

8507
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,390
nature that we're
hoping to overcome so that we don't

8508
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,400
hoping to overcome so that we don't
 

8509
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,550
hoping to overcome so that we don't
destroy ourselves i tend to

8510
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:44,560
destroy ourselves i tend to
 

8511
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:47,350
destroy ourselves i tend to
put a lot of value in um the broad

8512
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,360
put a lot of value in um the broad
 

8513
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,669
put a lot of value in um the broad
general concept of love

8514

general concept of love
 

8515
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:53,910
general concept of love
of uh the human capacity to um

8516
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:53,920
of uh the human capacity to um
 

8517
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:57,270
of uh the human capacity to um
of compassion towards each other of just

just the human
human to human connection yeah it

8524
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:01,840
human to human connection yeah it
 

8525
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,069
human to human connection yeah it
connects back to our initial discussion

8526
02:11:04,069 --> 02:11:04,079
connects back to our initial discussion
 

8527
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:06,310
connects back to our initial discussion
i tend to see a lot of value in this

8528
02:11:06,310 --> 02:11:06,320
i tend to see a lot of value in this
 

8529
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:07,830
i tend to see a lot of value in this
collective intelligence aspect

8530
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:07,840
collective intelligence aspect
 

8531
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,350
collective intelligence aspect
i think some of the magic of human

8532
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
i think some of the magic of human
 

8533
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:12,229
i think some of the magic of human
civilization happens when there's

8534
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:12,239
civilization happens when there's
 

8535
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,310
civilization happens when there's
uh a party is not as fun when it you're

8536
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,320
uh a party is not as fun when it you're
 

8537
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,270
uh a party is not as fun when it you're
alone yeah

8538
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:15,280
alone yeah
 

8539
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,430
alone yeah
i totally agree with you on these issues

8540
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:17,440
i totally agree with you on these issues
 

8541
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,950
i totally agree with you on these issues
uh do you think

8542
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:18,960
uh do you think
 

8543
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,229
uh do you think
from a neurocortex perspective

8544
02:11:22,229 --> 02:11:22,239
from a neurocortex perspective
 

8545
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:24,069
from a neurocortex perspective
uh what role does love play in the human

8546
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
uh what role does love play in the human
 

8547
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:26,149
uh what role does love play in the human
condition uh well those are two separate

8548
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:26,159
condition uh well those are two separate
 

8549
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:28,310
condition uh well those are two separate
things from a new project

8550
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:28,320
things from a new project
 

8551
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:29,750
things from a new project
i don't think it doesn't impact our

8552
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:29,760
i don't think it doesn't impact our
 

8553
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,270
i don't think it doesn't impact our
thinking about human uh about the

8554
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,280
thinking about human uh about the
 

8555
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,310
thinking about human uh about the
neocortex

8556
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:32,320
neocortex
 

8557
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:33,750
neocortex
from a human condition point of view i

8558
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:33,760
from a human condition point of view i
 

8559
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,390
from a human condition point of view i
think it's core um

8560
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:36,400
think it's core um
 

8561
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:40,310
think it's core um
i mean we get so much pleasure out of

8562
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,320
i mean we get so much pleasure out of
 

8563
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,109
i mean we get so much pleasure out of
loving people

8564
02:11:41,109 --> 02:11:41,119
loving people
 

8565
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:44,310
loving people
and helping people um

8566
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:44,320
and helping people um
 

8567
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,950
and helping people um
so you know i can i'll rack it up to old

8568
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:46,960
so you know i can i'll rack it up to old
 

8569
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:48,470
so you know i can i'll rack it up to old
brain stuff and maybe you can throw it

8570
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
brain stuff and maybe you can throw it
 

8571
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,270
brain stuff and maybe you can throw it
under the

8572
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:49,280
under the
 

8573
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:52,149
under the
the bust of evolution if you want um

8574
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:52,159
the bust of evolution if you want um
 

8575
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:53,030
the bust of evolution if you want um
that's fine

8576
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,040
that's fine
 

8577
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,830
that's fine
um uh it doesn't impact how i think

8578
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:55,840
um uh it doesn't impact how i think
 

8579
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:58,310
um uh it doesn't impact how i think
about how we model the world

8580
02:11:58,310 --> 02:11:58,320
about how we model the world
 

8581
02:11:58,320 --> 02:11:59,830
about how we model the world
but from a humanity point of view i

8582
02:11:59,830 --> 02:11:59,840
but from a humanity point of view i
 

8583
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,069
but from a humanity point of view i
think it's essential well i tend to

8584
02:12:02,069 --> 02:12:02,079
think it's essential well i tend to
 

8585
02:12:02,079 --> 02:12:04,470
think it's essential well i tend to
give it to the new brain and also i tend

8586
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:04,480
give it to the new brain and also i tend
 

8587
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,990
give it to the new brain and also i tend
to think that some of aspects

8588
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
to think that some of aspects
 

8589
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,149
to think that some of aspects
of that need to be engineered into ai

8590
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
of that need to be engineered into ai
 

8591
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:09,830
of that need to be engineered into ai
systems

8592
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:09,840
systems
 

8593
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,069
systems
both in their ability to have compassion

8594
02:12:14,069 --> 02:12:14,079
both in their ability to have compassion
 

8595
02:12:14,079 --> 02:12:16,069
both in their ability to have compassion
for other humans

8596
02:12:16,069 --> 02:12:16,079
for other humans
 

8597
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:19,270
for other humans
and their ability to

8598
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:19,280
and their ability to
 

8599
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,830
and their ability to
maximize love in the world between

8600
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:21,840
maximize love in the world between
 

8601
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,629
maximize love in the world between
humans

8602
02:12:22,629 --> 02:12:22,639
humans
 

8603
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:24,550
humans
so i'm more thinking about the social

8604
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
so i'm more thinking about the social
 

8605
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,669
so i'm more thinking about the social
network so like

8606
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
network so like
 

8607
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,189
network so like
whenever there's a deep integration

8608
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:27,199
whenever there's a deep integration
 

8609
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:28,870
whenever there's a deep integration
between ai systems and humans

8610
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:28,880
between ai systems and humans
 

8611
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,589
between ai systems and humans
so specific applications where it's uh

8612
02:12:31,589 --> 02:12:31,599
so specific applications where it's uh
 

8613
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:32,069
so specific applications where it's uh
ai

8614
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:32,079
ai
 

8615
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:35,109
ai
and humans i think that's something that

8616
02:12:35,109 --> 02:12:35,119
and humans i think that's something that
 

8617
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:38,870
and humans i think that's something that
often not talked about in terms of um

8618
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:38,880
often not talked about in terms of um
 

8619
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:43,589
often not talked about in terms of um
metrics over which you try to maximize

8620
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
metrics over which you try to maximize
 

8621
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:46,149
metrics over which you try to maximize
uh like which metric to maximize in a

8622
02:12:46,149 --> 02:12:46,159
uh like which metric to maximize in a
 

8623
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:46,709
uh like which metric to maximize in a
system

8624
02:12:46,709 --> 02:12:46,719
system
 

8625
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:49,990
system
it seems like one of the most powerful

8626
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:50,000
it seems like one of the most powerful
 

8627
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,109
it seems like one of the most powerful
things in societies

8628
02:12:53,109 --> 02:12:53,119
things in societies
 

8629
02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:55,750
things in societies
is the capacity to work it's fascinating

8630
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:55,760
is the capacity to work it's fascinating
 

8631
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:56,470
is the capacity to work it's fascinating
i think it's

8632
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:56,480
i think it's
 

8633
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:58,390
i think it's
it's a great way of thinking about it

8634
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,400
it's a great way of thinking about it
 

8635
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,069
it's a great way of thinking about it
you know i have

8636
02:13:00,069 --> 02:13:00,079
you know i have
 

8637
02:13:00,079 --> 02:13:01,270
you know i have
i have been thinking more of these

8638
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:01,280
i have been thinking more of these
 

8639
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,189
i have been thinking more of these
fundamental mechanisms in the brain as

8640
02:13:03,189 --> 02:13:03,199
fundamental mechanisms in the brain as
 

8641
02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:03,990
fundamental mechanisms in the brain as
opposed to

8642
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
opposed to
 

8643
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,750
opposed to
the social interaction between the

8644
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:05,760
the social interaction between the
 

8645
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,109
the social interaction between the
interaction between humans and ai

8646
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:07,119
interaction between humans and ai
 

8647
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:08,790
interaction between humans and ai
systems in the future which is

8648
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
systems in the future which is
 

8649
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,149
systems in the future which is
and i think if you think about that

8650
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:10,159
and i think if you think about that
 

8651
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:12,229
and i think if you think about that
you're absolutely right um

8652
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:12,239
you're absolutely right um
 

8653
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:14,229
you're absolutely right um
but that's that's a complex system i can

8654
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:14,239
but that's that's a complex system i can
 

8655
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:15,830
but that's that's a complex system i can
have intelligent systems that don't have

8656
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:15,840
have intelligent systems that don't have
 

8657
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:16,870
have intelligent systems that don't have
that component but they're not

8658
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:16,880
that component but they're not
 

8659
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,149
that component but they're not
interacting with people you know they're

8660
02:13:18,149 --> 02:13:18,159
interacting with people you know they're
 

8661
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,830
interacting with people you know they're
just running something or building a

8662
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:19,840
just running something or building a
 

8663
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,430
just running something or building a
building someplace or something i don't

8664
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,440
building someplace or something i don't
 

8665
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,950
building someplace or something i don't
know um

8666
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:22,960
know um
 

8667
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,470
know um
but if you think about interacting with

8668
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:24,480
but if you think about interacting with
 

8669
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,470
but if you think about interacting with
humans yeah it's it's gonna

8670
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
humans yeah it's it's gonna
 

8671
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,910
humans yeah it's it's gonna
and then but it has to be engineered in

8672
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:27,920
and then but it has to be engineered in
 

8673
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,109
and then but it has to be engineered in
there i don't think it's gonna appear on

8674
02:13:29,109 --> 02:13:29,119
there i don't think it's gonna appear on
 

8675
02:13:29,119 --> 02:13:30,550
there i don't think it's gonna appear on
its own

8676
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:30,560
its own
 

8677
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,950
its own
uh that's a good question i yeah well we

8678
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:32,960
uh that's a good question i yeah well we
 

8679
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,950
uh that's a good question i yeah well we
could

8680
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960
could
 

8681
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:39,189
could
in terms of uh uh from a reinforcement

8682
02:13:39,189 --> 02:13:39,199
in terms of uh uh from a reinforcement
 

8683
02:13:39,199 --> 02:13:41,589
in terms of uh uh from a reinforcement
learning perspective

8684
02:13:41,589 --> 02:13:41,599
learning perspective
 

8685
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:45,030
learning perspective
whether the darker sides of human nature

8686
02:13:45,030 --> 02:13:45,040
whether the darker sides of human nature
 

8687
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,109
whether the darker sides of human nature
or the better angels of our nature

8688
02:13:47,109 --> 02:13:47,119
or the better angels of our nature
 

8689
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:49,589
or the better angels of our nature
uh win out yeah statistically speaking i

8690
02:13:49,589 --> 02:13:49,599
uh win out yeah statistically speaking i
 

8691
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:50,310
uh win out yeah statistically speaking i
don't know

8692
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
don't know
 

8693
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:52,229
don't know
i tend to be optimistic and hope that

8694
02:13:52,229 --> 02:13:52,239
i tend to be optimistic and hope that
 

8695
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:53,830
i tend to be optimistic and hope that
love wins out in the end

8696
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:53,840
love wins out in the end
 

8697
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:56,950
love wins out in the end
um you've done a lot of incredible stuff

8698
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:56,960
um you've done a lot of incredible stuff
 

8699
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:00,390
um you've done a lot of incredible stuff
and your book is uh

8700
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:00,400
and your book is uh
 

8701
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,790
and your book is uh
driving towards this fourth question

8702
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:02,800
driving towards this fourth question
 

8703
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,470
driving towards this fourth question
that you started with

8704
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:04,480
that you started with
 

8705
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,629
that you started with
on the nature of intelligence what do

8706
02:14:06,629 --> 02:14:06,639
on the nature of intelligence what do
 

8707
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:07,589
on the nature of intelligence what do
you hope your

8708
02:14:07,589 --> 02:14:07,599
you hope your
 

8709
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:10,709
you hope your
legacy for people reading a hundred

8710
02:14:10,709 --> 02:14:10,719
legacy for people reading a hundred
 

8711
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:13,189
legacy for people reading a hundred
years from now

8712
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:13,199
years from now
 

8713
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:14,870
years from now
how do you hope they remember your work

8714
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:14,880
how do you hope they remember your work
 

8715
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:17,270
how do you hope they remember your work
how do you hope they remember this book

8716
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
how do you hope they remember this book
 

8717
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,910
how do you hope they remember this book
well i think as an entrepreneur or

8718
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:19,920
well i think as an entrepreneur or
 

8719
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,510
well i think as an entrepreneur or
scientist or

8720
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:21,520
scientist or
 

8721
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:23,270
scientist or
any human who's trying to accomplish

8722
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:23,280
any human who's trying to accomplish
 

8723
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:26,790
any human who's trying to accomplish
some things i have a view that

8724
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:26,800
some things i have a view that
 

8725
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:29,189
some things i have a view that
really all you can do is accelerate the

8726
02:14:29,189 --> 02:14:29,199
really all you can do is accelerate the
 

8727
02:14:29,199 --> 02:14:30,470
really all you can do is accelerate the
inevitable

8728
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
inevitable
 

8729
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:33,270
inevitable
um yeah it's like you know if we didn't

8730
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:33,280
um yeah it's like you know if we didn't
 

8731
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:34,709
um yeah it's like you know if we didn't
figure out if we didn't study the brain

8732
02:14:34,709 --> 02:14:34,719
figure out if we didn't study the brain
 

8733
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:35,830
figure out if we didn't study the brain
someone else would study the brain if

8734
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:35,840
someone else would study the brain if
 

8735
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,109
someone else would study the brain if
you know if elon just

8736
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:37,119
you know if elon just
 

8737
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:38,390
you know if elon just
didn't make electric cars someone else

8738
02:14:38,390 --> 02:14:38,400
didn't make electric cars someone else
 

8739
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,310
didn't make electric cars someone else
would do it eventually and if you know

8740
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
would do it eventually and if you know
 

8741
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,830
would do it eventually and if you know
if thomas anderson didn't invent a light

8742
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:41,840
if thomas anderson didn't invent a light
 

8743
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,069
if thomas anderson didn't invent a light
bulb we wouldn't be using candles today

8744
02:14:44,069 --> 02:14:44,079
bulb we wouldn't be using candles today
 

8745
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:47,109
bulb we wouldn't be using candles today
so what you can do as an individual is

8746
02:14:47,109 --> 02:14:47,119
so what you can do as an individual is
 

8747
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:48,870
so what you can do as an individual is
you can accelerate

8748
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:48,880
you can accelerate
 

8749
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,270
you can accelerate
something that's beneficial and make it

8750
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:51,280
something that's beneficial and make it
 

8751
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,550
something that's beneficial and make it
happen sooner than whatever that's

8752
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
happen sooner than whatever that's
 

8753
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,629
happen sooner than whatever that's
that's really it that's all you can do

8754
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:54,639
that's really it that's all you can do
 

8755
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:57,270
that's really it that's all you can do
um you can't create a new reality that

8756
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,280
um you can't create a new reality that
 

8757
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,950
um you can't create a new reality that
it wasn't gonna happen

8758
02:14:58,950 --> 02:14:58,960
it wasn't gonna happen
 

8759
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,149
it wasn't gonna happen
um so from that perspective

8760
02:15:02,149 --> 02:15:02,159
um so from that perspective
 

8761
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:05,109
um so from that perspective
um i would hope that our work not just

8762
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:05,119
um i would hope that our work not just
 

8763
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:05,990
um i would hope that our work not just
me but our work

8764
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
me but our work
 

8765
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,550
me but our work
in general um people would look back and

8766
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:08,560
in general um people would look back and
 

8767
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,109
in general um people would look back and
said

8768
02:15:09,109 --> 02:15:09,119
said
 

8769
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:10,870
said
hey they really helped make this better

8770
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:10,880
hey they really helped make this better
 

8771
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,390
hey they really helped make this better
future happen sooner

8772
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:12,400
future happen sooner
 

8773
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:15,750
future happen sooner
um they you know they helped us

8774
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:15,760
um they you know they helped us
 

8775
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,430
um they you know they helped us
understand the nature of false beliefs

8776
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:17,440
understand the nature of false beliefs
 

8777
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:19,030
understand the nature of false beliefs
sooner than we met up they made it

8778
02:15:19,030 --> 02:15:19,040
sooner than we met up they made it
 

8779
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,629
sooner than we met up they made it
now we're so happy that we have these

8780
02:15:20,629 --> 02:15:20,639
now we're so happy that we have these
 

8781
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:21,910
now we're so happy that we have these
intelligent machines doing these things

8782
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:21,920
intelligent machines doing these things
 

8783
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:22,709
intelligent machines doing these things
helping us

8784
02:15:22,709 --> 02:15:22,719
helping us
 

8785
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:24,629
helping us
that that maybe that solved the climate

8786
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
that that maybe that solved the climate
 

8787
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:26,149
that that maybe that solved the climate
change problem and

8788
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:26,159
change problem and
 

8789
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:28,550
change problem and
they made it happen sooner so i think

8790
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:28,560
they made it happen sooner so i think
 

8791
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:29,510
they made it happen sooner so i think
that's the best

8792
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
that's the best
 

8793
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,109
that's the best
i would hope for some would say those

8794
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:31,119
i would hope for some would say those
 

8795
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,709
i would hope for some would say those
guys just

8796
02:15:32,709 --> 02:15:32,719
guys just
 

8797
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:34,629
guys just
moved the needle forward a little bit in

8798
02:15:34,629 --> 02:15:34,639
moved the needle forward a little bit in
 

8799
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:36,550
moved the needle forward a little bit in
time well

8800
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:36,560
time well
 

8801
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,709
time well
i do it it feels like the progress of

8802
02:15:38,709 --> 02:15:38,719
i do it it feels like the progress of
 

8803
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:41,350
i do it it feels like the progress of
human civilization is not

8804
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:41,360
human civilization is not
 

8805
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:44,550
human civilization is not
is uh there's a lot of trajectories and

8806
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:44,560
is uh there's a lot of trajectories and
 

8807
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,470
is uh there's a lot of trajectories and
if you have individuals that accelerate

8808
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:48,480
if you have individuals that accelerate
 

8809
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,030
if you have individuals that accelerate
towards one direction that helps steer

8810
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,040
towards one direction that helps steer
 

8811
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,310
towards one direction that helps steer
human civilization so

8812
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:52,320
human civilization so
 

8813
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:55,910
human civilization so
i think in this long stretch of time all

8814
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:55,920
i think in this long stretch of time all
 

8815
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,069
i think in this long stretch of time all
all trajectories will be traveled but i

8816
02:15:58,069 --> 02:15:58,079
all trajectories will be traveled but i
 

8817
02:15:58,079 --> 02:15:59,189
all trajectories will be traveled but i
think it's nice

8818
02:15:59,189 --> 02:15:59,199
think it's nice
 

8819
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:00,950
think it's nice
for this particular civilization on

8820
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:00,960
for this particular civilization on
 

8821
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,709
for this particular civilization on
earth to travel down one that's not yeah

8822
02:16:02,709 --> 02:16:02,719
earth to travel down one that's not yeah
 

8823
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:03,990
earth to travel down one that's not yeah
well i think you're right i mean look we

8824
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:04,000
well i think you're right i mean look we
 

8825
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:04,390
well i think you're right i mean look we
have the

8826
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
have the
 

8827
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,990
have the
take the whole period of you know world

8828
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
take the whole period of you know world
 

8829
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,270
take the whole period of you know world
war ii nazism or something like that

8830
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:07,280
war ii nazism or something like that
 

8831
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,510
war ii nazism or something like that
well that was a bad sidestep right

8832
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:09,520
well that was a bad sidestep right
 

8833
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:11,669
well that was a bad sidestep right
went over there for a while but you know

8834
02:16:11,669 --> 02:16:11,679
went over there for a while but you know
 

8835
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:13,350
went over there for a while but you know
there is the optimistic view about life

8836
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:13,360
there is the optimistic view about life
 

8837
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:13,990
there is the optimistic view about life
that

8838
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,000
that
 

8839
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,950
that
um that ultimately it does converge in a

8840
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:16,960
um that ultimately it does converge in a
 

8841
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,069
um that ultimately it does converge in a
positive way

8842
02:16:18,069 --> 02:16:18,079
positive way
 

8843
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:20,149
positive way
it progresses ultimately even if we have

8844
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:20,159
it progresses ultimately even if we have
 

8845
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:21,109
it progresses ultimately even if we have
years of

8846
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
years of
 

8847
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:25,270
years of
darkness um so yeah so i think you can

8848
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
darkness um so yeah so i think you can
 

8849
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,069
darkness um so yeah so i think you can
perhaps

8850
02:16:26,069 --> 02:16:26,079
perhaps
 

8851
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:28,069
perhaps
that's accelerating the positive it

8852
02:16:28,069 --> 02:16:28,079
that's accelerating the positive it
 

8853
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:29,990
that's accelerating the positive it
could also mean eliminating some bad

8854
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
could also mean eliminating some bad
 

8855
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,549
could also mean eliminating some bad
missteps along the way too um

8856
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
missteps along the way too um
 

8857
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:35,110
missteps along the way too um
but but i i'm an optimistic in that way

8858
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:35,120
but but i i'm an optimistic in that way
 

8859
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:36,870
but but i i'm an optimistic in that way

8879
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,990
they'll live in some sort of way that's
compatible with the carrying capacity of

8880
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,000
compatible with the carrying capacity of
 

8881
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:52,870
compatible with the carrying capacity of
the earth

8882

happen
and all we can do is try to get there

02:16:57,349 --> 02:16:57,359
and all we can do is try to get there
 

8889
02:16:57,359 --> 02:16:59,990
and all we can do is try to get there
sooner and at the very least if we do

8890
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:00,000
sooner and at the very least if we do
 

8891
