how the ingredients come together to
form a taste it's the whole pipeline

you know making you uh giving you the
 

275
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,830
you know making you uh giving you the
ability to make the

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
like just meat or just a vegetable like
 

1155
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,110
like just meat or just a vegetable like
basic grilled without sauces without any

1156
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
basic grilled without sauces without any
 

1157
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,310
basic grilled without sauces without any
of that

1158
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
of that
 

1159
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,310
of that
that i've discovered is what brings me a

1160
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
that i've discovered is what brings me a
 

1161
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,390
that i've discovered is what brings me a
lot of joy but that's boring to a lot of

1162
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
lot of joy but that's boring to a lot of
 

1163
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,909
lot of joy but that's boring to a lot of
people

1164
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
people
 

1165
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,070
people
so i usually have to be kind of private

1166
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
so i usually have to be kind of private
 

1167
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,669
so i usually have to be kind of private
about that joy

1168
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
about that joy
 

1169
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,190
about that joy
so but that's mine so yeah i figured

1170
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
so but that's mine so yeah i figured
 

1171
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,870
so but that's mine so yeah i figured
that out and i guess as a

1172
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
that out and i guess as a
 

1173
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,870
that out and i guess as a
as a chef you have to figure that out

1174
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
as a chef you have to figure that out
 

1175
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,669
as a chef you have to figure that out
about everybody that you care for

1176
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
about everybody that you care for
 

1177
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,710
about everybody that you care for
well also for you

1178
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
well also for you
 

1179
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,830
well also for you
you're very interested in things and

1180
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
you're very interested in things and
 

1181
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,990
you're very interested in things and
and interested in things being done well

1182
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
and interested in things being done well
 

1183
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,190
and interested in things being done well
and appreciating them so

1184
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
and appreciating them so
 

1185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,029
and appreciating them so
the single ingredient also allows you to

1186
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
the single ingredient also allows you to
 

1187
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,190
the single ingredient also allows you to
control for perfection and cooking that

1188
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
control for perfection and cooking that
 

1189
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,310
control for perfection and cooking that
which is probably really

1190
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
which is probably really
 

1191
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,590
which is probably really
appealing to you and i think

1192
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
appealing to you and i think
 

1193
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,190
appealing to you and i think
sometimes i see people also in the

1194
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
sometimes i see people also in the
 

1195
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,789
sometimes i see people also in the
beginning of their journey of

1196
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
beginning of their journey of
 

1197
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,870
beginning of their journey of
culinary trying to do too many things

1198
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
culinary trying to do too many things
 

1199
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,950
culinary trying to do too many things
right so there's another piece too

1200
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
right so there's another piece too
 

1201
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,950
right so there's another piece too
that you'll notice if you recall last

1202
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
that you'll notice if you recall last
 

1203
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,549
that you'll notice if you recall last
night i grilled us the salad

1204
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
night i grilled us the salad
 

1205
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,310
night i grilled us the salad
right and then i did all those pieces

1206
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
right and then i did all those pieces
 

1207
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,070
right and then i did all those pieces
separately and that's something in

1208
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
separately and that's something in
 

1209
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,630
separately and that's something in
general

1210
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
general
 

1211
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,390
general
to be really attentive of when you're

1212
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
to be really attentive of when you're
 

1213
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,870
to be really attentive of when you're
building flavor to make sure you

1214
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
building flavor to make sure you
 

1215
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,909
building flavor to make sure you
pay attention to every piece separately

1216
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
pay attention to every piece separately
 

1217
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,630
pay attention to every piece separately
um you know the idea that you can okay

1218
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
um you know the idea that you can okay
 

1219
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,830
um you know the idea that you can okay
with the soup or something or stew

1220
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
with the soup or something or stew
 

1221
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,350
with the soup or something or stew
there's there's workarounds

1222
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
there's there's workarounds
 

1223
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,669
there's there's workarounds
but like to make a great dish that's got

1224
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
but like to make a great dish that's got
 

1225
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,350
but like to make a great dish that's got
four or five vegetables in it

1226
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
four or five vegetables in it
 

1227
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,990
four or five vegetables in it
cook them all separately to their

1228
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
cook them all separately to their
 

1229
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,990
cook them all separately to their
optimal deliciousness and then combine

1230
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
optimal deliciousness and then combine
 

1231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,470
optimal deliciousness and then combine
them

1232
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
them
 

1233
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,070
them
so that's another way to approach that

1234
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
so that's another way to approach that
 

1235
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,590
so that's another way to approach that
is that you may also be able to look at

1236
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
is that you may also be able to look at
 

1237
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,190
is that you may also be able to look at
the different ingredients separately

1238
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
the different ingredients separately
 

1239
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,950
the different ingredients separately
and still have that sense of like

1240
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
and still have that sense of like
 

1241
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,390
and still have that sense of like
understanding of it

1242
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
understanding of it
 

1243
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,390
understanding of it
but there's too often that we're

1244
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
but there's too often that we're
 

1245
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,310
but there's too often that we're
layering together like four or five

1246
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
layering together like four or five
 

1247
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,470
layering together like four or five
things and then cooking them all at once

1248
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
things and then cooking them all at once
 

1249
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,430
things and then cooking them all at once
and then surprised that it's not

1250
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
and then surprised that it's not
 

1251
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,070
and then surprised that it's not
delicious

1252
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
delicious
 

1253
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,590
delicious
yeah because you can't you can't really

1254
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
yeah because you can't you can't really
 

1255
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,070
yeah because you can't you can't really
optimize on multiple variables at the

1256
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
optimize on multiple variables at the
 

1257
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,990
optimize on multiple variables at the
same time for peak

1258
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
same time for peak
 

1259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,669
same time for peak
awesomeness and that's actually you know

1260
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
awesomeness and that's actually you know
 

1261
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,110
awesomeness and that's actually you know
the number one way you see this is

1262
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
the number one way you see this is
 

1263
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,470
the number one way you see this is
roasting a whole chicken

1264
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
roasting a whole chicken
 

1265
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,830
roasting a whole chicken
which is a really difficult it's the

1266
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
which is a really difficult it's the
 

1267
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,510
which is a really difficult it's the
simplest dish but it's very difficult

1268
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
simplest dish but it's very difficult
 

1269
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,950
simplest dish but it's very difficult
because you have the breast meat which

1270
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
because you have the breast meat which
 

1271
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,590
because you have the breast meat which
is bigger chunks they cook faster you

1272
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
is bigger chunks they cook faster you
 

1273
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,149
is bigger chunks they cook faster you
have the

1274
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
have the
 

1275
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,789
have the
thighs and drums which are smaller and

1276
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
thighs and drums which are smaller and
 

1277
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,990
thighs and drums which are smaller and
they cook slower

1278
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
they cook slower
 

1279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,909
they cook slower
to optimize that and pay attention to it

1280
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
to optimize that and pay attention to it
 

1281
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,270
to optimize that and pay attention to it
and do it all right they're you're

1282
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
and do it all right they're you're
 

1283
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,270
and do it all right they're you're
actually solving for different outcomes

1284
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
actually solving for different outcomes
 

1285
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,270
actually solving for different outcomes
so there's a there's one example but

1286
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
so there's a there's one example but
 

1287
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,590
so there's a there's one example but
oftentimes food is less delicious with

1288
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
oftentimes food is less delicious with
 

1289
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,190
oftentimes food is less delicious with
multiple ingredients at the start

1290
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
multiple ingredients at the start
 

1291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,190
multiple ingredients at the start
because we're not able to pay attention

1292
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
because we're not able to pay attention
 

1293
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,510
because we're not able to pay attention
to how each one needs to end up

1294
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
to how each one needs to end up
 

1295
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,750
to how each one needs to end up
so there's a way to parse that apart and

1296
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
so there's a way to parse that apart and
 

1297
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,669
so there's a way to parse that apart and
achieve a better outcome

1298
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
achieve a better outcome
 

1299
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,870
achieve a better outcome
i don't know if you've seen jiro dreams

1300
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
i don't know if you've seen jiro dreams
 

1301
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,669
i don't know if you've seen jiro dreams
of sushi it's a documentary about

1302
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
of sushi it's a documentary about
 

1303
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,350
of sushi it's a documentary about
yeah so there's an obsession

1304
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
yeah so there's an obsession
 

1305
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,630
yeah so there's an obsession
that particular first of all set of

1306
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:44,640
that particular first of all set of
 

1307
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,310
that particular first of all set of
humans

1308
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
humans
 

1309
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,230
humans
but also the particular uh cuisine

1310
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
but also the particular uh cuisine
 

1311
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,669
but also the particular uh cuisine
that focused on the basics of the

1312
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
that focused on the basics of the
 

1313
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,510

but if you want to get mastery with food
 

1377
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,909
but if you want to get mastery with food
you probably

1378
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
you probably
 

1379
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,590
you probably
aren't going to be able to get more than

1380
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
aren't going to be able to get more than
 

1381
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,750
aren't going to be able to get more than
say 20 ingredients that you use

1382
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
say 20 ingredients that you use

1394
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
and then really people only use just a
 

1395
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,669
and then really people only use just a
couple things

1396
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679

tacos the next time you can
absolutely but to get in a regular

1404
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
absolutely but to get in a regular
 

1405
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,669
absolutely but to get in a regular
cadence of specific ingredients you're

1406
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
cadence of specific ingredients you're
 

1407
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,270
cadence of specific ingredients you're
probably going to get more mastery with

1408
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
probably going to get more mastery with
 

1409
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,710
probably going to get more mastery with
that sooner

1410
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
that sooner
 

1411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,510

challenging in foods i also find that
 

1497
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,950
challenging in foods i also find that
it's difficult um on the quality of that

1498
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
it's difficult um on the quality of that
 

1499
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,990
it's difficult um on the quality of that
ingredient

1500
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
ingredient
 

1501
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,230
ingredient
so i've found often that i buy a high

1502
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
so i've found often that i buy a high
 

1503
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,350
so i've found often that i buy a high
quality coconut oil and there's

1504
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
quality coconut oil and there's
 

1505
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,390
quality coconut oil and there's
rancidity in it

1506
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
rancidity in it
 

1507
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,230
rancidity in it
um and i don't totally know why i think

1508
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
um and i don't totally know why i think
 

1509
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,830
um and i don't totally know why i think
it's just the cold chain and how that

1510
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
it's just the cold chain and how that
 

1511
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,029
it's just the cold chain and how that
products packaged

1512
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
products packaged
 

1513
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,630
products packaged
so i've had some issues with product

1514
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
so i've had some issues with product
 

1515
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,470
so i've had some issues with product
quality in that but i

1516
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
quality in that but i
 

1517
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,909
quality in that but i
for me it's a little bit too much

1518
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
for me it's a little bit too much
 

1519
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,230
for me it's a little bit too much
sweetness in my foods

sweetness in my foods
 

1521
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,070

1536
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
notes
 

1537
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,230
notes
and earthiness which is a nice

1538
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
and earthiness which is a nice
 

1539
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,230
and earthiness which is a nice
combination but it's more like a treat

1540
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
combination but it's more like a treat
 

1541
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,990
combination but it's more like a treat
yeah it is almost like a tree it has it

1542
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
yeah it is almost like a tree it has it
 

1543
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,830
yeah it is almost like a tree it has it
has a flavor of its own

1544
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
has a flavor of its own
 

1545
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,669
has a flavor of its own
that almost stands on its own like i

1546
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
that almost stands on its own like i
 

1547
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,950
that almost stands on its own like i
could probably just

1548
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
could probably just
 

1549
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,390
could probably just
eat cook that's probably the only oil i

1550
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
eat cook that's probably the only oil i
 

1551
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,350
eat cook that's probably the only oil i
could enjoy by itself

1552
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
could enjoy by itself
 

1553
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,909
could enjoy by itself
it sounds weird to say but it feels like

1554
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:31,919
it sounds weird to say but it feels like
 

1555
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,070
it sounds weird to say but it feels like
fat is often a thing that enriches the

1556
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
fat is often a thing that enriches the
 

1557
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,350
fat is often a thing that enriches the
flavor of something else

1558
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
flavor of something else
 

1559
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,350

coconut can almost stand on its own you

1560
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
coconut can almost stand on its own you
 

1561
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,110
coconut can almost stand on its own you
might also be responding to that it's a

1562
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
might also be responding to that it's a
 

1563
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,310
might also be responding to that it's a
complex flavor

1564
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
complex flavor
 

1565
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,870
complex flavor
right so there's also a there's an

1566
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
right so there's also a there's an
 

1567
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,310
right so there's also a there's an

analogous
 

1569
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,510

you know if you look at butter for

1570
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
you know if you look at butter for
 

1571
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,590
you know if you look at butter for
example a lot of the butter that we eat

1572
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
example a lot of the butter that we eat
 

1573
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,310

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,470
in the u.s
is just sweet cream butter it's not

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
is just sweet cream butter it's not
 

1577
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,350
is just sweet cream butter it's not
cultured

1578
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
cultured
 

1579
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,390
cultured
if you explore like a cultured fermented

1580
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
if you explore like a cultured fermented
 

1581
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,269
if you explore like a cultured fermented

butter
 

1583
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,430
butter
maybe a grass milk grass-fed and finish

00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
maybe a grass milk grass-fed and finish
 

1585
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,269
maybe a grass milk grass-fed and finish
butter you're gonna get a ton more

1586
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
butter you're gonna get a ton more
 

1587
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,390
butter you're gonna get a ton more
complexity

1588
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
complexity
 

1589
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,630
complexity
and so you may also just be responding

1590
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
and so you may also just be responding
 

1591
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
and so you may also just be responding
to having fats with

1592
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
to having fats with
 

1593
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,029
to having fats with
more flavor which is the

1594
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
more flavor which is the
 

1595
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,750
more flavor which is the
the journey in the u.s has been towards

1596
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
the journey in the u.s has been towards
 

1597
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,029
the journey in the u.s has been towards
refined foods

1598
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
refined foods
 

1599
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,269
refined foods
that are very neutral and then you have

1600
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
that are very neutral and then you have
 

1601
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,190
that are very neutral and then you have
to combine more of them to make things

1602
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
to combine more of them to make things
 

1603
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,269
to combine more of them to make things
taste like things

1604
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
taste like things
 

1605
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,430
taste like things
and so if you're coming from a

1606
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
and so if you're coming from a
 

1607
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,190
and so if you're coming from a
background of using mostly just

1608
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
background of using mostly just
 

1609
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,789
background of using mostly just
generic butter or let's say canola oil

1610
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
generic butter or let's say canola oil
 

1611
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,190
generic butter or let's say canola oil
to cook with those are very neutral oils

1612
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
to cook with those are very neutral oils
 

1613
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,950
to cook with those are very neutral oils
so you can also take some of your

1614
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
so you can also take some of your
 

1615
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,549
so you can also take some of your
favorite fats and look for versions of

1616
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
favorite fats and look for versions of
 

1617
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,909
favorite fats and look for versions of
them that are more flavorful

1618
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
them that are more flavorful
 

1619
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,470
them that are more flavorful

00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
is there something that can be said the
 

1809
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,230
is there something that can be said the
basic approach

basic approach
 

1811
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,350
basic approach
to cooking any type of meat

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
to cooking any type of meat
 

1813
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,350
to cooking any type of meat
beyond the artistry of it is pretty

1814

beyond the artistry of it is pretty
scientific

1816
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
scientific
 

1817
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,750
scientific
and it's what type of muscle is it in

1818
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
and it's what type of muscle is it in
 

1819
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,950
and it's what type of muscle is it in
the animal

1820
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
the animal
 

1821
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,630
the animal
and what's the surface area to volume

1822
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
and what's the surface area to volume
 

1823
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,470
and what's the surface area to volume
ratio

1824
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
ratio
 

1825
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,669
ratio
okay so let's look at those two

1826
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
okay so let's look at those two
 

1827
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,710
okay so let's look at those two
questions so the first piece is

1828
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
questions so the first piece is
 

1829
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,549
questions so the first piece is
what's the type of muscle in the animal

1830
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
what's the type of muscle in the animal
 

1831
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,070
what's the type of muscle in the animal
what's the functionality

1832
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
what's the functionality
 

1833
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,669
what's the functionality
you don't necessarily need to know that

1834
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
you don't necessarily need to know that
 

1835
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,590
you don't necessarily need to know that
um to evaluate it but you need to

1836
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
um to evaluate it but you need to
 

1837
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,310
um to evaluate it but you need to
understand

1838
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,320
understand
 

1839
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,909
understand
is it a tender muscle that's not used

1840
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
is it a tender muscle that's not used
 

1841
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,430
is it a tender muscle that's not used
very frequently in the animal

1842
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
very frequently in the animal
 

1843
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,190
very frequently in the animal
or is it a big load-bearing muscle that

1844
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
or is it a big load-bearing muscle that
 

1845
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,950
or is it a big load-bearing muscle that
gets a lot of action like the cheek

1846
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
gets a lot of action like the cheek
 

1847
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,549
gets a lot of action like the cheek
right or the shin or the those pieces

right or the shin or the those pieces
 

1849
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,269
right or the shin or the those pieces
the muscles like um those along the

1850
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
the muscles like um those along the
 

1851
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,789
the muscles like um those along the
spinal cord that make up

1852
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
spinal cord that make up
 

1853
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,389
spinal cord that make up
rib eyes and new york stakes and things

1854

rib eyes and new york stakes and things
 

1855
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,070
rib eyes and new york stakes and things
those aren't very exercised

1856
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
those aren't very exercised
 

1857
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,430
those aren't very exercised
they're they're right next to the spinal

they're they're right next to the spinal
 

1859
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,029
they're they're right next to the spinal
cord spinal cord is doing most of the

1860
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
cord spinal cord is doing most of the
 

1861
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,549
cord spinal cord is doing most of the
work there they're kind of like

1862
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
work there they're kind of like
 

1863
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,470
work there they're kind of like
stabilizing muscles around this big

1864
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
stabilizing muscles around this big
 

1865
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,830
stabilizing muscles around this big
functional piece of

1866
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
functional piece of
 

1867
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,190
functional piece of
of skeletal structure in the animal

1868
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
of skeletal structure in the animal
 

1869
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,029
of skeletal structure in the animal
other muscles like the ones around the

1870
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:21,039
other muscles like the ones around the
 

1871
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,630
other muscles like the ones around the
diaphragm with the flat iron stakes and

1872
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
diaphragm with the flat iron stakes and
 

1873
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,070
diaphragm with the flat iron stakes and
skirt stakes and things those are

1874
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
skirt stakes and things those are
 

1875
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,590
skirt stakes and things those are
those are really functional muscles that

1876
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
those are really functional muscles that
 

1877
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,669
those are really functional muscles that
are doing a ton and moving and

1878
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
are doing a ton and moving and
 

1879
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,230
are doing a ton and moving and
if they're moving a lot what happens

1880
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
if they're moving a lot what happens
 

1881
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,710
if they're moving a lot what happens
well

1882
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
well
 

1883
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,190
well
functionally they've got lots of muscle

1884
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
functionally they've got lots of muscle
 

1885
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,909
functionally they've got lots of muscle
sheaths

1886
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
sheaths
 

1887
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,830
sheaths
because muscles that move frequently

1888
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:35,840
because muscles that move frequently
 

1889
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,669
because muscles that move frequently
have to do a lot of like complex

1890
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
have to do a lot of like complex
 

1891
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,630
have to do a lot of like complex
contraction that's why you know there's

1892
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
contraction that's why you know there's
 

1893
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,830
contraction that's why you know there's
um

1894
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,840
um
 

1895
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,909
um
in the cheek for example there's tons of

1896
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
in the cheek for example there's tons of
 

1897
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,190
in the cheek for example there's tons of
visible fiber of

1898
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
visible fiber of
 

1899
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,389
visible fiber of
like collagenous connective tissue

1900
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
like collagenous connective tissue
 

1901
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,909
like collagenous connective tissue
that connective tissue is everything

1902
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
that connective tissue is everything
 

1903
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,549
that connective tissue is everything
in how the meat cooks because connective

1904
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
in how the meat cooks because connective
 

1905
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,310
in how the meat cooks because connective
tissue doesn't respond

1906
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
tissue doesn't respond
 

1907
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,110
tissue doesn't respond
to high heat with becoming more tender

1908
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
to high heat with becoming more tender
 

1909
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,669
to high heat with becoming more tender
muscles

1910
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
muscles
 

1911
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,190
muscles
do right they can get a sear on them you

1912
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
do right they can get a sear on them you
 

1913
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,710
do right they can get a sear on them you
can cut them and eat them the collagen

1914
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
can cut them and eat them the collagen
 

1915
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,149
can cut them and eat them the collagen
stitches will glom up

1916
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
stitches will glom up
 

1917
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,389
stitches will glom up
and get really tough so you either have

1918
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
and get really tough so you either have
 

1919
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,230
and get really tough so you either have
to liquefy it with really low

1920
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
to liquefy it with really low
 

1921
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,669
to liquefy it with really low
slow heat with moisture right

1922
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
slow heat with moisture right
 

1923
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,870
slow heat with moisture right
or you have to barely cook it and that's

1924
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
or you have to barely cook it and that's
 

1925
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,149
or you have to barely cook it and that's
so that's the major piece that's the

1926
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
so that's the major piece that's the
 

1927
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,350
so that's the major piece that's the
question of like why wouldn't you just

1928
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
question of like why wouldn't you just
 

1929
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,029
question of like why wouldn't you just
throw a brisket on the grill

1930
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
throw a brisket on the grill
 

1931
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,630
throw a brisket on the grill
okay it's not about the fat you can cut

1932
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,640
okay it's not about the fat you can cut
 

1933
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,990
okay it's not about the fat you can cut
the fat out the reason you're not going

1934
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
the fat out the reason you're not going
 

1935
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,350
the fat out the reason you're not going
to throw a brisket on the grill and cook

1936
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
to throw a brisket on the grill and cook
 

1937
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,789
to throw a brisket on the grill and cook
it hot and fast it's got too much

1938
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
it hot and fast it's got too much
 

1939
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,630
it hot and fast it's got too much
collagenous connective tissue in it

1940
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
collagenous connective tissue in it
 

1941
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,870
collagenous connective tissue in it
those are these giant muscles that have

1942
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
those are these giant muscles that have
 

1943
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,389
those are these giant muscles that have
all this collagen and these fibers and

1944
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:30,399
all this collagen and these fibers and
 

1945
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,909
all this collagen and these fibers and
tendons in them effectively

1946
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
tendons in them effectively
 

1947
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,750
tendons in them effectively
so you're never going to be able to just

1948
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
so you're never going to be able to just
 

1949
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,389
so you're never going to be able to just
cook that up hot fast so that's the

1950
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
cook that up hot fast so that's the
 

1951
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,149
cook that up hot fast so that's the
first piece it's like what where's this

1952
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
first piece it's like what where's this
 

1953
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,389
first piece it's like what where's this
muscle in the architecture of the animal

1954
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
muscle in the architecture of the animal
 

1955
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,269
muscle in the architecture of the animal
and then

1956
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:41,279
and then
 

1957
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,029
and then
what does that mean for what's going on

1958
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
what does that mean for what's going on
 

1959
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,789
what does that mean for what's going on
in the muscle

1960
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
in the muscle
 

1961
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,669
in the muscle
and that's actually more important than

1962
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
and that's actually more important than
 

1963
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,269
and that's actually more important than
fat content we get really

1964
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
fat content we get really
 

1965
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,710
fat content we get really
kind of we pay a lot of attention to fat

1966
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
kind of we pay a lot of attention to fat
 

1967
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,310
kind of we pay a lot of attention to fat
content in muscles

1968
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
content in muscles
 

1969
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,590
content in muscles
you can make a steak tender if it

1970
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
you can make a steak tender if it
 

1971
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,950
you can make a steak tender if it
doesn't have a ton of fat in it it

1972
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
doesn't have a ton of fat in it it
 

1973
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,070
doesn't have a ton of fat in it it
actually has more to do if

1974
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,080
actually has more to do if
 

1975
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,430
actually has more to do if
there's if there's collagen and

1976
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
there's if there's collagen and
 

1977
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,669
there's if there's collagen and
connective tissue in it

1978
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
connective tissue in it
 

1979
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,950
connective tissue in it
that's fascinating i never even thought

1980
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:00,960
that's fascinating i never even thought
 

1981
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,190
that's fascinating i never even thought
about that i just

1982
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
about that i just
 

1983
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,149
about that i just
i thought it kind of uh universe i mean

1984
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
i thought it kind of uh universe i mean
 

1985
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,110
i thought it kind of uh universe i mean
adds to the

1986
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
adds to the
 

1987
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,430
adds to the
the texture of the meat the chewiness of

1988
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
the texture of the meat the chewiness of
 

1989
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,149
the texture of the meat the chewiness of
the meat

1990
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
the meat
 

1991
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,789
the meat
but you're saying it's also adds to uh

1992
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
but you're saying it's also adds to uh
 

1993
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,190
but you're saying it's also adds to uh
how

1994
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
how
 

1995
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,509
how
heat how it reacts to heat how the

1996
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:15,519
heat how it reacts to heat how the
 

1997
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,669
heat how it reacts to heat how the
entirety of the meat reacts to heat

1998
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
entirety of the meat reacts to heat
 

1999
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,909
entirety of the meat reacts to heat
and the fat is not as important to that

2000
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
and the fat is not as important to that
 

2001
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,669
and the fat is not as important to that
as the the calories the fat will make

2002
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
as the the calories the fat will make
 

2003
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,110
as the the calories the fat will make
the flavor more delicious

2004
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
the flavor more delicious
 

2005
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,029
the flavor more delicious
right like it'll add punctuousness and

2006
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
right like it'll add punctuousness and
 

2007
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,870
right like it'll add punctuousness and
mouth feel and things like that but

2008
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
mouth feel and things like that but
 

2009
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,029
mouth feel and things like that but
the all the connective tissue in meat

2010
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
the all the connective tissue in meat
 

2011
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,710
the all the connective tissue in meat
and in some of the cuts like that we ate

2012
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
and in some of the cuts like that we ate
 

2013
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,149
and in some of the cuts like that we ate
a skirt steak last night you could see a

2014
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
a skirt steak last night you could see a
 

2015
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:32,710
a skirt steak last night you could see a
web

2016
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720

2017
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,350
web
of that collagen sheath on the outside

2018
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,360
of that collagen sheath on the outside
 

2019
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,350
of that collagen sheath on the outside
on a ribeye that same collagen sheath is

2020
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
on a ribeye that same collagen sheath is
 

2021
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,710
on a ribeye that same collagen sheath is
this big there's only one it goes around

2022
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
this big there's only one it goes around
 

2023
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,149
this big there's only one it goes around
the outside okay because it's just

2024
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
the outside okay because it's just
 

2025
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,990
the outside okay because it's just
that muscle there's one large muscle

2026
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
that muscle there's one large muscle
 

2027
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,430
that muscle there's one large muscle
fiber so

2028
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
fiber so
 

2029
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,389
fiber so
that specific it's a myelin sheath right

2030
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
that specific it's a myelin sheath right
 

2031
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:46,789
that specific it's a myelin sheath right
that's

2032
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
that's
 

2033
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,110
that's
that material needs moisture and low and

2034
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
that material needs moisture and low and
 

2035
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,230
that material needs moisture and low and
slow heat to become

2036
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
slow heat to become
 

2037
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,710
slow heat to become
tender the other side of that is that

2038
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
tender the other side of that is that
 

2039
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,870
tender the other side of that is that
when it becomes tender it liquefies

2040
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
when it becomes tender it liquefies
 

2041
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,710
when it becomes tender it liquefies
and it adds all this beautiful

2042
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
and it adds all this beautiful
 

2043
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,950
and it adds all this beautiful
gelatinous consistency that's what bone

2044
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
gelatinous consistency that's what bone
 

2045
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,230
gelatinous consistency that's what bone
broth is that's why

2046
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
broth is that's why
 

2047
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,789
broth is that's why
like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so

2048
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so
 

2049
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,750
like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so
delicious

2050
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
delicious
 

2051
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,509
delicious
it's not that it's full of all that fat

2052
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
it's not that it's full of all that fat
 

2053
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,789
it's not that it's full of all that fat
that fat's also great but

2054
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
that fat's also great but
 

2055
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,710
that fat's also great but
a lot of that mouth feel comes from that

2056
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
a lot of that mouth feel comes from that
 

2057
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,310
a lot of that mouth feel comes from that
really beautiful

2058
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,320
really beautiful
 

2059
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,789
really beautiful
dissolved collagen so when you're

2060
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
dissolved collagen so when you're
 

2061
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,070
dissolved collagen so when you're
looking like how do i understand

2062
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
looking like how do i understand
 

2063
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,430
looking like how do i understand
how i'm going to cook a piece of meat

2064
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
how i'm going to cook a piece of meat
 

2065
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,430
how i'm going to cook a piece of meat
that first fork in the road is

2066
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
that first fork in the road is
 

2067
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,549
that first fork in the road is
how is this going to respond to heat and

2068
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
how is this going to respond to heat and
 

2069
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,110
how is this going to respond to heat and
what's the appropriate cooking technique

2070
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
what's the appropriate cooking technique
 

2071
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,389
what's the appropriate cooking technique
then the second piece

2072
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
then the second piece
 

2073
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,350
then the second piece
is that surface area to volume ratio and

2074
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
is that surface area to volume ratio and
 

2075
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,070
is that surface area to volume ratio and
that's

2076
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
that's
 

2077
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,909
that's
important because the heat is going to

2078
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
important because the heat is going to
 

2079
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,070
important because the heat is going to
impact the meat through the surfaces

2080
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
impact the meat through the surfaces
 

2081
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,990
impact the meat through the surfaces
of the meat that are in contact with the

2082
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
of the meat that are in contact with the
 

2083
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,669
of the meat that are in contact with the
heat

2084
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
heat
 

2085
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,269
heat
so if i have a steak that's three inches

2086
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
so if i have a steak that's three inches
 

2087
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,669
so if i have a steak that's three inches
thick i'm going to cook it extremely

2088
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
thick i'm going to cook it extremely
 

2089
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,110
thick i'm going to cook it extremely
diff differently from my

2090
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
diff differently from my
 

2091
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,590
diff differently from my
from a steak that's a half inch thick or

2092
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
from a steak that's a half inch thick or
 

2093
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,190
from a steak that's a half inch thick or
three quarters of an inch thick

2094
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
three quarters of an inch thick
 

2095
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,870
three quarters of an inch thick
and that's the major and that's the

2096
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
and that's the major and that's the
 

2097
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,870
and that's the major and that's the
truth if i have a piece of pork shoulder

2098
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
truth if i have a piece of pork shoulder
 

2099
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,350
truth if i have a piece of pork shoulder
that's cut into cubes versus having a

2100
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
that's cut into cubes versus having a
 

2101
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,630
that's cut into cubes versus having a
whole pork shoulder

2102
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
whole pork shoulder
 

2103
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,630
whole pork shoulder
that surface area to volume ratio that's

2104
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
that surface area to volume ratio that's
 

2105
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,029
that surface area to volume ratio that's
going to totally change how i cook it

2106
00:32:59,029 --> 00:32:59,039
going to totally change how i cook it
 

2107
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,830
going to totally change how i cook it
and same things like pot roast and a

2108
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
and same things like pot roast and a
 

2109
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,909
and same things like pot roast and a
beef stew would be the same cut of meat

2110
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
beef stew would be the same cut of meat
 

2111
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,830
beef stew would be the same cut of meat
right but how i cook them is going to

2112
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:05,840
right but how i cook them is going to
 

2113
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,350
right but how i cook them is going to
change based on the surface area of

2114
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
change based on the surface area of
 

2115
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,710
change based on the surface area of
volume because you've got to let

2116
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
volume because you've got to let
 

2117
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,789
volume because you've got to let
moisture and heat work its way into the

2118
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
moisture and heat work its way into the
 

2119
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,909
moisture and heat work its way into the
center of the meat

2120
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
center of the meat
 

2121
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,190
center of the meat
and that's going to be determined by the

2122
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
and that's going to be determined by the
 

2123
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,190
and that's going to be determined by the
amount of surface of the meat that's in

2124
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
amount of surface of the meat that's in
 

2125
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,950
amount of surface of the meat that's in
contact with whatever cooking liquid or

2126
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
contact with whatever cooking liquid or
 

2127
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,909
contact with whatever cooking liquid or
heat you've got

2128
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
heat you've got
 

2129
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,909
heat you've got
is there different sources of heat to

2130
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
is there different sources of heat to
 

2131
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,750
is there different sources of heat to
play with like a big flame

2132
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
play with like a big flame
 

2133
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,269
play with like a big flame
versus a small or maybe even like

2134
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
versus a small or maybe even like
 

2135
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,669
versus a small or maybe even like
almost no flame like over coals all that

2136
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
almost no flame like over coals all that
 

2137
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,830
almost no flame like over coals all that
kind of stuff is there some

2138
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of stuff is there some
 

2139
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,230
kind of stuff is there some
science to the source of heat in how it

2140
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
science to the source of heat in how it
 

2141
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,430
science to the source of heat in how it
plays with the meat

2142
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
plays with the meat
 

2143
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,909
plays with the meat
there's indirect heat and direct heat

2144
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
there's indirect heat and direct heat
 

2145
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,630
there's indirect heat and direct heat
and

2146
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
and
 

2147
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,509
and
that really is mostly about temperature

2148
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
that really is mostly about temperature
 

2149
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:39,830
that really is mostly about temperature
okay

2150
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
okay
 

2151
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,230
okay
in more than actual i mean smoke is

2152
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
in more than actual i mean smoke is
 

2153
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,870
in more than actual i mean smoke is
important

2154
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
important
 

2155
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,710
important
as well that can permeate but really the

2156
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
as well that can permeate but really the
 

2157
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,310
as well that can permeate but really the
smoke doesn't go into the center of most

2158
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
smoke doesn't go into the center of most
 

2159
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,669
smoke doesn't go into the center of most
cuts that you barbecue it'll come it's

2160
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:47,679
cuts that you barbecue it'll come it's
 

2161
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,190
cuts that you barbecue it'll come it's
like the smoke ring it's it's a

2162
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
like the smoke ring it's it's a
 

2163
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,430
like the smoke ring it's it's a
it's a you know it's maximum like half

2164
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
it's a you know it's maximum like half
 

2165
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,470
it's a you know it's maximum like half
an inch on the outside

2166
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
an inch on the outside
 

2167
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,909
an inch on the outside
maybe a little bit deeper on a really

2168
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
maybe a little bit deeper on a really
 

2169
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,149
maybe a little bit deeper on a really
long slow cook so they

2170
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
long slow cook so they
 

2171
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,990
long slow cook so they
but this the smoke that does create a

2172
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
but this the smoke that does create a
 

2173
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,909
but this the smoke that does create a
ton of flavor on the surface of the meat

2174
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
ton of flavor on the surface of the meat
 

2175
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,830
ton of flavor on the surface of the meat
um but that's so the indirect allows you

2176
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
um but that's so the indirect allows you
 

2177
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,230
um but that's so the indirect allows you
to have smoke contacting it and then a

2178
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
to have smoke contacting it and then a
 

2179
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,149
to have smoke contacting it and then a
very very low and slow heat

2180
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
very very low and slow heat
 

2181
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,669
very very low and slow heat
and what that does is indirect heat

2182
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
and what that does is indirect heat
 

2183
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,950
and what that does is indirect heat
will be low and slow enough

2184
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
will be low and slow enough
 

2185
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,950
will be low and slow enough
that the center of the meat will get

2186
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
that the center of the meat will get
 

2187
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,790
that the center of the meat will get
warm at the same time as the exterior of

2188
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
warm at the same time as the exterior of
 

2189
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,430
warm at the same time as the exterior of
the meat

2190
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
the meat
 

2191
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,230
the meat
and it'll all cook equally and all get

2192
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,240
and it'll all cook equally and all get
 

2193
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,990
and it'll all cook equally and all get
equally tender

2194
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,000
equally tender
 

2195
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,470
equally tender
if you go very hot and fast you risk the

2196
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
if you go very hot and fast you risk the
 

2197
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,510
if you go very hot and fast you risk the
interior of the meat

2198
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
interior of the meat
 

2199
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,109
interior of the meat
not getting right you kind of create a

2200
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
not getting right you kind of create a
 

2201
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,750
not getting right you kind of create a
shell on the on it um and you slow down

2202
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
shell on the on it um and you slow down
 

2203
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,869
shell on the on it um and you slow down
the interior or the meat which you

2204
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
the interior or the meat which you
 

2205
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,990
the interior or the meat which you
actually want to do with something like

2206
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
actually want to do with something like
 

2207
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,710
actually want to do with something like
a steak

2208
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
a steak
 

2209
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,069
a steak
where you want to keep it rare on the

2210
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
where you want to keep it rare on the
 

2211
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,790
where you want to keep it rare on the
inside so it's really indirect versus

2212
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
inside so it's really indirect versus
 

2213
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,310
inside so it's really indirect versus
direct then once you get into

2214
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
direct then once you get into
 

2215
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,629
direct then once you get into
direct heat right like in that category

2216
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
direct heat right like in that category
 

2217
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,829
direct heat right like in that category
there's wood

2218
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
there's wood
 

2219
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,030
there's wood
charcoal gas right that's about it and

2220
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
charcoal gas right that's about it and
 

2221
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,829
charcoal gas right that's about it and
those are

2222
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
those are
 

2223
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,430
those are
meaningfully different they're

2224
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
meaningfully different they're
 

2225
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,829
meaningfully different they're
meaningfully different charcoal and wood

2226
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
meaningfully different charcoal and wood
 

2227
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,750
meaningfully different charcoal and wood
that's more of there's more poetry and

2228
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760
that's more of there's more poetry and
 

2229
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,230
that's more of there's more poetry and
wood there's a little bit more flavor

2230
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
wood there's a little bit more flavor
 

2231
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,710
wood there's a little bit more flavor
not functionally very different but gas

2232
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:56,720
not functionally very different but gas
 

2233
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,829
not functionally very different but gas
versus charcoal wood

2234
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
versus charcoal wood
 

2235
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,910
versus charcoal wood
is very different um and that's because

2236
00:34:59,910 --> 00:34:59,920
is very different um and that's because
 

2237
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,870
is very different um and that's because
of the actual

2238
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
of the actual
 

2239
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,430
of the actual
scent of the of the cook right the scent

2240
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
scent of the of the cook right the scent
 

2241
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,390
scent of the of the cook right the scent
of the flavor

2242
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
of the flavor
 

2243
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,349
of the flavor
um and then there's a i think an

2244
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
um and then there's a i think an
 

2245
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,510
um and then there's a i think an
evenness of heat distribution that comes

2246
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
evenness of heat distribution that comes
 

2247
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,630
evenness of heat distribution that comes
off of charcoal

2248
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
off of charcoal
 

2249
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,310
off of charcoal
that's different from gas because no

2250
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
that's different from gas because no
 

2251
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,750
that's different from gas because no
matter how awesome your gas grill is you

2252
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
matter how awesome your gas grill is you
 

2253
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,710
matter how awesome your gas grill is you
do have hotter

2254
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:14,720
do have hotter
 

2255
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,349
do have hotter
and cooler spots so gas grills are

2256
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
and cooler spots so gas grills are
 

2257
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:17,910
and cooler spots so gas grills are
typically

2258
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:17,920
typically
 

2259
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,510
typically
you can kind of control for that if you

2260
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
you can kind of control for that if you
 

2261
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,190
you can kind of control for that if you
just are going really hot and fast

2262
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
just are going really hot and fast
 

2263
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,790
just are going really hot and fast
yeah which is why grass grills are fine

2264
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
yeah which is why grass grills are fine
 

2265
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,150
yeah which is why grass grills are fine
if you're just like throwing that steak

2266
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
if you're just like throwing that steak
 

2267

when you're doing things that do better
with a low and slow

with a low and slow
 

2277
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,630
with a low and slow
cook like let's say a whole tenderloin

2278

cook like let's say a whole tenderloin
 

2279

or
chicken thigh that's going to be a

2282
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
chicken thigh that's going to be a
 

2283
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,470

little bit
 

2285
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,390

versus wood so when you have more
 

2289
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,870
versus wood so when you have more
more kind of nuance in the low slow cook

more kind of nuance in the low slow cook
 

2291

the things with the crank it allows you
 

2389
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,829
the things with the crank it allows you
to control the distance from the flame

2390
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:13,839
to control the distance from the flame
 

2391
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,430
to control the distance from the flame
it's awesome really key with the wood

2392
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440
it's awesome really key with the wood
 

2393
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,030
it's awesome really key with the wood
fire so when we evolved

2394
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
fire so when we evolved
 

2395
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,310
fire so when we evolved
um from cooking over wood to charcoal

2396
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,320
um from cooking over wood to charcoal
 

2397
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,790
um from cooking over wood to charcoal
right when when that became more popular

right when when that became more popular
 

2399
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,550
right when when that became more popular
the reason that we did that is that

2400
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
the reason that we did that is that
 

2401
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,510
the reason that we did that is that
allowed us to

2402
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:25,520
allowed us to
 

2403
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,270
allowed us to
skip the whole part of making our own

2404
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
skip the whole part of making our own

so we're here about campbell farms and

2524
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
so we're here about campbell farms and
 

2525
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,390
so we're here about campbell farms and
we'll maybe you could talk about

2526
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
we'll maybe you could talk about
 

2527
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,589
we'll maybe you could talk about
what your vision your dream is on in uh

2528
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
what your vision your dream is on in uh
 

2529
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,190
what your vision your dream is on in uh
in terms of like food in terms of where

2530
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,200
in terms of like food in terms of where
 

2531
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,630
in terms of like food in terms of where
food comes from

2532
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
food comes from
 

2533
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,030
food comes from
where meat comes from but food broadly

2534
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
where meat comes from but food broadly
 

2535
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,390
where meat comes from but food broadly
and how that affects

2536
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
and how that affects
 

2537
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,030
and how that affects
the entirety of the the culinary journey

2538
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
the entirety of the the culinary journey
 

2539
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,950
the entirety of the the culinary journey
on the question of where does it come

2540
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
on the question of where does it come
 

2541
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,470
on the question of where does it come
from and does that matter

2542
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
from and does that matter
 

2543
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,190
from and does that matter
i'd say though the way that meat is

2544
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
i'd say though the way that meat is
 

2545
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,150
i'd say though the way that meat is
raised is

2546
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
raised is
 

2547
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,390
raised is
massively important for flavor and for

2548
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
massively important for flavor and for
 

2549
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,829
massively important for flavor and for
how it cooks

2550
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
how it cooks
 

2551
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,030
how it cooks
um i think most

2552
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
um i think most
 

2553
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,310
um i think most

corn fed that's the
 

2557
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,430
corn fed that's the
first moment where they realize that

2558
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
first moment where they realize that
 

2559
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,109
first moment where they realize that
right where corn fed

2560
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
right where corn fed
 

2561
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,430

musculature and fiber to it

2588
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
musculature and fiber to it
 

2589
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,950
musculature and fiber to it
than fast-growing poultry that's

2590
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
than fast-growing poultry that's
 

2591
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,230
than fast-growing poultry that's
confinement animals it's just

2592
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
confinement animals it's just
 

2593
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,910
confinement animals it's just
it has to do with the way that the

2594
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
it has to do with the way that the
 

2595
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,670
it has to do with the way that the
muscles are built they tend to be

2596
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
muscles are built they tend to be
 

2597
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,390
muscles are built they tend to be
finer and thinner and more tender and a

2598
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
finer and thinner and more tender and a
 

2599
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,470
finer and thinner and more tender and a
little bit more susceptible to heat so

2600
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
little bit more susceptible to heat so
 

2601
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,790
little bit more susceptible to heat so
they the character of the meat's

2602
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
they the character of the meat's
 

2603
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,069
they the character of the meat's
radically different

2604
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:32,079
radically different
 

2605
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,150
radically different
it's also much more flavorful when it's

2606
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,160
it's also much more flavorful when it's
 

2607
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,510
it's also much more flavorful when it's
grown more naturally

2608
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:35,520
grown more naturally
 

2609
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,630
grown more naturally
and i think some of the the reliance in

2610
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
and i think some of the the reliance in
 

2611
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,309
and i think some of the the reliance in
the u.s on like

2612
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
the u.s on like
 

2613
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,550
the u.s on like
sugary sauces and lots of salts and

2614
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
sugary sauces and lots of salts and
 

2615
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,349
sugary sauces and lots of salts and
flavors and things like that's actually

2616
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
flavors and things like that's actually
 

2617
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,030
flavors and things like that's actually
based on having the broadly available

2618
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
based on having the broadly available
 

2619
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,510
based on having the broadly available
meat out there is pretty low on flavor

2620
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
meat out there is pretty low on flavor
 

2621
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,069
meat out there is pretty low on flavor
and so we're

2622
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
and so we're
 

2623
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,230
and so we're
adding in a lot to compensate for that

2624
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
adding in a lot to compensate for that
 

2625
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,510
adding in a lot to compensate for that
so to your point of like

2626
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
so to your point of like
 

2627
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,030
so to your point of like
enjoying things very simply and and

2628
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
enjoying things very simply and and
 

2629
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,990
enjoying things very simply and and
with like salt and nothing else like the

2630
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,000
with like salt and nothing else like the
 

2631
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,829
with like salt and nothing else like the
more flavorful that product is i think

2632
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
more flavorful that product is i think
 

2633
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,309
more flavorful that product is i think
the more

2634
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
the more
 

2635
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,630
the more
people will find that enjoyable let's

2636
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
people will find that enjoyable let's
 

2637
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,069
people will find that enjoyable let's
paint a vision

2638
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
paint a vision
 

2639
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,910
paint a vision
i mean you're a visionary you have you

2640
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:09,920
i mean you're a visionary you have you
 

2641
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,309
i mean you're a visionary you have you
have a vision to have

2642
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
have a vision to have
 

2643
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,510
have a vision to have
basically meat in every store that comes

2644
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:15,520
basically meat in every store that comes
 

2645
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,190
basically meat in every store that comes
from a a farm like belcampo

2646
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
from a a farm like belcampo
 

2647
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,710
from a a farm like belcampo
that's uh that's basically doing

2648
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
that's uh that's basically doing
 

2649
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,230
that's uh that's basically doing
regenerative farming

2650
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
regenerative farming
 

2651
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,349
regenerative farming
how do we get there it's about

2652
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:25,359
how do we get there it's about
 

2653
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,670
how do we get there it's about
a network of smaller producers working

2654
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
a network of smaller producers working
 

2655
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,190
a network of smaller producers working
together with

2656
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
together with
 

2657
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,829
together with
shared values and

2658
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:32,839
shared values and
 

2659
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,750
shared values and
it's true that there's a limit on

2660
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
it's true that there's a limit on
 

2661
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,870
it's true that there's a limit on
regenerative farming

2662
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
regenerative farming
 

2663
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,790
regenerative farming
in that it requires more human knowledge

2664
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:40,800
in that it requires more human knowledge
 

2665
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,829
in that it requires more human knowledge
so regenerative farming is

2666
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
so regenerative farming is
 

2667
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,829
so regenerative farming is
more difficult to scale in a single

2668
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
more difficult to scale in a single
 

2669
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,829
more difficult to scale in a single
operation it'd be really challenging to

2670
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:47,839
operation it'd be really challenging to
 

2671
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,109
operation it'd be really challenging to
have a regenerative farm that was like

2672
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,119
have a regenerative farm that was like
 

2673
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,870
have a regenerative farm that was like
200 000 acres

2674
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
200 000 acres
 

2675
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,109
200 000 acres
because of the amount of manpower needed

2676
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
because of the amount of manpower needed
 

2677
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,069
because of the amount of manpower needed
to pay attention

2678
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
to pay attention
 

2679
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,670
to pay attention
can you first and i apologize to

2680
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
can you first and i apologize to
 

2681
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,430
can you first and i apologize to
interrupt but can you

2682
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
interrupt but can you
 

2683
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,470
interrupt but can you
say what is regenerative farming sure

2684
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
say what is regenerative farming sure
 

2685
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,829
say what is regenerative farming sure
so they if you're looking at scaling

2686
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
so they if you're looking at scaling
 

2687
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,870
so they if you're looking at scaling
regenerative

2688

regenerative farming is how we used to

2694
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
regenerative farming is how we used to
 

2695
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,870
regenerative farming is how we used to

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
we used to farm with an eye towards the
 

2699
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,510
we used to farm with an eye towards the
long term

2700
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
long term

you might be on the friedman farm

2702
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
you might be on the friedman farm
 

2703
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,190
you might be on the friedman farm
thinking about your heirs

2704
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
thinking about your heirs

five generations from now farming that

2706
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
five generations from now farming that
 

2707
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,030
five generations from now farming that
same land

00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
same land
 

2709
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,630
same land
are you going to leave that land

2710
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:26,640
are you going to leave that land
 

2711
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,550
are you going to leave that land
nutritionally empty

2712

nutritionally empty
 

2713
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,910
nutritionally empty
no okay it's a long-term thinking also

2714
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
no okay it's a long-term thinking also
 

2715
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,550
no okay it's a long-term thinking also
in traditional ag you don't have inputs

2716
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
in traditional ag you don't have inputs
 

2717
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,990
in traditional ag you don't have inputs
that are very convenient

2718
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
that are very convenient
 

2719
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,069
that are very convenient
you can put some chicken manure on but

2720
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
you can put some chicken manure on but
 

2721
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,349
you can put some chicken manure on but
you can't

2722
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
you can't
 

2723
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,309
you can't
spray or dump something that massively

2724
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
spray or dump something that massively
 

2725
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,510
spray or dump something that massively
increases

2726
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
increases
 

2727
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,510
increases
the growing potential of the land

2728
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520

 

2729
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,230

so regenerative agriculture is

2734
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
so regenerative agriculture is
 

2735
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,589
so regenerative agriculture is
an approach to farming where you're

2736
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
an approach to farming where you're
 

2737
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,589
an approach to farming where you're
increasing soil fertility

2738
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599
increasing soil fertility
 

2739
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,870
increasing soil fertility
through your farming you increase soil

2740
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
through your farming you increase soil
 

2741
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,990
through your farming you increase soil
fertility

2742
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
fertility
 

2743
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,589
fertility
by feeding the soil you feed the soil

2744
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
by feeding the soil you feed the soil
 

2745
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,790
by feeding the soil you feed the soil
through carbon that's why regenerative

2746
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
through carbon that's why regenerative
 

2747
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,150
through carbon that's why regenerative
farming is better for the environment

2748
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
farming is better for the environment
 

2749
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,470
farming is better for the environment
it sequesters carbon and puts carbon

2750
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:14,480
it sequesters carbon and puts carbon
 

2751
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,390
it sequesters carbon and puts carbon
into the soil

2752
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
into the soil
 

2753
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,589
into the soil
now it's interesting plants

2754
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
now it's interesting plants
 

2755
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,990
now it's interesting plants
need carbon and put it into the soil

2756
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,000
need carbon and put it into the soil
 

2757
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,870
need carbon and put it into the soil
when they're going through growth

2758
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:24,880
when they're going through growth
 

2759
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,550
when they're going through growth
so if you have a beautiful field of

2760
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
so if you have a beautiful field of
 

2761
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,470
so if you have a beautiful field of
grass that's just waving in the wind

2762
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:28,480
grass that's just waving in the wind
 

2763
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,470
grass that's just waving in the wind
that's not sequestering as much carbon

2764
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,480
that's not sequestering as much carbon
 

2765
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,470
that's not sequestering as much carbon
as plants that have been damaged

2766
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
as plants that have been damaged
 

2767
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,030
as plants that have been damaged
and are regrowing plants that have been

2768
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
and are regrowing plants that have been
 

2769
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,309
and are regrowing plants that have been
damaged and are re-growing

2770
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
damaged and are re-growing
 

2771
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,109
damaged and are re-growing
are repairing and they're doing that by

2772
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
are repairing and they're doing that by
 

2773
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,710
are repairing and they're doing that by
drawing down carbon as one of the

2774
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
drawing down carbon as one of the
 

2775
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,950
drawing down carbon as one of the
nutrients that feeds them

2776
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
nutrients that feeds them
 

2777
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,430
nutrients that feeds them
to damage the plants effectively that's

2778
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:45,440
to damage the plants effectively that's
 

2779
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,030
to damage the plants effectively that's
what we're doing with regenerative

2780
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
what we're doing with regenerative
 

2781
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,190
what we're doing with regenerative
grazing

2782
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
grazing
 

2783
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,790
grazing
so the cows or you know lambs whatever

2784
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
so the cows or you know lambs whatever
 

2785
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,910
so the cows or you know lambs whatever
out there they're eating and taking

2786
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
out there they're eating and taking
 

2787
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,470
out there they're eating and taking
the grass down and that then cause a

2788
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
the grass down and that then cause a
 

2789
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,430
the grass down and that then cause a
regrowth cycle

2790
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
regrowth cycle
 

2791
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,829
regrowth cycle
that sequesters carbon wow there's a

2792
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:01,839
that sequesters carbon wow there's a
 

2793
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,190
that sequesters carbon wow there's a
limit to it there's an edge

2794
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
limit to it there's an edge
 

2795
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,589
limit to it there's an edge
because if those plants are so damaged

2796
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
because if those plants are so damaged
 

2797
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,950
because if those plants are so damaged
that they can't regrow

2798
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:06,960
that they can't regrow
 

2799
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,550
that they can't regrow
then it turns into a dirt patch and that

2800
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
then it turns into a dirt patch and that
 

2801
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,990
then it turns into a dirt patch and that
doesn't sequester any carbon

2802
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,000
doesn't sequester any carbon
 

2803
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,829
doesn't sequester any carbon
so it's a balance how do you find that

2804
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
so it's a balance how do you find that
 

2805
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,270
so it's a balance how do you find that
uh balance so

2806
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
uh balance so
 

2807
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,670
uh balance so
that has to do with like the frequency

2808
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
that has to do with like the frequency
 

2809
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,750
that has to do with like the frequency
and the scale the grazing essentially

2810
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:17,760
and the scale the grazing essentially
 

2811
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,150
and the scale the grazing essentially
exactly and so you have to find the

2812
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
exactly and so you have to find the
 

2813
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,670
exactly and so you have to find the
right balance and that that connects to

2814
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:21,680
right balance and that that connects to
 

2815
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,470
right balance and that that connects to
the

2816
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
the
 

2817
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,030
the
both the the grass i mean is is the

2818
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
both the the grass i mean is is the
 

2819
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,990
both the the grass i mean is is the
ultimately

2820
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,000
ultimately
 

2821
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,710
ultimately
the focus here is that the life cycle of

2822
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
the focus here is that the life cycle of
 

2823
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,829
the focus here is that the life cycle of
whatever is grazing

2824
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
whatever is grazing
 

2825
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,550
whatever is grazing
whether it's cows or lambs or so on

2826
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,560
whether it's cows or lambs or so on
 

2827
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,630
whether it's cows or lambs or so on
that's why the scalability question so

2828
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
that's why the scalability question so
 

2829
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,670
that's why the scalability question so
all that stuff that i

2830
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
all that stuff that i
 

2831
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,829
all that stuff that i
just talked about like think about all

2832
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
just talked about like think about all
 

2833
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,790
just talked about like think about all
the actions

2834
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
the actions
 

2835
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,230
the actions
that that requires somebody's out there

2836
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,240
that that requires somebody's out there
 

2837
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,390
that that requires somebody's out there
looking and paying attention

2838
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
looking and paying attention
 

2839
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,430
looking and paying attention
and understanding how far the grass is

2840
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
and understanding how far the grass is
 

2841
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,710
and understanding how far the grass is
remembering what happened in that field

2842
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,720
remembering what happened in that field
 

2843
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,750
remembering what happened in that field
last year

2844
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
last year
 

2845
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,230
last year
there's a huge human intelligence need

2846
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
there's a huge human intelligence need
 

2847
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,750
there's a huge human intelligence need
and human

2848
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
and human
 

2849
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,670
and human
kind of availability of attention

2850
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:55,680
kind of availability of attention
 

2851
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,309
kind of availability of attention
now industrial farming has done a great

2852
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
now industrial farming has done a great
 

2853
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,829
now industrial farming has done a great
job at de-skilling

2854
00:44:59,829 --> 00:44:59,839
job at de-skilling
 

2855
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,950
job at de-skilling
agriculture

2856
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960

 

2857
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,870

industrial farming has taken agriculture

2858
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
industrial farming has taken agriculture
 

2859
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,069
industrial farming has taken agriculture
from being art science to being

2860
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:08,079
from being art science to being
 

2861
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,430
from being art science to being
entry-level employment yeah

2862
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
entry-level employment yeah
 

2863
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,589
entry-level employment yeah
so that's the limiting factor on regen

2864
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
so that's the limiting factor on regen
 

2865
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,030
so that's the limiting factor on regen
and that's why i think the human

2866
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,040
and that's why i think the human
 

2867
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,630
and that's why i think the human
intelligence piece exactly

2868
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
intelligence piece exactly
 

2869
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,470
intelligence piece exactly
i gotta ask uh i don't know if you think

2870
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
i gotta ask uh i don't know if you think
 

2871
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,829
i gotta ask uh i don't know if you think
about this kind of stuff i mentioned to

2872
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
about this kind of stuff i mentioned to
 

2873
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,430
about this kind of stuff i mentioned to
you offline that i spent

2874

you offline that i spent
 

2875
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,109
you offline that i spent
a bit of time with some robots and

a bit of time with some robots and
 

2877
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,790
a bit of time with some robots and
boston dynamics do you think there's a

2878
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:24,800
boston dynamics do you think there's a
 

2879
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,710
boston dynamics do you think there's a
way to use artificial intelligence to

is there a way if ai can help do you

2898
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
is there a way if ai can help do you
 

2899

is there a way if ai can help do you
think i totally

2900
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
think i totally
 

2901
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,870
think i totally
i mean that's that's that would be

2902
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
i mean that's that's that would be
 

2903
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,550
i mean that's that's that would be
incredible that's one of the

incredible that's one of the
 

2905
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,750
incredible that's one of the
ingredients that could help with the

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,670
that could completely be automated
as well in order to supplement and work

2914
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
as well in order to supplement and work
 

2915
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,990
as well in order to supplement and work
with somebody like a farmer in managing

2916
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
with somebody like a farmer in managing
 

2917
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,470
with somebody like a farmer in managing
it

2918
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:58,480
it
 

2919
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,109
it
about the the the performance on land

2920
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
about the the the performance on land
 

2921
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,470
about the the the performance on land
and a bit of that's being done right now

2922
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
and a bit of that's being done right now
 

2923
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,030
and a bit of that's being done right now
with some

2924
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
with some
 

2925
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,910
with some
aerial mapping and but that type of ai

2926
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
aerial mapping and but that type of ai
 

2927
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,470
aerial mapping and but that type of ai
would be

2928
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,480
would be
 

2929
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,790
would be
huge in this i mean there's estimates

2930
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
huge in this i mean there's estimates
 

2931
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,589
huge in this i mean there's estimates
that if

2932
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:09,599
that if
 

2933
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,710
that if
the um damage and underutilized range

2934
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
the um damage and underutilized range
 

2935
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,430
the um damage and underutilized range
land

2936
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
land
 

2937
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,790
land
in the world was converted to

2938
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
in the world was converted to
 

2939
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,069
in the world was converted to
regenerative agriculture at somewhere

2940
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:16,079
regenerative agriculture at somewhere
 

2941
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:16,710
regenerative agriculture at somewhere
between

2942
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
between
 

2943
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,790
between
like 20 and 40 percent of the world's

2944
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
like 20 and 40 percent of the world's
 

2945
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,470
like 20 and 40 percent of the world's
carbon could be sequestered

2946
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:20,480
carbon could be sequestered
 

2947
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,950
carbon could be sequestered
so there's a huge potential the problem

2948
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
so there's a huge potential the problem
 

2949
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,829
so there's a huge potential the problem
is

2950
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:23,839
is
 

2951
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,589
is
cultural we've

2952
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
cultural we've
 

2953
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,190
cultural we've
like lost the generational threat of

2954
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
like lost the generational threat of
 

2955
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,870
like lost the generational threat of
knowledge about how to do this it's kind

2956
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:30,880
knowledge about how to do this it's kind
 

2957
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,069
knowledge about how to do this it's kind
of been two generations that haven't

2958
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
of been two generations that haven't
 

2959
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,069
of been two generations that haven't
farmed this way

2960
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
farmed this way
 

2961
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,430
farmed this way
also the science around it is

2962
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
also the science around it is
 

2963
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,550
also the science around it is
limited by the scale and longevity so

2964
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560
limited by the scale and longevity so
 

2965
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,270
limited by the scale and longevity so
the data

2966
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
the data
 

2967
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,950
the data
collection around regenerative farming

2968
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
collection around regenerative farming
 

2969
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,710
collection around regenerative farming
is also limited by the fact it's kind of

2970
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,720
is also limited by the fact it's kind of
 

2971
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,829
is also limited by the fact it's kind of
piecemeal

2972
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
piecemeal
 

2973
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,670
piecemeal
there's small operations that are doing

2974
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,680
there's small operations that are doing
 

2975
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,270
there's small operations that are doing
it they're learning and developing as

2976
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
it they're learning and developing as
 

2977
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,990
it they're learning and developing as
they go

2978
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
they go
 

2979
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,589
they go
and they haven't been documenting it and

2980
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
and they haven't been documenting it and
 

2981
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,349
and they haven't been documenting it and
doing it for too long

2982
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
doing it for too long
 

2983
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,829
doing it for too long
is the ethical treatment of animals a

2984
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
is the ethical treatment of animals a
 

2985
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,030
is the ethical treatment of animals a
part of

2986
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,040
part of
 

2987
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,230
part of
regenerative farming so in

2988
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
regenerative farming so in
 

2989
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,670
regenerative farming so in
the way you do things about campo that's

2990
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
the way you do things about campo that's
 

2991
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,430
the way you do things about campo that's
a huge part

2992
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
a huge part
 

2993
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,270
a huge part
uh is that necessarily part of the life

2994
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
uh is that necessarily part of the life
 

2995
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,870
uh is that necessarily part of the life
cycle so like the things that you're

2996
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
cycle so like the things that you're
 

2997
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,990
cycle so like the things that you're
trying to measure

2998
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
trying to measure
 

2999
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,589
trying to measure
is like uh like the way

3000
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
is like uh like the way
 

3001
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,829
is like uh like the way
like like not damaging the land too much

3002
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:13,839
like like not damaging the land too much
 

3003
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,950
like like not damaging the land too much
make sure

3004
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:14,960
make sure
 

3005
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,710
make sure
that the sort of the land is constantly

3006
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:16,720
that the sort of the land is constantly
 

3007
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,990
that the sort of the land is constantly
healthy and producing

3008
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,000
healthy and producing
 

3009
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,109
healthy and producing
and then the grazing process and also

3010
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,119
and then the grazing process and also
 

3011
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,230
and then the grazing process and also
the carbon piece

3012
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
the carbon piece
 

3013
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,230
the carbon piece
the the fact that it's like carbon

3014
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,240
the the fact that it's like carbon
 

3015
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,589
the the fact that it's like carbon
neutral or something like that

3016
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
neutral or something like that
 

3017
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,510
neutral or something like that
i mean are all those pieces of the

3018
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
i mean are all those pieces of the
 

3019
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,630
i mean are all those pieces of the
regenerative farming

3020
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
regenerative farming
 

3021
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,270
regenerative farming
or is this an extra part to your vision

3022
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
or is this an extra part to your vision
 

3023
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,390
or is this an extra part to your vision
that you're thinking about it's all

3024
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:32,400
that you're thinking about it's all
 

3025
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,750
that you're thinking about it's all
implicit and regenerative

3026
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
implicit and regenerative
 

3027
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,829
implicit and regenerative
yeah i call it out separately because we

3028
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
yeah i call it out separately because we
 

3029
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,030
yeah i call it out separately because we
are certified humane

3030
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040
are certified humane
 

3031
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,710
are certified humane
right which is another layer of welfare

3032
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
right which is another layer of welfare
 

3033
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,150
right which is another layer of welfare
that has to do with density and a couple

3034
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
that has to do with density and a couple
 

3035
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,430
that has to do with density and a couple
other things

3036
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
other things
 

3037
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,990
other things
but regenerative i mean think about if

3038
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000
but regenerative i mean think about if
 

3039
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,950
but regenerative i mean think about if
you're a cow and you're in a

3040
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:44,960
you're a cow and you're in a
 

3041
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,790
you're a cow and you're in a
regenerative operation where

3042
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
regenerative operation where
 

3043
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,950
regenerative operation where
the whole life cycle of the pasture

3044
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
the whole life cycle of the pasture
 

3045
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,030
the whole life cycle of the pasture
means that you only eat the top six

3046
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
means that you only eat the top six
 

3047
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,390
means that you only eat the top six
inches of the grass

3048
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
inches of the grass
 

3049
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,750
inches of the grass
and then when there's whatever a couple

3050
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
and then when there's whatever a couple
 

3051
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,150
and then when there's whatever a couple
inches left then that feels left dormant

3052
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
inches left then that feels left dormant
 

3053
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,309
inches left then that feels left dormant
that's a better experience right okay so

3054
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
that's a better experience right okay so
 

3055
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,510
that's a better experience right okay so
just think about it kind of functionally

3056
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
just think about it kind of functionally
 

3057
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,349
just think about it kind of functionally
that way well grazing period is a better

3058
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
that way well grazing period is a better
 

3059
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,230
that way well grazing period is a better
experience right

3060
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
experience right
 

3061
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,109
experience right
yeah and that's that's not what's done

3062
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
yeah and that's that's not what's done
 

3063
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,630
yeah and that's that's not what's done
in i mean that's the grass-fed

3064
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
in i mean that's the grass-fed
 

3065
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,470
in i mean that's the grass-fed
piece that's the other piece with you

3066
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
piece that's the other piece with you
 

3067
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,670
piece that's the other piece with you
know

3068
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
know
 

3069
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,870
know
certified organics amazing there's

3070
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
certified organics amazing there's
 

3071
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,750
certified organics amazing there's
you know there's plenty of

3072
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
you know there's plenty of
 

3073
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,750
you know there's plenty of
certifications that you know grass-fed

3074
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
certifications that you know grass-fed
 

3075
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,030
certifications that you know grass-fed

that's their impacts also incorporate in
 

3181
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,829
that's their impacts also incorporate in
that i mean first of all that's

3182

that i mean first of all that's
 

3183
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,710
that i mean first of all that's
incredible

3184

incredible
 

3185
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,069
incredible
and second of all is that possible to

3186
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
and second of all is that possible to
 

3187
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,390
and second of all is that possible to

it isn't i mean it's it's complex to

3190
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
it isn't i mean it's it's complex to
 

3191
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,470
it isn't i mean it's it's complex to

3192
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
scale
 

3193
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,150

but i mean we're putting people on the

3194
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
but i mean we're putting people on the
 

3195
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,710
but i mean we're putting people on the
moon and you have a robotic dog

3196
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:04,720
moon and you have a robotic dog
 

3197
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,670
moon and you have a robotic dog
i mean but those are that's more that's

3198
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
i mean but those are that's more that's
 

3199
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,109
i mean but those are that's more that's
less about scale that's more about

3200
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
less about scale that's more about
 

3201
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:09,750
less about scale that's more about
innovation

innovation
 

3203
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,309
innovation
so like in many ways what belcamp has

3204
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
so like in many ways what belcamp has
 

3205
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,510
so like in many ways what belcamp has
done is innovative

3206
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
done is innovative
 

3207
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,109
done is innovative
at a small scale the question is whether

3208
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:15,119
at a small scale the question is whether
 

3209
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,549
at a small scale the question is whether
that innovation could be scaled that's

3210
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
that innovation could be scaled that's
 

3211
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,589
that innovation could be scaled that's
where i feel like

3212

00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:44,720
you know
 

3239
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,990
you know
plant-based solutions and

3240
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
plant-based solutions and
 

3241
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,910
plant-based solutions and
i am saying there's a way to make meat

3242
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
i am saying there's a way to make meat
 

3243
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,390
i am saying there's a way to make meat
this a part of the solution

3244
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
this a part of the solution
 

3245
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,470
this a part of the solution
and it's going to mean eating less of it

3246
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
and it's going to mean eating less of it
 

3247
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,990
and it's going to mean eating less of it
it's going to mean paying more for it

3248
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
it's going to mean paying more for it
 

3249
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,030
it's going to mean paying more for it
it's going to mean that the farming

3250
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
it's going to mean that the farming
 

3251
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,870
it's going to mean that the farming
systems are more complicated

3252
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
systems are more complicated
 

3253
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,030
systems are more complicated
it's not the easiest path but i think in

3254
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
it's not the easiest path but i think in
 

3255
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,030
it's not the easiest path but i think in
the long term it's the better path

3256
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,040
the long term it's the better path
 

3257
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,190
the long term it's the better path
and it's also better for human health

3258
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
and it's also better for human health
 

3259
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,109
and it's also better for human health
can you comment on the certified humane

3260
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:07,119
can you comment on the certified humane
 

3261
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,030
can you comment on the certified humane
piece so how do you run a farm

3262
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
piece so how do you run a farm
 

3263
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,870
piece so how do you run a farm
like what does it mean to raise an

3264
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,880
like what does it mean to raise an
 

3265
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,390
like what does it mean to raise an
animal from

3266
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
animal from
 

3267
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,150
animal from
the beginning of its life to the end of

3268
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
the beginning of its life to the end of
 

3269
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,150
the beginning of its life to the end of
its life in a way that's ethical that's

3270
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:18,160
its life in a way that's ethical that's
 

3271
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:18,870
its life in a way that's ethical that's
humane

3272
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:18,880
humane
 

3273
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,910
humane
i think the first piece you need to just

3274
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
i think the first piece you need to just
 

3275
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,990
i think the first piece you need to just
be comfortable with is that

3276
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
be comfortable with is that
 

3277
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,430
be comfortable with is that
making an animal into meat you know is

3278
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,440
making an animal into meat you know is
 

3279
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,470
making an animal into meat you know is
is something you're comfortable with

3280
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:28,480
is something you're comfortable with
 

3281
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,750
is something you're comfortable with
because i think that's the biggest

3282
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
because i think that's the biggest
 

3283
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,710
because i think that's the biggest
question right

3284
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:30,720
question right
 

3285
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,790
question right
and so certified humane actually goes

3286
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
and so certified humane actually goes
 

3287
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,069
and so certified humane actually goes
all the way through

3288
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:34,079
all the way through
 

3289
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,910
all the way through
the death of the animal how it's killed

3290
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:35,920
the death of the animal how it's killed
 

3291
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,430
the death of the animal how it's killed
and handled that at processing

3292
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
and handled that at processing
 

3293
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,589
and handled that at processing
so i put that out there just to say well

3294
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
so i put that out there just to say well
 

3295
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,109
so i put that out there just to say well
that's you know this is all about

3296
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:41,119
that's you know this is all about
 

3297
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,470
that's you know this is all about
producing an animal

3298
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:42,480
producing an animal
 

3299
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,190
producing an animal
to die for me that's not necessarily

3300
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
to die for me that's not necessarily
 

3301
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,309
to die for me that's not necessarily
that's something people struggle with

3302
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:46,319
that's something people struggle with
 

3303
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,829
that's something people struggle with
with the word humane and i understand

3304
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
with the word humane and i understand
 

3305
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,510
with the word humane and i understand
that like i have space and empathy for

3306
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,520
that like i have space and empathy for
 

3307
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,589
that like i have space and empathy for
that it's a it's a complicated decision

3308
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
that it's a it's a complicated decision
 

3309
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,710
that it's a it's a complicated decision
and when you have to be comfortable with

3310
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
and when you have to be comfortable with
 

3311
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,630
and when you have to be comfortable with
at the outset to say this is an animal

3312
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
at the outset to say this is an animal
 

3313
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,150
at the outset to say this is an animal
it's going to die to feed me

3314
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
it's going to die to feed me
 

3315
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,150
it's going to die to feed me
yeah so we should pause on that because

3316
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,160
yeah so we should pause on that because
 

3317
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,750
yeah so we should pause on that because
i actually just uh

3318
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
i actually just uh
 

3319
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,069
i actually just uh
the two days ago read a paper that

3320
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
the two days ago read a paper that
 

3321
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,510
the two days ago read a paper that
argued that

3322
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,520
argued that
 

3323
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,349
argued that
you know the killing of an animal period

3324
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
you know the killing of an animal period
 

3325
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,750
you know the killing of an animal period
cannot be humane so it's impossible

3326
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:07,760
cannot be humane so it's impossible
 

3327
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,510
cannot be humane so it's impossible
and so and that's an argument just like

3328
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
and so and that's an argument just like
 

3329
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,870
and so and that's an argument just like
you're saying

3330
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
you're saying
 

3331
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,430
you're saying
we could make but if we now on the table

3332
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,440
we could make but if we now on the table
 

3333
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,670
we could make but if we now on the table
kind of

3334
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680
kind of
 

3335
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,309
kind of
take as a starting point the idea that

3336
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
take as a starting point the idea that
 

3337
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,630
take as a starting point the idea that
it's possible to kill an animal for food

3338
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:22,640
it's possible to kill an animal for food
 

3339
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,829
it's possible to kill an animal for food
in an ethical way

3340
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:23,839
in an ethical way
 

3341
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,829
in an ethical way
if we take that as a starting point so

3342
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
if we take that as a starting point so
 

3343
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,270
if we take that as a starting point so
we won't argue about that

3344
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
we won't argue about that
 

3345
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,349
we won't argue about that
it is worth arguing about it elsewhere

3346
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:29,359
it is worth arguing about it elsewhere
 

3347
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,470
it is worth arguing about it elsewhere
and it probably will

3348
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
and it probably will
 

3349
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,230
and it probably will
i will probably talk to a few vegan

3350
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
i will probably talk to a few vegan
 

3351
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,510
i will probably talk to a few vegan
folks and

3352
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
folks and
 

3353
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,190
folks and
we'll talk about the vegan diet i'm

3354
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
we'll talk about the vegan diet i'm
 

3355
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,109
we'll talk about the vegan diet i'm
fascinated by it as well so i'm torn in

3356
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
fascinated by it as well so i'm torn in
 

3357
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:37,750
fascinated by it as well so i'm torn in
the whole thing

3358
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
the whole thing
 

3359
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,670
the whole thing
but if we just take that as a starting

3360
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
but if we just take that as a starting
 

3361
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,030
but if we just take that as a starting
point

3362
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
point
 

3363
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,069
point
what then is an ethical humane way to

3364
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
what then is an ethical humane way to
 

3365
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,190
what then is an ethical humane way to
treat an animal

3366
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,200
treat an animal
 

3367
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,589
treat an animal
i look at ethical humane animal

3368
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
i look at ethical humane animal
 

3369
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,190
i look at ethical humane animal
treatment as

3370
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
treatment as
 

3371
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,390
treatment as
the major phases of life so

3372
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
the major phases of life so
 

3373
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,030
the major phases of life so
um conception birth and mothering

3374
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,040
um conception birth and mothering
 

3375
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,670
um conception birth and mothering
diet those are kind of the major touch

3376
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
diet those are kind of the major touch
 

3377
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,870
diet those are kind of the major touch
points of life

3378
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
points of life
 

3379
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,910
points of life
so what we're

3380
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
so what we're
 

3381
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,589
so what we're
looking at is evolutionary approach

3382
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
looking at is evolutionary approach
 

3383
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,670
looking at is evolutionary approach
which means is the animal eating what it

3384
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
which means is the animal eating what it
 

3385
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,230
which means is the animal eating what it
evolved to eat primarily

3386
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
evolved to eat primarily
 

3387
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,349
evolved to eat primarily
is the animal primarily outdoors

3388
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
is the animal primarily outdoors
 

3389
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,990
is the animal primarily outdoors
which is how all animals evolved um

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
which is how all animals evolved um

3398
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
can't have
 

3399
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,910
can't have
animals fully outdoors like here on our

3400
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
animals fully outdoors like here on our
 

3401
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,109
animals fully outdoors like here on our
ranch we

3402
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
ranch we
 

3403
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,030
ranch we
um have had issues with like you know

3404
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
um have had issues with like you know
 

3405
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,230
um have had issues with like you know
cold weather and things

3406
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
cold weather and things
 

3407
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,309
cold weather and things
but um so if you have if you have you

3408
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:30,319
but um so if you have if you have you
 

3409
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,910
but um so if you have if you have you
know appropriate weather conditions does

3410
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
know appropriate weather conditions does
 

3411
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,030
know appropriate weather conditions does
animal outdoors

3412
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,040
animal outdoors
 

3413
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,430
animal outdoors
um is the animal able to nurture and

3414
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,440
um is the animal able to nurture and
 

3415
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,630
um is the animal able to nurture and
engage with its young

3416
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
engage with its young
 

3417
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,309
engage with its young
um those are the kind of key touch

3418
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
um those are the kind of key touch
 

3419
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,829
um those are the kind of key touch
points but it's really the

3420
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
points but it's really the
 

3421
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,030
points but it's really the
the birth of it let me start this one

3422
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040
the birth of it let me start this one
 

3423
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,430
the birth of it let me start this one
from the scratch um

3424
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
from the scratch um
 

3425
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,829
from the scratch um
okay so when i'm looking at when i when

3426
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
okay so when i'm looking at when i when
 

3427
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,589
okay so when i'm looking at when i when
i consider what's humane setting aside

3428
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
i consider what's humane setting aside
 

3429
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,790
i consider what's humane setting aside
the death part

3430
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
the death part
 

3431
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,390
the death part
i look at the evolutionary diet

3432
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
i look at the evolutionary diet
 

3433
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,390
i look at the evolutionary diet
access to the outdoors and ideally

3434
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
access to the outdoors and ideally
 

3435
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,910
access to the outdoors and ideally
spending the majority of its life

3436
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
spending the majority of its life
 

3437
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,430
spending the majority of its life
outdoors

3438
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
outdoors
 

3439
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,030
outdoors
low density so animals spread out

3440
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
low density so animals spread out
 

3441
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,150
low density so animals spread out
and um engagement with young

3442
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,160
and um engagement with young
 

3443
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,750
and um engagement with young
social interactions and that's all kind

3444
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
social interactions and that's all kind
 

3445
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,430
social interactions and that's all kind
of social interaction is a cool one

3446
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
of social interaction is a cool one
 

3447
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,349
of social interaction is a cool one
i mean i also read an article that like

3448
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359
i mean i also read an article that like
 

3449
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,510
i mean i also read an article that like
they're that like cows for example

3450
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:13,520
they're that like cows for example
 

3451
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,950
they're that like cows for example
have social like they have friends yeah

3452
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:16,960
have social like they have friends yeah
 

3453
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,349
have social like they have friends yeah
yeah that's fascinating i mean that

3454
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
yeah that's fascinating i mean that
 

3455
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,470
yeah that's fascinating i mean that
piece with a young

3456
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
piece with a young
 

3457
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,829
piece with a young
social interaction with young social

3458
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
social interaction with young social
 

3459
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,510
social interaction with young social
interaction with each other

3460
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
interaction with each other
 

3461
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,750
interaction with each other
that uh at a basic level i'm sure that

3462
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
that uh at a basic level i'm sure that
 

3463
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,990
that uh at a basic level i'm sure that
interaction is not as rich as humans

3464
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
interaction is not as rich as humans
 

3465
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,589
interaction is not as rich as humans
but they're that that piece seems to be

3466
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
but they're that that piece seems to be
 

3467
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,510
but they're that that piece seems to be
part of the humane picture

3468
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
part of the humane picture
 

3469
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,510
part of the humane picture
and you said also just a quick comment

3470
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
and you said also just a quick comment
 

3471
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,549
and you said also just a quick comment
uh

3472
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
uh
 

3473
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,510
uh
evolutionary diet meaning the diet that

3474
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
evolutionary diet meaning the diet that
 

3475
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,789
evolutionary diet meaning the diet that
they were evolved

3476
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:38,799
they were evolved
 

3477
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,910
they were evolved
to have and that's pretty simple you can

3478
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:41,920
to have and that's pretty simple you can
 

3479
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,829
to have and that's pretty simple you can
look at the physiology of the animal

3480
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:43,839
look at the physiology of the animal
 

3481
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,390
look at the physiology of the animal
and figure that out so ruminant species

3482
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
and figure that out so ruminant species
 

3483
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,030
and figure that out so ruminant species
are

3484
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
are
 

3485
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,750
are
lamb goats and beef and they have five

3488
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
stomachs
 

3489
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,349
stomachs
there they evolved eating really low

3490
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:53,359
there they evolved eating really low
 

3491
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:53,990
there they evolved eating really low

3493
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,589
calorie
high fiber foods that's why they've got

3494
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
high fiber foods that's why they've got
 

3495
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,270
high fiber foods that's why they've got
all the stomachs they need a lot of

3496
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,280
all the stomachs they need a lot of
 

3497
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,390
all the stomachs they need a lot of

were to eat grass die in a week right we

3500
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:00,720
were to eat grass die in a week right we
 

3501
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,390
were to eat grass die in a week right we
our physiology can't handle it

3502
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
our physiology can't handle it
 

3503
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,870
our physiology can't handle it
cows were built and evolved to eat this

3504
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
cows were built and evolved to eat this
 

3505
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,870
cows were built and evolved to eat this
very low calorie very high fiber very

low density food
and they walk around slowly they're

3510
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:10,720
and they walk around slowly they're
 

3511
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,270
and they walk around slowly they're
moving constantly and they're eating it

3512

moving constantly and they're eating it
 

3513
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,589
moving constantly and they're eating it
when we put them on a corn fed diet

3514
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
when we put them on a corn fed diet
 

3515
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,630
when we put them on a corn fed diet
that's the opposite of their

3516
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
that's the opposite of their
 

3517
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,390
that's the opposite of their
evolutionary diet and their systems

3518
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
evolutionary diet and their systems
 

3519
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,670
evolutionary diet and their systems
really struggle with it

3520
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
really struggle with it
 

3521
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,309
really struggle with it
now pigs and chickens are different pigs

3522
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
now pigs and chickens are different pigs
 

3523
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,630
now pigs and chickens are different pigs
and chickens are omnivores

3524
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640
and chickens are omnivores
 

3525
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,030
and chickens are omnivores
and pigs will happily eat

3526
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
and pigs will happily eat
 

3527
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,950
and pigs will happily eat
chickens for example yeah our pigs on

3528
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
chickens for example yeah our pigs on
 

3529
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,950
chickens for example yeah our pigs on
the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes

3530
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes
 

3531
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,150
the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes
yeah and eat them um you know

3532
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
yeah and eat them um you know
 

3533
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,829
yeah and eat them um you know
it's they're they they have they enjoy

3534
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
it's they're they they have they enjoy
 

3535
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,190
it's they're they they have they enjoy
the they enjoy all of it

3536
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
the they enjoy all of it
 

3537
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,950
the they enjoy all of it
they're they're they're omnivores so

3538
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
they're they're they're omnivores so
 

3539
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,230
they're they're they're omnivores so
that you often see and i

3540
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,240
that you often see and i
 

3541
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,750
that you often see and i
i've seen people try to raise like a

3542
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
i've seen people try to raise like a
 

3543
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,670
i've seen people try to raise like a
grass-fed chicken and

3544
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
grass-fed chicken and
 

3545
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,589
grass-fed chicken and
that doesn't exist i mean they need a

3546
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
that doesn't exist i mean they need a
 

3547
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,270
that doesn't exist i mean they need a
higher omnivores

3548
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
higher omnivores
 

3549
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,549
higher omnivores
eat everything they're what's called

3550
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
eat everything they're what's called
 

3551
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,950
eat everything they're what's called
monogastric they got one stomach

3552
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:52,960
monogastric they got one stomach
 

3553
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,789
monogastric they got one stomach
and that one stomach needs higher

3554
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
and that one stomach needs higher
 

3555
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,150
and that one stomach needs higher
density nutrients

3556
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,160
density nutrients
 

3557
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,470
density nutrients
so in the case of um chicken if you're

3558
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480
so in the case of um chicken if you're
 

3559
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,190
so in the case of um chicken if you're
to do

3560
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
to do
 

3561
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,069
to do
you know look back in american history

3562
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
you know look back in american history
 

3563
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,910
you know look back in american history
and in the 1950s it took you know

3564
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
and in the 1950s it took you know
 

3565
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,750
and in the 1950s it took you know
commercial chickens took like 54 weeks

3566
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
commercial chickens took like 54 weeks
 

3567
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,270
commercial chickens took like 54 weeks
to come to full weight

3568
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
to come to full weight
 

3569
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,349
to come to full weight
and now it's two and a half weeks in the

3570
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
and now it's two and a half weeks in the
 

3571
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,870
and now it's two and a half weeks in the
in confinement farming on our

3572
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
in confinement farming on our
 

3573
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,950
in confinement farming on our
in our systems it's like eight to ten

3574
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
in our systems it's like eight to ten
 

3575
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,990
in our systems it's like eight to ten
weeks typically

3576
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
weeks typically
 

3577
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,670
weeks typically
so it's a very you have to give them

3578
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
so it's a very you have to give them
 

3579
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,270
so it's a very you have to give them
some amount of nutrient density

3580
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
some amount of nutrient density
 

3581
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,390
some amount of nutrient density
um but there's a the idea that no grain

3582
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
um but there's a the idea that no grain
 

3583
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,109
um but there's a the idea that no grain
because you that's a misinformation for

3584
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119
because you that's a misinformation for
 

3585
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,030
because you that's a misinformation for
any type of commercial operation

3586
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:25,040
any type of commercial operation
 

3587
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,710
any type of commercial operation
free range regenerative pastured

3588
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:26,720
free range regenerative pastured
 

3589
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,309
free range regenerative pastured
everything you're going to have to have

3590
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
everything you're going to have to have
 

3591
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,470
everything you're going to have to have
a grain feed to get any type of it's

3592
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
a grain feed to get any type of it's
 

3593
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:30,870
a grain feed to get any type of it's
actually

3594
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
actually
 

3595
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,390
actually
i think for the case of chickens unless

3596
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
i think for the case of chickens unless
 

3597
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,510
i think for the case of chickens unless
you're in a place with like tons of

3598
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
you're in a place with like tons of
 

3599
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,710
you're in a place with like tons of
natural seeds and

3600
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
natural seeds and
 

3601
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,789
natural seeds and
grubs and worms and stuff to eat really

3602
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:36,799
grubs and worms and stuff to eat really
 

3603
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,230
grubs and worms and stuff to eat really
challenging for the chicken

3604
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
challenging for the chicken
 

3605
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,510
challenging for the chicken
so you got to give them some high

3606
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
so you got to give them some high
 

3607
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,190
so you got to give them some high
density high calorie food different from

3608
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
density high calorie food different from
 

3609
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,430
density high calorie food different from
that that's the evolutionary diet

3610
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
that that's the evolutionary diet
 

3611
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,789
that that's the evolutionary diet
is a really key thing that's the

3612
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
is a really key thing that's the
 

3613
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,470
is a really key thing that's the
fundamental thing for health

3614
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
fundamental thing for health
 

3615
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,910
fundamental thing for health
and it's also interesting because that

3616
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:47,920
and it's also interesting because that
 

3617
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,750
and it's also interesting because that
the evolutionary diet ties to human

3618
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
the evolutionary diet ties to human
 

3619
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,870
the evolutionary diet ties to human
health

3620

i've looked at the nutritional analysis

3622
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
i've looked at the nutritional analysis
 

3623
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,870
i've looked at the nutritional analysis
on on all of our products and

3624
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:54,880
on on all of our products and
 

3625
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,549
on on all of our products and
it's the evolutionary diet is

3626
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
it's the evolutionary diet is
 

3627
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,230
it's the evolutionary diet is
for the case of beef and lamb gets

3628
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,240
for the case of beef and lamb gets
 

3629
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,829
for the case of beef and lamb gets
their omega three to six ratio is the

3630
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
their omega three to six ratio is the
 

3631
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,390
their omega three to six ratio is the
same as wild game

3632
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
same as wild game
 

3633
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,750
same as wild game
so it's not like beef is really

3634
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
so it's not like beef is really
 

3635
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,589
so it's not like beef is really
radically different from elk

3636
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
radically different from elk
 

3637
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,069
radically different from elk

00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:02,480
you're a link whether that's exciting to
 

3693
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,910
you're a link whether that's exciting to
you whether maybe on the humane side

3694
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
you whether maybe on the humane side
 

3695
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,670
you whether maybe on the humane side
it's a little bit concerning

3696
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:05,680
it's a little bit concerning
 

3697
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,789
it's a little bit concerning
um if there's something to be said

3698
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
um if there's something to be said
 

3699
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,549
um if there's something to be said
and sort of like um yeah on the

well pigs are incredibly intelligent so

3712
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
well pigs are incredibly intelligent so
 

3713
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,069
well pigs are incredibly intelligent so
i'm not surprised that they're a subject

3714
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
i'm not surprised that they're a subject
 

3715

i'm not surprised that they're a subject
matter for neurolink

um they're smarter than dogs and they're

3718
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,040
um they're smarter than dogs and they're
 

3719
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,950
um they're smarter than dogs and they're
empathetic and emotional

3720
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
empathetic and emotional
 

3721
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,829
empathetic and emotional
um and they're we'll go look at our pigs

3722
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
um and they're we'll go look at our pigs
 

3723
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,630
um and they're we'll go look at our pigs
afterwards and

3724
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
afterwards and
 

3725
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,870
afterwards and
see but they're they're they're kind of

3726
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
see but they're they're they're kind of
 

3727
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,390
see but they're they're they're kind of
like joyful and exuberant when they're

3728
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
like joyful and exuberant when they're
 

3729
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,829
like joyful and exuberant when they're
in good health

3730
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
in good health
 

3731
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,950
in good health
and um so that that makes sense

3732
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
and um so that that makes sense
 

3733
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,309
and um so that that makes sense
i i'm interested in open i feel

3734
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:44,319
i i'm interested in open i feel
 

3735
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,589
i i'm interested in open i feel
um that the

3736
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
um that the
 

3737
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,230
um that the
kind of bleeding edge agriculture

3738
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
kind of bleeding edge agriculture
 

3739
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,430
kind of bleeding edge agriculture
movement that i'm

3740
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
movement that i'm
 

3741
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,030
movement that i'm
you know on the edge of in some ways

3742
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
you know on the edge of in some ways
 

3743
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,030
you know on the edge of in some ways
we're a larger operator but

3744
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
we're a larger operator but
 

3745
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,309
we're a larger operator but
we as a movement have to we have to get

3746
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
we as a movement have to we have to get
 

3747
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,309
we as a movement have to we have to get
into the game we have to move forward in

3748
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
into the game we have to move forward in
 

3749
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,150
into the game we have to move forward in
a way that allows us to scale if we want

3750
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
a way that allows us to scale if we want
 

3751
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,510
a way that allows us to scale if we want
to be viable

3752
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
to be viable
 

3753
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,109
to be viable
so i think there has to be openness to

3754
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
so i think there has to be openness to
 

3755
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,950
so i think there has to be openness to
how that can happen yeah and i also

3756
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:06,960
how that can happen yeah and i also
 

3757
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,710
how that can happen yeah and i also
think there needs to be more

3758
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:08,720
think there needs to be more
 

3759
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,230
think there needs to be more
thoughtful and noisy data about how

3760
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
thoughtful and noisy data about how
 

3761
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,390
thoughtful and noisy data about how
regenerative ranching can sequester

3762
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:14,400
regenerative ranching can sequester
 

3763
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,270
regenerative ranching can sequester
carbon

3764
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:15,280
carbon
 

3765
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,549
carbon
i mean thousands of american ranchers

3766
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
i mean thousands of american ranchers
 

3767
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,470
i mean thousands of american ranchers
are selling carbon credits right now

3768
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:20,480
are selling carbon credits right now
 

3769
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,990
are selling carbon credits right now
the data is that valid and they're not

3770
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
the data is that valid and they're not
 

3771
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,910
the data is that valid and they're not
selling carbon credits from like

3772
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,920
selling carbon credits from like
 

3773
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,589
selling carbon credits from like
grassland that just got a fence around

3774
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
grassland that just got a fence around
 

3775
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,270
grassland that just got a fence around
it they're selling carbon credits for

3776
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
it they're selling carbon credits for
 

3777
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,390
it they're selling carbon credits for
verified data from

3778
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
verified data from
 

3779
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,510
verified data from
animals assisting in carbon

3780
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,520
animals assisting in carbon
 

3781
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,990
animals assisting in carbon
sequestration right so there's got

3782
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
sequestration right so there's got
 

3783
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,630
sequestration right so there's got
to be a way to to get the tech community

3784
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
to be a way to to get the tech community
 

3785
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,510
to be a way to to get the tech community
involved

3786
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,520
involved
 

3787
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,829
involved
in ways to help regenerative agriculture

3788
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:37,839
in ways to help regenerative agriculture
 

3789
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,589
in ways to help regenerative agriculture
scale in different creative ways

3790
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:39,599
scale in different creative ways
 

3791
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,030
scale in different creative ways
and actually yeah that'd be interesting

3792
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
and actually yeah that'd be interesting
 

3793
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,030
and actually yeah that'd be interesting
if like neuralink somehow has

3794
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
if like neuralink somehow has
 

3795
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,549
if like neuralink somehow has
i mean especially because the elon musk

3796
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
i mean especially because the elon musk
 

3797
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,150
i mean especially because the elon musk
is involved in kimball mosques

3798
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
is involved in kimball mosques
 

3799
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,069
is involved in kimball mosques
like has his whole effort and

3800
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
like has his whole effort and
 

3801
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,270
like has his whole effort and
appreciation of

3802
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
appreciation of
 

3803
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,309
appreciation of
regenerative agriculture that i wonder

3804
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:52,319
regenerative agriculture that i wonder
 

3805
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,789
regenerative agriculture that i wonder
if neurolink has a role to play

3806
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:54,799
if neurolink has a role to play
 

3807
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,789
if neurolink has a role to play
like exploring the the neurobiology of

3808
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
like exploring the the neurobiology of
 

3809
00:59:58,799 --> 00:59:59,589
like exploring the the neurobiology of
the animal

3810
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
the animal
 

3811
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,510
the animal
if that somehow will create innovations

3812
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:01,520
if that somehow will create innovations
 

3813
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,789
if that somehow will create innovations
that uh

3814
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:02,799
that uh
 

3815
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,910
that uh
lead to uh improved

3816
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:05,920
lead to uh improved
 

3817
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,069
lead to uh improved
uh scaling of regenerative agriculture

3818
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
uh scaling of regenerative agriculture
 

3819
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,030
uh scaling of regenerative agriculture
it'd be interesting but

3820
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,040
it'd be interesting but
 

3821
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,230
it'd be interesting but
you're saying you should be open to all

3822
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
you're saying you should be open to all
 

3823
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,430
you're saying you should be open to all
those possibilities i don't think i

3824
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
those possibilities i don't think i
 

3825
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,109
those possibilities i don't think i
don't know the landscape to know

3826
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
don't know the landscape to know
 

3827
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,430
don't know the landscape to know
what yeah but my sense is that it's very

3828
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
what yeah but my sense is that it's very
 

3829
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,789
what yeah but my sense is that it's very
hard

3830
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
hard
 

3831
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,349
hard
it's very hard and our farming operation

3832
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
it's very hard and our farming operation
 

3833
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,390
it's very hard and our farming operation
to scale has been

3834
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
to scale has been
 

3835
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,230
to scale has been
incredibly complex and challenging we

3836
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
incredibly complex and challenging we
 

3837
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,230
incredibly complex and challenging we
now work with partner farms

3838
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,240
now work with partner farms
 

3839
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,670
now work with partner farms
i see their operations they're

3840
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
i see their operations they're
 

3841
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,430
i see their operations they're
incredibly complex you know it just

3842
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,440
incredibly complex you know it just
 

3843
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,950
incredibly complex you know it just
seems like there's got to be a way to

3844
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960
seems like there's got to be a way to
 

3845
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,710
seems like there's got to be a way to
make some of these things

3846
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
make some of these things
 

3847
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,710
make some of these things
simpler and easier to share information

3848
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:32,720
simpler and easier to share information
 

3849
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,829
simpler and easier to share information
yeah um

3850
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
yeah um
 

3851
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,990
yeah um
i don't know what that answer is you

3852
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
i don't know what that answer is you
 

3853
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,109
i don't know what that answer is you
know what would be cool

3854
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:37,119
know what would be cool
 

3855
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,910
know what would be cool
is if we can understand deeper ways to

3856
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
is if we can understand deeper ways to
 

3857
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,950
is if we can understand deeper ways to
measure

3858
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
measure
 

3859
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,030
measure
the happiness of an animal because then

3860
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
the happiness of an animal because then
 

3861
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,549
the happiness of an animal because then
we can optimize

3862
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:44,559
we can optimize
 

3863
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,710
we can optimize
like a certified humane could be

3864
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
like a certified humane could be
 

3865
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,230
like a certified humane could be
literally an optimization problem just

3866
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
literally an optimization problem just
 

3867
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,109
literally an optimization problem just
make sure

3868
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:49,119
make sure
 

3869
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,349
make sure
as opposed to kind of uh using our

3870
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:51,359
as opposed to kind of uh using our
 

3871
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,510
as opposed to kind of uh using our
projecting our own human values

3872
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
projecting our own human values
 

3873
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,870
projecting our own human values
actually measuring what the what the

3874
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
actually measuring what the what the
 

3875
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,789
actually measuring what the what the
animal is happy doing that could be so

3876
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
animal is happy doing that could be so
 

3877
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,549
animal is happy doing that could be so
understanding the pig brain

3878
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
understanding the pig brain
 

3879
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,789
understanding the pig brain
might help us understand pig happiness

3880
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799
might help us understand pig happiness
 

3881
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,750
might help us understand pig happiness
and

3882
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
and
 

3883
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,829
and
like reframe what it means for a happy

3884
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
like reframe what it means for a happy
 

3885
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,750
like reframe what it means for a happy
animal and then maybe it's a lot easier

3886
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
animal and then maybe it's a lot easier
 

3887
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,950
animal and then maybe it's a lot easier
to make a happy animal

3888
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
to make a happy animal
 

3889
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,750
to make a happy animal
to make the animal happy than we think

3890
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
to make the animal happy than we think
 

3891
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,349
to make the animal happy than we think
it might have to do with a variety of

3892
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:11,359
it might have to do with a variety of
 

3893
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,589
it might have to do with a variety of
delicious food in the case

3894
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
delicious food in the case
 

3895
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,789
delicious food in the case
is there something you can say about

3896
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
is there something you can say about
 

3897
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,030
is there something you can say about
grass-fed meat is it all

3898
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040
grass-fed meat is it all
 

3899
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,349
grass-fed meat is it all
just out of my own curiosity whenever

3900
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
just out of my own curiosity whenever
 

3901
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,470
just out of my own curiosity whenever
people say

3902
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
people say
 

3903
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,230
people say
sort of grass-fed meat is better for you

3904
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
sort of grass-fed meat is better for you
 

3905
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,670
sort of grass-fed meat is better for you
are all grass-fed meat

3906
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
are all grass-fed meat
 

3907
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,710
are all grass-fed meat
made the same is there different like

3908
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:26,720
made the same is there different like
 

3909
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,349
made the same is there different like
le it's like the word organic uh is

3910
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
le it's like the word organic uh is
 

3911
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,430
le it's like the word organic uh is
there a lot of variety within that

3912
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
there a lot of variety within that
 

3913
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,190
there a lot of variety within that
like the way belcampa does it with it

3914
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,200
like the way belcampa does it with it
 

3915
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,950
like the way belcampa does it with it
others do it just

3916
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
others do it just
 

3917
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,589
others do it just
more color if you could add to this

3918
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
more color if you could add to this
 

3919
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,109
more color if you could add to this
whole word and what it means

3920
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
whole word and what it means
 

3921
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,309
whole word and what it means
grass-fed beef has been on grass its

3922
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
grass-fed beef has been on grass its
 

3923
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,589
grass-fed beef has been on grass its
entire life and you want to look for the

3924
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
entire life and you want to look for the
 

3925
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,190
entire life and you want to look for the
words 100 grass-fed

3926
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
words 100 grass-fed
 

3927
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,230
words 100 grass-fed
or grass-fed and finished now

3928
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
or grass-fed and finished now
 

3929
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,589
or grass-fed and finished now
the challenge with feeding

3930
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
the challenge with feeding
 

3931
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,950
the challenge with feeding
beef grass its whole life is that

3932
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
beef grass its whole life is that
 

3933
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,630
beef grass its whole life is that
it gains weight more slowly

3934
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:58,640
it gains weight more slowly
 

3935
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,510
it gains weight more slowly
although beef didn't evolve eating corn

3936
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
although beef didn't evolve eating corn
 

3937
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,150
although beef didn't evolve eating corn
and things

3938
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
and things
 

3939
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,430
and things
um it can't eat them and in eating them

3940
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
um it can't eat them and in eating them
 

3941
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,069
um it can't eat them and in eating them
it gains weight

3942
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
it gains weight
 

3943
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,270
it gains weight
more rapidly and has like a version of

3944
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
more rapidly and has like a version of
 

3945
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:09,829
more rapidly and has like a version of
like an

3946
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:09,839
like an
 

3947
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,230
like an
inflammatory response if you actually

3948
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
inflammatory response if you actually
 

3949
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,430
inflammatory response if you actually
look inside the rumen

3950
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
look inside the rumen
 

3951
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,910
look inside the rumen
of the animal inside the stomach it's

3952
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:15,920
of the animal inside the stomach it's
 

3953
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,109
of the animal inside the stomach it's
like

3954
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119
like
 

3955
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,789
like
black and shiny inside compared to

3956
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:18,799
black and shiny inside compared to
 

3957
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,549
black and shiny inside compared to
grass-fed animals like greens smells

3958
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
grass-fed animals like greens smells
 

3959
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,349
grass-fed animals like greens smells
like compost

3960
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
like compost
 

3961
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,630
like compost
so the animals themselves their whole

3962
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
so the animals themselves their whole
 

3963
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,349
so the animals themselves their whole
physiology is is damaged by that

3964
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
physiology is is damaged by that
 

3965
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,190
physiology is is damaged by that
food but they also gain weight really

3966
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
food but they also gain weight really
 

3967
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,710
food but they also gain weight really
quickly and they put on a lot of fats

3968
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:28,720
quickly and they put on a lot of fats
 

3969
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,470
quickly and they put on a lot of fats
like if you or me were to eat

3970
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,480
like if you or me were to eat
 

3971
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,829
like if you or me were to eat
a bunch of processed food compared to

3972
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
a bunch of processed food compared to
 

3973
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,829
a bunch of processed food compared to
eating a bunch of greens it's the same

3974
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
eating a bunch of greens it's the same
 

3975
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,829
eating a bunch of greens it's the same
impact you're going to blow up

3976
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:35,839
impact you're going to blow up
 

3977
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,950
impact you're going to blow up
so the problem for grass-fed is

3978
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
so the problem for grass-fed is
 

3979
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,870
so the problem for grass-fed is
getting the animals to gain weight

3980
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
getting the animals to gain weight
 

3981
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,549
getting the animals to gain weight
they're getting a ton of exercise

3982
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
they're getting a ton of exercise
 

3983
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,190
they're getting a ton of exercise
they're eating really clean right and

3984
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
they're eating really clean right and
 

3985
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,470
they're eating really clean right and
they're super chill

3986
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
they're super chill
 

3987
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,549
they're super chill
so that's different from the animals

3988
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
so that's different from the animals
 

3989
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,710
so that's different from the animals
that are kept still

3990
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
that are kept still
 

3991
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,670
that are kept still
eating really nutrient dense foods and

3992
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
eating really nutrient dense foods and
 

3993
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,349
eating really nutrient dense foods and
under a ton of stress

3994
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359
under a ton of stress
 

3995
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,470
under a ton of stress
which is a confinement animal so are all

3996
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
which is a confinement animal so are all
 

3997
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,549
which is a confinement animal so are all
grass-fed meats created the same

3998
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
grass-fed meats created the same
 

3999
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,789
grass-fed meats created the same
the diet yeah nutritional profile

4000
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
the diet yeah nutritional profile
 

4001
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,990
the diet yeah nutritional profile
broadly

4002
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,000
broadly
 

4003
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,470
broadly
but the length of time that the animal

4004
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
but the length of time that the animal
 

4005
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,710
but the length of time that the animal
lives is extremely important for

4006
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
lives is extremely important for
 

4007
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,349
lives is extremely important for
the flavor of the meat we're taking

4008
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
the flavor of the meat we're taking
 

4009
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,470
the flavor of the meat we're taking
our beef to 24 to 26 months conventional

4010
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:16,480
our beef to 24 to 26 months conventional
 

4011
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,630
our beef to 24 to 26 months conventional
is around 18 months

4012
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
is around 18 months
 

4013
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,630
is around 18 months
so i'm always looking and if you're

4014
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
so i'm always looking and if you're
 

4015
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,069
so i'm always looking and if you're
evaluating grass-fed animals

4016
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
evaluating grass-fed animals
 

4017
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,510
evaluating grass-fed animals
you want to get animals that are

4018
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
you want to get animals that are
 

4019
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,670
you want to get animals that are
typically allowed to live for longer

4020
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:25,680
typically allowed to live for longer
 

4021
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,549
typically allowed to live for longer
because their flavor is going to be

4022
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
because their flavor is going to be
 

4023
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,829
because their flavor is going to be
better there's going to be a bit more

4024
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
better there's going to be a bit more
 

4025
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:28,870
better there's going to be a bit more
fat

4026
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
fat
 

4027
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,029
fat
and their omega ratios also vary

4028
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:33,039
and their omega ratios also vary
 

4029
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,270
and their omega ratios also vary
very differently and i've seen omega

4030
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
very differently and i've seen omega
 

4031
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,029
very differently and i've seen omega
ratios you know on our farm

4032
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
ratios you know on our farm
 

4033
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,870
ratios you know on our farm
everywhere from one to three to one to

01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
everywhere from one to three to one to
 

4035
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,950
everywhere from one to three to one to
one you ideal as one to one game is

4036
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
one you ideal as one to one game is
 

4037
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,710
one you ideal as one to one game is
typically one to one or one to two omega

4038

three to sixes
 

4041
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,750
three to sixes
but in operations where you don't have

4042
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:45,760
but in operations where you don't have
 

4043
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,349
but in operations where you don't have
year-round grass

4044
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
year-round grass
 

4045
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,390
year-round grass
it's more complicated you know you're

4046
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
it's more complicated you know you're
 

4047
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,829
it's more complicated you know you're
feeding hay and you don't get that three

4048
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:49,839
feeding hay and you don't get that three
 

4049
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,029
feeding hay and you don't get that three
to six ratio

4050
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
to six ratio

omega-3s come from green grass um they

4052
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
omega-3s come from green grass um they
 

4053
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,950
omega-3s come from green grass um they
they're the fat in greens and so they're

4054
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
they're the fat in greens and so they're
 

4055
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,510
they're the fat in greens and so they're
scarce

4056
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
scarce
 

4057
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,470
scarce
and costly right so you can have

4058
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
and costly right so you can have
 

4059
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,750
and costly right so you can have
grass-fed and finished animals that

4060
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:01,760
grass-fed and finished animals that
 

4061
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,950
grass-fed and finished animals that
don't have that perfect ratio because

4062
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
don't have that perfect ratio because
 

4063
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,390
don't have that perfect ratio because
maybe they're in a climate or for

4064
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
maybe they're in a climate or for
 

4065
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,309
maybe they're in a climate or for
whatever reasons we've had to do it too

4066
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
whatever reasons we've had to do it too
 

4067
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,829
whatever reasons we've had to do it too
during the droughts do hay finishing

4068
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:07,839
during the droughts do hay finishing
 

4069
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,510
during the droughts do hay finishing
it's not optimal it changes the ratio

4070
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
it's not optimal it changes the ratio
 

4071
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:09,829
it's not optimal it changes the ratio
but

4072
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
but
 

4073
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,589
but
so there's a little bit of variance

4074
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
so there's a little bit of variance
 

4075
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,990
so there's a little bit of variance
within it i'd say though

4076
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
within it i'd say though
 

4077
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,870
within it i'd say though
the the variance within grass fed is

4078
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
the the variance within grass fed is
 

4079
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,829
the the variance within grass fed is
still

4080
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
still
 

4081
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,829
still
small compared to the variance between

4082
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:19,839
small compared to the variance between
 

4083
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,510
small compared to the variance between
conventional and grass-fed

4084
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
conventional and grass-fed
 

4085
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,029
conventional and grass-fed
right so there's definitely things to

4086
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
right so there's definitely things to
 

4087
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,870
right so there's definitely things to
look for within it but the

4088
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
look for within it but the
 

4089
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,750
look for within it but the
the real difference is between those two

4090
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
the real difference is between those two
 

4091
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,710
the real difference is between those two
also thing

4092
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
also thing
 

4093
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,309
also thing
to notice is that it's not a verified

4094
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
to notice is that it's not a verified
 

4095
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,589
to notice is that it's not a verified
word okay so grass fed

4096
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:35,599
word okay so grass fed
 

4097
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,349
word okay so grass fed
means animals that have been on grass at

4098
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
means animals that have been on grass at
 

4099
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:40,470
means animals that have been on grass at
some point in their life

4100
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,480
some point in their life
 

4101
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,789
some point in their life
the way the cattle industry is in the

4102
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:42,799
the way the cattle industry is in the
 

4103
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:43,829
the way the cattle industry is in the
u.s

4104
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
u.s
 

4105
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,349
u.s
there's segmentation so there's cow calf

4106
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
there's segmentation so there's cow calf
 

4107
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,390
there's segmentation so there's cow calf
operations

4108
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,400
operations
 

4109
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,109
operations
there's then those calves get sold to

4110
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
there's then those calves get sold to
 

4111
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,950
there's then those calves get sold to
stalker operations which raised

4112
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
stalker operations which raised
 

4113
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,230
stalker operations which raised
animals in their teens basically and

4114
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:54,240
animals in their teens basically and
 

4115
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,630
animals in their teens basically and
then those get sold to feedlots

4116
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
then those get sold to feedlots
 

4117
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,430
then those get sold to feedlots
and so those three phases that that

4118
01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,440
and so those three phases that that
 

4119
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,430
and so those three phases that that
first phase of the cow calf is always on

4120
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
first phase of the cow calf is always on
 

4121
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,309
first phase of the cow calf is always on
grass

4122
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
grass
 

4123
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,150
grass
it's mother cows and mom cows are

4124
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
it's mother cows and mom cows are
 

4125
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,910
it's mother cows and mom cows are
amazing they can thrive on

4126
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
amazing they can thrive on
 

4127
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,270
amazing they can thrive on
anything and still put all their

4128
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
anything and still put all their
 

4129
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,470
anything and still put all their
nutrients into their baby and their

4130
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
nutrients into their baby and their
 

4131
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,510
nutrients into their baby and their
babies will be healthy

4132
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,520
babies will be healthy
 

4133
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,190
babies will be healthy
so you never are putting weather cows on

4134
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
so you never are putting weather cows on
 

4135
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,549
so you never are putting weather cows on
really premium pasture

4136
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
really premium pasture
 

4137
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,910
really premium pasture
so it's usually just kind of like okay

4138
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
so it's usually just kind of like okay
 

4139
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,150
so it's usually just kind of like okay
pasture dirty life if you ever see kind

4140
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160
pasture dirty life if you ever see kind
 

4141
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,710
pasture dirty life if you ever see kind
of like

4142
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
of like
 

4143
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,309
of like
you know scrubby lots with lots of you

4144
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
you know scrubby lots with lots of you
 

4145
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,750
you know scrubby lots with lots of you
know cows and cats on that's a cow-calf

4146
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
know cows and cats on that's a cow-calf
 

4147
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,630
know cows and cats on that's a cow-calf
operation

4148
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
operation
 

4149
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,430
operation
so there's also a worm a loophole

4150
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
so there's also a worm a loophole
 

4151
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,029
so there's also a worm a loophole
unfortunately where people use the term

4152
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
unfortunately where people use the term
 

4153
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,069
unfortunately where people use the term
grass fed

4154
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
grass fed
 

4155
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,190
grass fed
and they're actually referring to

4156
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
and they're actually referring to
 

4157
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,470
and they're actually referring to
animals that at some point in their life

4158
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
animals that at some point in their life
 

4159
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,990
animals that at some point in their life
had grass but that might be

4160
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
had grass but that might be
 

4161
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,670
had grass but that might be
pretty far in the rearview mirror so you

4162
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
pretty far in the rearview mirror so you
 

4163
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,510
pretty far in the rearview mirror so you
need to see look at that uh

4164
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
need to see look at that uh
 

4165
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,750
need to see look at that uh

unfortunately it's the same thing for
 

4177
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,549
unfortunately it's the same thing for
you and me you could eat clean for a

you eat you know junk for three days

4182
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
you eat you know junk for three days
 

4183
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,309
you eat you know junk for three days
you're garbage right it's not like you

4184
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
you're garbage right it's not like you
 

4185
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,750
you're garbage right it's not like you
can just like coast on that

4186
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:49,760
can just like coast on that
 

4187
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,029
can just like coast on that
right we know what that's like same

4188
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
right we know what that's like same
 

4189
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,630
right we know what that's like same
thing for animals our physiology changes

4190
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
thing for animals our physiology changes
 

4191
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,829
thing for animals our physiology changes
food's the number one way we interact

4192
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:53,839
food's the number one way we interact
 

4193
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,029
food's the number one way we interact
with our environment yeah

4194
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
with our environment yeah
 

4195
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,789
with our environment yeah
and our body changes really rapidly and

4196
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
and our body changes really rapidly and
 

4197
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,069
and our body changes really rapidly and
dramatically so

4198
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
dramatically so
 

4199
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,349
dramatically so
so we know about campo and just the way

about this type of agriculture say just
 

4227
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:28,630
about this type of agriculture say just
like

4228
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
like
 

4229
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,029
like
set that aside you know it really is

yeah it's got a better fat ratio it's

4234
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
yeah it's got a better fat ratio it's
 

4235
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,430
yeah it's got a better fat ratio it's
less inflammatory

4236
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
less inflammatory
 

4237
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,230
less inflammatory
it's got higher protein um it's just

4238
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:38,240
it's got higher protein um it's just
 

4239
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,950
it's got higher protein um it's just
better product

4240
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:38,960
better product
 

4241
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,069
better product
i mean in the case of beef it's lower in

4242
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
i mean in the case of beef it's lower in
 

4243
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:42,789
i mean in the case of beef it's lower in
fat

4244
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
fat
 

4245
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,630
fat
and that fat is a better quality it's

4246
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
and that fat is a better quality it's
 

4247
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,549
and that fat is a better quality it's
higher in poultry and pork is also

4248
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:46,559
higher in poultry and pork is also
 

4249
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,670
higher in poultry and pork is also
higher in protein so

4250
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
higher in protein so
 

4251
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,109
higher in protein so
all the nutritionals are better it's got

4252
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:49,119
all the nutritionals are better it's got
 

4253
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,630
all the nutritionals are better it's got
higher density of vitamins got higher

4254
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
higher density of vitamins got higher
 

4255
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,069
higher density of vitamins got higher
density of minerals

4256
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
density of minerals
 

4257
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,990
density of minerals
and none of this stuff is radically

4258
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000
and none of this stuff is radically
 

4259
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,670
and none of this stuff is radically
different than you know it's like not

4260
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:55,680
different than you know it's like not
 

4261
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,069
different than you know it's like not
like

4262
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079
like
 

4263
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,029
like
it's the product is is black and white

4264
01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
it's the product is is black and white
 

4265
01:06:59,039 --> 01:06:59,670
it's the product is is black and white
but their

4266
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
but their
 

4267
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,630
but their
every metric meaningfully is better in

4268
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,640
every metric meaningfully is better in
 

4269
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,069
every metric meaningfully is better in
the right direction

4270
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
the right direction
 

4271
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,870
the right direction
across the board so why wouldn't you i

4272
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:06,880
across the board so why wouldn't you i
 

4273
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,750
across the board so why wouldn't you i
hesitate

4274
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
hesitate
 

4275
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,789
hesitate
to take anecdotal evidence

4276
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
to take anecdotal evidence
 

4277
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,190
to take anecdotal evidence
as like final scientific conclusions but

4278
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:13,200
as like final scientific conclusions but
 

4279
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,150
as like final scientific conclusions but
it does seem

4280
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
it does seem
 

4281

uh less inflamed i just feel better

4290
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
uh less inflamed i just feel better
 

4291
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:26,390
uh less inflamed i just feel better
because i

4292
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,400
because i
 

4293
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,190
because i
mostly eat a meat diet and it does seem

4294
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,200
mostly eat a meat diet and it does seem
 

4295
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,870
mostly eat a meat diet and it does seem
to be a little bit of a difference what

4296
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:30,880
to be a little bit of a difference what
 

4297
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,630
to be a little bit of a difference what
kind of meat i eat

4298
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
kind of meat i eat
 

4299
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,470
kind of meat i eat
where it comes from i don't know if

4300
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
where it comes from i don't know if
 

4301
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,670
where it comes from i don't know if
that's

4302
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:35,680
that's
 

4303
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,670
that's
my own psychology also i mean there is

4304
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680
my own psychology also i mean there is
 

4305
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,029
my own psychology also i mean there is
an aspect to like

4306
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:39,039
an aspect to like
 

4307
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,349
an aspect to like
when you know that the meat came from a

4308
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:41,359
when you know that the meat came from a
 

4309
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,029
when you know that the meat came from a
good place and all the ways we've

4310
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
good place and all the ways we've
 

4311
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,150
good place and all the ways we've
we've defined good you feel better about

4312
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
we've defined good you feel better about
 

4313
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,710
we've defined good you feel better about
it

4314
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
it
 

4315
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,470
it
and that has an effect like decreased

4316
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
and that has an effect like decreased
 

4317
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,710
and that has an effect like decreased
stress so i'm a huge believer in that

4318
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:50,720
stress so i'm a huge believer in that
 

4319
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,349
stress so i'm a huge believer in that
like

4320
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
like
 

4321
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,670
like
outside of just nutrition how you feel

4322
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
outside of just nutrition how you feel
 

4323
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,190
outside of just nutrition how you feel
about the whole experience is a huge

4324
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
about the whole experience is a huge
 

4325
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,710
about the whole experience is a huge
impact but

4326
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
impact but
 

4327
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,870
impact but
it does feel like the meat itself is

4328
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
it does feel like the meat itself is
 

4329
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,230
it does feel like the meat itself is
actually just leading to less

4330
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
actually just leading to less
 

4331
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,309
actually just leading to less
inflammation for me or like less

4332
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
inflammation for me or like less
 

4333
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,870
inflammation for me or like less
like the bloat bloat bloated feeling and

4334
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
like the bloat bloat bloated feeling and
 

4335
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,150
like the bloat bloat bloated feeling and
all those negative effects that

4336
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,160
all those negative effects that
 

4337
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,470
all those negative effects that
could come with me versus like certain

4338
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,480
could come with me versus like certain
 

4339
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,309
could come with me versus like certain
other ground beefs that i eat

4340
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:10,319
other ground beefs that i eat
 

4341
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,390
other ground beefs that i eat
like store bought chicken breast

4342
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
like store bought chicken breast
 

4343
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,950
like store bought chicken breast
or steak all those kinds of things my my

4344
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:16,960
or steak all those kinds of things my my
 

4345
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,709
or steak all those kinds of things my my
body is a little bit more

4346
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:18,719
body is a little bit more
 

4347
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,630
body is a little bit more
uh works a little bit harder to process

4348
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
uh works a little bit harder to process
 

4349
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,749
uh works a little bit harder to process
that food it feels like

4350
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:21,759
that food it feels like
 

4351
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:22,950
that food it feels like
i don't know if there's science to that

4352
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
i don't know if there's science to that
 

4353
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,870
i don't know if there's science to that
but sort of anecdotally that seems to be

4354
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:24,880
but sort of anecdotally that seems to be
 

4355
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,709
but sort of anecdotally that seems to be
the case omega-6s are a big part of that

4356
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:26,719
the case omega-6s are a big part of that
 

4357
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:27,510
the case omega-6s are a big part of that
for in the case of the

4358
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:27,520
for in the case of the
 

4359
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,349
for in the case of the
you eat a lot of beef yes you love beef

4360

you eat a lot of beef yes you love beef
 

4361
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,950
you eat a lot of beef yes you love beef
yeah and so in

4362
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:30,960
yeah and so in
 

4363
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,669
yeah and so in
a conventional beef product it's a 1 to

4364
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
a conventional beef product it's a 1 to
 

4365
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:34,630
a conventional beef product it's a 1 to
30 ratio

4366
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:34,640
30 ratio
 

4367
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,910
30 ratio
of omega-3s to sixes and it can

4368
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:37,920
of omega-3s to sixes and it can
 

4369
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,669
of omega-3s to sixes and it can
sometimes 1 to 20 1 to 30 but

4370
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
sometimes 1 to 20 1 to 30 but
 

4371
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,630
sometimes 1 to 20 1 to 30 but
that's the wrong direction in our beef

4372
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
that's the wrong direction in our beef
 

4373
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,189
that's the wrong direction in our beef
it's

4374
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
it's
 

4375
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,430
it's
you know as low as one to one right so

4376
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
you know as low as one to one right so
 

4377
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,749
you know as low as one to one right so
that and the omega-6s are what's part of

4378
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
that and the omega-6s are what's part of
 

4379
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,430
that and the omega-6s are what's part of
inflammation

4380
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
inflammation
 

4381
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,910
inflammation
right now you know they the magic in

4382
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:51,920
right now you know they the magic in
 

4383
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,189
right now you know they the magic in
animals is that they're incredibly

4384
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,199
animals is that they're incredibly
 

4385
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:54,309
animals is that they're incredibly
efficient processors

4386
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319
efficient processors
 

4387
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,789
efficient processors
right and in the same way that you know

4388
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
right and in the same way that you know
 

4389
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,070
right and in the same way that you know
they the

4390
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
they the
 

4391
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,269
they the
the body can protect uh us from you know

4392
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
the body can protect uh us from you know
 

4393
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,110
the body can protect uh us from you know
can process and take out tons of

4394
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
can process and take out tons of
 

4395
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,229
can process and take out tons of
things that are toxic out of the

4396
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
things that are toxic out of the
 

4397
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:05,669
things that are toxic out of the
environment i mean animals bodies can do

4398
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
environment i mean animals bodies can do
 

4399
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:06,470
environment i mean animals bodies can do
that too

4400
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
that too
 

4401
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,630
that too
so the beauty of meat is that it can be

4402
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
so the beauty of meat is that it can be
 

4403
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,390
so the beauty of meat is that it can be
pretty clean you know things like

4404
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,400
pretty clean you know things like
 

4405
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,829
pretty clean you know things like
roundup and stuff don't end up in the

4406
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
roundup and stuff don't end up in the
 

4407
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:12,390
roundup and stuff don't end up in the
meat

4408
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
meat
 

4409
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,630
meat
when we have antibiotics in our meat

4410
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:14,640
when we have antibiotics in our meat
 

4411
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,990
when we have antibiotics in our meat
we're not worried about getting like

4412
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
we're not worried about getting like
 

4413
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,309
we're not worried about getting like
tetracycline from the chicken breast

4414
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:18,319
tetracycline from the chicken breast
 

4415
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,390
tetracycline from the chicken breast
what we're worried about is the workers

4416
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
what we're worried about is the workers
 

4417
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,229
what we're worried about is the workers
getting tetracycline the chicken growing

4418
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,239
getting tetracycline the chicken growing
 

4419
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,749
getting tetracycline the chicken growing
faster than it should the meat being

4420
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
faster than it should the meat being
 

4421
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,870
faster than it should the meat being
chewier and not as

4422
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
chewier and not as
 

4423
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,950
chewier and not as
high quality so they but the actual

4424
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960
high quality so they but the actual
 

4425
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,870
high quality so they but the actual
antibiotics don't the animals

4426
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
antibiotics don't the animals
 

4427
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,550
antibiotics don't the animals
great at filtering that right they get

4428
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
great at filtering that right they get
 

4429
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,630
great at filtering that right they get
that out so you have to think about

4430
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:32,640
that out so you have to think about
 

4431
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,789
that out so you have to think about
meat not as like contamination of like

4432
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
meat not as like contamination of like
 

4433
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:35,829
meat not as like contamination of like
oh there's going to be some of that

4434
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
oh there's going to be some of that
 

4435
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,110
oh there's going to be some of that
garbage they used

4436
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,120
garbage they used
 

4437
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,990
garbage they used
in the farming in my meat um but it's

4438
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
in the farming in my meat um but it's
 

4439
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,510
in the farming in my meat um but it's
the more subtle things it's the fat

4440
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
the more subtle things it's the fat
 

4441
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,590
the more subtle things it's the fat
ratio it's the protein density

4442
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
ratio it's the protein density
 

4443
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,950
ratio it's the protein density
and there's also just i think in my

4444
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:46,960
and there's also just i think in my
 

4445
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,550
and there's also just i think in my
experience um

4446
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
experience um
 

4447
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,630
experience um
there's just more complex flavor and

4448
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
there's just more complex flavor and
 

4449
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,590
there's just more complex flavor and
things that taste

4450
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
things that taste
 

4451
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,829
things that taste
more complex this is you know science

4452
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
more complex this is you know science
 

4453
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,110
more complex this is you know science
backs this up

4454
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
backs this up
 

4455
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,110
backs this up
they fill you up faster so if you're

4456
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
they fill you up faster so if you're
 

4457
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,630
they fill you up faster so if you're
looking to limit

4458
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
looking to limit
 

4459
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,270
looking to limit
you know to to eat for fullness and but

4460
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
you know to to eat for fullness and but
 

4461

more complex foods are the way to do

4464
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:05,440
more complex foods are the way to do
 

4465
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,430
more complex foods are the way to do
that and that hit

you know you hit your satiety he'll help
 

4469
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,630
you know you hit your satiety he'll help
you hit that society so things like i

4470
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
you hit that society so things like i
 

4471
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,110
you hit that society so things like i
mean

4472

mean
 

4473
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,590
mean
all the key um you know amino acids that

4474
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,600
all the key um you know amino acids that

that's part of it like it but all meats

4480
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
that's part of it like it but all meats
 

4481
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:18,870
that's part of it like it but all meats
have those

4482

have those
 

4483
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,830
have those
then there's other kind of

then there's other kind of
 

4485
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,270
then there's other kind of
micronutrients and things around that

alone
a lot you know for a long time um i felt

4524
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
a lot you know for a long time um i felt
 

4525

a lot you know for a long time um i felt
very

4526
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
very
 

4527
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,830
very
uh like everybody waiting for me

4528
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,840
uh like everybody waiting for me
 

4529
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,270
uh like everybody waiting for me
to fail or watching and

4530
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
to fail or watching and
 

4531
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,870
to fail or watching and
assuming that i was like just good at

4532
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:14,880
assuming that i was like just good at
 

4533
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,189
assuming that i was like just good at
marketing or whatever else and

4534
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
marketing or whatever else and
 

4535
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,709
marketing or whatever else and
and um so it it's taken me

4536
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
and um so it it's taken me
 

4537
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,750
and um so it it's taken me
a while to

4538
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
a while to
 

4539
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,350
a while to
not internalize that

4540
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360

 

4541
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,110

i think the only reason i've i'm here

4542
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
i think the only reason i've i'm here
 

4543
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,149
i think the only reason i've i'm here
is we have our own supply chain in

4544
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
is we have our own supply chain in
 

4545
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,750
is we have our own supply chain in
slaughterhouse and i think had i really

4546
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
slaughterhouse and i think had i really
 

4547
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,790
slaughterhouse and i think had i really
been playing in the broader meat

4548
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
been playing in the broader meat
 

4549
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,229
been playing in the broader meat

hard to make it
 

4555
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,630
hard to make it

with a piece of food right it could be a
totally different than what actually

absolutely completely
completely analogous i get that i mean

5498
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,280
completely analogous i get that i mean
 

5499
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,629
completely analogous i get that i mean
you also though there's elements of

5500
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
you also though there's elements of
 

5501
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,070
you also though there's elements of
comfort and love and those different

5502
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,080
comfort and love and those different
 

5503

pieces for you
 

5505
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,149
pieces for you
but i think you got to look at like

5506
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159
but i think you got to look at like
 

5507
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,910
but i think you got to look at like
where would you go somewhere like would

5508
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
where would you go somewhere like would
 

5509
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,790
where would you go somewhere like would
you go

5510
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:10,800
you go
 

5511
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,629
you go
to a place where you could you know hike

5512
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
to a place where you could you know hike
 

5513
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,990
to a place where you could you know hike
in japan and then end up in a little

5514
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,000
in japan and then end up in a little
 

5515
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,270
in japan and then end up in a little
place where you'd eat something

a great meal for me so like
 

5563
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,590
a great meal for me so like
24 hours is like the minimum you're

5564
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
24 hours is like the minimum you're
 

5565
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,830
24 hours is like the minimum you're
you're more sensitive to the richness of

5566
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
you're more sensitive to the richness of
 

5567
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,790
you're more sensitive to the richness of
any experience

5568
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:00,800
any experience
 

5569
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,149

but like you that's not very that's not

5970
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:00,880
but like you that's not very that's not
 

5971

they love about it
 

5979
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,110
they love about it
many of them are just outdoors and i say

5980
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:09,120
many of them are just outdoors and i say
 

5981
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,990
many of them are just outdoors and i say
that because most of them are men but

5982
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,000
that because most of them are men but
 

5983
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,390
that because most of them are men but

love the outdoors aspect of it and being
 

5987
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,910
love the outdoors aspect of it and being
out in in the wild

5988

out in in the wild
 

5989
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,270
out in in the wild
but a lot of them it's because of how

5990
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:15,280
but a lot of them it's because of how
 

5991
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,030
but a lot of them it's because of how
they feel when they eat the meat

5992
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:17,040
they feel when they eat the meat
 

5993
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,550
they feel when they eat the meat
and it's because they're eating i mean

99 of meat in america is made a very

01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:20,639
99 of meat in america is made a very
 

5997
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:21,910
99 of meat in america is made a very
specific way

5998
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
specific way
 

5999
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,709
specific way
and it's in in a way that is pretty

6000
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
and it's in in a way that is pretty
 

6001
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:25,669
and it's in in a way that is pretty
inflammatory

6002
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679

not incredibly delicious and when you're
 

6005
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,070
not incredibly delicious and when you're
on that extreme

6006

on that extreme
 

6007
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,229
on that extreme
um and then you toggle to having this

6008
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
um and then you toggle to having this
 

6009
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,149
um and then you toggle to having this
totally different style of product

so when i talk about us being on that

6018
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
so when i talk about us being on that
 

6019
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,510
so when i talk about us being on that
spectrum it's like well it's

could there's no way you can do that on

6034
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
could there's no way you can do that on
 

6035
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,790
could there's no way you can do that on
a farm so there's always going to be

6036
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
a farm so there's always going to be
 

6037
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,629
a farm so there's always going to be
that extra five or ten percent that

6038
01:34:58,629 --> 01:34:58,639
that extra five or ten percent that
 

6039
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,070
that extra five or ten percent that
those wild animals are going to have

6040
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
those wild animals are going to have
 

6041
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,750
those wild animals are going to have
you know and those wild animals also

6042
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
you know and those wild animals also
 

6043
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,189
you know and those wild animals also
fast for longer they go through periods

6044
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:03,199
fast for longer they go through periods
 

6045
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,229
fast for longer they go through periods
of starvation

6046
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
of starvation
 

6047
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,310
of starvation
and that creates an even like slower

6048
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
and that creates an even like slower
 

6049
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,990
and that creates an even like slower
growth for musculature that's going to

6050
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,000
growth for musculature that's going to
 

6051
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,750
growth for musculature that's going to
be create even more

6052
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:09,760
be create even more
 

6053
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,149
be create even more
unique flavor and characteristics and so

6054
01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:12,159
unique flavor and characteristics and so
 

6055
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:13,189
unique flavor and characteristics and so
that's why there's that

6056
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
that's why there's that
 

6057
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,070
that's why there's that
that extra in the hunted meat but you

6058
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,080
that extra in the hunted meat but you
 

6059
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,910
that extra in the hunted meat but you
can come a lot closer

6060
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:17,920
can come a lot closer
 

6061
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,830
can come a lot closer

actually find it very appetizing

6120
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:15,440
actually find it very appetizing
 

6121
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,350
actually find it very appetizing
so we're kind of teaching ourselves to

6122
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
so we're kind of teaching ourselves to
 

6123
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,430
so we're kind of teaching ourselves to
overcome our instinct

6124
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,440
overcome our instinct
 

6125
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,470
overcome our instinct
with food we're saying here's this kind

6126
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
with food we're saying here's this kind
 

6127
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,270
with food we're saying here's this kind
of

6128
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:23,280
of
 

6129
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,270
of
based substrate not very interesting i'm

6130
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:25,280
based substrate not very interesting i'm
 

6131
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,030
based substrate not very interesting i'm
not like sparking to it

6132
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:27,040
not like sparking to it
 

6133
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,750
not like sparking to it
awesome put sugar and salt on it this up

6134
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:29,760
awesome put sugar and salt on it this up
 

6135
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,270
awesome put sugar and salt on it this up
the hyper-processed flavor profile

6136
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,280
the hyper-processed flavor profile
 

6137
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,990
the hyper-processed flavor profile
great done and then your spark to it

6138
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,000
great done and then your spark to it
 

6139
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,750
great done and then your spark to it
yeah that's not that's a very short road

6140
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:35,760
yeah that's not that's a very short road
 

6141
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,470
yeah that's not that's a very short road
and that's i think

6142
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:36,480
and that's i think
 

6143
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,550
and that's i think
a lot of the health problems we have now

6144
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:38,560
a lot of the health problems we have now
 

6145
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,669
a lot of the health problems we have now
is because we're

6146
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
is because we're
 

6147
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,390
is because we're
masking flavors and basically trying to

6148
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
masking flavors and basically trying to
 

6149
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,070
masking flavors and basically trying to
get ourselves to move down this path of

6150
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
get ourselves to move down this path of
 

6151
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,430
get ourselves to move down this path of
the same way we behave around all hyper

6152
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
the same way we behave around all hyper
 

6153
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,229
the same way we behave around all hyper
processed foods

6154
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:46,239
processed foods
 

6155
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,149
processed foods
yeah and that gets us into a mess with

6156
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
yeah and that gets us into a mess with
 

6157
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:50,390
yeah and that gets us into a mess with
our health so if we can get

6158
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
our health so if we can get
 

6159
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,629
our health so if we can get
things like game where people love the

6160
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
things like game where people love the
 

6161
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,229
things like game where people love the
flavor out of the gate but it's natural

6162
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
flavor out of the gate but it's natural
 

6163
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:55,910
flavor out of the gate but it's natural
simple mentally processed like that's a

6164
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:55,920
simple mentally processed like that's a
 

6165
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,390
simple mentally processed like that's a
win

6166
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
win
 

6167
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,109
win
yeah that it reverses that hyper

6168
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
yeah that it reverses that hyper
 

6169
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,629
yeah that it reverses that hyper
processing

6170
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:00,639
processing
 

6171
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,750
processing
trend that we're on as a human species

6172
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:03,760
trend that we're on as a human species
 

6173
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,990
trend that we're on as a human species
and that's uh that's the promise of

6174
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
and that's uh that's the promise of
 

6175
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,430
and that's uh that's the promise of
regenerative farming that's the promise

6176
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
regenerative farming that's the promise
 

6177
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,070
regenerative farming that's the promise
of hunting

6178
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:08,080
of hunting
 

6179
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,709
of hunting
obviously the former can be scaled the

6180
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:10,719
obviously the former can be scaled the
 

6181
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:11,590
obviously the former can be scaled the
hunting

6182
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:11,600
hunting
 

6183
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,629
hunting
i think cannot be scaled right but in

6184
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:14,639
i think cannot be scaled right but in
 

6185
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,470
i think cannot be scaled right but in
many ways the hunting

6186
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,480
many ways the hunting
 

6187
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,229
many ways the hunting
inspires the world that this is the

6188
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:18,239
inspires the world that this is the
 

6189
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,310
inspires the world that this is the
right way to eat yes

6190
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:20,320
right way to eat yes
 

6191
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,709
right way to eat yes
and and that naturally leads to then

6192
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719
and and that naturally leads to then
 

6193
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:27,510
and and that naturally leads to then
uh the humane farming regenerative

6194
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:27,520
uh the humane farming regenerative
 

6195
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,550
uh the humane farming regenerative
farming idea

6196
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
farming idea
 

6197
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,390
farming idea
which is this idea that hunting

6198
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
which is this idea that hunting
 

6199
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,669
which is this idea that hunting
represents

6200
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
represents
 

6201
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,590
represents
how do you scale that well if you look

6202
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:33,600
how do you scale that well if you look
 

6203
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,430
how do you scale that well if you look
at like you know we're talking about

6204
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
at like you know we're talking about
 

6205
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,709
at like you know we're talking about
people use the sort of marketing

6206
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:36,719
people use the sort of marketing
 

6207
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,470
people use the sort of marketing
language of like happy cows or

6208
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
language of like happy cows or
 

6209
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,590
language of like happy cows or
that kind of thing you know if you're

6210
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
that kind of thing you know if you're
 

6211
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,709
that kind of thing you know if you're
talking about the happiest animals it's

6212
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
talking about the happiest animals it's
 

6213
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:41,990
talking about the happiest animals it's
wild animals right

6214
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
wild animals right
 

6215
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,310
wild animals right
so if you wonder why these practices are

6216
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:44,320
so if you wonder why these practices are
 

6217
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,270
so if you wonder why these practices are
good

6218
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:45,280
good
 

6219
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,629
good
talk to hunters you know you're talking

6220
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
talk to hunters you know you're talking
 

6221
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,390
talk to hunters you know you're talking
about animals that have lived in their

6222
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
about animals that have lived in their
 

6223
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,149
about animals that have lived in their
evolutionary capacity right who have

6224
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
evolutionary capacity right who have
 

6225
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,350
evolutionary capacity right who have
played their role in the ecosystem

6226
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
played their role in the ecosystem
 

6227
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,070
played their role in the ecosystem
who've

6228
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,080
who've
 

6229
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,870
who've
lived their meaning of life right and

6230
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
lived their meaning of life right and
 

6231
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,350
lived their meaning of life right and
that's

6232
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
that's
 

6233
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,310
that's
a very powerfully different kind of role

6234
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
a very powerfully different kind of role
 

6235
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:58,950
a very powerfully different kind of role
than

6236
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:58,960
than
 

6237
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,189
than
than livestock production so i think if

6238
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:01,199
than livestock production so i think if
 

6239
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,790
than livestock production so i think if
we can make our livestock production

6240
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
we can make our livestock production
 

6241
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,590
we can make our livestock production
as similar to wild as possible then

6242
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
as similar to wild as possible then
 

6243
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:05,990
as similar to wild as possible then
we're

6244
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,000
we're
 

6245
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,910
we're
a lot of steps closer so you said the

6246
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
a lot of steps closer so you said the
 

6247
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,310
a lot of steps closer so you said the
animals are happiest in the wild

6248
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320
animals are happiest in the wild
 

6249
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,629
animals are happiest in the wild
and that's where they find meaning uh

6250
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
and that's where they find meaning uh
 

6251
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:13,669
and that's where they find meaning uh
what about us

6252
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:13,679
what about us
 

6253
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,510
what about us
the human animal what's the meaning for

6254
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:15,520
the human animal what's the meaning for
 

6255
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,109
the human animal what's the meaning for
us do you think

6256
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:17,119
us do you think
 

6257
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:20,229
us do you think
if you've uh monitored the life cycle of

6258
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
if you've uh monitored the life cycle of
 

6259
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,310
if you've uh monitored the life cycle of
a lot of living beings you ever look in

6260
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
a lot of living beings you ever look in
 

6261
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,750
a lot of living beings you ever look in
the mirror and think like

6262
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:23,760
the mirror and think like
 

6263
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,030
the mirror and think like
why the hell are we humans here ah

6264
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
why the hell are we humans here ah
 

6265
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,470
why the hell are we humans here ah
i mean thriving reducing suffering um

6266
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
i mean thriving reducing suffering um
 

6267
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,430
i mean thriving reducing suffering um
creating goodness i mean those are the

6268
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
creating goodness i mean those are the
 

6269
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,470
creating goodness i mean those are the
things i see in

6270
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:34,480
things i see in
 

6271
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,790
things i see in
in animals behavior they're mostly

6272
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:36,800
in animals behavior they're mostly
 

6273
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,830
in animals behavior they're mostly
interested in

6274
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
interested in
 

6275
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,189
interested in
in reducing suffering and and

6276
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:41,199
in reducing suffering and and
 

6277
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,430
in reducing suffering and and
um nurturing right those are the things

6278
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
um nurturing right those are the things
 

6279
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,189
um nurturing right those are the things
that i think evolutionarily

6280
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
that i think evolutionarily
 

6281
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,350
that i think evolutionarily
