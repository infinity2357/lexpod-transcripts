171
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,710
complicated
and then you have to be inventive to

172
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
and then you have to be inventive to
 

173
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,550
and then you have to be inventive to
figure out how to do it

174
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
figure out how to do it
 

175
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,229
figure out how to do it
right so that's that's definitely

176
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
right so that's that's definitely
 

177
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,670
right so that's that's definitely
happens a lot

178
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
happens a lot
 

179
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,270
happens a lot
and then every so often some big idea

180
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
and then every so often some big idea
 

181
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,309
and then every so often some big idea
happens

182
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
happens
 

183
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,790
happens
but it might be one person and that idea

184
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
but it might be one person and that idea
 

185
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,589
but it might be one person and that idea
is in what

186
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
is in what
 

187
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,830
is in what
in the space of engineering or is it in

188
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
in the space of engineering or is it in
 

189
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,190
in the space of engineering or is it in
the space well i'll give you an example

190
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
the space well i'll give you an example
 

191
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,470
the space well i'll give you an example
so one of the limits of computer

192
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
so one of the limits of computer
 

193
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,790
so one of the limits of computer
performance is branch predictions

194
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
performance is branch predictions
 

195
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,030
performance is branch predictions
so and there's there's a whole bunch of

196
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
so and there's there's a whole bunch of
 

197
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,710
so and there's there's a whole bunch of
ideas about how good you could predict

198
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
ideas about how good you could predict
 

199
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,350
ideas about how good you could predict
the branch

200
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
the branch
 

201
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,430
the branch
and people said there's a limit to it

202
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
and people said there's a limit to it
 

203
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,350
and people said there's a limit to it
it's an asthmatic curve

204
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
it's an asthmatic curve
 

205
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,789
it's an asthmatic curve
and somebody came up with a better way

206
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
and somebody came up with a better way
 

207
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,789
and somebody came up with a better way
to do branch prediction it was a lot

208
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
to do branch prediction it was a lot
 

209
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,070
to do branch prediction it was a lot
better

210
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
better
 

211
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,149
better
and he published a paper on it and every

212
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
and he published a paper on it and every
 

213
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,710
and he published a paper on it and every
computer in the world now uses it

214
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
computer in the world now uses it
 

215
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,830
computer in the world now uses it
and it was one idea so the the engineers

216
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
and it was one idea so the the engineers
 

217
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,830
and it was one idea so the the engineers
who build branch prediction hardware

218
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
who build branch prediction hardware
 

219
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,589
who build branch prediction hardware
were happy to drop the one kind of

220
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
were happy to drop the one kind of
 

221
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,309
were happy to drop the one kind of
training array and put it in another one

222
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
training array and put it in another one
 

223
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,190
training array and put it in another one
so it was it was a real idea and branch

224
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
so it was it was a real idea and branch
 

225
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,309
so it was it was a real idea and branch
prediction is

226
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
prediction is
 

227
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,430
prediction is
is one of the key problems underlying

all of sort of the lowest level of
 

231
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,949
all of sort of the lowest level of
software it boils down to branch

234
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
prediction
 

235
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,350
prediction
boils down to uncertainty computers are

236
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
boils down to uncertainty computers are
 

237
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,710
boils down to uncertainty computers are
limited by you know single thread

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,869
computers limited by two things
the predictability of the path of the

242
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
the predictability of the path of the
 

243
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,229
the predictability of the path of the

of data so we have predictors that now
 

249
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,789
of data so we have predictors that now
predict both of those pretty well

250
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
predict both of those pretty well
 

251
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,550
predict both of those pretty well
yeah so memory is you know a couple

252
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
yeah so memory is you know a couple
 

253
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,550
yeah so memory is you know a couple
hundred cycles away local cache is

254
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
hundred cycles away local cache is
 

255
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,390
hundred cycles away local cache is
couple cycles away

256
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
couple cycles away
 

257
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,229
couple cycles away
when you're executing fast virtually all

258
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
when you're executing fast virtually all
 

259
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,870
when you're executing fast virtually all
the data has to be in the local cache

260
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
the data has to be in the local cache
 

261
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,509
the data has to be in the local cache
so a simple program says you know add

262
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
so a simple program says you know add
 

263
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,189
so a simple program says you know add
one to every element in array

264
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
one to every element in array
 

265
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,950
one to every element in array
it's really easy to see what the stream

266
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
it's really easy to see what the stream
 

267
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,469
it's really easy to see what the stream
of data will be

268
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
of data will be
 

269
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,990
of data will be
but you might have a more complicated

270
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
but you might have a more complicated
 

271
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,990
but you might have a more complicated
program that you know says get a get an

272
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
program that you know says get a get an
 

273
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,749
program that you know says get a get an
element of this array look at something

274
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
element of this array look at something
 

275
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,629
element of this array look at something
make a decision

276
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
make a decision
 

277
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,150
make a decision
go get another element it's kind of

278
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
go get another element it's kind of
 

279
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,150
go get another element it's kind of
random and you can think that's really

280
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
random and you can think that's really
 

281
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,590
random and you can think that's really
unpredictable

282
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
unpredictable
 

283
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,030
unpredictable
and then you make this big predictor

284
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
and then you make this big predictor
 

285
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,710
and then you make this big predictor
that looks at this kind of pattern and

286
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
that looks at this kind of pattern and
 

287
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,270
that looks at this kind of pattern and
you realize

288
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
you realize
 

289
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,870
you realize
well if you get this data in this data

290
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
well if you get this data in this data
 

291
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,310
well if you get this data in this data
then you probably want that one

292
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
then you probably want that one
 

293
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,909
then you probably want that one
and if you get this one and this one and

294
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
and if you get this one and this one and
 

295
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,830
and if you get this one and this one and
this one you probably want that one

296
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
this one you probably want that one
 

297
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,189
this one you probably want that one
and is that theory or is that

298
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
and is that theory or is that
 

299
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,790
and is that theory or is that
engineering like the paper that was

300
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
engineering like the paper that was
 

301
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,270
engineering like the paper that was

303
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,670

was it uh well it was asymptotic kind of

304
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
was it uh well it was asymptotic kind of
 

305
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,350
was it uh well it was asymptotic kind of
kind of discussion or is it more like

306
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
kind of discussion or is it more like
 

307
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,510
kind of discussion or is it more like
here's a hack that works well

308
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
here's a hack that works well
 

309
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
here's a hack that works well
um it's a little bit of both like

310
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
um it's a little bit of both like
 

311
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,710
um it's a little bit of both like
there's information theory in it i think

312
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
there's information theory in it i think
 

313
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,189
there's information theory in it i think
somewhere

314
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
somewhere
 

315
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,590
somewhere
okay so that's actually trying to prove

316
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
okay so that's actually trying to prove
 

317
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,310
okay so that's actually trying to prove
yeah but once once you know the method

318
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
yeah but once once you know the method
 

319
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,070
yeah but once once you know the method

inventing things so lots of companies

336
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
inventing things so lots of companies
 

337
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,590
inventing things so lots of companies
will reward you for

338
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
will reward you for
 

339
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,230
will reward you for
filing patents yes some many big

340
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
filing patents yes some many big

something new
 

347
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,390
something new
and then what happens is everybody's

348
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
and then what happens is everybody's
 

349
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,469
and then what happens is everybody's
trying to do some random new thing

350
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
trying to do some random new thing

they get to there's a dichotomy they
 

359
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,749
they get to there's a dichotomy they
think like the cell library and the

think like the cell library and the
 

361
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,110
think like the cell library and the
basic cad tools

that's simple stuff you know they want

368
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
that's simple stuff you know they want
 

369
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,790
that's simple stuff you know they want
to work on the exciting stuff

to work on the exciting stuff
 

371
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,309
to work on the exciting stuff
and then they they spend lots of time

00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
and then they they spend lots of time
 

373
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,350
and then they they spend lots of time
trying to figure out how to patent

374
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
trying to figure out how to patent
 

375

something
 

377
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,309
something
and that's mostly useless but the

378
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
and that's mostly useless but the
 

379
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,469
and that's mostly useless but the
breakthroughs are on the simple stuff

no no you no you have to do the simple

382
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
no no you no you have to do the simple
 

383
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,710
no no you no you have to do the simple
stuff really well

384
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
stuff really well
 

385
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,230
stuff really well
if you're brilliant building a building

how square they are and you know which
 

405
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,990
how square they are and you know which
one you can buy bricks from

which is going to make a better house so
you're talking about the craftsman the

410
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
you're talking about the craftsman the
 

411
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,749
you're talking about the craftsman the
person who understands bricks who loves

bricks who loves their varieties
that's a good word you know good

416
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
that's a good word you know good
 

417
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,430
that's a good word you know good
engineering is great craftsmanship

418
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
engineering is great craftsmanship
 

419
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,110
engineering is great craftsmanship
and when you start thinking engineering

420
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
and when you start thinking engineering
 

421
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,710
and when you start thinking engineering
is about invention

422
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
is about invention
 

423
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,710
is about invention
and set up a system that rewards

424
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
and set up a system that rewards
 

425
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,749
and set up a system that rewards
invention

426

invention
 

427
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,350
invention
the craftsmanship gets neglected okay so

428
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
the craftsmanship gets neglected okay so
 

429
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,589
the craftsmanship gets neglected okay so
maybe one perspective is the theory the

430
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
maybe one perspective is the theory the
 

431
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,029
maybe one perspective is the theory the
science

432
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
science
 

433
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,150
science
over emphasizes invention and

434
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
over emphasizes invention and
 

435
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,390
over emphasizes invention and
engineering emphasizes craftsmanship and

436
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
engineering emphasizes craftsmanship and
 

437
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,270
engineering emphasizes craftsmanship and
therefore

438
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
therefore
 

439
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,510
therefore
like so if you it doesn't matter what

440
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
like so if you it doesn't matter what
 

441
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,950
like so if you it doesn't matter what
you do in theory well everybody knows

442
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
you do in theory well everybody knows
 

443
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,390
you do in theory well everybody knows
like read the tech rags they're always

444
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
like read the tech rags they're always
 

445
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,909
like read the tech rags they're always
talking about some breakthrough or

446
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
talking about some breakthrough or
 

447
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,710
talking about some breakthrough or
intervention

448
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
intervention
 

449
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,710
intervention
innovation and everybody thinks that's

450
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
innovation and everybody thinks that's
 

451
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,230
innovation and everybody thinks that's
the most important thing

452
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
the most important thing
 

453
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,990
the most important thing
but the number of innovative ideas is

454
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
but the number of innovative ideas is
 

455
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,710
but the number of innovative ideas is
actually relatively low we need them

456
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
actually relatively low we need them
 

457
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,550
actually relatively low we need them
right and innovation creates a whole new

458
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
right and innovation creates a whole new
 

459
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,230
right and innovation creates a whole new
opportunity like when

460
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
opportunity like when
 

461
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,710
opportunity like when
when some guy invented the internet

462
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
when some guy invented the internet
 

463
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,830
when some guy invented the internet
right

464
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
right
 

465
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,309
right
like that was a big thing the million

466
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
like that was a big thing the million
 

467
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,070
like that was a big thing the million
people that wrote software against that

468
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
people that wrote software against that
 

469
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,029
people that wrote software against that
were mostly doing

470
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
were mostly doing
 

471
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,270
were mostly doing
engineering software writing so the

472
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
engineering software writing so the
 

473
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,150
engineering software writing so the
elaboration of that idea was huge

474
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
elaboration of that idea was huge
 

475
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,749
elaboration of that idea was huge
i don't know if you know brendan ike he

476
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
i don't know if you know brendan ike he
 

477
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,830
i don't know if you know brendan ike he
wrote javascript in 10 days

478
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
wrote javascript in 10 days
 

479
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,670
wrote javascript in 10 days
and that's an interesting story it makes

480
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
and that's an interesting story it makes
 

481
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,270
and that's an interesting story it makes
me wonder

482
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
me wonder
 

483
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,350
me wonder
and it was you know famously for many

484
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
and it was you know famously for many
 

485
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,710
and it was you know famously for many
years considered to be

486
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
years considered to be
 

487
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,589
years considered to be
a pretty crappy programming language

488
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
a pretty crappy programming language
 

489
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,589
a pretty crappy programming language
still is perhaps it's been improving

490
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
still is perhaps it's been improving
 

491
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,110
still is perhaps it's been improving
sort of consistently

492
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
sort of consistently
 

493
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,230
sort of consistently
but the interesting thing about that guy

494
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
but the interesting thing about that guy
 

495
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,430
but the interesting thing about that guy
is

496
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
is
 

497
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,469
is
you know he doesn't get any awards you

498
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
you know he doesn't get any awards you
 

499
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,629
you know he doesn't get any awards you
don't get a nobel prize or a field medal

500
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639

there's a few elements maybe if he
 

561
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,350
there's a few elements maybe if he
figured out what it was

figured out what it was
 

563
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,230
figured out what it was
no then he'd get a prize like that

564
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
no then he'd get a prize like that

written about it which is like
 

577
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,030
written about it which is like
wrong is right which is like doing the

578

wrong is right which is like doing the
 

579
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,269
wrong is right which is like doing the
crappy thing fast

580
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
crappy thing fast

just like hacking together the thing

582
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
just like hacking together the thing
 

583
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,190
just like hacking together the thing
that answers some of the needs

but the right time like you have to

596
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
but the right time like you have to
 

597
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,550

simple and just get it
 

605
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,310
simple and just get it
out there the problem is this is true

606
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
out there the problem is this is true
 

607
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,990
out there the problem is this is true
with hardware this is less true with

this backward compatibility that just

612
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
this backward compatibility that just
 

613
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,030
this backward compatibility that just
drags behind you as

614
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
drags behind you as
 

615
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,790
drags behind you as
you know as you try to fix all the

you know as you try to fix all the
 

617
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,670
you know as you try to fix all the
mistakes of the past but the the timing

618
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
mistakes of the past but the the timing
 

619
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,509
mistakes of the past but the the timing
was good there's something about that it

620
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
was good there's something about that it
 

621
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,710
was good there's something about that it
wasn't accidental

622
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
wasn't accidental
 

623
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,350

you have to like give yourself over to

624
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
you have to like give yourself over to
 

625
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,470
you have to like give yourself over to
the

626
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
the
 

627
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,269
the
you have to have this like broad sense

628
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
you have to have this like broad sense
 

629
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,430
you have to have this like broad sense
of what's needed now

630
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
of what's needed now
 

631
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,829
of what's needed now
and both scientifically and like the

632
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
and both scientifically and like the
 

633
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,710
and both scientifically and like the
community

634
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
community
 

635
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,509
community
and just like this it was obvious that

636
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
and just like this it was obvious that
 

637
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,550
and just like this it was obvious that
uh

638
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
uh
 

639
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,829
uh
there was no the interesting thing about

640
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
there was no the interesting thing about
 

641
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,389
there was no the interesting thing about
javascript is

642
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
javascript is
 

643
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,069
javascript is
everything that ran in the browser at

644
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
everything that ran in the browser at
 

645
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,750
everything that ran in the browser at
the time like java

646
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
the time like java
 

647
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,550
the time like java
and and i think other like scheme other

648
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
and and i think other like scheme other
 

649
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,910
and and i think other like scheme other
programming languages

650
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
programming languages
 

651
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,870
programming languages
they were all in a separate external

652
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
they were all in a separate external
 

653
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,470
they were all in a separate external
container

654
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
container
 

655
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,870
container
and then javascript was literally just

656
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
and then javascript was literally just
 

657
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,949
and then javascript was literally just
injected into the web page it was the

658
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
injected into the web page it was the
 

659
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,389
injected into the web page it was the
dumbest possible thing

660
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
dumbest possible thing
 

661
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,470
dumbest possible thing
running in the same thread as everything

662
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
running in the same thread as everything
 

663
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,630
running in the same thread as everything
else and like

664
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
else and like
 

665
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,190
else and like
uh it was inserted as a comment so

666
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
uh it was inserted as a comment so
 

667
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,750
uh it was inserted as a comment so
javascript code is inserted as a comment

668
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
javascript code is inserted as a comment
 

669
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,949
javascript code is inserted as a comment
in the html code and it was i mean it's

670
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
in the html code and it was i mean it's
 

671
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,150
in the html code and it was i mean it's
there's it's either genius or super dumb

672
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
there's it's either genius or super dumb
 

673
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,949
there's it's either genius or super dumb
but it's like

674
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
but it's like
 

675
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,790
but it's like
right so it has no apparatus for like a

676
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
right so it has no apparatus for like a
 

677
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,630
right so it has no apparatus for like a

it just executed in the framework the

680
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
it just executed in the framework the
 

681
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,670
it just executed in the framework the

00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
program is already running
 

683
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,910
program is already running
and it was that's cool and then uh

684
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
and it was that's cool and then uh
 

685
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,110
and it was that's cool and then uh
because something about that

686
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
because something about that
 

687
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,069
because something about that
accessibility

688

accessibility
 

689
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,269
accessibility
the ease of its use uh

690
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
the ease of its use uh
 

691
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,990
the ease of its use uh
resulted in then developers innovating

692
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
resulted in then developers innovating
 

693
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,269
resulted in then developers innovating
on how to actually use it

694
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
on how to actually use it
 

695
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,350
on how to actually use it
i mean i don't even know what to make of

696
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
i mean i don't even know what to make of
 

697
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,710
i mean i don't even know what to make of
that but

698
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
that but
 

699
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,269

it does seem to echo across different

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,670
the random length instructions that
variable length instructions that's

716
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
variable length instructions that's
 

717
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,550
variable length instructions that's
always one

718
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
always one

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
x86 is arguably the worst architecture
 

725
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,030
x86 is arguably the worst architecture
you know on the planet is one of the

726
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
you know on the planet is one of the
 

727
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,190
you know on the planet is one of the
most popular ones well i mean isn't

728
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
most popular ones well i mean isn't
 

729
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,590
most popular ones well i mean isn't
isn't that also the story of risk versus

730
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
isn't that also the story of risk versus
 

731
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,230
isn't that also the story of risk versus
i mean is that simplicity there's

732
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
i mean is that simplicity there's
 

733
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,470
i mean is that simplicity there's
something about simplicity that

734
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
something about simplicity that
 

735
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,150
something about simplicity that
uh us in this evolutionary process

736
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
uh us in this evolutionary process
 

737
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,509
uh us in this evolutionary process
is valued if it's simple it's uh

738
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
is valued if it's simple it's uh
 

739
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,470
is valued if it's simple it's uh
gets it spreads faster it seems like

740
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
gets it spreads faster it seems like
 

741
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,829
gets it spreads faster it seems like
yeah or is that not always true

742
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
yeah or is that not always true
 

743
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,990
yeah or is that not always true
that's always true yeah it could be

744
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
that's always true yeah it could be
 

745
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,069
that's always true yeah it could be
simple is good but too simple is bad

746
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
simple is good but too simple is bad
 

747
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,389
simple is good but too simple is bad
so why did risk win you think so far did

748
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
so why did risk win you think so far did
 

749
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,550
so why did risk win you think so far did
risk win

750
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
risk win
 

751
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,629
risk win
in the long arc of history maybe we

752
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
in the long arc of history maybe we
 

753
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,629
in the long arc of history maybe we
don't know so who who's going to win

754
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
don't know so who who's going to win
 

755
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,470
don't know so who who's going to win
what what's risk what's cisco who's

756
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
what what's risk what's cisco who's
 

757
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,750
what what's risk what's cisco who's
going to win in that space

758
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
going to win in that space
 

759
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,310
going to win in that space
in these instruction sets a ice offers

760
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
in these instruction sets a ice offers
 

761
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,670
in these instruction sets a ice offers
going to win but

762
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
going to win but
 

763
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,350
going to win but
they'll be little computers that run

764
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
they'll be little computers that run
 

765
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,710
they'll be little computers that run
little programs like normal

766
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
little programs like normal
 

767
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,750
little programs like normal
all over the place but but

768
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
all over the place but but
 

769
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,870
all over the place but but
we're we're going through another

770
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
we're we're going through another
 

771
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,790
we're we're going through another
transformation so but

772
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
transformation so but
 

773
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,629
transformation so but
you think instruction sets underneath it

774
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
you think instruction sets underneath it
 

775
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,230
you think instruction sets underneath it
all will change

776
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
all will change
 

777
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,069
all will change
yeah they evolve slowly they don't

778
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
yeah they evolve slowly they don't
 

779
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,269
yeah they evolve slowly they don't
matter very much

780
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
matter very much
 

781
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,190
matter very much
they don't matter very much okay i mean

782
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
they don't matter very much okay i mean
 

783
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,269
they don't matter very much okay i mean
the limits of performance are

784
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
the limits of performance are
 

785
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,870
the limits of performance are
you know predictability of instructions

786
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
you know predictability of instructions
 

787
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,269
you know predictability of instructions
and data i mean that's the big thing

788
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
and data i mean that's the big thing
 

789
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,150
and data i mean that's the big thing
and then the usability of it is some you

790
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
and then the usability of it is some you
 

791
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,910
and then the usability of it is some you
know

like right now x86 is proprietary with
 

799
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,269
like right now x86 is proprietary with

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,509
right arm is proprietary to arm and they
won't let anybody else change it

806
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
won't let anybody else change it
 

807
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,470
won't let anybody else change it
so it's like a sole point and risk 5 is

808
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
so it's like a sole point and risk 5 is
 

809
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,269
so it's like a sole point and risk 5 is

open source
 

811
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,670
open source
so anybody can change it which is super

812
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
so anybody can change it which is super
 

813
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,470
so anybody can change it which is super
cool

814
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
cool
 

815
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,310
cool
but that also might mean it gets changed

816
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
but that also might mean it gets changed
 

817
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,069
but that also might mean it gets changed
in too many random ways that there's no

and then they move faster than others

842
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
and then they move faster than others
 

843
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,350
and then they move faster than others
and also bought one or two of them

844
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
and also bought one or two of them
 

845
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,710
and also bought one or two of them
but there were seven different people

but there were seven different people
 

847
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,110

making x86 because at the time there was
 

849
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,870
making x86 because at the time there was
6502 and z80s and you know 8086

850
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
6502 and z80s and you know 8086
 

851
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,550

and you could argue everybody thought
 

853
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,790

oh and the 6800 so there's like five or

860
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
oh and the 6800 so there's like five or
 

861
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,350
oh and the 6800 so there's like five or
four or five different microprocessors

intel went open got the market share
 

865
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,350
intel went open got the market share
because people felt like they had

866
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
because people felt like they had
 

867
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,110
because people felt like they had
multiple sources from it and then over

868
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
multiple sources from it and then over
 

869
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,509
multiple sources from it and then over
time it narrowed down the two players

870
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
time it narrowed down the two players
 

871

so why you as a historian uh well

872
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
so why you as a historian uh well

and then at the time when the japanese

908
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
and then at the time when the japanese
 

909
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,790

you know they were getting out competed

912
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
you know they were getting out competed
 

913
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,509
you know they were getting out competed
on that and they pivoted the

00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
on that and they pivoted the
 

915
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,350
on that and they pivoted the
microprocessors and they made the first

916

their processor designs were pretty good

944
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
their processor designs were pretty good
 

945
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,189

um
 

947
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,629
um
i think the you know core 2

948
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
i think the you know core 2
 

949
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,710
i think the you know core 2
was probably the first one i thought was

950
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
was probably the first one i thought was
 

951
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,990
was probably the first one i thought was
great

952
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
great
 

953
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
great
it was a really fast processor and then

954
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
it was a really fast processor and then
 

955
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,389
it was a really fast processor and then
haswell was great

956
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
haswell was great
 

957
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,829
haswell was great
what makes a great processor in that

958
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
what makes a great processor in that
 

959
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,269
what makes a great processor in that
delay oh if you just look at it's

963
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,990

it's you know the size of it the you

964
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
it's you know the size of it the you
 

965
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,670
it's you know the size of it the you
know usability of it

966
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
know usability of it
 

967
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,350
know usability of it
so it's not specific some kind of

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
just like literally just raw
 

973
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,389
just like literally just raw
performance is that how you think about

974
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
performance is that how you think about
 

975
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,749
performance is that how you think about
processors it's just like

processors it's just like
 

977
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,110

the fastest one you could and then
 

995
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,790
the fastest one you could and then
people started to have power limits

996
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
people started to have power limits
 

997
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,230
people started to have power limits
so then you made the fastest at the

998
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
so then you made the fastest at the
 

999
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,069
so then you made the fastest at the
right power point and then

1000
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
right power point and then
 

1001
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,269
right power point and then
and then when we started doing

1002
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
and then when we started doing
 

1003
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,430
and then when we started doing
multiprocessors like

1004
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
multiprocessors like
 

1005
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,670
multiprocessors like
if you could scale your processors more

1006
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
if you could scale your processors more
 

1007
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,189
if you could scale your processors more
than the other guy you could be 10

1008
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
than the other guy you could be 10
 

1009
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,110
than the other guy you could be 10
faster on like a single thread but you

1010
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
faster on like a single thread but you
 

1011
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,310
faster on like a single thread but you
have more threads

1012
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
have more threads
 

1013
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,949
have more threads
so there's lots of variability and then

1014
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
so there's lots of variability and then
 

1015
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,949
so there's lots of variability and then
arm

1016
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
arm
 

1017
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,670
arm
really explored like you know they have

1018
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
really explored like you know they have
 

1019
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,949
really explored like you know they have
the a series and the r

1020
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
the a series and the r
 

1021
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,670
the a series and the r
series and the m series like a family of

1022
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
series and the m series like a family of
 

1023
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,189
series and the m series like a family of
processors for all these different

1024
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
processors for all these different
 

1025
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,110
processors for all these different
design points from like unbelievably

1026
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
design points from like unbelievably
 

1027
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,470
design points from like unbelievably
small and simple

1028
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
small and simple
 

1029
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,389
small and simple
and so then when you're doing the design

1030
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
and so then when you're doing the design
 

1031
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,990
and so then when you're doing the design
it's sort of like this big palette of

1032
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
it's sort of like this big palette of
 

1033
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,269
it's sort of like this big palette of
cpus

1034
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
cpus
 

1035
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,710
cpus
like they're the only ones with a

1036
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
like they're the only ones with a
 

1037
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,110
like they're the only ones with a
credible you know top to bottom palette

1038
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
credible you know top to bottom palette
 

1039
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,310
credible you know top to bottom palette
and what do you mean incredible

1040
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
and what do you mean incredible
 

1041
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,590
and what do you mean incredible
top to bottom well there's people who

1042
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
top to bottom well there's people who
 

1043
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,189
top to bottom well there's people who
make microcontrollers that are small but

1044
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
make microcontrollers that are small but
 

1045
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,629
make microcontrollers that are small but
they don't have a fast one there's

1046
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
they don't have a fast one there's
 

1047
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,310
they don't have a fast one there's
people make fast processors but don't

1048
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
people make fast processors but don't
 

1049
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,150
people make fast processors but don't
have a little a medium one or a small

1050
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
have a little a medium one or a small
 

1051
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,949
have a little a medium one or a small
one is it hard to do that full palette

1052
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
one is it hard to do that full palette
 

1053
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,350
one is it hard to do that full palette
that's

1054
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
that's
 

1055
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,630
that's
that seems like a it's a lot of

1056
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
that seems like a it's a lot of
 

1057
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,390
that seems like a it's a lot of
different so what's the difference in

1058
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
different so what's the difference in
 

1059
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,750
different so what's the difference in
uh the arm folks and intel in terms of

1060
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
uh the arm folks and intel in terms of
 

1061
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,510
uh the arm folks and intel in terms of
the way they're approaching this problem

1062
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
the way they're approaching this problem
 

1063
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,630
the way they're approaching this problem
well intel almost all their processor

1064
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
well intel almost all their processor
 

1065
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,510
well intel almost all their processor
designs were

1066
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
designs were
 

1067
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,829
designs were
you know very custom high end you know

1068
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
you know very custom high end you know
 

1069
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,789
you know very custom high end you know
for the last 15

1070
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
for the last 15
 

1071
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,750
for the last 15
20 years the fastest force possible yeah

1072
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
20 years the fastest force possible yeah
 

1073
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,429
20 years the fastest force possible yeah
in one horseshoe

1074
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
in one horseshoe
 

1075
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,350
in one horseshoe
yeah and then architecture they're

1076
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
yeah and then architecture they're
 

1077
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,230
yeah and then architecture they're
really good but the company itself was

1078
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
really good but the company itself was
 

1079
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,230
really good but the company itself was
fairly insular to what's going on in the

1080
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
fairly insular to what's going on in the
 

1081
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
fairly insular to what's going on in the
industry with cad tools and stuff

1082
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
industry with cad tools and stuff
 

1083
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,750
industry with cad tools and stuff
and there's this debate about custom

1084
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
and there's this debate about custom
 

1085
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,669
and there's this debate about custom
design versus synthesis

1086
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
design versus synthesis
 

1087
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,990
design versus synthesis
and how do you approach that i'd say

1088
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
and how do you approach that i'd say
 

1089
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,270
and how do you approach that i'd say
intel was slow on the

1090
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
intel was slow on the
 

1091
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,630
intel was slow on the
getting to synthesize processors arm

1092
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
getting to synthesize processors arm
 

1093
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,070
getting to synthesize processors arm
came in from the bottom and they

1094
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
came in from the bottom and they
 

1095
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,909
came in from the bottom and they
generated ip which went to all kinds of

1096
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
generated ip which went to all kinds of
 

1097
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,710
generated ip which went to all kinds of
customers

1098
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
customers
 

1099
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,230
customers
so they had very little say how the

1100
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
so they had very little say how the
 

1101
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,750
so they had very little say how the
customer implemented their

1102
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
customer implemented their
 

1103
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,029
customer implemented their
ip so arm is super friendly to the

1104
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
ip so arm is super friendly to the
 

1105
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,909
ip so arm is super friendly to the
synthesis ip environment whereas intel

1106
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
synthesis ip environment whereas intel
 

1107
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,590
synthesis ip environment whereas intel
said we're going to make this great

1108
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
said we're going to make this great
 

1109
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,909
said we're going to make this great
client chip server chip with our own cad

1110
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
client chip server chip with our own cad
 

1111
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,310
client chip server chip with our own cad
tools with our own process with our own

1112
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
tools with our own process with our own
 

1113
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,150
tools with our own process with our own
you know other supporting ip and

1114
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
you know other supporting ip and
 

1115
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,270
you know other supporting ip and
everything only works with our stuff

1116
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
everything only works with our stuff
 

1117
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,029
everything only works with our stuff
so is that is arm winning the mobile

1118
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
so is that is arm winning the mobile
 

1119
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,590
so is that is arm winning the mobile
platform space in terms of processors

1120
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
platform space in terms of processors
 

1121
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,270
platform space in terms of processors
and so

1122
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
and so
 

1123
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,909
and so
in that and what you're describing is

1124
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
in that and what you're describing is
 

1125
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,430
in that and what you're describing is
why they're winning well they

1126
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
why they're winning well they
 

1127
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,950
why they're winning well they
had lots of people doing lots of

1128
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
had lots of people doing lots of
 

1129
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,029
had lots of people doing lots of
different experiments so they controlled

1130
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
different experiments so they controlled
 

1131
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,270
different experiments so they controlled
the processor architecture and ip

1132
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
the processor architecture and ip
 

1133
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,870
the processor architecture and ip
but they let people put in lots of

1134
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
but they let people put in lots of
 

1135
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,630
but they let people put in lots of
different chips and there was a lot of

1136
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
different chips and there was a lot of
 

1137
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,029
different chips and there was a lot of
variability in what happened there

1138
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
variability in what happened there
 

1139
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,549
variability in what happened there
whereas intel when they made their

1140
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
whereas intel when they made their
 

1141
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,630
whereas intel when they made their
mobile their foray into mobile they had

1142
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
mobile their foray into mobile they had
 

1143
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,909
mobile their foray into mobile they had
one team doing one

1144
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
one team doing one
 

1145
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,029
one team doing one
part right so it wasn't 10 experiments

1146
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
part right so it wasn't 10 experiments
 

1147
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,830
part right so it wasn't 10 experiments
and then their mindset was pc mindset

1148
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
and then their mindset was pc mindset
 

1149
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,390
and then their mindset was pc mindset
microsoft software mindset and that

1150
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
microsoft software mindset and that
 

1151
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,750
microsoft software mindset and that
brought a whole bunch of things along

1152
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
brought a whole bunch of things along
 

1153
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,230
brought a whole bunch of things along
that

1154
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
that

you know maybe it takes time maybe you
 

1311
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,070
you know maybe it takes time maybe you
have to iterate there's a whole bunch of

1312
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
have to iterate there's a whole bunch of
 

1313

have to iterate there's a whole bunch of
things

1314
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
things
 

1315
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,149
things
you could think about but saying it

1316
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
you could think about but saying it
 

1317
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,230
you could think about but saying it
can't be done is stupid

1318
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
can't be done is stupid
 

1319
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,789
can't be done is stupid
how would you compare so it seems like

1320
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
how would you compare so it seems like
 

1321
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,630
how would you compare so it seems like
elon musk is more

1322
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
elon musk is more
 

1323
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,510
elon musk is more
engineering centric but it's also i

1324
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
engineering centric but it's also i
 

1325
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,190
engineering centric but it's also i
think he considers himself a designer

1326
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
think he considers himself a designer
 

1327
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,870
think he considers himself a designer
too he has a design mind

1328
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
too he has a design mind
 

1329
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,510
too he has a design mind
steve jobs feels like he is much more

1330
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
steve jobs feels like he is much more
 

1331
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,750
steve jobs feels like he is much more
idea space design space versus

1332
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
idea space design space versus
 

1333
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,830
idea space design space versus
engineering yeah just make it happen

1334
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
engineering yeah just make it happen
 

1335
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,990
engineering yeah just make it happen
like the world should be this way just

1336
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
like the world should be this way just
 

1337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,029
like the world should be this way just
figure it out but

1338
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
figure it out but
 

1339
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,350
figure it out but
but he used computers you know he had

1340
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
but he used computers you know he had
 

1341
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,669
but he used computers you know he had
computer people talk to him all the time

1342
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
computer people talk to him all the time
 

1343
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,270
computer people talk to him all the time
like mike was a really good computer guy

1344
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280
like mike was a really good computer guy
 

1345
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,710
like mike was a really good computer guy
he knew what computers could do

1346
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
he knew what computers could do
 

1347
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,710
he knew what computers could do
computer meaning computer hardware like

1348
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
computer meaning computer hardware like
 

1349
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,470
computer meaning computer hardware like
hardware software all of pieces the

1350
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
hardware software all of pieces the
 

1351
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,950
hardware software all of pieces the
whole thing

1352
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
whole thing
 

1353
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,669
whole thing
and then he would you know have an idea

1354
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
and then he would you know have an idea
 

1355
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,390
and then he would you know have an idea
about what could we do with this next

1356
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
about what could we do with this next
 

1357
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,230
about what could we do with this next
that was grounded in reality it wasn't

1358
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
that was grounded in reality it wasn't
 

1359
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,750
that was grounded in reality it wasn't
like he was you know just

1360
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
like he was you know just
 

1361
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,510
like he was you know just
finger painting on the wall and wishing

1362
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
finger painting on the wall and wishing
 

1363
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,870
finger painting on the wall and wishing
somebody would interpret it

1364
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
somebody would interpret it
 

1365
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,710
somebody would interpret it
like so he had this interesting

1366
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
like so he had this interesting
 

1367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,110
like so he had this interesting
connection because

1368
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
connection because
 

1369
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,190
connection because
no he wasn't a computer architect or a

1370
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
no he wasn't a computer architect or a
 

1371
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,149
no he wasn't a computer architect or a
designer

1372
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
designer
 

1373
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,909
designer
but he had an intuition from the

1374
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
but he had an intuition from the
 

1375
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,710
but he had an intuition from the
computers we had to what could happen

1376
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
computers we had to what could happen
 

1377
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,190
computers we had to what could happen
and essentially you say intuition

1378
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
and essentially you say intuition
 

1379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,990
and essentially you say intuition
because

1380
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
because
 

1381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,310
because
it seems like he was pissing off a lot

1382
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
it seems like he was pissing off a lot
 

1383
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,710
it seems like he was pissing off a lot
of engineers in

1384
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
of engineers in
 

1385
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,870
of engineers in
his intuition about what canada can't be

1386
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
his intuition about what canada can't be
 

1387
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,230
his intuition about what canada can't be
done those

1388
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
done those
 

1389
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,950
done those
like the what is all these stories about

1390
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
like the what is all these stories about
 

1391
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,549
like the what is all these stories about
like floppy disks and all that kind of

1392
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
like floppy disks and all that kind of
 

1393
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,029
like floppy disks and all that kind of
stuff like

1394
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
stuff like
 

1395
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,149
stuff like
yeah so in in steve the first round like

1396
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
yeah so in in steve the first round like
 

1397
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,149
yeah so in in steve the first round like
he'd go into a lab

1398
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
he'd go into a lab
 

1399
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,149
he'd go into a lab
and look at what's going on and hate it

1400
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
and look at what's going on and hate it
 

1401
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,190
and look at what's going on and hate it
and and

1402
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
and and
 

1403
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,070
and and
uh fire people or or ask somebody in the

1404
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
uh fire people or or ask somebody in the
 

1405
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,750
uh fire people or or ask somebody in the
elevator what they're doing for apple

1406
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
elevator what they're doing for apple
 

1407
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,149
elevator what they're doing for apple
and you know not be happy when he came

1408
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
and you know not be happy when he came
 

1409
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,390
and you know not be happy when he came
back my impression was

1410
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
back my impression was
 

1411
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,230
back my impression was
is he surrounded himself with this

1412
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
is he surrounded himself with this
 

1413
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,070
is he surrounded himself with this
relatively small group of people

1414
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
relatively small group of people
 

1415
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,310
relatively small group of people
yes and didn't really interact outside

1416
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
yes and didn't really interact outside
 

1417
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,750
yes and didn't really interact outside
of that as much

1418
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
of that as much
 

1419
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,510
of that as much
and then the joke was you'd see like

1420
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
and then the joke was you'd see like
 

1421
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,669
and then the joke was you'd see like
somebody moving a prototype through the

1422
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
somebody moving a prototype through the
 

1423
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,630
somebody moving a prototype through the
quad with a

1424
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
quad with a
 

1425
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,870
quad with a
with a black blanket over it and that

1426
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
with a black blanket over it and that
 

1427
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,789
with a black blanket over it and that
was because it was secret

1428
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
was because it was secret
 

1429
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,310
was because it was secret
you know partly from steve because they

1430
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
you know partly from steve because they
 

1431
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,909
you know partly from steve because they
didn't want steve to see it until it was

1432
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
didn't want steve to see it until it was
 

1433
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,789
didn't want steve to see it until it was
ready

1434
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
ready
 

1435
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,190
ready
yeah the dynamic with johnny ive and

1436
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
yeah the dynamic with johnny ive and
 

1437
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,390
yeah the dynamic with johnny ive and
steve

1438
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
steve
 

1439
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,310
steve
is interesting it's like you don't wanna

1440
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
is interesting it's like you don't wanna
 

1441
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,190
is interesting it's like you don't wanna
he ruins as many ideas as he generates

1442
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
he ruins as many ideas as he generates
 

1443
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,310
he ruins as many ideas as he generates
yeah

1444
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah
 

1445
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,029
yeah
yeah it's a dangerous kind of line to

1446
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
yeah it's a dangerous kind of line to
 

1447
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:41,990
yeah it's a dangerous kind of line to
walk

1448
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
walk
 

1449
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,549
walk
if you have a lot of ideas like like

1450
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
if you have a lot of ideas like like
 

1451
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,549
if you have a lot of ideas like like
gordon bell was famous for ideas

1452
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
gordon bell was famous for ideas
 

1453
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,390
gordon bell was famous for ideas
right and it wasn't that the percentage

1454
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
right and it wasn't that the percentage
 

1455
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,750
right and it wasn't that the percentage
of good ideas was way higher than

1456
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
of good ideas was way higher than
 

1457
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,350
of good ideas was way higher than
anybody else

1458
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
anybody else
 

1459
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,590
anybody else
it was he had so many ideas and and he

1460
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
it was he had so many ideas and and he
 

1461
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,430
it was he had so many ideas and and he
was also good at talking people about it

1462
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
was also good at talking people about it
 

1463
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,750
was also good at talking people about it
and

1464
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
and
 

1465
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,710
and
and getting the filters right and you

1466
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
and getting the filters right and you
 

1467
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,950
and getting the filters right and you
know seeing through stuff

1468
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
know seeing through stuff
 

1469
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,390
know seeing through stuff
whereas elon was like hey i want to

1470
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
whereas elon was like hey i want to
 

1471
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,310
whereas elon was like hey i want to
build rockets so

1472
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
build rockets so
 

1473
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,830
build rockets so
steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys

1474
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys
 

1475
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,470
steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys
and elon would go read rocket manuals

1476
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
and elon would go read rocket manuals
 

1477
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,350
and elon would go read rocket manuals
so ian is a better engineer a sense like

1478
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
so ian is a better engineer a sense like
 

1479
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,430
so ian is a better engineer a sense like
or like more uh

1480
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
or like more uh
 

1481
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,230
or like more uh
like a love and passion for the manuals

1482
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
like a love and passion for the manuals
 

1483
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,789
like a love and passion for the manuals
yeah

1484
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
yeah
 

1485
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,190
yeah
and the details the details the

1486
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
and the details the details the
 

1487
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,710
and the details the details the
craftsmanship too right

1488
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
craftsmanship too right
 

1489
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,630
craftsmanship too right
well i guess you had craftsmanship too

1490
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
well i guess you had craftsmanship too
 

1491
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,149
well i guess you had craftsmanship too
but of a different kind

1492
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
but of a different kind
 

1493
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,470
but of a different kind
what do you make of the just the

1494
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
what do you make of the just the
 

1495
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,909
what do you make of the just the
standard for just a little longer what

1496
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
standard for just a little longer what
 

1497
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,350
standard for just a little longer what
do you make of like the anger and the

1498
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
do you make of like the anger and the
 

1499
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,590
do you make of like the anger and the
passion and all that the the firing and

1500
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
passion and all that the the firing and
 

1501
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,149
passion and all that the the firing and
the

1502
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
the
 

1503
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,590
the
mood swings and the madness the

1504
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
mood swings and the madness the
 

1505
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,230
mood swings and the madness the
um you know being emotional and all that

1506
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
um you know being emotional and all that
 

1507
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,870
um you know being emotional and all that
that's

1508
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
that's
 

1509
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,190
that's
steve and i i guess elon too so what is

1510
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
steve and i i guess elon too so what is
 

1511
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,510
steve and i i guess elon too so what is
that a is that a bugger feature

1512
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,520
that a is that a bugger feature
 

1513
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,230
that a is that a bugger feature
it's a feature so there's a graph which

1514
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
it's a feature so there's a graph which
 

1515
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,350
it's a feature so there's a graph which
is

1516
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
is
 

1517
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,029
is
uh y-axis productivity yeah x-axis at

1518
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
uh y-axis productivity yeah x-axis at
 

1519
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,470
uh y-axis productivity yeah x-axis at
zero it's chaos

1520
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
zero it's chaos
 

1521
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,590
zero it's chaos
yeah and infinity is complete order yeah

1522
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
yeah and infinity is complete order yeah
 

1523
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,029
yeah and infinity is complete order yeah
right so as you go from the

1524
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
right so as you go from the
 

1525
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,070
right so as you go from the
you know the origin as you improve order

1526
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
you know the origin as you improve order
 

1527
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,430
you know the origin as you improve order
you improve productivity

1528
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
you improve productivity
 

1529
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,510
you improve productivity
yeah and at some point productivity

1530
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
yeah and at some point productivity
 

1531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,830
yeah and at some point productivity
peaks and then it goes back down again

1532
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
peaks and then it goes back down again
 

1533
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,669
peaks and then it goes back down again
yeah too much order nothing can happen

1534
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
yeah too much order nothing can happen
 

1535
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,350
yeah too much order nothing can happen
yes but the question is

1536
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
yes but the question is
 

1537
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,990
yes but the question is
is how close to the chaos is that no no

1538
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
is how close to the chaos is that no no
 

1539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,950
is how close to the chaos is that no no
no here's the thing

1540
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
no here's the thing
 

1541
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,630
no here's the thing
is once you start moving the directional

1542
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
is once you start moving the directional
 

1543
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,230
is once you start moving the directional
order the force vector to drive you

1544
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
order the force vector to drive you
 

1545
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,870
order the force vector to drive you
towards order is unstoppable

1546
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
towards order is unstoppable
 

1547
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,190
towards order is unstoppable
oh this is the same every organization

1548
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
oh this is the same every organization
 

1549
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,909
oh this is the same every organization
will

1550
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
will
 

1551
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,029
will
move to the place where their

1552
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
move to the place where their
 

1553
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,029
move to the place where their
productivity is stymied by order

1554
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
productivity is stymied by order
 

1555
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,110
productivity is stymied by order
so you need uh so the question is who's

1556
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
so you need uh so the question is who's
 

1557
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,110
so you need uh so the question is who's
the counter force

1558
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
the counter force
 

1559
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,269
the counter force
like because it also feels really good

1560
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
like because it also feels really good
 

1561
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,710
like because it also feels really good
as you get more organized

1562
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
as you get more organized
 

1563
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,310
as you get more organized
then productivity goes up the

1564
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
then productivity goes up the
 

1565
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,630
then productivity goes up the
organization feels it they orient it

1566
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
organization feels it they orient it
 

1567
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,950
organization feels it they orient it
towards it right to hire more people

1568
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
towards it right to hire more people
 

1569
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,789
towards it right to hire more people
they get more guys who can run process

1570
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
they get more guys who can run process
 

1571
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,390
they get more guys who can run process
you get bigger

1572
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
you get bigger
 

1573
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,669
you get bigger
right and then inevitably inevitably

1574
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
right and then inevitably inevitably
 

1575
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,269
right and then inevitably inevitably
the organization gets captured by the

1576
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
the organization gets captured by the
 

1577
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,870
the organization gets captured by the
bureaucracy that manages all the

1578
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
bureaucracy that manages all the
 

1579
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,510
bureaucracy that manages all the
processes

1580
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
processes
 

1581
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,430
processes
right and then humans really like that

1582
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
right and then humans really like that
 

1583
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,430
right and then humans really like that
and so if you just walk into a room

1584
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
and so if you just walk into a room
 

1585
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,870
and so if you just walk into a room
and say guys love what you're doing

1586
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
and say guys love what you're doing
 

1587
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,870
and say guys love what you're doing
but i need you to have less order

1588
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
but i need you to have less order
 

1589
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,789
but i need you to have less order
if you don't have some force behind that

1590
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
if you don't have some force behind that
 

1591
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,630
if you don't have some force behind that
nothing will happen

1592
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
nothing will happen
 

1593
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,789
nothing will happen
i i can't tell you on how many levels

1594
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
i i can't tell you on how many levels
 

1595
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,310
i i can't tell you on how many levels
that's profound so

1596
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
that's profound so
 

1597
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,029
that's profound so
so that's why i'd say it's a feature now

1598
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
so that's why i'd say it's a feature now
 

1599
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,950
so that's why i'd say it's a feature now
could you be nicer about it

1600
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:16,960
could you be nicer about it
 

1601
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,310
could you be nicer about it
i don't know i don't know any good

1602
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
i don't know i don't know any good
 

1603
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,269
i don't know i don't know any good
examples of being nicer about it

1604
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
examples of being nicer about it
 

1605
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,110
examples of being nicer about it
well the funny thing is to get stuff

1606
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
well the funny thing is to get stuff
 

1607
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,710
well the funny thing is to get stuff
done you need people who can manage

1608
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
done you need people who can manage
 

1609
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,230
done you need people who can manage
stuff and manage people because humans

1610
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
stuff and manage people because humans
 

1611
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,590
stuff and manage people because humans
are complicated they need lots of care

1612
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
are complicated they need lots of care
 

1613
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,110
are complicated they need lots of care
and feeding and you need to tell them

1614
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
and feeding and you need to tell them
 

1615
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,390
and feeding and you need to tell them
they look nice and they're doing good

they look nice and they're doing good
 

1617
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,149
they look nice and they're doing good
stuff and pat them on the back

1618
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
stuff and pat them on the back
 

1619
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,789
stuff and pat them on the back
right i don't know do you tell me is

1620
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
right i don't know do you tell me is
 

1621
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,070
right i don't know do you tell me is
that is that needed

1622
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,080
that is that needed
 

1623
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,590
that is that needed
humans need that i had a friend he

1624
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
humans need that i had a friend he
 

1625
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,510
humans need that i had a friend he
started to manage the group and he said

1626
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
started to manage the group and he said
 

1627
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,590
started to manage the group and he said
i figured it out you have to praise them

1628
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
i figured it out you have to praise them
 

1629
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,269
i figured it out you have to praise them
before they do anything

1630
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
before they do anything
 

1631
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,190
before they do anything
i was waiting until they were done and

1632
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
i was waiting until they were done and
 

1633
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,390
i was waiting until they were done and

you miss him sure yeah he had
parkinson's and then cancer his last 10

1718
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
parkinson's and then cancer his last 10
 

1719
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,870
parkinson's and then cancer his last 10
years were tough

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
years were tough
 

1721
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,549
years were tough
and i killed him killing a man like

1722
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
and i killed him killing a man like
 

1723
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,149
and i killed him killing a man like
that's hard

1724
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
that's hard
 

1725
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,269
that's hard
the mind well it's pretty good um

1726

the mind well it's pretty good um
 

1727
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,710
the mind well it's pretty good um
parkinson's causes slow dementia and uh

1728
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
parkinson's causes slow dementia and uh
 

1729
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,950
parkinson's causes slow dementia and uh
the chemotherapy i think accelerated it

1730
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
the chemotherapy i think accelerated it
 

1731

a friend told me one time i could draw a
computer on the whiteboard faster than

1752
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
computer on the whiteboard faster than
 

1753
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,310
computer on the whiteboard faster than
anybody you'd ever met

1754
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
anybody you'd ever met

i was driving by this bridge and i was
 

1761
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,190
i was driving by this bridge and i was
thinking about it and he pulled out a

1762
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
thinking about it and he pulled out a
 

1763
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,470
thinking about it and he pulled out a
piece of paper and he'd draw the whole

1764
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
piece of paper and he'd draw the whole
 

1765
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,350
piece of paper and he'd draw the whole
bridge

1766
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
bridge
 

1767
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,669
bridge
he was a mechanical engineer yeah and he

1768
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
he was a mechanical engineer yeah and he
 

1769
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,110
he was a mechanical engineer yeah and he
would just draw the whole thing and then

1770
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
would just draw the whole thing and then
 

1771
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,389
would just draw the whole thing and then
he would tell me about it and

1772
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
he would tell me about it and
 

1773
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,549
he would tell me about it and
tell me how you would have changed it

1774
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
tell me how you would have changed it
 

1775
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,310
tell me how you would have changed it
and he had this you know

1776
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
and he had this you know
 

1777

and he had this you know
idea that he could understand and

1778
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
idea that he could understand and
 

1779
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,310
idea that he could understand and

people draw a little box
 

1793
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,630
people draw a little box
you know and then they'll say and then

1794
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
you know and then they'll say and then
 

1795
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,470
you know and then they'll say and then
this talks to this and yeah

1796
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
this talks to this and yeah
 

1797
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,149
this talks to this and yeah
i'd be like this is frustrating and i

1798
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
i'd be like this is frustrating and i
 

1799
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,750
i'd be like this is frustrating and i
had this other guy come in one time he

1800
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
had this other guy come in one time he
 

1801
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,470
had this other guy come in one time he
says

1802
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,480
says
 

1803
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,149
says
well i designed a floating point in this

1804
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
well i designed a floating point in this
 

1805
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,430
well i designed a floating point in this
chip but i'd really like to tell you how

1806
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
chip but i'd really like to tell you how
 

1807
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,630
chip but i'd really like to tell you how
the whole thing works and then tell you

1808
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:36,640
the whole thing works and then tell you
 

1809
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,990
the whole thing works and then tell you
how the floating point works inside of

1810
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
how the floating point works inside of
 

1811
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,029
how the floating point works inside of
it do you mind if i do that

1812
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
it do you mind if i do that
 

1813
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,110
it do you mind if i do that
he covered two whiteboards yeah like 30

1814
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
he covered two whiteboards yeah like 30
 

1815
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,710
he covered two whiteboards yeah like 30
minutes and i hired him

1816
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
minutes and i hired him
 

1817
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,190
minutes and i hired him
like yeah he was great this is craftsman

1818
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
like yeah he was great this is craftsman
 

1819
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,870
like yeah he was great this is craftsman
i mean that's the craftsmanship to that

1820
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
i mean that's the craftsmanship to that
 

1821
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,430
i mean that's the craftsmanship to that
yeah but also the the mental agility to

1822
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
yeah but also the the mental agility to
 

1823
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,190
yeah but also the the mental agility to
understand the whole thing

1824
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
understand the whole thing
 

1825
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,750
understand the whole thing
right put the pieces in contacts like

1826
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
right put the pieces in contacts like
 

1827
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,710
right put the pieces in contacts like
you know

1828
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
you know
 

1829
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,549
you know
real view of the balance of how the

1830
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
real view of the balance of how the
 

1831
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,549
real view of the balance of how the
design worked

1832
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
design worked
 

1833
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,389
design worked
because if you don't understand it

1834
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
because if you don't understand it
 

1835
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,070
because if you don't understand it
properly when you start to draw it

1836
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
properly when you start to draw it
 

1837
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,909
properly when you start to draw it
you'll fill up half the white board with

1838
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
you'll fill up half the white board with
 

1839
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,430
you'll fill up half the white board with
like a little piece of it and

1840
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
like a little piece of it and
 

1841
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,990
like a little piece of it and
you know like your ability to lay it out

1842
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
you know like your ability to lay it out
 

1843
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,590
you know like your ability to lay it out
in an understandable way it takes a lot

1844
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
in an understandable way it takes a lot
 

1845
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,350
in an understandable way it takes a lot
of understanding so

1846
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
of understanding so
 

1847
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,350
of understanding so
and be able to zoom into the detail and

1848
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
and be able to zoom into the detail and
 

1849
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,870
and be able to zoom into the detail and
then zoom out to the zoom

1850
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
then zoom out to the zoom
 

1851
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,269
then zoom out to the zoom
really fast what about the impossible

1852
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
really fast what about the impossible
 

1853
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,269
really fast what about the impossible
thing you see your dad

1854
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
thing you see your dad
 

1855
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,789
thing you see your dad
believed that uh you could do anything

1856
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
believed that uh you could do anything
 

1857
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,350
believed that uh you could do anything
that's a weird feature for a craftsman

1858
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
that's a weird feature for a craftsman
 

1859
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,549
that's a weird feature for a craftsman
yeah

1860
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
yeah
 

1861
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,990
yeah
it seems that that uh echoes in your own

1862
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
it seems that that uh echoes in your own
 

1863
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,710
it seems that that uh echoes in your own
behavior

1864
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
behavior
 

1865
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,710
behavior
like that's that's the well it's not

1866
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
like that's that's the well it's not
 

1867
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,070
like that's that's the well it's not
that anybody can do anything right now

1868
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,080
that anybody can do anything right now
 

1869
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,230
that anybody can do anything right now
right it's that if you work at it you

1870
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
right it's that if you work at it you
 

1871
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,510
right it's that if you work at it you
can get better at it

1872
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,520
can get better at it
 

1873
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,870
can get better at it
and there might not be a limit

1874
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880

 

1875
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,710

and they did funny things like like he

1876
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:44,720
and they did funny things like like he
 

1877
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,389
and they did funny things like like he
always wanted to play piano so at the

1878
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
always wanted to play piano so at the
 

1879
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,510
always wanted to play piano so at the
end of his life he started playing the

1880
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
end of his life he started playing the
 

1881
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,230
end of his life he started playing the
piano

1882
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
piano
 

1883
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,070
piano
when he had parkinson's and he was

1884
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
when he had parkinson's and he was
 

1885
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,430
when he had parkinson's and he was
terrible

1886
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
terrible
 

1887
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,870
terrible
but he thought if he really worked out

1888
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
but he thought if he really worked out
 

1889
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,549
but he thought if he really worked out
in this life maybe the next life he'd be

1890
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
in this life maybe the next life he'd be
 

1891
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,230
in this life maybe the next life he'd be
better at it

1892
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
better at it
 

1893
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,430
better at it
he might be onto something yeah

1894
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
he might be onto something yeah
 

1895
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,830
he might be onto something yeah
he enjoyed doing it yeah so that's

1896
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
he enjoyed doing it yeah so that's
 

1897
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,710
he enjoyed doing it yeah so that's
pretty funny do you think the

1898
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
pretty funny do you think the
 

1899
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,149
pretty funny do you think the
perfect is the enemy of the good in

1900
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
perfect is the enemy of the good in
 

1901
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,990
perfect is the enemy of the good in
hardware and software engineering

1902
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
hardware and software engineering
 

1903
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,190
hardware and software engineering
it's like we were talking about

1904
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
it's like we were talking about
 

1905
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,110
it's like we were talking about
javascript a little bit and

1906
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
javascript a little bit and
 

1907
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,590
javascript a little bit and
the messiness of the 10-day building

1908
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
the messiness of the 10-day building
 

1909
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,789
the messiness of the 10-day building
process

1910
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
process
 

1911
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,830
process
yeah it's you know creative tension

1912
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
yeah it's you know creative tension
 

1913
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,950
yeah it's you know creative tension
right

1914
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
right
 

1915
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,549
right
the creative tension is you have two

1916
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
the creative tension is you have two
 

1917
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,750
the creative tension is you have two
different ideas that you can't do both

1918
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
different ideas that you can't do both
 

1919
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,990
different ideas that you can't do both
right right and then but the fact that

1920
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
right right and then but the fact that
 

1921
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,590
right right and then but the fact that
you want to do both

1922
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
you want to do both
 

1923
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,350
you want to do both
causes you to go try to solve that

1924
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
causes you to go try to solve that
 

1925
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,990
causes you to go try to solve that
problem that's the creative part

1926
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
problem that's the creative part
 

1927
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,190
problem that's the creative part
so if you're building computers like

1928
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
so if you're building computers like
 

1929
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,950
so if you're building computers like
some people say we have the schedule

1930
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
some people say we have the schedule
 

1931
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,310
some people say we have the schedule
and anything that doesn't fit in the

1932
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
and anything that doesn't fit in the
 

1933
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,070
and anything that doesn't fit in the
schedule we can't do

1934
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
schedule we can't do
 

1935
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,909
schedule we can't do
right so they throw out the perfect

1936
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
right so they throw out the perfect
 

1937
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,149
right so they throw out the perfect
because they have a schedule

1938
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
because they have a schedule
 

1939
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,750
because they have a schedule
i hate that then there's other people

1940
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
i hate that then there's other people
 

1941
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,430
i hate that then there's other people
who say we need to get this perfectly

1942
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
who say we need to get this perfectly
 

1943
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,470
who say we need to get this perfectly
right

1944
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
right
 

1945
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,789
right
and no matter what you know more people

1946
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
and no matter what you know more people
 

1947
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,909
and no matter what you know more people
more money

1948
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:53,919
more money
 

1949
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,029
more money
right and there's a really clear idea

1950
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
right and there's a really clear idea
 

1951
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,230
right and there's a really clear idea
about what you want some people are

1952
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
about what you want some people are
 

1953
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,669
about what you want some people are
going to articulate in it

1954
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
going to articulate in it
 

1955
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,909
going to articulate in it
right so let's call that the perfect

1956
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
right so let's call that the perfect
 

1957
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,110
right so let's call that the perfect
yeah yeah

1958
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
yeah yeah
 

1959
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,549
yeah yeah
all right but that's also terrible

1960
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
all right but that's also terrible
 

1961
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,149
all right but that's also terrible
because they never ship anything you

1962
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
because they never ship anything you
 

1963
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,269
because they never ship anything you
never hit any goals

1964
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
never hit any goals
 

1965
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,789
never hit any goals
so now you have that now you have your

1966
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
so now you have that now you have your
 

1967
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,350
so now you have that now you have your
framework yes you can't throw out stuff

1968
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
framework yes you can't throw out stuff
 

1969
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,630
framework yes you can't throw out stuff
because you can't get it done today

1970
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
because you can't get it done today
 

1971
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,830
because you can't get it done today
because maybe you get it done tomorrow

1972
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840
because maybe you get it done tomorrow
 

1973
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,190
because maybe you get it done tomorrow
or the next project

1974
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
or the next project
 

1975
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,470
or the next project
right you can't so you have to i work

1976
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
right you can't so you have to i work
 

1977
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,909
right you can't so you have to i work
with a guy that i really like working

1978
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:19,919
with a guy that i really like working
 

1979
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,389
with a guy that i really like working
with

1980
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
with
 

1981
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,350
with
but he over filters his ideas over

1982
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
but he over filters his ideas over
 

1983
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,630
but he over filters his ideas over
filters

1984
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
filters
 

1985
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,549
filters
he'd start thinking about something and

1986
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
he'd start thinking about something and
 

1987
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,590
he'd start thinking about something and
as soon as he figure out what's wrong

1988
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
as soon as he figure out what's wrong
 

1989
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,750
as soon as he figure out what's wrong
with it you'd throw it out

1990
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
with it you'd throw it out
 

1991
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,350
with it you'd throw it out
and then i start thinking about it like

1992
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
and then i start thinking about it like
 

1993
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,630
and then i start thinking about it like
you know you come up with an idea and

1994
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
you know you come up with an idea and
 

1995
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,870
you know you come up with an idea and
then you find out what's wrong with it

1996
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
then you find out what's wrong with it
 

1997
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,389
then you find out what's wrong with it
and then you give it a little time to

1998
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
and then you give it a little time to
 

1999
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,750
and then you give it a little time to
set because sometimes you know you

2000
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
set because sometimes you know you
 

2001
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,389
set because sometimes you know you
figure out

2002
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
figure out
 

2003
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,230
figure out
how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps

2004
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps
 

2005
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,389
how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps
some other idea

2006
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:42,399
some other idea
 

2007
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,110
some other idea
so idea generation is really funny so

2008
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
so idea generation is really funny so
 

2009
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,789
so idea generation is really funny so
you have to give your ideas space

2010
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
you have to give your ideas space
 

2011
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,830
you have to give your ideas space
like spaciousness of mind is key but you

2012
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
like spaciousness of mind is key but you
 

2013
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,830
like spaciousness of mind is key but you
also have to execute programs and get

2014
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
also have to execute programs and get
 

2015
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,190
also have to execute programs and get
 done

2016
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
done
 

2017
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,630
done
and then it turns out computer

2018
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
and then it turns out computer
 

2019
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,149
and then it turns out computer
engineering is fun because it takes you

2020
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
engineering is fun because it takes you
 

2021
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,149
engineering is fun because it takes you
know 100 people to build a computer

2022

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,430
people are so
variable about you know temperament and

2028
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
variable about you know temperament and
 

2029
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,590

you know skill sets and stuff
 

2031
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,430
you know skill sets and stuff
that you know in a big organization you

2032
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
that you know in a big organization you
 

2033
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,870
that you know in a big organization you
find that the people who love the

00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
to get stuff done yesterday and
 

2039
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,470
to get stuff done yesterday and
people like to come up with ideas and

2040
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
people like to come up with ideas and
 

2041
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,830
people like to come up with ideas and
people like to

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
people like to
 

2043
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,830
people like to
let's say shoot down ideas and it takes

2044
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:19,840
let's say shoot down ideas and it takes
 

2045
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,190
let's say shoot down ideas and it takes
the whole

2046
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
the whole
 

2047
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,430
the whole
it takes a large group of people some

2048
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
it takes a large group of people some
 

2049
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,710
it takes a large group of people some
are good at generating ideas some are

2050
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
are good at generating ideas some are
 

2051
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,310
are good at generating ideas some are
good at filtering ideas and then

2052
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
good at filtering ideas and then
 

2053
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,870
good at filtering ideas and then
all in that giant mess you somehow

2054
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
all in that giant mess you somehow
 

2055
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,950
all in that giant mess you somehow
i guess the goal is for that giant mess

2056
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:32,960
i guess the goal is for that giant mess
 

2057
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,870
i guess the goal is for that giant mess
of people to uh

2058
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
of people to uh
 

2059
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,710
of people to uh
find the perfect path through the

2060
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
find the perfect path through the
 

2061
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,310
find the perfect path through the
attention the creative tension

2062
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
attention the creative tension
 

2063
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,190
attention the creative tension
but like how do you know when you said

2064
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
but like how do you know when you said
 

2065
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,789
but like how do you know when you said
there's some people good at articulating

2066
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
there's some people good at articulating
 

2067
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,990
there's some people good at articulating
what perfect looks like what a good

2068
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
what perfect looks like what a good
 

2069
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,990
what perfect looks like what a good
design is like if you're sitting in a

2070
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
design is like if you're sitting in a
 

2071
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,950
design is like if you're sitting in a
in a room and uh you have a set of ideas

2072
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
in a room and uh you have a set of ideas
 

2073
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,549
in a room and uh you have a set of ideas
about like how to design uh a better

2074
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
about like how to design uh a better
 

2075
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,549
about like how to design uh a better
processor how do you know

2076
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
processor how do you know
 

2077
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,710
processor how do you know
this is this is something special here

2078
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
this is this is something special here
 

2079
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,669
this is this is something special here
this is a good idea

2080
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
this is a good idea
 

2081
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,269
this is a good idea
let's try this so have you ever

2082
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
let's try this so have you ever
 

2083
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,870
let's try this so have you ever
brainstormed idea with a couple people

2084
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
brainstormed idea with a couple people
 

2085
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,389
brainstormed idea with a couple people
that were really smart

2086
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:04,399
that were really smart
 

2087
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,149
that were really smart
and you kind of go into it and you you

2088
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
and you kind of go into it and you you
 

2089
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,430
and you kind of go into it and you you
don't quite understand it

2090
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
don't quite understand it
 

2091
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,990
don't quite understand it
and you're working on it and then you

2092
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,000
and you're working on it and then you
 

2093
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,869
and you're working on it and then you
start you know

2094
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
start you know
 

2095
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,629
start you know
talking about it putting it on the

2096
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
talking about it putting it on the
 

2097
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,909
talking about it putting it on the
whiteboard

2098
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
whiteboard
 

2099
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,310
whiteboard
maybe it takes days or weeks and then

2100
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
maybe it takes days or weeks and then
 

2101
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,470
maybe it takes days or weeks and then
your brain start to kind of synchronize

2102
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
your brain start to kind of synchronize
 

2103
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,349
your brain start to kind of synchronize
it's really weird and like you start to

2104
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
it's really weird and like you start to
 

2105
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,829
it's really weird and like you start to
see what each other is thinking

2106
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839

 

2107
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,629

and yeah and it starts to work like you

2108
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
and yeah and it starts to work like you
 

2109
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,470
and yeah and it starts to work like you
can see work like my talent in computer

2110
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
can see work like my talent in computer
 

2111
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,669
can see work like my talent in computer
design is i can

2112
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
design is i can
 

2113
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,149
design is i can
i can see how computers work in my head

2114
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
i can see how computers work in my head
 

2115
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,190
i can see how computers work in my head
like really well

2116
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
like really well
 

2117
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,190
like really well
and i know other people can do that too

2118
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
and i know other people can do that too
 

2119
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,550
and i know other people can do that too
and when you're working with people that

2120
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560
and when you're working with people that
 

2121
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,310
and when you're working with people that
can do that

2122
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
can do that
 

2123
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,430
can do that
like it is kind of a an amazing

2124
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
like it is kind of a an amazing
 

2125
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,190
like it is kind of a an amazing
experience

2126
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
experience
 

2127
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,349
experience
and then and every once in a while you

2128
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359
and then and every once in a while you
 

2129
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,629
and then and every once in a while you
get to that place and then you find the

2130
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
get to that place and then you find the
 

2131
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,270
get to that place and then you find the
flaw

2132
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
flaw
 

2133
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,790
flaw
which is kind of funny because you you

2134
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
which is kind of funny because you you
 

2135
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,109
which is kind of funny because you you
can you can fool yourself in

2136
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
can you can fool yourself in
 

2137
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,909
can you can fool yourself in
but the two of you kind of drifted along

2138
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
but the two of you kind of drifted along
 

2139
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,310
but the two of you kind of drifted along
yeah

2140
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
yeah
 

2141
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,310
yeah
into the direction that was useless yeah

2142
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
into the direction that was useless yeah
 

2143
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,870
into the direction that was useless yeah
that happens too like you have to

2144
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,880
that happens too like you have to
 

2145
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,349
that happens too like you have to
because you know well the nice thing

2146
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
because you know well the nice thing
 

2147
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,390
because you know well the nice thing
about computer design there's always

2148
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
about computer design there's always
 

2149
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,430
about computer design there's always
reduction in practice

2150
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
reduction in practice
 

2151
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,910
reduction in practice
like you come up with your good ideas

2152
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
like you come up with your good ideas
 

2153
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,589
like you come up with your good ideas
and i know some architects who really

2154
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
and i know some architects who really
 

2155
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,950
and i know some architects who really
love ideas

2156
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
love ideas
 

2157
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,310
love ideas
and then they work on them and they put

2158
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
and then they work on them and they put
 

2159
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,829
and then they work on them and they put
it on the shelf they go work on the next

2160
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839
it on the shelf they go work on the next
 

2161
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,109
it on the shelf they go work on the next
idea and put on the shelf they never

2162
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,119
idea and put on the shelf they never
 

2163
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,630
idea and put on the shelf they never
reduce the practice

2164
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:16,640
reduce the practice
 

2165
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,630
reduce the practice
so they find out what's good and bad

2166
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
so they find out what's good and bad
 

2167
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,910
so they find out what's good and bad
because most

2168
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
because most
 

2169
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,510
because most
every time i've done something really

2170
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
every time i've done something really
 

2171
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,310
every time i've done something really
new by the time it's done

2172
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
new by the time it's done
 

2173
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,990
new by the time it's done
like the good parts are good but i know

flaws or by successes
 

2185
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,790
flaws or by successes
like if again there's great tension

2186
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800
like if again there's great tension

right then you're not going to be facing
 

2195
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,270
right then you're not going to be facing
the challenges when you build it then

2196
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
the challenges when you build it then
 

2197
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,829
the challenges when you build it then
you find out all the problems with it

2198
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
you find out all the problems with it
 

2199
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,910
you find out all the problems with it
and but when you look back you see

2200
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
and but when you look back you see

00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,829
okay oh when i look back um what do you
think earlier in my career

2206
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
think earlier in my career
 

2207
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,589
think earlier in my career
yeah like eb5 was the second alpha chip

2208
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:03,599
yeah like eb5 was the second alpha chip
 

2209
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,910
yeah like eb5 was the second alpha chip
uh i was so embarrassed about the

2210
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
uh i was so embarrassed about the
 

2211
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,470
uh i was so embarrassed about the
mistake so i could barely talk about it

2212
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
mistake so i could barely talk about it
 

2213
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,589
mistake so i could barely talk about it
and it was in the guinness book of

2214
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
and it was in the guinness book of
 

2215
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,950
and it was in the guinness book of
worlds records and it was the fastest

2216
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
worlds records and it was the fastest
 

2217
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,310
worlds records and it was the fastest
processor on the planet

2218
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
processor on the planet
 

2219
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,349
processor on the planet
yeah so it was and at some point i

2220
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
yeah so it was and at some point i
 

2221
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,510
yeah so it was and at some point i
realized that was really a bad

2222
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
realized that was really a bad
 

2223
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,430
realized that was really a bad
mental framework to deal with like doing

2224
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
mental framework to deal with like doing
 

2225
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,710
mental framework to deal with like doing
something new we did a bunch of new

2226
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
something new we did a bunch of new
 

2227
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,069
something new we did a bunch of new
things and some worked out great and

2228
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:22,079
things and some worked out great and
 

2229
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,270
things and some worked out great and
some were bad

2230
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
some were bad
 

2231
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,150
some were bad
and we learned a lot from it and then

2232
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
and we learned a lot from it and then
 

2233
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,910
and we learned a lot from it and then
the next one we learned a lot

2234
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
the next one we learned a lot
 

2235
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,109
the next one we learned a lot
that also ev6 also had some really cool

2236
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
that also ev6 also had some really cool
 

2237
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,870
that also ev6 also had some really cool
things in it i think the proportion of

2238
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880
things in it i think the proportion of
 

2239
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,750
things in it i think the proportion of
good stuff went

2240
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
good stuff went
 

2241
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,470
good stuff went
up but it had a couple of fatal flaws in

2242
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
up but it had a couple of fatal flaws in
 

2243
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,750
up but it had a couple of fatal flaws in
it that were

2244
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,760
it that were
 

2245
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,870
it that were
painful and then uh

2246
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880
painful and then uh
 

2247
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,349
painful and then uh
yeah you learn to channel the pain into

2248
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
yeah you learn to channel the pain into
 

2249
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,550
yeah you learn to channel the pain into
like pride

2250
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:44,560
like pride
 

2251
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,589
like pride
not pride really you know just uh

2252
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
not pride really you know just uh
 

2253
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,670
not pride really you know just uh
realization about how the world works

2254
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
realization about how the world works
 

2255

00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
you know light and darkness that you
 

2275
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,630
you know light and darkness that you
have to tolerate and

2276
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640
have to tolerate and
 

2277
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,630
have to tolerate and
you know deal with yeah there's

2278
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
you know deal with yeah there's
 

2279
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,829
you know deal with yeah there's
definitely lots of suffering in the

2280
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
definitely lots of suffering in the
 

2281
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,470
definitely lots of suffering in the
world

2282
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
world
 

2283
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,069
world
depends on the perspective it seems like

2284
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
depends on the perspective it seems like
 

2285
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,990
depends on the perspective it seems like
there's way more darkness but uh

2286
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
there's way more darkness but uh
 

2287
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,550
there's way more darkness but uh
that makes the light part really nice

2288
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
that makes the light part really nice
 

2289
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,430
that makes the light part really nice
what uh

2290
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
what uh
 

2291
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,950
what uh
computing hardware

2292
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
computing hardware
 

2293
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,829
computing hardware
or just any kind of even software design

2294
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
or just any kind of even software design
 

2295
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,310
or just any kind of even software design
are you

2296
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
are you
 

2297
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,190
are you
uh do you find beautiful from your own

2298
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,200
uh do you find beautiful from your own
 

2299
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,030
uh do you find beautiful from your own
work from

2300
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,040
work from
 

2301
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,990
work from
other people's work that you're just uh

2302
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,000
other people's work that you're just uh
 

2303
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,230
other people's work that you're just uh
we were just talking about the

2304
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
we were just talking about the
 

2305
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,550
we were just talking about the
the battleground of flaws and mistakes

2306
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
the battleground of flaws and mistakes
 

2307
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,950
the battleground of flaws and mistakes
and errors but things that were just

2308
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
and errors but things that were just
 

2309
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,109
and errors but things that were just
beautifully done is there something that

2310
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
beautifully done is there something that
 

2311
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,310
beautifully done is there something that
pops to mind

2312
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
pops to mind
 

2313
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,829
pops to mind
well when things are beautifully done

2314
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
well when things are beautifully done
 

2315
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,190
well when things are beautifully done
usually there's a well thought out set

2316
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
usually there's a well thought out set
 

2317
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,589
usually there's a well thought out set
of abstraction layers

2318
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,599
of abstraction layers
 

2319
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,910
of abstraction layers
so the whole thing works in unison

2320
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
so the whole thing works in unison
 

2321
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,270
so the whole thing works in unison
nicely yes

2322
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280
nicely yes
 

2323
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,270
nicely yes
and and when i say abstraction layer

2324
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,280
and and when i say abstraction layer
 

2325
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,190
and and when i say abstraction layer
that means two different components when

2326
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
that means two different components when
 

2327
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,349
that means two different components when
they work together

2328
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
they work together
 

2329
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,349
they work together
they work independently they don't have

2330
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
they work independently they don't have
 

2331
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,589
they work independently they don't have
to know what the other one is doing

2332
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:07,599
to know what the other one is doing
 

2333
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,829
to know what the other one is doing
so that decoupling yeah so the famous

2334
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
so that decoupling yeah so the famous
 

2335
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,510
so that decoupling yeah so the famous
one was the the network stack like

2336
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
one was the the network stack like
 

2337
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,950
one was the the network stack like
there's a seven layer network

2338
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
there's a seven layer network
 

2339
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,190
there's a seven layer network
you know data transport and protocol and

2340
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
you know data transport and protocol and
 

2341
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,230
you know data transport and protocol and
all the layers

2342
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
all the layers
 

2343
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,910
all the layers
and the innovation was is when they

2344
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,920
and the innovation was is when they
 

2345
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,829
and the innovation was is when they
really wrote got that right

2346
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
really wrote got that right
 

2347
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,190
really wrote got that right
because networks before that didn't

2348
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,200
because networks before that didn't
 

2349
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,069
because networks before that didn't
define those very well the layers could

2350
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
define those very well the layers could
 

2351
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,950
define those very well the layers could
innovate independently and occasionally

2352
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:26,960
innovate independently and occasionally
 

2353
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,390
innovate independently and occasionally
the layer boundary would

2354
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
the layer boundary would
 

2355
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,870
the layer boundary would
you know the interface would be upgraded

2356
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
you know the interface would be upgraded
 

2357
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,990
you know the interface would be upgraded
and that that let

2358
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,000
and that that let
 

2359
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,630
and that that let
you know the the design space breathe

2360
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
you know the the design space breathe
 

2361
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,589
you know the the design space breathe
and

2362
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
and
 

2363
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,349
and
you could do something new in layer

2364
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
you could do something new in layer
 

2365
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,870
you could do something new in layer
seven without having to worry about how

2366
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
seven without having to worry about how
 

2367
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,510
seven without having to worry about how
layer four

2368
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,520
layer four
 

2369
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,630
layer four
worked right and so good design does

2370
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:42,640
worked right and so good design does
 

2371
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,030
worked right and so good design does
that and you see it in processor designs

2372
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
that and you see it in processor designs
 

2373
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,470
that and you see it in processor designs
when we did the zen design at amd

2374
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,480
when we did the zen design at amd
 

2375
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,829
when we did the zen design at amd
we made several components very modular

2376
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:51,839
we made several components very modular
 

2377
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,310
we made several components very modular
and you know my insistence at the top

2378
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
and you know my insistence at the top
 

2379
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,470
and you know my insistence at the top
was i wanted all the interfaces to find

2380
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
was i wanted all the interfaces to find
 

2381
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,109
was i wanted all the interfaces to find
before we wrote the rtl for the pieces

2382
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
before we wrote the rtl for the pieces
 

2383
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,349
before we wrote the rtl for the pieces
one of the verification leads said if we

2384
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:01,359
one of the verification leads said if we
 

2385
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,589
one of the verification leads said if we
do this right i can test the pieces

2386
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
do this right i can test the pieces
 

2387
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,430
do this right i can test the pieces
so well independently when we put it

2388
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,440
so well independently when we put it
 

2389
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,270
so well independently when we put it
together we won't find all these

2390
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
together we won't find all these
 

2391
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,630
together we won't find all these
interaction bugs because the floating

2392
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
interaction bugs because the floating
 

2393
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,550
interaction bugs because the floating
point knows how the cache works

2394
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
point knows how the cache works
 

2395
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,470
point knows how the cache works
and i was a little skeptical but he was

2396
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480
and i was a little skeptical but he was
 

2397
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,069
and i was a little skeptical but he was
mostly right

2398
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
mostly right
 

2399
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,030
mostly right
that the modularity design greatly

2400
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
that the modularity design greatly
 

2401
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,870
that the modularity design greatly
improved the quality

2402
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:18,880
improved the quality
 

2403
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,390
improved the quality
is that universally true in general

2404
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
is that universally true in general
 

2405
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,829
is that universally true in general
would you say about good designs the

2406
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
would you say about good designs the
 

2407
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,349
would you say about good designs the
modularity is

2408
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
modularity is
 

2409
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,109
modularity is
like usually talked about this before

2410
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
like usually talked about this before
 

2411
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,870
like usually talked about this before
humans are only so smart like

2412
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
humans are only so smart like
 

2413
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,349
humans are only so smart like
and we're not getting any smarter right

2414
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
and we're not getting any smarter right
 

2415
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,910
and we're not getting any smarter right
but the complexity of things is going up

2416
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
but the complexity of things is going up
 

2417
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,430
but the complexity of things is going up
yeah so you know a beautiful design

2418
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
yeah so you know a beautiful design
 

2419
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,910
yeah so you know a beautiful design
can't be bigger than the person doing it

2420
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
can't be bigger than the person doing it
 

2421
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,910
can't be bigger than the person doing it
it's just you know their piece of it

2422
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
it's just you know their piece of it
 

2423
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,589
it's just you know their piece of it
like the odds of you doing a really

design of something that's way too hard

2428
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
design of something that's way too hard
 

2429
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,190
design of something that's way too hard
for you is slow

2430
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
for you is slow
 

2431
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,910
for you is slow
right if it's way too simple for you

2432
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
right if it's way too simple for you
 

2433
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,430
right if it's way too simple for you
it's not that interesting it's like well

2434
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
it's not that interesting it's like well
 

2435
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,470
it's not that interesting it's like well
anybody could do that

2436
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
anybody could do that
 

2437
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,670
anybody could do that
but when you get the right match of your

2438
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
but when you get the right match of your
 

2439
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,550
but when you get the right match of your
your expertise and you know mental power

2440
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,560
your expertise and you know mental power
 

2441
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,550
your expertise and you know mental power
to the right design size

2442
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
to the right design size
 

2443
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,390
to the right design size
that's cool but that's not big enough to

2444
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
that's cool but that's not big enough to
 

2445
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,150
that's cool but that's not big enough to
make a meaningful impact in the world

2446
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
make a meaningful impact in the world
 

2447
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,790
make a meaningful impact in the world
so now you have to have some framework

2448
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:04,800
so now you have to have some framework
 

2449
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,790
so now you have to have some framework
to design the pieces

2450
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
to design the pieces
 

2451
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,829
to design the pieces
so that the whole thing is big and

2452
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839
so that the whole thing is big and
 

2453
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:09,990
so that the whole thing is big and
harmonious

2454
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
harmonious
 

2455
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,430
harmonious
but you know when you put it together

2456
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
but you know when you put it together
 

2457
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,829
but you know when you put it together
it's

2458
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:13,839
it's
 

2459
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,910
it's
you know sufficiently sufficiently

2460
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
you know sufficiently sufficiently
 

2461
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,710
you know sufficiently sufficiently
interesting to to be used

2462
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720
interesting to to be used
 

2463
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,470
interesting to to be used
and you know so that's like a beautiful

2464
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480
and you know so that's like a beautiful
 

2465
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,349
and you know so that's like a beautiful
design is

2466
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359

 

2467
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,309

matching the limits of that human

2468
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
matching the limits of that human
 

2469
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,910
matching the limits of that human
cognitive capacity

2470
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
cognitive capacity
 

2471
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,710
cognitive capacity
to uh to the module you can create and

2472
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
to uh to the module you can create and
 

2473
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,230
to uh to the module you can create and
creating a nice interface between those

2474
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
creating a nice interface between those
 

2475
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,030
creating a nice interface between those
modules

2476
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,040
modules
 

2477
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,390
modules
and thereby do you think there's a limit

2478
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
and thereby do you think there's a limit
 

2479
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,950
and thereby do you think there's a limit
to the kind of beautiful complex systems

2480
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
to the kind of beautiful complex systems
 

2481
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,910
to the kind of beautiful complex systems
we can build with this kind of modular

2482
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:39,920
we can build with this kind of modular
 

2483
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,190
we can build with this kind of modular
design it's like uh

2484
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200
design it's like uh
 

2485
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,990
design it's like uh
you know if we build increasingly more

2486
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
you know if we build increasingly more
 

2487
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,430
you know if we build increasingly more
complicated you can think of like the

2488
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
complicated you can think of like the
 

2489
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,430
complicated you can think of like the
internet

2490
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
internet
 

2491
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,349
internet
okay let's scale it up you can think of

2492
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
okay let's scale it up you can think of
 

2493
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,190
okay let's scale it up you can think of
like social network like twitter

2494
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
like social network like twitter
 

2495
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,270
like social network like twitter
as one computing system

2496
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
as one computing system
 

2497
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,589
as one computing system
and but those are little modules yeah

2498
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
and but those are little modules yeah
 

2499
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,630
and but those are little modules yeah
right

2500
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
right
 

2501
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,109
right
but it's built on it's built on so many

2502
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
but it's built on it's built on so many
 

2503
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,829
but it's built on it's built on so many
components nobody at twitter even

2504
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:04,839
components nobody at twitter even
 

2505
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,790
components nobody at twitter even
understands right so

2506
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:06,800
understands right so
 

2507
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,550
understands right so
so so if an alien showed up and looked

2508
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
so so if an alien showed up and looked
 

2509
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,309
so so if an alien showed up and looked
at twitter he wouldn't just see twitter

2510
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
at twitter he wouldn't just see twitter
 

2511
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,910
at twitter he wouldn't just see twitter
as a beautiful simple thing that

2512
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
as a beautiful simple thing that
 

2513
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,950
as a beautiful simple thing that
everybody uses

2514
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
everybody uses
 

2515
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,670
everybody uses
which is really big you would see the

2516
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
which is really big you would see the
 

2517
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,390
which is really big you would see the
network

2518
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,400
network
 

2519
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,470
network
it runs on the fiber optics the data is

2520
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,480
it runs on the fiber optics the data is
 

2521
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,990
it runs on the fiber optics the data is
transported the computers the whole

2522
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
transported the computers the whole
 

2523
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,910
transported the computers the whole
thing is so bloody complicated

2524
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
thing is so bloody complicated
 

2525
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,990
thing is so bloody complicated
nobody twitter understands it and so i

2526
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
nobody twitter understands it and so i
 

2527
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,670
nobody twitter understands it and so i
think that's what the alienware sees

2528
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
think that's what the alienware sees
 

2529
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,270
think that's what the alienware sees
so yeah if an alien showed up and looked

2530
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
so yeah if an alien showed up and looked
 

2531
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,829
so yeah if an alien showed up and looked
at twitter or looked at the various

2532
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:29,839
at twitter or looked at the various
 

2533
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,710
at twitter or looked at the various
different

2534
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
different
 

2535
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,630
different
networked systems that you can see on

2536
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
networked systems that you can see on
 

2537
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,870
networked systems that you can see on
earth so imagine they were really smart

2538
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:34,880
earth so imagine they were really smart
 

2539
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,550
earth so imagine they were really smart
they could comprehend the whole thing

2540
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
they could comprehend the whole thing
 

2541
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,510
they could comprehend the whole thing
and then they sort of you know evaluated

2542
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
and then they sort of you know evaluated
 

2543
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,030
and then they sort of you know evaluated
the human and thought this is really

2544
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
the human and thought this is really
 

2545
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,630
the human and thought this is really
interesting no human on this planet

2546
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
interesting no human on this planet
 

2547
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,430
interesting no human on this planet
comprehends the system they built

2548
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
comprehends the system they built
 

2549
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,030
comprehends the system they built
no individual or well would they even

2550
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
no individual or well would they even
 

2551
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,309
no individual or well would they even
see individual humans that's the

2552
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
see individual humans that's the
 

2553
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:48,710
see individual humans that's the
interest

2554
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
interest
 

2555
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,030
interest
like we humans are very human-centric

2556
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
like we humans are very human-centric
 

2557
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,630
like we humans are very human-centric
entity-centric

2558
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
entity-centric
 

2559
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,670
entity-centric
and so we think of us as the organ as

2560
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
and so we think of us as the organ as
 

2561
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,910
and so we think of us as the organ as
the central organism and the networks as

2562
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
the central organism and the networks as
 

2563
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,670
the central organism and the networks as
just the connection of organisms

2564
00:41:59,670 --> 00:41:59,680
just the connection of organisms
 

2565
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,550
just the connection of organisms
but from a perspective of an alien from

2566
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:02,560
but from a perspective of an alien from
 

2567
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,910
but from a perspective of an alien from
an outside perspective

2568
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
an outside perspective
 

2569
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,030
an outside perspective
it seems like yeah yeah i get it where

2570
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
it seems like yeah yeah i get it where
 

2571
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,870
it seems like yeah yeah i get it where
the ants and they'd see the ant colony

2572
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
the ants and they'd see the ant colony
 

2573
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,270
the ants and they'd see the ant colony
the ant colony yeah or the result the

2574
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
the ant colony yeah or the result the
 

2575
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,950
the ant colony yeah or the result the
production of the ant colony which is

2576
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
production of the ant colony which is
 

2577
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,270
production of the ant colony which is
like

2578
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
like
 

2579
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,670
like
cities and it's it's uh

2580
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
cities and it's it's uh
 

2581
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,109
cities and it's it's uh
yeah in that sense humans are pretty

2582
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
yeah in that sense humans are pretty
 

2583
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,870
yeah in that sense humans are pretty
impressive the modularity that we're

2584
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
impressive the modularity that we're
 

2585
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,910
impressive the modularity that we're
able to

2586
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
able to
 

2587
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,870
able to
and the and how robust we are to noise

2588
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
and the and how robust we are to noise
 

2589
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,270
and the and how robust we are to noise
and

2590
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
and
 

2591
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,630
and
mutation all that kind of stuff well

2592
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:26,640
mutation all that kind of stuff well
 

2593
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,910
mutation all that kind of stuff well
that's because it's stress tested all

2594
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
that's because it's stress tested all
 

2595
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,470
that's because it's stress tested all
the time

2596
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,480
the time
 

2597
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,309
the time
yeah you know you build all these cities

2598
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
yeah you know you build all these cities
 

2599
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,750
yeah you know you build all these cities
with buildings and you get earthquakes

2600
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
with buildings and you get earthquakes
 

2601
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,190
with buildings and you get earthquakes
occasionally and

2602
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
occasionally and
 

2603
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,430
occasionally and
you know some you know wars earthquakes

2604
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,440
you know some you know wars earthquakes
 

2605
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,430
you know some you know wars earthquakes
viruses every once in a while

2606
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
viruses every once in a while
 

2607
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,829
viruses every once in a while
you know changes in business plans for

2608
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
you know changes in business plans for
 

2609
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,550
you know changes in business plans for
you know like

2610
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
you know like
 

2611
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,349
you know like
shipping or something like like as long

2612
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:43,359
shipping or something like like as long
 

2613
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,589
shipping or something like like as long
as it's all stress tested then

2614
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
as it's all stress tested then
 

2615
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,470
as it's all stress tested then
it keeps adapting to the the situation

2616
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
it keeps adapting to the the situation
 

2617
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:48,790
it keeps adapting to the the situation
so

2618
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
so
 

2619
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,470
so
the that's that's a curious phenomena

2620
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
the that's that's a curious phenomena
 

2621
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,150
the that's that's a curious phenomena
well let's go let's talk about moore's

2622
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,160
well let's go let's talk about moore's
 

2623
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,750
well let's go let's talk about moore's
law a little bit

2624
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
law a little bit
 

2625
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,109
law a little bit
uh at the broad view

2626
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
uh at the broad view
 

2627
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,109
uh at the broad view
of moore's law was just exponential

2628
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
of moore's law was just exponential
 

2629
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,190
of moore's law was just exponential
improvement of uh

2630
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
improvement of uh
 

2631
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,230
improvement of uh
computing capability uh like openai for

2632
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
computing capability uh like openai for
 

2633
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,829
computing capability uh like openai for
example recently

2634
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:07,839
example recently
 

2635
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,550
example recently
published this kind of papers looking at

2636
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
published this kind of papers looking at
 

2637
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,390
published this kind of papers looking at
the exponential improvement in the

2638
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:14,400
the exponential improvement in the
 

2639
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,870
the exponential improvement in the
training efficiency of neural networks

2640
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:16,880
training efficiency of neural networks
 

2641
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,230
training efficiency of neural networks
for like image net and all that kind of

2642
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
for like image net and all that kind of
 

2643
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,910
for like image net and all that kind of
stuff we just got better on

2644
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
stuff we just got better on
 

2645
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,710
stuff we just got better on
this is purely software aside just

2646
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
this is purely software aside just
 

2647
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,589
this is purely software aside just
figuring out

2648
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
figuring out
 

2649
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,670
figuring out
better tricks and algorithms for

2650
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
better tricks and algorithms for
 

2651
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,030
better tricks and algorithms for
training neural networks

2652
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
training neural networks
 

2653
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,430
training neural networks
and that seems to be improving uh

2654
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,440
and that seems to be improving uh
 

2655
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,270
and that seems to be improving uh
significantly faster than the moore's

2656
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
significantly faster than the moore's
 

2657
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,230
significantly faster than the moore's
law prediction

2658
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
law prediction
 

2659
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,870
law prediction
you know so that's in the software space

2660
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
you know so that's in the software space
 

2661
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,349
you know so that's in the software space
like

2662
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
like
 

2663
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,390
like
what do you think if moore's law

2664
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:38,400
what do you think if moore's law
 

2665
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,670
what do you think if moore's law
continues or

2666
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
continues or
 

2667
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,990
continues or
if the general version of moore's law

2668
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
if the general version of moore's law
 

2669
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,790
if the general version of moore's law
continues

2670
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
continues
 

2671
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,710
continues
do you think that comes mostly from the

2672
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
do you think that comes mostly from the
 

2673
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,550
do you think that comes mostly from the
hardware from the software some mix of

2674
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
hardware from the software some mix of
 

2675
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,510
hardware from the software some mix of
the two

2676
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
the two
 

2677
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,790
the two
some interesting totally uh so not the

2678
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:50,800
some interesting totally uh so not the
 

2679
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,710
some interesting totally uh so not the
reduction of the size of the transistor

2680
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
reduction of the size of the transistor
 

2681
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,910
reduction of the size of the transistor
kind of thing but more in the uh

2682
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
kind of thing but more in the uh
 

2683
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,150
kind of thing but more in the uh
in the totally interesting kinds of

2684
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,160
in the totally interesting kinds of
 

2685
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,829
in the totally interesting kinds of
innovations in the hardware space all

2686
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
innovations in the hardware space all
 

2687
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,109
innovations in the hardware space all
that kind of stuff

2688
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
that kind of stuff
 

2689
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,910
that kind of stuff
well there's like a half a dozen things

2690
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
well there's like a half a dozen things
 

2691
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,430
well there's like a half a dozen things
going on in that graph

2692
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
going on in that graph
 

2693
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,309
going on in that graph
so one is there's initial innovations

2694
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
so one is there's initial innovations
 

2695
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,910
so one is there's initial innovations
that had a lot of had room to be

2696
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
that had a lot of had room to be
 

2697
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,589
that had a lot of had room to be
exploited

2698
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599
exploited
 

2699
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,349
exploited
so you know the efficiency of the

2700
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
so you know the efficiency of the
 

2701
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,829
so you know the efficiency of the
networks has improved dramatically

2702
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
networks has improved dramatically
 

2703
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,390
networks has improved dramatically
and then the decomposability of those

2704
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400
and then the decomposability of those
 

2705
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,230
and then the decomposability of those
and the use go you know they started

2706
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,240
and the use go you know they started
 

2707
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,829
and the use go you know they started
running on one computer then multiple

2708
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
running on one computer then multiple
 

2709
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,829
running on one computer then multiple
computers and multiple gpus and then

2710
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:23,839
computers and multiple gpus and then
 

2711
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,589
computers and multiple gpus and then
arrays of gpus and

2712
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
arrays of gpus and
 

2713
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,589
arrays of gpus and
they're up to thousands and at some

2714
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
they're up to thousands and at some
 

2715
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,790
they're up to thousands and at some
point

2716
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
point
 

2717
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,870
point
so so it's sort of like they were

2718
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:30,880
so so it's sort of like they were
 

2719
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,390
so so it's sort of like they were
consumed they were going from like a

2720
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
consumed they were going from like a
 

2721
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,990
consumed they were going from like a
single computer application to a

2722
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
single computer application to a
 

2723
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,550
single computer application to a
thousand

2724
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
thousand
 

2725
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,950
thousand
computer application so that's not

2726
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
computer application so that's not
 

2727
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,390
computer application so that's not
really a moore's law thing that's an

2728
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
really a moore's law thing that's an
 

2729
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,309
really a moore's law thing that's an
independent vector how many computers

2730
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
independent vector how many computers
 

2731
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,150
independent vector how many computers
can i put on this problem

2732
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,160
can i put on this problem
 

2733
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,589
can i put on this problem
because the computers themselves are

2734
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
because the computers themselves are
 

2735
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,030
because the computers themselves are
getting better on like a moore's law

2736
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
getting better on like a moore's law

yeah you know was something and then

2744
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
yeah you know was something and then
 

2745
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,790
yeah you know was something and then
multiplied by

2746
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:52,800
multiplied by
 

2747
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,470
multiplied by
you know the amount of computes it took

2748
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
you know the amount of computes it took
 

2749
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,870
you know the amount of computes it took
to resolve like alex net to resnet the

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
it's been quite you know steady
 

2755
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,510

but those are like s cars aren't they

2758
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
but those are like s cars aren't they
 

2759
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,790
but those are like s cars aren't they
yeah that's the exactly kind of s-curves

2760
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
yeah that's the exactly kind of s-curves
 

2761
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,309
yeah that's the exactly kind of s-curves
that are underlying moore's law from the

2762
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
that are underlying moore's law from the
 

2763
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,510
that are underlying moore's law from the
very beginning

2764
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
very beginning
 

2765
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,230
very beginning
so so what what's the biggest what's the

2766
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
so so what what's the biggest what's the
 

2767
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,710
so so what what's the biggest what's the
most

2768
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
most
 

2769
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,750
most
uh productive uh rich

2770
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
uh productive uh rich
 

2771
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,069
uh productive uh rich
source of s-curves in in the future do

2772
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
source of s-curves in in the future do
 

2773
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,109
source of s-curves in in the future do
you think is it

2774
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
you think is it
 

2775
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,870
you think is it
hardware is it software or is it so

2776
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
hardware is it software or is it so
 

2777
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,510
hardware is it software or is it so
hardware is going to move along

2778
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
hardware is going to move along
 

2779
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,550
hardware is going to move along
relatively slowly like you know double

2780
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
relatively slowly like you know double
 

2781
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,470
relatively slowly like you know double
performance every two years

2782
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
performance every two years
 

2783
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,790
performance every two years
there are there's still i like how you

2784
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
there are there's still i like how you
 

2785
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,390
there are there's still i like how you
call that slow yeah that's the slow

2786
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,400
call that slow yeah that's the slow
 

2787
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,190
call that slow yeah that's the slow
version

2788
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
version
 

2789
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,430
version
the snail's pace of moore's law maybe we

2790
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:33,440
the snail's pace of moore's law maybe we
 

2791
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,430
the snail's pace of moore's law maybe we
should we should

00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
should we should
 

2793
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,950

00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
we should uh trademark that one
 

2795
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,630
we should uh trademark that one
whereas the scaling by number of

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
whereas the scaling by number of
 

2797
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,270
whereas the scaling by number of
computers you know can go much faster

2798
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
computers you know can go much faster
 

2799
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,030
computers you know can go much faster
you know i'm sure at some point google

2800
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
you know i'm sure at some point google
 

2801
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,109
you know i'm sure at some point google
had a you know their initial search

2802
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
had a you know their initial search
 

2803
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,030
had a you know their initial search
engine was running on a laptop you know

2804
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
engine was running on a laptop you know
 

2805
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,670
engine was running on a laptop you know
like

2806
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:49,680
like
 

2807
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,270
like
yeah and at some point they really

2808
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
yeah and at some point they really
 

2809
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,950
yeah and at some point they really
worked on scaling that and then they

2810
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
worked on scaling that and then they
 

2811
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,990
worked on scaling that and then they
factored

2812
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
factored
 

2813
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,309
factored
the indexer from you know this piece and

2814
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
the indexer from you know this piece and
 

2815
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,510
the indexer from you know this piece and
this piece and this piece and they

2816
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
this piece and this piece and they
 

2817
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,990
this piece and this piece and they
spread the data on more things and you

2818
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
spread the data on more things and you
 

2819
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,710
spread the data on more things and you
know they did

2820
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
know they did
 

2821
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,670
know they did
a dozen innovations but as they scaled

2822
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
a dozen innovations but as they scaled
 

2823
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,190
a dozen innovations but as they scaled
up the number of computers on that

2824
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
up the number of computers on that
 

2825
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,349
up the number of computers on that
it kept breaking finding new bottlenecks

2826
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
it kept breaking finding new bottlenecks
 

2827
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,030
it kept breaking finding new bottlenecks
in their software and their schedulers

2828
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
in their software and their schedulers
 

2829
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,670
in their software and their schedulers
and

2830
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
and
 

2831
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,390
and
and made them rethink like it seems

2832
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
and made them rethink like it seems
 

2833
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,390
and made them rethink like it seems
insane to do a scheduler across a

2834
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
insane to do a scheduler across a
 

2835
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,390
insane to do a scheduler across a
thousand computers to schedule parts of

2836
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
thousand computers to schedule parts of
 

2837
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,069
thousand computers to schedule parts of
it and then send the results to one

2838
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
it and then send the results to one
 

2839
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,790
it and then send the results to one
computer

2840
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
computer
 

2841
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,230
computer
but if you want to schedule a million

2842
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,240
but if you want to schedule a million
 

2843
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,109
but if you want to schedule a million
searches that makes perfect sense

2844
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
searches that makes perfect sense
 

2845
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,069
searches that makes perfect sense
so so there's the the scaling by just

2846
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
so so there's the the scaling by just
 

2847
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,990
so so there's the the scaling by just
quantity is probably the richest

2848
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
quantity is probably the richest
 

2849
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,910
quantity is probably the richest
thing but then as you scale quantity

2850
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
thing but then as you scale quantity
 

2851
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,990
thing but then as you scale quantity
like a network that was great on 100

2852
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
like a network that was great on 100
 

2853
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,950
like a network that was great on 100
computers may be

2854
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
computers may be
 

2855
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,030
computers may be
completely the wrong one you may pick a

2856
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
completely the wrong one you may pick a
 

2857
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,430
completely the wrong one you may pick a
network that's 10 times slower

2858
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440
network that's 10 times slower
 

2859
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,309
network that's 10 times slower
on 10 000 computers like per computer

2860
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319
on 10 000 computers like per computer
 

2861
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,829
on 10 000 computers like per computer
but if you go from a hundred to ten

2862
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
but if you go from a hundred to ten
 

2863
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,589
but if you go from a hundred to ten
thousand that's a hundred times

2864
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
thousand that's a hundred times
 

2865
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,710
thousand that's a hundred times
so that's one of the things that

2866
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
so that's one of the things that
 

2867
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,710
so that's one of the things that
happened when we did internet scaling is

2868
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
happened when we did internet scaling is
 

2869
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,750
happened when we did internet scaling is
the efficiency went down

2870
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
the efficiency went down
 

2871
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,670
the efficiency went down
not up the future of computing is

2872
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
not up the future of computing is
 

2873
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,349
not up the future of computing is
inefficiency not efficiency

2874
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
inefficiency not efficiency
 

2875
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,990
inefficiency not efficiency
but scales in efficient scale it's it's

2876
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
but scales in efficient scale it's it's
 

2877
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,470
but scales in efficient scale it's it's
scaling faster than inefficiency

2878
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
scaling faster than inefficiency
 

2879
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,630
scaling faster than inefficiency
bites you and as long as there's you

2880
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
bites you and as long as there's you
 

2881
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,230
bites you and as long as there's you
know dollar value there like scaling

2882
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
know dollar value there like scaling
 

2883
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,589
know dollar value there like scaling
costs lots of money

2884
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
costs lots of money
 

2885
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,349
costs lots of money
yeah but google showed facebook showed

2886
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
yeah but google showed facebook showed
 

2887
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,190
yeah but google showed facebook showed
everybody showed that the scale was

2888
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
everybody showed that the scale was
 

2889
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,069
everybody showed that the scale was
where the money was

2890
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
where the money was
 

2891
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,190
where the money was
at it was and so it was worth it

2892
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
at it was and so it was worth it
 

2893
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,030
at it was and so it was worth it
financially do you think

2894
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
financially do you think
 

2895
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,829
financially do you think
is it possible that like basically the

2896
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:17,839
is it possible that like basically the
 

2897
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:18,710
is it possible that like basically the
entirety

2898
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
entirety
 

2899
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,710
entirety
of earth will be like a computing

2901
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,950

this hedgehog will be doing computing

2906
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,000
this hedgehog will be doing computing
 

2907
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,390
this hedgehog will be doing computing
like everything really inefficient dumb

2908
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
like everything really inefficient dumb
 

2909
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,510
like everything really inefficient dumb
computing would be

2910
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
computing would be
 

2911
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,670
computing would be
fiction books they call it computronium

2912
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:31,680
fiction books they call it computronium
 

2913
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,430
fiction books they call it computronium
computing we turn everything into

2914
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
computing we turn everything into

good for anything like you're not going
 

2921
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,150
good for anything like you're not going
to make a computer out of iron like

2922
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
to make a computer out of iron like
 

2923
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,950
to make a computer out of iron like
you know silicon and carbon have like

2924
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
you know silicon and carbon have like
 

2925
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,870
you know silicon and carbon have like
nice structures

2926
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
nice structures
 

2927
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,390
nice structures
you know we'll we'll see what what you

2928
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
you know we'll we'll see what what you
 

2929
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,470
you know we'll we'll see what what you
can do with the rest of it

2930
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
can do with the rest of it
 

2931
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,910
can do with the rest of it
people talk about well maybe we can turn

2932
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
people talk about well maybe we can turn
 

2933
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,750
people talk about well maybe we can turn
the sun into computer but it's

2934
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
the sun into computer but it's
 

2935
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,870
the sun into computer but it's
it's hydrogen and a little bit of helium

2936
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
it's hydrogen and a little bit of helium
 

2937
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,829
it's hydrogen and a little bit of helium
so what i mean is more like actually

2938
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:57,839
so what i mean is more like actually
 

2939
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:58,150
so what i mean is more like actually
just

2940
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
just
 

2941
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,549
just
adding computers to everything oh okay

2942
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
adding computers to everything oh okay
 

2943
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,510
adding computers to everything oh okay
so you're just

2944
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
so you're just
 

2945
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,950
so you're just
converting all the mass of the universe

2946
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
converting all the mass of the universe
 

2947
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,710
converting all the mass of the universe
into a computer no no

2948
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
into a computer no no
 

2949
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,390
into a computer no no
so not using to be ironic from the

2950
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
so not using to be ironic from the
 

2951
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,390
so not using to be ironic from the
simulation point of view is like

2952
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
simulation point of view is like
 

2953
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,630
simulation point of view is like
the simulator build mass to simulate

2954
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
the simulator build mass to simulate
 

2955
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,910
the simulator build mass to simulate
like

2956
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
like
 

2957
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,990
like
yeah i mean yeah so i mean ultimately

2958
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
yeah i mean yeah so i mean ultimately
 

2959
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,190
yeah i mean yeah so i mean ultimately
this is all heading towards the

2960
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
this is all heading towards the
 

2961
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,549
this is all heading towards the
simulation yeah well

2962
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
simulation yeah well
 

2963
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,910
simulation yeah well
i i think i might have told you the

2964
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
i i think i might have told you the
 

2965
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,069
i i think i might have told you the
story a tesla they were deciding

2966
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
story a tesla they were deciding
 

2967
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,270
story a tesla they were deciding
so they want to measure the current

2968
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
so they want to measure the current
 

2969
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,630
so they want to measure the current
coming out of the battery and they

2970
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
coming out of the battery and they
 

2971
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,390
coming out of the battery and they
decide between putting the resistor in

2972
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,400
decide between putting the resistor in
 

2973
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,750
decide between putting the resistor in
there

2974
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
there
 

2975
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,390
there
and putting a computer with a sensor in

2976
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
and putting a computer with a sensor in
 

2977
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,349
and putting a computer with a sensor in
there

2978
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
there
 

2979
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,030
there
and the computer was faster than the

2980
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,040
and the computer was faster than the
 

2981
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,990
and the computer was faster than the
computer i worked on in 1982.

2982
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
computer i worked on in 1982.
 

2983
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,829
computer i worked on in 1982.
and we chose the computer because it was

2984
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
and we chose the computer because it was
 

2985
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,549
and we chose the computer because it was
cheaper than the resistor

2986
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
cheaper than the resistor
 

2987
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,109
cheaper than the resistor
so so sure this hedgehog you know it

2988
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
so so sure this hedgehog you know it
 

2989
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,150
so so sure this hedgehog you know it
costs 13

2990
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:42,160
costs 13
 

2991
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,390
costs 13
and we can put a you know an ai that's

2992
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
and we can put a you know an ai that's
 

2993
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,910
and we can put a you know an ai that's
the smartest you in there for five bucks

2994
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
the smartest you in there for five bucks
 

2995
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,069
the smartest you in there for five bucks
it'll have one

2996
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
it'll have one
 

2997
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,150
it'll have one
you know so computers will be you know

2998
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
you know so computers will be you know
 

2999
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,589
you know so computers will be you know
he'd be everywhere

3000
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
he'd be everywhere
 

3001
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,270
he'd be everywhere
i was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than

3002
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
i was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than
 

3003
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,270
i was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than
me because well everything's going to be

3004
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,280
me because well everything's going to be
 

3005
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,470
me because well everything's going to be
smarter than you

3006
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,480
smarter than you
 

3007
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,069
smarter than you
but you were saying it's inefficient i

3008
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
but you were saying it's inefficient i
 

3009
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,349
but you were saying it's inefficient i
thought it was better to have a lot of

3010
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
thought it was better to have a lot of
 

3011
00:48:59,359 --> 00:48:59,670
thought it was better to have a lot of
doubt

3012
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
doubt
 

3013
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,589
doubt
well well moore's law will slowly

3014
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
well well moore's law will slowly
 

3015
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,349
well well moore's law will slowly
compact that stuff so even the dump

3016
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359
compact that stuff so even the dump
 

3017
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,710
compact that stuff so even the dump
things will be smarter than us

3018
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,720
things will be smarter than us
 

3019
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,990
things will be smarter than us
the dump things are going to be smart or

3020
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,000
the dump things are going to be smart or
 

3021
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,430
the dump things are going to be smart or
they're going to be smart enough to talk

3022
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
they're going to be smart enough to talk
 

3023
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,990
they're going to be smart enough to talk
to something that's really smart

3024
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
to something that's really smart
 

3025
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,510
to something that's really smart
you know it's like well just remember

00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
how do you build scalable and efficient
 

3085
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,109
how do you build scalable and efficient
deep learning this is such a fascinating

3086
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:17,119
deep learning this is such a fascinating
 

3087
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,950
deep learning this is such a fascinating
space yeah yeah so it's interesting so

3088
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:18,960
space yeah yeah so it's interesting so
 

3089
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,829
space yeah yeah so it's interesting so
um

3090
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
um
 

3091
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,190
um
up until recently i thought there was

3092
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
up until recently i thought there was
 

3093
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,870
up until recently i thought there was
two kinds of computers there are serial

3094
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
two kinds of computers there are serial
 

3095
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,990
two kinds of computers there are serial
computers

3096
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
computers
 

3097
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,510
computers
that run like c programs and then

3098
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:25,520
that run like c programs and then
 

3099
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,030
that run like c programs and then
there's parallel computers

3100
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,040
there's parallel computers
 

3101
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,270
there's parallel computers
so the way i think about it is you know

3102
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
so the way i think about it is you know
 

3103
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,549
so the way i think about it is you know
parallel computers you

3104
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:30,559
parallel computers you
 

3105
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,710
parallel computers you
have given parallelism like gpus are

3106
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
have given parallelism like gpus are
 

3107
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,630
have given parallelism like gpus are
great because you have a million pixels

3108
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
great because you have a million pixels
 

3109
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,710
great because you have a million pixels
and modern gpus run a program on every

3110
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
and modern gpus run a program on every
 

3111
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,030
and modern gpus run a program on every
pixel they call the shader program

3112
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,040
pixel they call the shader program
 

3113
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,309
pixel they call the shader program
right so or like finite element analysis

3114
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
right so or like finite element analysis
 

3115
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:42,710
right so or like finite element analysis
you

3116
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
you
 

3117
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,069
you
you build something you know you make

3118
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:44,079
you build something you know you make
 

3119
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,750
you build something you know you make
this into little tiny chunks you give

3120
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
this into little tiny chunks you give
 

3121
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,950
this into little tiny chunks you give
each chunk to a computer

3122
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:46,960
each chunk to a computer
 

3123
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,470
each chunk to a computer
so you're giving all these chunks a

3124
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
so you're giving all these chunks a
 

3125
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,990
so you're giving all these chunks a
parallel something like that

3126
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
parallel something like that
 

3127
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,990
parallel something like that
but most c programs you write this

3128
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
but most c programs you write this
 

3129
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,430
but most c programs you write this
linear narrative

3130
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,440
linear narrative
 

3131
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,750
linear narrative
and you have to make it go fast to make

3132
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
and you have to make it go fast to make
 

3133
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,589
and you have to make it go fast to make
it go fast you predict all the branches

3134
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
it go fast you predict all the branches
 

3135
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,190
it go fast you predict all the branches
all the data fetches and you run that

3136
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,200
all the data fetches and you run that
 

3137
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,950
all the data fetches and you run that
more in parallel but that's found

3138
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
more in parallel but that's found
 

3139
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,069
more in parallel but that's found
parallelism

3140
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079

 

3141
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,950

ai is i'm still trying to decide how

3142
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
ai is i'm still trying to decide how
 

3143
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,309
ai is i'm still trying to decide how
fundamental this is

3144
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
fundamental this is
 

3145
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,030
fundamental this is
it's a given parallelism problem but the

3146
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
it's a given parallelism problem but the
 

3147
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,069
it's a given parallelism problem but the
way people

3148
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
way people
 

3149
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,109
way people
describe the neural networks and then

3150
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
describe the neural networks and then
 

3151
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,710
describe the neural networks and then
how they write them in pi torch it makes

3152
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
how they write them in pi torch it makes
 

3153
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,390
how they write them in pi torch it makes
graphs yeah

3154
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
graphs yeah
 

3155
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,750
graphs yeah
that might be fundamentally different

3156
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
that might be fundamentally different
 

3157
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,470
that might be fundamentally different
than the gpu kind of parallelism yeah it

3158
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:22,480
than the gpu kind of parallelism yeah it
 

3159
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,190
than the gpu kind of parallelism yeah it
might be

3160
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
might be
 

3161
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,069
might be
because the when you run the gpu program

3162
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:26,079
because the when you run the gpu program
 

3163
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,190
because the when you run the gpu program
on all the pixels

3164
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
on all the pixels
 

3165
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,430
on all the pixels
you're running like you know depends you

3166
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
you're running like you know depends you
 

3167
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,510
you're running like you know depends you
know this group of pixels say it's

3168
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
know this group of pixels say it's
 

3169
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,030
know this group of pixels say it's
background blue and that runs a really

3170
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:33,040
background blue and that runs a really
 

3171
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,190
background blue and that runs a really
simple program this pixel is

3172
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
simple program this pixel is
 

3173
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,030
simple program this pixel is
you know some patch of your face so you

3174
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
you know some patch of your face so you
 

3175
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,950
you know some patch of your face so you
have some really interesting shader

3176
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:38,960
have some really interesting shader
 

3177
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,390
have some really interesting shader
program to give you impression of

3178
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:40,400
program to give you impression of
 

3179
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,510
program to give you impression of
translucency

3180
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
translucency
 

3181
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,270
translucency
but the pixels themselves don't talk to

3182
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,280
but the pixels themselves don't talk to
 

3183
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,910
but the pixels themselves don't talk to
each other there's no graph

3184
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
each other there's no graph
 

3185
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,390
each other there's no graph
right so you you do the image and then

3186
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
right so you you do the image and then
 

3187
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,910
right so you you do the image and then
you do the next image and you do the

3188
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:49,920
you do the next image and you do the
 

3189
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,190
you do the next image and you do the
next image

3190
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
next image
 

3191
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,309
next image
and you run 8 million pixels 8 million

3192
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
and you run 8 million pixels 8 million
 

3193
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,470
and you run 8 million pixels 8 million
programs every time and modern gpus have

3194
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
programs every time and modern gpus have
 

3195
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,670
programs every time and modern gpus have
like 6 000

3196
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
like 6 000
 

3197
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,710
like 6 000
thread engines in them so you know to

3198
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
thread engines in them so you know to
 

3199
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,790
thread engines in them so you know to
get 8 million pixels each one runs a

3200
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:02,800
get 8 million pixels each one runs a
 

3201
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,710
get 8 million pixels each one runs a
program on you know 10 or 20

3202
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
program on you know 10 or 20
 

3203
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,670
program on you know 10 or 20
pixels and that's how that's how they

3204
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
pixels and that's how that's how they
 

3205
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,270
pixels and that's how that's how they
work but there's no graph

3206
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,280
work but there's no graph
 

3207
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,470
work but there's no graph
but you think graph might be a totally

3208
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
but you think graph might be a totally
 

3209
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,829
but you think graph might be a totally
new way to think about hardware so raja

3210
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
new way to think about hardware so raja
 

3211
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,270
new way to think about hardware so raja
gadori and i've been having this good

3212
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,280
gadori and i've been having this good
 

3213
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,990
gadori and i've been having this good
conversation

3214
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
conversation
 

3215
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,470
conversation
about giving versus found parallelism

3216
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
about giving versus found parallelism
 

3217
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,430
about giving versus found parallelism
and then

3218
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
and then
 

3219
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,030
and then
the kind of walk cause we got more

3220
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,040
the kind of walk cause we got more
 

3221
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,109
the kind of walk cause we got more
transistors like you know computers way

3222
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
transistors like you know computers way
 

3223
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,069
transistors like you know computers way
back when did

3224
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
back when did
 

3225
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,309
back when did
stuff on scalar data then we did it on

3226
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:28,319
stuff on scalar data then we did it on
 

3227
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,549
stuff on scalar data then we did it on
vector data famous vector machines

3228
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
vector data famous vector machines
 

3229
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,309
vector data famous vector machines
now we're making computers that operate

3230
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
now we're making computers that operate
 

3231
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,150
now we're making computers that operate
on matrices

3232
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
on matrices
 

3233
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,630
on matrices
right and then the the category we we

3234
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,640
right and then the the category we we
 

3235
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,710
right and then the the category we we
said that was next was spatial

3236
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,720
said that was next was spatial
 

3237
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,270
said that was next was spatial
like imagine you have so much data that

3238
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,280
like imagine you have so much data that
 

3239
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,549
like imagine you have so much data that
you know you want to do the compute on

3240
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,559
you know you want to do the compute on
 

3241
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,270
you know you want to do the compute on
this data

3242
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:43,280
this data
 

3243
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,150
this data
and then when it's done it says send the

3244
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
and then when it's done it says send the
 

3245
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,910
and then when it's done it says send the
result to this pile of data run some

3246
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
result to this pile of data run some
 

3247
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,109
result to this pile of data run some
software on that

3248
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
software on that
 

3249
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,309
software on that
and it's better to to think about it

3250
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
and it's better to to think about it
 

3251
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,670
and it's better to to think about it
spatially than

3252
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
spatially than
 

3253
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,430
spatially than
to move all the data to a central

3254
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
to move all the data to a central
 

3255
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,430
to move all the data to a central
processor and do all the work

3256
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
processor and do all the work
 

3257
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,069
processor and do all the work
so especially i mean moving in the space

3258
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
so especially i mean moving in the space
 

3259
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,309
so especially i mean moving in the space
of data as opposed to moving the data

3260
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
of data as opposed to moving the data
 

3261
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,309
of data as opposed to moving the data
yeah you have a you have a petabyte data

3262
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
yeah you have a you have a petabyte data
 

3263
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,109
yeah you have a you have a petabyte data
space spread across some huge array of

3264
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
space spread across some huge array of
 

3265
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,470
space spread across some huge array of
computers

3266
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
computers
 

3267
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,390
computers
and when you do a computation somewhere

3268
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
and when you do a computation somewhere
 

3269
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,150
and when you do a computation somewhere
you send the result of that computation

3270
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,160
you send the result of that computation
 

3271
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,790
you send the result of that computation
or maybe

3272
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
or maybe
 

3273
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,710
or maybe
a pointer to the next program some other

3274
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
a pointer to the next program some other
 

3275
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,470
a pointer to the next program some other
piece of data and do it

3276
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
piece of data and do it
 

3277
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,710
piece of data and do it
but i think a better word might be graph

3278
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
but i think a better word might be graph
 

3279
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,710
but i think a better word might be graph
and all the ai neural networks are

3280
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:20,720
and all the ai neural networks are
 

3281
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,510
and all the ai neural networks are
graphs

3282
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
graphs
 

3283
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,190
graphs
do some computations send the result

3284
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
do some computations send the result
 

3285
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,510
do some computations send the result
here do another computation do a data

3286
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520
here do another computation do a data
 

3287
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,230
here do another computation do a data
transformation do a merging do a pooling

3288
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
transformation do a merging do a pooling
 

3289
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,190
transformation do a merging do a pooling
do another computation is it possible to

3290
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
do another computation is it possible to
 

3291
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,230
do another computation is it possible to
compress and say

3292
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:32,240
compress and say
 

3293
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,630
compress and say
how we make this thing efficient this

3294
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
how we make this thing efficient this
 

3295
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,829
how we make this thing efficient this
whole process efficient

3296
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
whole process efficient
 

3297
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,109
whole process efficient
that's different so first uh

3298
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
that's different so first uh
 

3299
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,790
that's different so first uh
the fundamental elements in the graphs

3300
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
the fundamental elements in the graphs
 

3301
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,309
the fundamental elements in the graphs
are things like matrix multiplies

3302
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:42,319
are things like matrix multiplies
 

3303
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,549
are things like matrix multiplies
convolutions data manipulations and data

3304
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
convolutions data manipulations and data
 

3305
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,990
convolutions data manipulations and data
movements

3306
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
movements
 

3307
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,710
movements
so gpus emulate those things with their

3308
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
so gpus emulate those things with their
 

3309
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,589
so gpus emulate those things with their
little singles

3310
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
little singles
 

3311
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,270
little singles
you know basically running a single

3312
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:51,280
you know basically running a single
 

3313
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,950
you know basically running a single
threaded program

3314
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
threaded program
 

3315
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,950
threaded program
and then there's a you know nvidia calls

3316
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
and then there's a you know nvidia calls
 

3317
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,309
and then there's a you know nvidia calls
it a work where they group a bunch of

3318
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
it a work where they group a bunch of
 

3319
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,230
it a work where they group a bunch of
programs that are similar together

3320
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
programs that are similar together
 

3321
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,430
programs that are similar together
so for efficiency and instruction use

3322
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,440
so for efficiency and instruction use
 

3323
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,829
so for efficiency and instruction use
and then at a higher level you kind of

3324
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
and then at a higher level you kind of
 

3325
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,270
and then at a higher level you kind of
you take this graph and you say this

3326
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:05,280
you take this graph and you say this
 

3327
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,030
you take this graph and you say this
part of the graph is a matrix multiplier

3328
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
part of the graph is a matrix multiplier
 

3329
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,069
part of the graph is a matrix multiplier
which runs on these

3330
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
which runs on these
 

3331
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,750
which runs on these
32 threads but the model at the bottom

3332
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:11,760
32 threads but the model at the bottom
 

3333
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,230
32 threads but the model at the bottom
was

3334
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
was
 

3335
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,910
was
built for running programs on pixels not

3336
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:15,920
built for running programs on pixels not
 

3337
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,030
built for running programs on pixels not
executing graphs

3338
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:17,040
executing graphs
 

3339
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,150
executing graphs
so it's emulation yes so is it possible

3340
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
so it's emulation yes so is it possible
 

3341
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,230
so it's emulation yes so is it possible
to build something that natively runs

3342
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
to build something that natively runs
 

3343
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,950
to build something that natively runs
graphs

3344
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
graphs
 

3345
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,150
graphs
yes so that's what ten storm did

3346
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
yes so that's what ten storm did
 

3347
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,190
yes so that's what ten storm did
so where are we on that how like in the

3348
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
so where are we on that how like in the
 

3349
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,710
so where are we on that how like in the
history of that effort

3350
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,720
history of that effort
 

3351
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,270
history of that effort
are we in the early days yeah i think so

3352
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,280
are we in the early days yeah i think so
 

3353
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,230
are we in the early days yeah i think so
tense torrance

3354

i was his first investor so i've been

3360
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
i was his first investor so i've been
 

3361
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,950
i was his first investor so i've been
you know kind of

3362
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
you know kind of
 

3363
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,470
you know kind of
following him and talking to him about

3364
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
following him and talking to him about
 

3365
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,630
following him and talking to him about
it for years and

3366
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
it for years and
 

3367
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,990
it for years and
in the fall when i was considering

3368
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
in the fall when i was considering
 

3369
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,750
in the fall when i was considering
things to do

3370
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
things to do
 

3371
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,710
things to do
i decided you know the we we held a

3372
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,720
i decided you know the we we held a
 

3373
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,990
i decided you know the we we held a
conference last year with a

3374
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,000
conference last year with a
 

3375
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,950
conference last year with a
friend organized it and and we we wanted

3376
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
friend organized it and and we we wanted
 

3377
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,069
friend organized it and and we we wanted
to bring in thinkers

3378
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
to bring in thinkers
 

3379
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,750
to bring in thinkers
and two of the people were andre

3380
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:57,760
and two of the people were andre
 

3381
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,390
and two of the people were andre
carpassi and chris lattner

3382
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
carpassi and chris lattner
 

3383
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,349
carpassi and chris lattner
and andre gave this talk on youtube

3384
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:03,359
and andre gave this talk on youtube
 

3385
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,030
and andre gave this talk on youtube
called software 2.0

3386
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
called software 2.0
 

3387
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,309
called software 2.0
which i think is great which is we went

3388
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
which i think is great which is we went
 

3389
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:08,710
which i think is great which is we went
from

3390
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
from
 

3391
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,630
from
programmed computers where you write

3392
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
programmed computers where you write
 

3393
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,670
programmed computers where you write
programs to data program computers

3394
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
programs to data program computers
 

3395
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,150
programs to data program computers
you know like the futures you know of

3396
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
you know like the futures you know of
 

3397
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,230
you know like the futures you know of
software as data programs the the

3398
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
software as data programs the the
 

3399
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,190
software as data programs the the
networks

3400
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200
networks
 

3401
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,870
networks
and i think that's true and then

3402
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:22,880
and i think that's true and then
 

3403
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,109
and i think that's true and then
chris has been work he worked on llvm

3404
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
chris has been work he worked on llvm

then you have to fix it by writing lots

3462
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
then you have to fix it by writing lots
 

3463
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,910
then you have to fix it by writing lots
more software

3464
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
more software
 

3465
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,470
more software
so the hardware naturally does matrix

3466
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
so the hardware naturally does matrix
 

3467
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,309
so the hardware naturally does matrix

00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,630
yeah and there's technical reasons for
it and i use both

there's more love for that and that that

3540
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
there's more love for that and that that
 

3541
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,470
there's more love for that and that that
may change

3542
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
may change
 

3543
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,870
may change
so the first thing is when they write

3544
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
so the first thing is when they write
 

3545
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,549
so the first thing is when they write
their programs

3546
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
their programs
 

3547
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,390
their programs
can the hardware execute it pretty much

3548
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
can the hardware execute it pretty much
 

3549
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,309
can the hardware execute it pretty much
as it was written

3550
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
as it was written
 

3551
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,270
as it was written
right so pi torch turns into a graph we

3552
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
right so pi torch turns into a graph we
 

3553
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,950
right so pi torch turns into a graph we
have a graph compiler that makes that

3554
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
have a graph compiler that makes that
 

3555
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,430
have a graph compiler that makes that
graph

3556
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
graph
 

3557
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,510
graph
then it fractions the graph down so if

3558
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
then it fractions the graph down so if
 

3559
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,950
then it fractions the graph down so if
you have a big matrix multiply we turn

3560
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:58,960
you have a big matrix multiply we turn
 

3561
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,390
you have a big matrix multiply we turn
it into right-sized chunks that run on

3562
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,400
it into right-sized chunks that run on
 

3563
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,990
it into right-sized chunks that run on
the processing elements

3564
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:02,000
the processing elements
 

3565
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,670
the processing elements
it hooks all the graph up it lays out

3566
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
it hooks all the graph up it lays out
 

3567
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,789
it hooks all the graph up it lays out
all the data there's a couple mid-level

3568
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
all the data there's a couple mid-level
 

3569
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,390
all the data there's a couple mid-level
representations of it that are also

3570
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
representations of it that are also
 

3571
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,390
representations of it that are also
simulatable so that

3572
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,400
simulatable so that
 

3573
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,630
simulatable so that
if you're writing the code you can see

3574
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,640
if you're writing the code you can see
 

3575
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,870
if you're writing the code you can see
how it's going to go through the machine

3576
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880
how it's going to go through the machine
 

3577
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,309
how it's going to go through the machine
which is pretty cool and then at the

3578
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
which is pretty cool and then at the
 

3579
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,710
which is pretty cool and then at the
bottom it schedules kernels like

3580
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
bottom it schedules kernels like
 

3581
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,710
bottom it schedules kernels like
math data manipulation data movement

3582
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:20,720
math data manipulation data movement
 

3583
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,789
math data manipulation data movement
kernels which do this stuff

3584
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
kernels which do this stuff
 

3585
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,670
kernels which do this stuff
so we don't have to run write a little

3586
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
so we don't have to run write a little
 

3587
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,430
so we don't have to run write a little
program to do matrix multiply because we

3588
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
program to do matrix multiply because we
 

3589
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,870
program to do matrix multiply because we
have a big matrix multiplier

3590
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
have a big matrix multiplier
 

3591
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,150
have a big matrix multiplier
like there's no cmd program for that

3592
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
like there's no cmd program for that
 

3593
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,829
like there's no cmd program for that
but there is scheduling for that right

3594
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:35,839
but there is scheduling for that right
 

3595
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:36,470
but there is scheduling for that right
so the the

3596
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
so the the
 

3597
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,270
so the the
one of the goals is if you write a piece

3598
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
one of the goals is if you write a piece
 

3599
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,630
one of the goals is if you write a piece
of pytorch code that looks pretty

3600
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:40,640
of pytorch code that looks pretty
 

3601
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,829
of pytorch code that looks pretty
reasonable you should be able to compile

3602
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,839
reasonable you should be able to compile
 

3603
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,270
reasonable you should be able to compile
it run it on the hardware

3604
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
it run it on the hardware
 

3605
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,670
it run it on the hardware
without having to tweak it and and do

3606
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:45,680
without having to tweak it and and do
 

3607
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,030
without having to tweak it and and do
all kinds of crazy things to get

3608
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,040
all kinds of crazy things to get
 

3609
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,910
all kinds of crazy things to get
performance

3610
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920
performance
 

3611
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,750
performance
there's not a lot of intermediate steps

3612
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:49,760
there's not a lot of intermediate steps
 

3613
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,190
there's not a lot of intermediate steps
right it's running directly as right

3614
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
right it's running directly as right
 

3615
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,789
right it's running directly as right
like on a gpu if you write a large

3616
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:52,799
like on a gpu if you write a large
 

3617
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,109
like on a gpu if you write a large
matrix multiply naively you'll get five

00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
right and then there's a bunch there's a
 

3625
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,430
right and then there's a bunch there's a
bunch of people publish papers on this

you either write a pre

3656
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:33,520
you either write a pre
 

3657
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,390
you either write a pre
use a pre-written library which is a

3658
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
use a pre-written library which is a
 

3659
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,829
use a pre-written library which is a
good strategy for some things

right so the optimization step is way

3666
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,760
right so the optimization step is way
 

3667
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,510
right so the optimization step is way
more complicated with the gpa so our

3668
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,520
more complicated with the gpa so our

now there's as the networks are evolving

3674
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
now there's as the networks are evolving
 

3675
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,670
now there's as the networks are evolving
you know they've changed from

people are talking about conditional

3680
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
people are talking about conditional
 

3681
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,030
people are talking about conditional
graphs you're talking about very large

3682
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,040
graphs you're talking about very large
 

3683
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,510

you're talking about problems that scale

3686
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:03,920
you're talking about problems that scale
 

3687
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,069
you're talking about problems that scale
across many many chips

3688
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
across many many chips
 

3689
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,270
across many many chips
so the the native you know

3690
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,280
so the the native you know
 

3691
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,829
so the the native you know
data item is a as a packet like so you

3692
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
data item is a as a packet like so you
 

3693
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,510
data item is a as a packet like so you
send a packet to a processor it gets

3694
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
send a packet to a processor it gets
 

3695
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,390
send a packet to a processor it gets
processed

3696
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
processed
 

3697
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,829
processed
it does a bunch of work and then it may

3698
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
it does a bunch of work and then it may
 

3699
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,990
it does a bunch of work and then it may
send packets to other processors and

3700
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
send packets to other processors and
 

3701
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,390
send packets to other processors and
and they execute like a data flow graph

3702
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
and they execute like a data flow graph
 

3703
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,990
and they execute like a data flow graph
kind of methodology

3704
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
kind of methodology
 

3705
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,470
kind of methodology
got it we have a big network on chip and

3706
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
got it we have a big network on chip and
 

3707
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,430
got it we have a big network on chip and
then 16

3708
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
then 16
 

3709
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,349
then 16
the next second chip has 16 ethernet

3710
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
the next second chip has 16 ethernet
 

3711
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,349
the next second chip has 16 ethernet
ports they hook lots of them together

3712
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,359
ports they hook lots of them together
 

3713
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,109
ports they hook lots of them together
and it's the same graph compiler across

3714
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
and it's the same graph compiler across
 

3715
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,109
and it's the same graph compiler across
multiple chips so that's where the scale

3716
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
multiple chips so that's where the scale
 

3717
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,390
multiple chips so that's where the scale
comes in so it's built to scale

3718
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
comes in so it's built to scale
 

3719
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,109
comes in so it's built to scale
naturally

3720
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:35,119
naturally
 

3721
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,670
naturally
now my experience with scaling is as you

3722
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
now my experience with scaling is as you
 

3723
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,430
now my experience with scaling is as you
scale you run into lots of interesting

3724
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
scale you run into lots of interesting
 

3725
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,630
scale you run into lots of interesting
problems

3726
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
problems
 

3727
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,270
problems
so scaling is the mountain to climb yeah

3728
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,280
so scaling is the mountain to climb yeah
 

3729
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,030
so scaling is the mountain to climb yeah
so the hardware is built to do this and

3730
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:45,040
so the hardware is built to do this and
 

3731
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,829
so the hardware is built to do this and
then

3732
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
then
 

3733
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,910
then
we're in the process of is there a

3734
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
we're in the process of is there a
 

3735
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,030
we're in the process of is there a
software part to this

3736
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:49,040
software part to this
 

3737
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,870
software part to this
with ethernet and all that well the

3738
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:52,880
with ethernet and all that well the
 

3739
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,549
with ethernet and all that well the
you know the protocol at the bottom you

3740
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:54,559
you know the protocol at the bottom you
 

3741
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,470
you know the protocol at the bottom you
know we send you know it's an ethernet

3742
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
know we send you know it's an ethernet
 

3743
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,670
know we send you know it's an ethernet
phi but the protocol basically says

3744
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
phi but the protocol basically says
 

3745
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,510
phi but the protocol basically says
send a packet from here to there it's

3746
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
send a packet from here to there it's
 

3747
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,950
send a packet from here to there it's
all point to point

3748
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
all point to point
 

3749
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,030
all point to point
the header bit says which processor to

3750
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
the header bit says which processor to
 

3751
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,510
the header bit says which processor to
send it to and we basically

3752
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
send it to and we basically
 

3753
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,430
send it to and we basically
take a packet off our on-chip network

3754
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,440
take a packet off our on-chip network
 

3755
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,109
take a packet off our on-chip network
put an ethernet header on it

3756
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:11,119
put an ethernet header on it
 

3757
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,349
put an ethernet header on it
send it to the other end to strip the

3758
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
send it to the other end to strip the
 

3759
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,630
send it to the other end to strip the
header off and send it to the local

3760
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:14,640
header off and send it to the local
 

3761
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,990
header off and send it to the local
thing it's pretty straightforward

3762
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,000
thing it's pretty straightforward
 

3763
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,349
thing it's pretty straightforward
human human interaction is pretty

3764
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
human human interaction is pretty
 

3765
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,549
human human interaction is pretty
straightforward too but when you get a

3766
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
straightforward too but when you get a
 

3767
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,829
straightforward too but when you get a
million of us we could

3768
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:19,839
million of us we could
 

3769
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,829
million of us we could
do some crazy stuff together it could be

3770
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
do some crazy stuff together it could be
 

3771
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,270
do some crazy stuff together it could be
fun

3772
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
fun
 

3773
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,470
fun
so is that the goal is scale so like for

3774
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
so is that the goal is scale so like for
 

3775
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,349
so is that the goal is scale so like for
example i've

01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
example i've
 

3777
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,750
example i've
been recently doing a bunch of robots at

3778
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
been recently doing a bunch of robots at
 

3779
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,750
been recently doing a bunch of robots at
home for my own personal pleasure

01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,760
home for my own personal pleasure
 

3781
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,390

uh am i going to ever use 10 story or is

3782
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
uh am i going to ever use 10 story or is

01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
this more for
 

3785
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,270
this more for
there's all kinds of problems like

3786
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
there's all kinds of problems like
 

3787
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,710
there's all kinds of problems like
they're small inference problems or

3788
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
they're small inference problems or
 

3789
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,990
they're small inference problems or
small training problems there's big

3790
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
small training problems there's big
 

3791
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,349
small training problems there's big
training problems

3792
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
training problems
 

3793
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,589
training problems
what's the big goal is it the big

3794
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
what's the big goal is it the big
 

3795
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,190
what's the big goal is it the big
difference uh training problems or the

3796
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
difference uh training problems or the
 

3797
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,470
difference uh training problems or the
small training problems

3798
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
small training problems
 

3799
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,150
small training problems
well one of the goals is to scale from

3800
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,160
well one of the goals is to scale from
 

3801
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,670
well one of the goals is to scale from
100 milliwatts to a

3802
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
100 milliwatts to a
 

3803
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,030
100 milliwatts to a
to a megawatt you know so like really

3804
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
to a megawatt you know so like really
 

3805
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,349
to a megawatt you know so like really
have some range on the problems and

3806
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
have some range on the problems and
 

3807
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,589
have some range on the problems and
the same kind of ai programs work at all

3808
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
the same kind of ai programs work at all
 

3809
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,190
the same kind of ai programs work at all
different levels

3810
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
different levels
 

3811
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,589
different levels
so that's cool the natural since the

3812
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:01,599
so that's cool the natural since the
 

3813
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,829
so that's cool the natural since the
natural data item is a packet that

3814
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
natural data item is a packet that
 

3815
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,510
natural data item is a packet that
we can move around it's built to scale

3816
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
we can move around it's built to scale
 

3817
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,990
we can move around it's built to scale
but so many people have you know small

3818
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
but so many people have you know small
 

3819
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,430
but so many people have you know small
problems

3820
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
problems
 

3821
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,670
problems
right right but but uh you know like

3822
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:13,680
right right but but uh you know like
 

3823
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,670
right right but but uh you know like
inside that phone is a small problem

3824
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
inside that phone is a small problem
 

3825
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,230
inside that phone is a small problem
to solve so do you see that storm

3826
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
to solve so do you see that storm
 

3827
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,630
to solve so do you see that storm
potentially being inside a phone well

3828
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
potentially being inside a phone well
 

3829
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,549
potentially being inside a phone well
the power efficiency of local memory

3830
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:22,559
the power efficiency of local memory
 

3831
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:23,670
the power efficiency of local memory
local computation

3832
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
local computation
 

3833
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,230
local computation
and the way we built it is pretty good

3834
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
and the way we built it is pretty good
 

3835
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,950
and the way we built it is pretty good
and then

3836
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
and then
 

3837
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,870
and then
there's a lot of efficiency on being

3838
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:28,880
there's a lot of efficiency on being
 

3839
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,150
there's a lot of efficiency on being
able to do conditional graphs and

3840
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
able to do conditional graphs and
 

3841
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,349
able to do conditional graphs and
sparsity

3842
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
sparsity
 

3843
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,470
sparsity
i think it for complicated networks i

3844
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
i think it for complicated networks i
 

3845
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,069
i think it for complicated networks i
want to go in a small factor it's been

3846
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
want to go in a small factor it's been
 

3847
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,670
want to go in a small factor it's been
quite good

3848
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
quite good
 

3849
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,910
quite good
um but we have to prove that that's a

3850
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:39,920
um but we have to prove that that's a
 

3851
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,029
um but we have to prove that that's a
that's a fun problem and that's the

3852
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,039
that's a fun problem and that's the
 

3853
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,230
that's a fun problem and that's the
early days of the company right it's a

3854
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
early days of the company right it's a
 

3855
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,630
early days of the company right it's a
couple years you said

3856
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
couple years you said
 

3857
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,470
couple years you said
but you think you invested you think

3858
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
but you think you invested you think
 

3859
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,789
but you think you invested you think
they're legit yeah as you join yeah well

3860
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
they're legit yeah as you join yeah well
 

3861
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,190
they're legit yeah as you join yeah well
that's well it's also it's a really

3862
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:51,200
that's well it's also it's a really
 

3863
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,109
that's well it's also it's a really
interesting place to be

3864
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
interesting place to be
 

3865
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,670
interesting place to be
like the ai world is exploding you know

3866
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
like the ai world is exploding you know
 

3867
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,950
like the ai world is exploding you know
and

3868
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
and
 

3869
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,390
and
i looked at some other opportunities

3870
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400
i looked at some other opportunities
 

3871
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,069
i looked at some other opportunities
like build a faster processor which

3872
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
like build a faster processor which
 

3873
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,109
like build a faster processor which
people want

3874
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:01,119
people want
 

3875
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,750
people want
yes but that's more on incremental path

3876
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
yes but that's more on incremental path
 

3877
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,789
yes but that's more on incremental path
than

3878
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:04,799
than
 

3879
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,390
than
what's going to happen in ai in the next

3880
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:06,400
what's going to happen in ai in the next
 

3881
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,829
what's going to happen in ai in the next
10 years

3882
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
10 years
 

3883
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,470
10 years
so this is kind of you know an exciting

3884
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
so this is kind of you know an exciting
 

3885
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,230
so this is kind of you know an exciting
place to be part of

3886
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
place to be part of
 

3887
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,150
place to be part of

01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,109
do it let's see
let's see see what turns out that that's

4050
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
let's see see what turns out that that's
 

4051
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,109
let's see see what turns out that that's
a that's a pretty powerful thing but

4052
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
a that's a pretty powerful thing but
 

4053
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,390
a that's a pretty powerful thing but
what do you um what's your sense about

4054
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
what do you um what's your sense about
 

4055
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,430
what do you um what's your sense about
he used to be

4056
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:55,440
he used to be
 

4057
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,190
he used to be
he no i think stepped away from google

4058
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,200
he no i think stepped away from google
 

4059
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,710
he no i think stepped away from google
right

4060
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
right
 

4061
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,829
right
he said sci-fi i think uh

4062
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
he said sci-fi i think uh
 

4063
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,750
he said sci-fi i think uh
what what's really impressive to you

4064
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,760
what what's really impressive to you
 

4065
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,510
what what's really impressive to you
about the things that chris has worked

4066
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,520
about the things that chris has worked
 

4067
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,870
about the things that chris has worked
on because it's that we mentioned the

4068
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
on because it's that we mentioned the
 

4069
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,230
on because it's that we mentioned the
optimization

4070
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
optimization
 

4071
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,829
optimization
the compiled design stuff the llvm uh

4072
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:11,839
the compiled design stuff the llvm uh
 

4073
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,589
the compiled design stuff the llvm uh
then there's he's also a google work

4074
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:13,599
then there's he's also a google work
 

4075
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,390
then there's he's also a google work
that the tpu stuff

4076
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:16,400
that the tpu stuff
 

4077
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,589
that the tpu stuff
he's obviously worked on swift so the

4078
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
he's obviously worked on swift so the
 

4079
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,270
he's obviously worked on swift so the
programming language side

4080
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:21,280
programming language side
 

4081
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,870
programming language side
talking about people that work in the

4082
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
talking about people that work in the
 

4083
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,710
talking about people that work in the
entirety of the stack yeah

4084
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720
entirety of the stack yeah
 

4085
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,029
entirety of the stack yeah
uh what uh from your time interacting

4086
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
uh what uh from your time interacting
 

4087
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:27,750
uh what uh from your time interacting
with chris

4088
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
with chris
 

4089
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,670
with chris
and knowing the guy what's really

4090
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680
and knowing the guy what's really
 

4091
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,990
and knowing the guy what's really
impressive to you it just inspires you

4092
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:32,000
impressive to you it just inspires you
 

4093
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,029
impressive to you it just inspires you
well well like llvm became

4094
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
well well like llvm became
 

4095
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,109
well well like llvm became
you know the platform the de facto

4096
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
you know the platform the de facto
 

4097
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,390
you know the platform the de facto
platform for

4098
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
platform for
 

4099
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,549
platform for
you know compilers like it's it's

4100
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:42,559
you know compilers like it's it's
 

4101
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,670
you know compilers like it's it's
amazing

4102
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
amazing
 

4103
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,109
amazing
and you know it was good code quality

4104
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:45,119
and you know it was good code quality
 

4105
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,789
and you know it was good code quality
good design choices he hit the right

4106
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
good design choices he hit the right
 

4107
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,630
good design choices he hit the right
level of abstraction

4108
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:48,640
level of abstraction
 

4109
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,309
level of abstraction
there's a little bit of the right time

4110
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:50,319
there's a little bit of the right time
 

4111
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,910
there's a little bit of the right time
in the right place

4112
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
in the right place
 

4113
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,349
in the right place
and then he built a new programming

4114
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
and then he built a new programming
 

4115
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,349
and then he built a new programming
language called swift

4116
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
language called swift
 

4117
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,589
language called swift
which you know after you know let's say

4118
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:57,599
which you know after you know let's say
 

4119
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,670
which you know after you know let's say
some adoption resistance became very

4120
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
some adoption resistance became very
 

4121
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,029
some adoption resistance became very
successful

4122
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
successful
 

4123
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,710
successful
i don't know that much about his work at

4124
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
i don't know that much about his work at
 

4125
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,789
i don't know that much about his work at
google although i know that

4126
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
google although i know that
 

4127
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,270
google although i know that
you know that was the typical they

4128
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
you know that was the typical they
 

4129
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,069
you know that was the typical they
started

4130
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
started
 

4131
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,990
started
tensorflow stuff and they you know it

4132
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
tensorflow stuff and they you know it
 

4133
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,430
tensorflow stuff and they you know it
was new is you know

4134
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
was new is you know
 

4135
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,109
was new is you know
they wrote a lot of code and then at

4136
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
they wrote a lot of code and then at
 

4137
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,270
they wrote a lot of code and then at
some point it needed to be refactored

4138
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
some point it needed to be refactored
 

4139
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,910
some point it needed to be refactored
to be you know because it its

4140
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920
to be you know because it its
 

4141
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,510
to be you know because it its
development slowed down why

4142
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:19,520
development slowed down why
 

4143
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,270
development slowed down why
pytorch started a little later and then

4144
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
pytorch started a little later and then
 

4145
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,430
pytorch started a little later and then
passed it so he did a lot of work on

4146
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:23,440
passed it so he did a lot of work on
 

4147
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:23,829
passed it so he did a lot of work on
that

4148
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
that
 

4149
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,870
that
and then his idea about mlir which is

4150
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:26,880
and then his idea about mlir which is
 

4151
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,390
and then his idea about mlir which is
what people started to realize is the

4152
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
what people started to realize is the
 

4153
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,470
what people started to realize is the
complexity of the software stack above

4154
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
complexity of the software stack above
 

4155
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,430
complexity of the software stack above
the low level ir was getting so high

4156
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:33,440
the low level ir was getting so high
 

4157
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,670
the low level ir was getting so high
that forcing the features of that into a

4158
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:35,680
that forcing the features of that into a
 

4159
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,150
that forcing the features of that into a
level

4160
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:36,160
level
 

4161
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,150
level
was was putting too much of a burden on

4162
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
was was putting too much of a burden on
 

4163
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,390
was was putting too much of a burden on
it so he's splitting that into multiple

4164
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
it so he's splitting that into multiple
 

4165
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,430
it so he's splitting that into multiple
pieces

4166
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
pieces
 

4167
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,789
pieces
and that was one of the inspirations for

4168
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:42,799
and that was one of the inspirations for
 

4169
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,710
and that was one of the inspirations for
our software stack where we have

4170
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:44,720
our software stack where we have
 

4171
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,549
our software stack where we have
several intermediate representations

4172
01:07:46,549 --> 01:07:46,559
several intermediate representations
 

4173
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,630
several intermediate representations
that are all executable

4174
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
that are all executable
 

4175
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,829
that are all executable
and you can look at them and do

4176
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:49,839
and you can look at them and do
 

4177
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,390
and you can look at them and do
transformations on them before you lower

4178
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
transformations on them before you lower
 

4179
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,829
transformations on them before you lower
the level

4180
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:53,839
the level
 

4181
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,390
the level
so that was i think we started before

4182
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
so that was i think we started before
 

4183
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,150
so that was i think we started before
moir

4184
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:58,160
moir
 

4185
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,230
moir
really got you know far enough along to

4186
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
really got you know far enough along to
 

4187
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,349
really got you know far enough along to
use

4188
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:01,359
use
 

4189
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,029
use
uh but we're interested in that he's

4190
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
uh but we're interested in that he's
 

4191
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,630
uh but we're interested in that he's
really excited about that malaya

4192
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
really excited about that malaya
 

4193
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,630
really excited about that malaya
he's that's that's his like little baby

4194
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
he's that's that's his like little baby
 

4195
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,990
he's that's that's his like little baby
so he you know

4196
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000
so he you know
 

4197
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,069
so he you know
and there seems to be some profound

4198
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
and there seems to be some profound
 

4199
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,910
and there seems to be some profound
ideas on that that are really useful so

4200
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
ideas on that that are really useful so
 

4201
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,870
ideas on that that are really useful so
so each one of those things has been

4202
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:14,880
so each one of those things has been
 

4203
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,550
so each one of those things has been
as the world of software gets more and

4204
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:16,560
as the world of software gets more and
 

4205
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,309
as the world of software gets more and
more complicated how do we

4206
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
more complicated how do we
 

4207
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,149
more complicated how do we
create the right abstraction levels to

4208
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
create the right abstraction levels to
 

4209
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,669
create the right abstraction levels to
simplify it in a way that

4210
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679

triangles
 

4295
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,430
triangles
like so you have a triangle which maps

4296
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
like so you have a triangle which maps
 

4297
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,030

01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,560
so you build it's very easy
 

4301
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,829

and it's kind of weird because you walk

4306
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
and it's kind of weird because you walk
 

4307
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,110
and it's kind of weird because you walk
along the triangle to get to the edge

4308
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
along the triangle to get to the edge
 

4309
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,470
along the triangle to get to the edge
and then you have to go back down to the

4310
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:00,480
and then you have to go back down to the
 

4311
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,229
and then you have to go back down to the
next row and walk along and then you

4312
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
next row and walk along and then you
 

4313
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,990
next row and walk along and then you
have to decide on the edge

4314
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
have to decide on the edge
 

4315
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,630
have to decide on the edge
if the line of the triangle is like half

on the pixel
 

4319
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,590
on the pixel
what's the pixel color because it's half

4320
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
what's the pixel color because it's half
 

4321
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,950
what's the pixel color because it's half

that's called rasterization

4324
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:12,960
that's called rasterization
 

4325
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,550
that's called rasterization
because you're saying that could be done

4326
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:14,560
because you're saying that could be done
 

4327
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,470
because you're saying that could be done
in uh in hardware now

i've written a program that did

4334
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
i've written a program that did
 

4335
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,590
i've written a program that did
rasterization the hardware that does it

4336
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
rasterization the hardware that does it
 

4337
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,350
rasterization the hardware that does it
has actually less code than

01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
has actually less code than
 

4339
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,030
has actually less code than
the software program that does it and

4340
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
the software program that does it and
 

4341
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,510
the software program that does it and
it's way faster

4342
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,520
it's way faster
 

4343
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,229
it's way faster
right so there are certain times when

4344
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:34,239
right so there are certain times when
 

4345
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,149
right so there are certain times when
the abstraction you have rasterize a

the right thing to do in the hardware

4354
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
the right thing to do in the hardware
 

4355
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,630
the right thing to do in the hardware
software boundary is for the hardware to

4356
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
software boundary is for the hardware to
 

4357
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,669
software boundary is for the hardware to
naturally do it

4358
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:45,679
naturally do it
 

4359
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,990
naturally do it
and so the gpu is really optimized for

4360
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
and so the gpu is really optimized for
 

4361
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,990
and so the gpu is really optimized for
the rasterization of triangles

the rasterization of triangles
 

4363
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,149
the rasterization of triangles
well no that's just well like in a

that's a small piece of modern gpus what

4368
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
that's a small piece of modern gpus what
 

4369
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,070
that's a small piece of modern gpus what
they did is

4370
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
they did is
 

4371
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,910
they did is

let's be honest to say i don't actually

4386
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
let's be honest to say i don't actually
 

4387
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,149
let's be honest to say i don't actually
know the the math behind shader

4388
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
know the the math behind shader
 

4389
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,430
know the the math behind shader
shading and lighting and all that kind

4390
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,440
shading and lighting and all that kind
 

4391
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,590

01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
of stuff i don't know what
 

4393
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,270
of stuff i don't know what
they look like little simple floating

4394
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:19,280
they look like little simple floating
 

4395
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,270
they look like little simple floating
point programs or complicated ones you

4396
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
point programs or complicated ones you
 

4397
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,030
point programs or complicated ones you
can have 8 000 instructions in a shader

4398
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040
can have 8 000 instructions in a shader

program
 

4401
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,750

but i i don't have a good intuition why

4402
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
but i i don't have a good intuition why
 

4403
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,830
but i i don't have a good intuition why
it could be parallelized so easily

4404
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
it could be parallelized so easily
 

4405
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,030
it could be parallelized so easily
no it's because you have 8 million

4406
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
no it's because you have 8 million
 

4407
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,030
no it's because you have 8 million
pixels in every single so when you have

4408
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:31,040
pixels in every single so when you have
 

4409
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,830
pixels in every single so when you have
a light

4410
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:31,840
a light
 

4411
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,270
a light
right yeah that comes down the angle you

4412
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
right yeah that comes down the angle you
 

4413
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,790
right yeah that comes down the angle you
know the amount of light

4414
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,800
know the amount of light
 

4415
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,709
know the amount of light
like like say this is a line of pixels

4416
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
like like say this is a line of pixels
 

4417
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,390
like like say this is a line of pixels
across this table

4418
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
across this table
 

4419
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,990
across this table
right the amount of light on each pixel

4420
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
right the amount of light on each pixel
 

4421
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,590
right the amount of light on each pixel
is subtly different

4422
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:43,600
is subtly different
 

4423
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,189
is subtly different
and each pixel is responsible for

4424
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
and each pixel is responsible for
 

4425
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,950
and each pixel is responsible for
figuring out what figure it out so that

4426
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
figuring out what figure it out so that
 

4427
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,870
figuring out what figure it out so that
pixel says on this pixel i know the

4428
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
pixel says on this pixel i know the
 

4429
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,709
pixel says on this pixel i know the
angle of the light i know the occlusion

4430
01:11:50,709 --> 01:11:50,719
angle of the light i know the occlusion
 

4431
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,229
angle of the light i know the occlusion
i know the color i am

4432
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
i know the color i am
 

4433
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,669
i know the color i am
like every single pixel here is a

4434
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:53,679
like every single pixel here is a
 

4435
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,270
like every single pixel here is a
different color every single pixel gets

4436
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
different color every single pixel gets
 

4437
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,030
different color every single pixel gets
a different amount of light

4438
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
a different amount of light
 

4439
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,630
a different amount of light
every single pixel has a subtly

4440
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
every single pixel has a subtly
 

4441
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,390
every single pixel has a subtly
different translucency

4442
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:00,400
different translucency
 

4443
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,149
different translucency
so to make it look realistic the

4444
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,159
so to make it look realistic the
 

4445
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,149
so to make it look realistic the
solution was you run a separate program

4446
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
solution was you run a separate program
 

4447
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,030
solution was you run a separate program
on every pixel

4448
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,040
on every pixel
 

4449
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,630
on every pixel
see but i thought there's a reflection

4450
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:06,640
see but i thought there's a reflection
 

4451
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,470
see but i thought there's a reflection
from all over the place is every picture

4452
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
from all over the place is every picture
 

4453
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,189
from all over the place is every picture
yeah but there is

4454
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
yeah but there is
 

4455
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,189
yeah but there is
so so you build a reflection map which

4456
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:11,199
so so you build a reflection map which
 

4457
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,990
so so you build a reflection map which
also has some pixelated thing

4458
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,000
also has some pixelated thing
 

4459
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,350
also has some pixelated thing
and then when the pixel is looking at

4460
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
and then when the pixel is looking at
 

4461
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,030
and then when the pixel is looking at
the reflection map it has to calculate

4462
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040
the reflection map it has to calculate
 

4463
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,030
the reflection map it has to calculate
what the normal of the surface is

4464
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,040
what the normal of the surface is
 

4465
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,110
what the normal of the surface is
and it does it per pixel by the way

4466
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
and it does it per pixel by the way
 

4467
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,630
and it does it per pixel by the way
there's both loads of hacks on that

4468
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,640
there's both loads of hacks on that
 

4469
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,669
there's both loads of hacks on that
you're like you may have a lower

4470
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
you're like you may have a lower
 

4471
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:24,709
you're like you may have a lower
resolution

4472
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
resolution
 

4473
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,790
resolution
light map reflection map there's all

4474
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:26,800
light map reflection map there's all
 

4475
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,030
light map reflection map there's all
these you know attacks they do

4476
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
these you know attacks they do
 

4477
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,030
these you know attacks they do
but at the end of the day it's per pixel

4478
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
but at the end of the day it's per pixel
 

4479
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,790
but at the end of the day it's per pixel

computation
 

4481
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,510

4489
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,350
essentially
you could do floating point programs on

01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
you could do floating point programs on

well they've innovated several times but
 

4521
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,709

well they tried to pivot it's an
 

4531
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,630
well they tried to pivot it's an
interesting little uh

interesting little uh
 

4533
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,189
interesting little uh
game and play in autonomous vehicles

4534
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
game and play in autonomous vehicles
 

4535
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,310
game and play in autonomous vehicles
right with

4536
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
right with
 

4537
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,149
right with
or semi-autonomous like playing with

4538
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:30,159
or semi-autonomous like playing with
 

4539
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,750
or semi-autonomous like playing with
tesla and so on and seeing

4540
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
tesla and so on and seeing
 

4541
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,709
tesla and so on and seeing
that's a dipping a toe into that kind of

4542
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
that's a dipping a toe into that kind of
 

4543
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,510
that's a dipping a toe into that kind of
pivot

4544
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
pivot
 

4545
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,189
pivot
they came out with this platform which

4546
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
they came out with this platform which
 

4547
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,709
they came out with this platform which
is interesting technically

4548
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719
is interesting technically
 

4549
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,310
is interesting technically
yeah but it was like a three thousand

4550
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
yeah but it was like a three thousand
 

4551
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,990
yeah but it was like a three thousand
watt you know

4552
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
watt you know
 

4553
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,750
watt you know
you know thousand watt three three

4554
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:43,760
you know thousand watt three three
 

4555
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,990
you know thousand watt three three
thousand dollar you know gpu platform

4556
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
thousand dollar you know gpu platform
 

4557
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,950
thousand dollar you know gpu platform
i don't know if it's interesting

4558
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
i don't know if it's interesting
 

4559
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,910
i don't know if it's interesting
technically it's interesting

4560
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
technically it's interesting
 

4561
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,030
technically it's interesting
philosophically i

4562
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
philosophically i
 

4563
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,110
philosophically i
i technically i don't know if it's the

4564
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
i technically i don't know if it's the
 

4565
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,270
i technically i don't know if it's the
execution that craftsmanship was there

4566
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
execution that craftsmanship was there
 

4567
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,110
execution that craftsmanship was there
i'm not sure but that i didn't get a

4568
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
i'm not sure but that i didn't get a
 

4569
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,310
i'm not sure but that i didn't get a
sense they were

4570
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:56,320
sense they were
 

4571
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,310
sense they were
repurposing gpus for an automotive

4572
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
repurposing gpus for an automotive
 

4573
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,229
repurposing gpus for an automotive
solution right it's not a real pivot

4574
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
solution right it's not a real pivot
 

4575
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,510
solution right it's not a real pivot
they didn't they didn't build a

4576
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:01,520
they didn't they didn't build a
 

4577
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,070
they didn't they didn't build a
ground-up

4578
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:02,080
ground-up
 

4579
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,950
ground-up
solution right like the like the chips

4580
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960
solution right like the like the chips
 

4581
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,390
solution right like the like the chips
inside tesla are pretty cheap like

4582
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
inside tesla are pretty cheap like
 

4583
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,910
inside tesla are pretty cheap like
mobile eye has been doing this

4584
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:07,920
mobile eye has been doing this
 

4585
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,430
mobile eye has been doing this
they're they're doing the classic work

4586
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
they're they're doing the classic work
 

4587
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,110
they're they're doing the classic work
from the simplest thing yeah you know

4588
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
from the simplest thing yeah you know
 

4589
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,390
from the simplest thing yeah you know
they were building 40 mil

4590
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,400
they were building 40 mil
 

4591
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,030
they were building 40 mil
square millimeter chips and nvidia their

4592
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
square millimeter chips and nvidia their
 

4593
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,070
square millimeter chips and nvidia their
solution had two

4594
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080
solution had two
 

4595
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,149
solution had two
800 millimeter chips and two 200

4596
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:18,159
800 millimeter chips and two 200
 

4597
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,830
800 millimeter chips and two 200
millimeter chips and

4598
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
millimeter chips and
 

4599
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,430
millimeter chips and
you know like boatloads are really

4600
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
you know like boatloads are really
 

4601
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,669
you know like boatloads are really
expensive drams and

4602
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:23,679
expensive drams and
 

4603
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,510
expensive drams and
and you know it's a really different

4604
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
and you know it's a really different
 

4605
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,950
and you know it's a really different
approach

4606
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
approach
 

4607
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,870
approach
the mobilelite fit the let's say

4608
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
the mobilelite fit the let's say
 

4609
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,110
the mobilelite fit the let's say
automotive cost and form factor

4610
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
automotive cost and form factor
 

4611
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,709
automotive cost and form factor
and then they added features as it was

4612
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:32,719
and then they added features as it was
 

4613
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,550
and then they added features as it was
economically viable and

4614
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:34,560
economically viable and
 

4615
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,550
economically viable and
nvidia said take the biggest thing and

4616
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
nvidia said take the biggest thing and
 

4617
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,630
nvidia said take the biggest thing and
we're gonna go make it work

4618
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
we're gonna go make it work
 

4619
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,390
we're gonna go make it work
you know and and that's also influenced

4620
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
you know and and that's also influenced
 

4621
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,390
you know and and that's also influenced
like waymo there's a whole bunch of

4622
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
like waymo there's a whole bunch of
 

4623
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,990
like waymo there's a whole bunch of
autonomous startups where they have a

4624
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
autonomous startups where they have a
 

4625
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,709
autonomous startups where they have a
5000 watt server in their trunk

4626
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
5000 watt server in their trunk
 

4627
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,189
5000 watt server in their trunk
right and but that's that's because they

4628
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
right and but that's that's because they
 

4629
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,110
right and but that's that's because they
think well 5000 watts and you know 10

4630
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,120
think well 5000 watts and you know 10
 

4631
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:51,669
think well 5000 watts and you know 10
000

4632
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:51,679
000
 

4633
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,110
000
is okay because it's replacing the

4634
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
is okay because it's replacing the
 

4635
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,229
is okay because it's replacing the
driver elon's approach was that port has

4636
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
driver elon's approach was that port has
 

4637
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,910
driver elon's approach was that port has
to be cheap enough

4638
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
to be cheap enough
 

4639
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,669
to be cheap enough
to put it in every single tesla whether

4640
01:14:59,669 --> 01:14:59,679
to put it in every single tesla whether
 

4641
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,510
to put it in every single tesla whether
they turn on it autonomous driving or

4642
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:01,520
they turn on it autonomous driving or
 

4643
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,149
they turn on it autonomous driving or
not

4644
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
not
 

4645
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,110
not
which and mobileye was like we need to

4646
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,120
which and mobileye was like we need to
 

4647
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,950
which and mobileye was like we need to
fit in the bomb and you know cost

4648
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:06,960
fit in the bomb and you know cost
 

4649
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,070
fit in the bomb and you know cost
structure that

4650
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
structure that
 

4651
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,310
structure that
car companies do so they may sell you a

4652
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
car companies do so they may sell you a
 

4653
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,229
car companies do so they may sell you a
gps for 1500 bucks

4654
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
gps for 1500 bucks
 

4655
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,310
gps for 1500 bucks
but the bond for that's like 25

4656
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
but the bond for that's like 25
 

4657
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,110
but the bond for that's like 25
well and uh for mobile eye it seems like

4658
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,120
well and uh for mobile eye it seems like
 

4659
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,229
well and uh for mobile eye it seems like
neural networks

4660
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
neural networks
 

4661
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,229
neural networks
were not first-class citizens like the

4662
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239
were not first-class citizens like the
 

4663
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,990
were not first-class citizens like the
computation they didn't start out as

4664
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
computation they didn't start out as
 

4665
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,430
computation they didn't start out as
a yeah it was a cv problem yeah and did

4666
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:27,440
a yeah it was a cv problem yeah and did
 

4667
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,350
a yeah it was a cv problem yeah and did
classic cv and found stop lights and

4668
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
classic cv and found stop lights and
 

4669
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,110
classic cv and found stop lights and
lines and they were really good at it

4670
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,120
lines and they were really good at it
 

4671
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,270
lines and they were really good at it
yeah and they never i mean i don't know

4672
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
yeah and they never i mean i don't know
 

4673
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,790
yeah and they never i mean i don't know
what's happening now but they never

4674
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
what's happening now but they never
 

4675
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,550
what's happening now but they never
fully pivoted i mean it's like it's the

4676
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
fully pivoted i mean it's like it's the
 

4677
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,870
fully pivoted i mean it's like it's the
nvidia thing and then

4678
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
nvidia thing and then
 

4679
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,870
nvidia thing and then
as opposed to so if you look at the new

4680
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
as opposed to so if you look at the new
 

4681
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,910
as opposed to so if you look at the new
tesla work

4682
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
tesla work
 

4683
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,590
tesla work
it's like neural networks from the

4684
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
it's like neural networks from the
 

4685
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,350
it's like neural networks from the
ground up yeah right

4686
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,360
ground up yeah right
 

4687
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,950
ground up yeah right
yeah and even tesla started with a lot

4688
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
yeah and even tesla started with a lot
 

4689
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,950
yeah and even tesla started with a lot
of cv stuff in it and andre's basically

4690
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:48,960
of cv stuff in it and andre's basically
 

4691
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,270
of cv stuff in it and andre's basically
been

4692
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
been
 

4693
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,470
been
eliminating it move it move

4694
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:52,480
eliminating it move it move
 

4695
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,189
eliminating it move it move
everything into the network so uh

4696
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
everything into the network so uh
 

4697
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,149
everything into the network so uh
without

4698
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:56,159
without
 

4699
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,070
without
this isn't like confidential stuff but

4700
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
this isn't like confidential stuff but
 

4701
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,910
this isn't like confidential stuff but
you sitting on a porch

4702
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
you sitting on a porch
 

4703
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,070
you sitting on a porch
looking over the world looking at the

4704
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
looking over the world looking at the
 

4705
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,510
looking over the world looking at the
work that andre is doing

4706
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
work that andre is doing
 

4707
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,070
work that andre is doing
that elon's doing with tesla autopilot

4708
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
that elon's doing with tesla autopilot
 

4709
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,070
that elon's doing with tesla autopilot
uh do you like the trajectory of where

4710
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,080
uh do you like the trajectory of where
 

4711
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,270
uh do you like the trajectory of where
things are going on the floor

4712
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,280
things are going on the floor
 

4713
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,110
things are going on the floor
they're making serious progress i like

4714
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
they're making serious progress i like
 

4715
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,390
they're making serious progress i like
the videos of people

4716
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
the videos of people
 

4717
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,630
the videos of people
driving the beta stuff like it's taking

4718
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
driving the beta stuff like it's taking
 

4719
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,390
driving the beta stuff like it's taking
some pretty complicated intersections

4720
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
some pretty complicated intersections
 

4721
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,669
some pretty complicated intersections
and all that but it's

4722
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
and all that but it's
 

4723
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,709
and all that but it's
it's still an intervention for drive i

4724
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
it's still an intervention for drive i
 

4725
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,149
it's still an intervention for drive i
mean i i have autopilot the current

4726
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
mean i i have autopilot the current
 

4727
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:22,950
mean i i have autopilot the current
autopilot my

4728
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:22,960
autopilot my
 

4729
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,709
autopilot my
my tesla i use it every day do you have

4730
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
my tesla i use it every day do you have
 

4731
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,229
my tesla i use it every day do you have
full self-driving beta or no

4732
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:26,239
full self-driving beta or no
 

4733
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,630
full self-driving beta or no
no so you you like where this is going

4734
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:28,640
no so you you like where this is going
 

4735
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,070
no so you you like where this is going
we're making progress it's taking longer

4736
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
we're making progress it's taking longer
 

4737
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,149
we're making progress it's taking longer
than anybody thought

4738
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
than anybody thought
 

4739
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,510
than anybody thought
you know my wonder was

4740
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
you know my wonder was
 

4741
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,229
you know my wonder was
is you know hardware three is it enough

4742
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
is you know hardware three is it enough
 

4743
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:38,950
is you know hardware three is it enough
computing

4744
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
computing
 

4745
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,510
computing
off by two off by five off by ten off by

4746
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
off by two off by five off by ten off by
 

4747
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,229
off by two off by five off by ten off by
a hundred

4748
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
a hundred
 

4749
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,510
a hundred
yeah and and i i thought it probably

4750
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:45,520
yeah and and i i thought it probably
 

4751
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,030
yeah and and i i thought it probably
wasn't enough

4752
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
wasn't enough
 

4753
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,630
wasn't enough
but they're doing pretty well with it

4754
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
but they're doing pretty well with it
 

4755
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,070
but they're doing pretty well with it
now yeah and one thing is

4756
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
now yeah and one thing is
 

4757
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,750
now yeah and one thing is
the data set gets bigger the training

4758
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
the data set gets bigger the training
 

4759
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,590
the data set gets bigger the training
gets better and then there's this

4760
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
gets better and then there's this
 

4761
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,189
gets better and then there's this
interesting thing is

4762
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
interesting thing is
 

4763
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,270
interesting thing is
you sort of train and build an arbitrary

4764
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
you sort of train and build an arbitrary
 

4765
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,189
you sort of train and build an arbitrary
size network that solves the problem

4766
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
size network that solves the problem
 

4767
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,030
size network that solves the problem
and then you refactor the network down

4768
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,040
and then you refactor the network down
 

4769
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,709
and then you refactor the network down
to the thing that you can afford

4770
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
to the thing that you can afford
 

4771
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,709
to the thing that you can afford
to ship right so the the goal isn't to

4772
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:08,719
to ship right so the the goal isn't to
 

4773
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,630
to ship right so the the goal isn't to
build the network that fits in the phone

4774
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
build the network that fits in the phone
 

4775
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,870
build the network that fits in the phone
it's to build something that actually

4776
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:12,880
it's to build something that actually
 

4777
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,709
it's to build something that actually
works

4778
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
works
 

4779
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,110
works
and then then how do you make that most

4780
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,120
and then then how do you make that most
 

4781
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,669
and then then how do you make that most
effective on the hardware you have

4782
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
effective on the hardware you have
 

4783
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,270
effective on the hardware you have
and they seem to be doing that much

4784
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
and they seem to be doing that much
 

4785
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,350
and they seem to be doing that much
better than a couple years ago

4786
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,360
better than a couple years ago
 

4787
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,189
better than a couple years ago
well the one really important thing is

4788
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:25,199
well the one really important thing is
 

4789
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,030
well the one really important thing is
also what they're doing well is

4790
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
also what they're doing well is
 

4791
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,270
also what they're doing well is
how to iterate that quickly which means

4792
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
how to iterate that quickly which means
 

4793
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,030
how to iterate that quickly which means
like it's not just about one time

4794
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
like it's not just about one time
 

4795
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,630
like it's not just about one time
deployment one building is constantly

4796
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:32,640
deployment one building is constantly
 

4797
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,070
deployment one building is constantly
entering the network

4798
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
entering the network
 

4799
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,910
entering the network
and trying to automate as many steps as

4800
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
and trying to automate as many steps as
 

4801
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,430
and trying to automate as many steps as
possible right

4802
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
possible right
 

4803
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,229
possible right
and that's actually the principles of

4804
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
and that's actually the principles of
 

4805
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,229
and that's actually the principles of
the software 2.0 like you mentioned with

4806
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,239
the software 2.0 like you mentioned with
 

4807
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,430
the software 2.0 like you mentioned with
andre

4808
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
andre
 

4809
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,790
andre
is uh it's not just

4810
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
is uh it's not just
 

4811
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,390
is uh it's not just
i mean i don't know what the actual his

4812
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
i mean i don't know what the actual his
 

4813
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,790
i mean i don't know what the actual his
description of software 2.0 is

4814
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
description of software 2.0 is
 

4815
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,550
description of software 2.0 is
if it's just high-level philosophical or

4816
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,560
if it's just high-level philosophical or
 

4817
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,990
if it's just high-level philosophical or
their specifics but the

4818
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
their specifics but the
 

4819
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,390
their specifics but the
interesting thing about what that

4820
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:56,400
interesting thing about what that
 

4821
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,149
interesting thing about what that
actually looks in the real world

4822
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
actually looks in the real world
 

4823
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,750
actually looks in the real world
is it's that uh what i think andre calls

4824
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
is it's that uh what i think andre calls
 

4825
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,990
is it's that uh what i think andre calls
the data engine it's like

4826
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
the data engine it's like
 

4827
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,990
the data engine it's like
it's the iterative improvement of the

4828
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,000
it's the iterative improvement of the
 

4829
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,070
it's the iterative improvement of the
thing you have a neural network

4830
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,080
thing you have a neural network
 

4831
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,270
thing you have a neural network
that uh does stuff fails on a bunch of

4832
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
that uh does stuff fails on a bunch of
 

4833
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,110
that uh does stuff fails on a bunch of
things and learns from it over and over

4834
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
things and learns from it over and over
 

4835
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,149
things and learns from it over and over
and over so you're constantly

4836
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:14,159
and over so you're constantly
 

4837
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,830
and over so you're constantly
discovering edge cases

4838
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
discovering edge cases
 

4839
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,270
discovering edge cases
so it's very much about uh like data

4840
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
so it's very much about uh like data
 

4841
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,310
so it's very much about uh like data
engineering like

4842
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:20,320
engineering like
 

4843
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,470
engineering like
figuring out it's it's kind of what you

4844
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,480
figuring out it's it's kind of what you
 

4845
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,830
figuring out it's it's kind of what you
were talking about with testosterone is

4846
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:23,840
were talking about with testosterone is
 

4847
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,590
were talking about with testosterone is
you have the data landscape

4848
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
you have the data landscape
 

4849
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,950
you have the data landscape
they have to walk along that data

4850
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,960
they have to walk along that data
 

4851
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,110
they have to walk along that data
landscape in a way that uh

4852
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
landscape in a way that uh
 

4853
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,830
landscape in a way that uh
that's constantly improving the the the

4854
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
that's constantly improving the the the
 

4855
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,510
that's constantly improving the the the
neural network and that that feels like

4856
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
neural network and that that feels like
 

4857
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,270
neural network and that that feels like
that's the central piece of it yeah

4858
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,280
that's the central piece of it yeah
 

4859
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,030
that's the central piece of it yeah
itself and there's two pieces of it like

4860
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
itself and there's two pieces of it like
 

4861
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,790
itself and there's two pieces of it like
you you find edge cases that don't work

4862
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
you you find edge cases that don't work
 

4863
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,229
you you find edge cases that don't work
and then you define something that goes

4864
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
and then you define something that goes
 

4865
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,070
and then you define something that goes
get your data for that

4866
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,080
get your data for that
 

4867
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,510
get your data for that
but then the other constraint is whether

4868
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
but then the other constraint is whether
 

4869
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,430
but then the other constraint is whether
you have to label it or not like the

4870
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
you have to label it or not like the
 

4871
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,430
you have to label it or not like the
the amazing thing about like the gpt3

4872
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
the amazing thing about like the gpt3
 

4873
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,350
the amazing thing about like the gpt3
stuff is it's unsupervised

4874
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
stuff is it's unsupervised
 

4875
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,790
stuff is it's unsupervised
so there's essentially infinite amount

4876
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
so there's essentially infinite amount
 

4877
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,470
so there's essentially infinite amount
of data now there's obviously infinite

4878
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
of data now there's obviously infinite
 

4879
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,750
of data now there's obviously infinite
amount of data

4880
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
amount of data
 

4881
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,270
amount of data
available from cars of people

4882
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
available from cars of people
 

4883
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,110
available from cars of people
successfully driving

4884
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
successfully driving
 

4885
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,110
successfully driving
but you know the the current pipelines

4886
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
but you know the the current pipelines
 

4887
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,189
but you know the the current pipelines
are mostly running on labeled data which

4888
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
are mostly running on labeled data which
 

4889
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,470
are mostly running on labeled data which
is human limited

4890
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
is human limited
 

4891
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:08,550
is human limited
so when that becomes unsupervised

4892
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:08,560
so when that becomes unsupervised
 

4893
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,070
so when that becomes unsupervised
right it it'll create unlimited amount

4894
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,080
right it it'll create unlimited amount
 

4895
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,070
right it it'll create unlimited amount
of data which then they'll scale

4896
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
of data which then they'll scale
 

4897
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,149
of data which then they'll scale
now the networks that may use that data

4898
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
now the networks that may use that data
 

4899
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,070
now the networks that may use that data
might be way too big for cars

4900
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:18,080
might be way too big for cars
 

4901
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,510
might be way too big for cars
but then there'll be the transformation

4902
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
but then there'll be the transformation
 

4903
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,950
but then there'll be the transformation
from now we have unlimited data i know

4904
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
from now we have unlimited data i know
 

4905
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,229
from now we have unlimited data i know
exactly what i want

4906
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
exactly what i want
 

4907
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,910
exactly what i want
now can i turn that into something that

4908
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920
now can i turn that into something that
 

4909
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,669
now can i turn that into something that
fits in the car

4910
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:25,679
fits in the car
 

4911
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,270
fits in the car
and that pro that process is going to

4912
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,280
and that pro that process is going to
 

4913
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,110
and that pro that process is going to
happen all over the place

4914
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
happen all over the place
 

4915
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,390
happen all over the place
every time you get to the place where

4916
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
every time you get to the place where
 

4917
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,550
every time you get to the place where
you have unlimited data and that's what

4918
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
you have unlimited data and that's what
 

4919
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,990
you have unlimited data and that's what
software 2.0 is about

4920
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000
software 2.0 is about
 

4921
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,229
software 2.0 is about
unlimited data training networks to do

4922
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
unlimited data training networks to do
 

4923
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,910
unlimited data training networks to do
stuff

4924
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
stuff
 

4925
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,189
stuff
without humans writing code to do it and

4926
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:41,199
without humans writing code to do it and
 

4927
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,030
without humans writing code to do it and
ultimately also trying to discover like

4928
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
ultimately also trying to discover like
 

4929
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,830
ultimately also trying to discover like
you're saying the self-supervised

4930
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:45,840
you're saying the self-supervised
 

4931
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,510
you're saying the self-supervised
formulation of the problem so the

4932
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,520
formulation of the problem so the
 

4933
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,510
formulation of the problem so the
unsupervised formulation of the problem

4934
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:49,520
unsupervised formulation of the problem
 

4935
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,510
unsupervised formulation of the problem
like uh you know in driving there's this

4936
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
like uh you know in driving there's this
 

4937
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,110
like uh you know in driving there's this
really interesting

4938
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:53,120
really interesting
 

4939
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,709
really interesting
thing which is you look at a scene

4940
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:56,719
thing which is you look at a scene
 

4941
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,950
thing which is you look at a scene
that's before you and you have data

4942
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
that's before you and you have data
 

4943
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,830
that's before you and you have data
about what a successful human driver did

4944
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:01,840
about what a successful human driver did
 

4945
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,310
about what a successful human driver did
in that scene you know one second later

4946
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,320
in that scene you know one second later
 

4947
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,229
in that scene you know one second later
it's a little piece of data that you can

4948
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
it's a little piece of data that you can
 

4949
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,350
it's a little piece of data that you can
use just like with gpt-3 as training

4950
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
use just like with gpt-3 as training
 

4951
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,510
use just like with gpt-3 as training
currently even even though tesla says

4952
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
currently even even though tesla says
 

4953
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,270
currently even even though tesla says
they're using that it's an open question

4954
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
they're using that it's an open question
 

4955
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,470
they're using that it's an open question
to me

4956
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,480
to me
 

4957
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,470
to me
how much how far can you can you sell

4958
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:16,480
how much how far can you can you sell
 

4959
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,070
how much how far can you can you sell
all of the driving with just

4960
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
all of the driving with just
 

4961
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,110
all of the driving with just
that self-supervised piece of data

4962
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,120
that self-supervised piece of data
 

4963
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,229
that self-supervised piece of data
and like i i think that's what comedy is

4964
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
and like i i think that's what comedy is
 

4965
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,430
and like i i think that's what comedy is
doing

4966
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
doing
 

4967
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,110
doing
that's what common ai is doing but the

4968
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
that's what common ai is doing but the
 

4969
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,950
that's what common ai is doing but the
question is how

4970
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
question is how
 

4971
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,189
question is how
how much data so what comedy ai doesn't

4972
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
how much data so what comedy ai doesn't
 

4973
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,229
how much data so what comedy ai doesn't
have

4974
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
have
 

4975
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,030
have
is as good of a data engine for example

4976
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040
is as good of a data engine for example
 

4977
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,709
is as good of a data engine for example
as tesla does that's where the

4978
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:36,719
as tesla does that's where the
 

4979
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,910
as tesla does that's where the
like the organization of the data i mean

4980
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
like the organization of the data i mean
 

4981
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,189
like the organization of the data i mean
as far as i know i haven't talked to

4982
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
as far as i know i haven't talked to
 

4983
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:41,830
as far as i know i haven't talked to
george

4984
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:41,840
george
 

4985
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,950
george
but they do have the data the question

4986
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
but they do have the data the question
 

4987
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,750
but they do have the data the question
is how much data is needed

4988
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
is how much data is needed
 

4989
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,430
is how much data is needed
because we say infinite very loosely

4990
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
because we say infinite very loosely
 

4991
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,350
because we say infinite very loosely
here uh it's it's

4992
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
here uh it's it's
 

4993
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,629
here uh it's it's
and then the other question which you

4994
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
and then the other question which you
 

4995
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,430
and then the other question which you
said i don't know if you think it's

4996
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
said i don't know if you think it's
 

4997
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,510
said i don't know if you think it's
still an open question is

4998
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,520
still an open question is
 

4999
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,270
still an open question is
are we in the right order of magnitude

5000
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
are we in the right order of magnitude
 

5001
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,910
are we in the right order of magnitude
for the compute necessary

5002
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:01,920
for the compute necessary
 

5003
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,629
for the compute necessary
that is is this is it like what elon

5004
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
that is is this is it like what elon
 

5005
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,430
that is is this is it like what elon
said this

5006
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
said this
 

5007
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,350
said this
chip that's in there now is enough to do

5008
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
chip that's in there now is enough to do
 

5009
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,470
chip that's in there now is enough to do
full self-driving

5010
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:08,480
full self-driving
 

5011
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,629
full self-driving
or do we need another order of magnitude

5012
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:10,639
or do we need another order of magnitude
 

5013
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,310
or do we need another order of magnitude
i think nobody actually knows the answer

5014
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,320
i think nobody actually knows the answer
 

5015
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,189
i think nobody actually knows the answer
to that question

5016
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
to that question
 

5017
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,149
to that question
i like the confidence that elon has but

5018
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:16,159
i like the confidence that elon has but
 

5019
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,430
i like the confidence that elon has but
yeah we'll see

5020
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
yeah we'll see
 

5021
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,870
yeah we'll see
and there's another funny thing is you

5022
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880
and there's another funny thing is you
 

5023
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,790
and there's another funny thing is you
don't learn to drive with infinite

5024
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
don't learn to drive with infinite
 

5025
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,149
don't learn to drive with infinite
amounts of data

5026
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
amounts of data
 

5027
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,750
amounts of data
you learn to drive with an intellectual

5028
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
you learn to drive with an intellectual
 

5029
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,070
you learn to drive with an intellectual
framework that understands physics and

5030
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
framework that understands physics and
 

5031
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,189
framework that understands physics and
color and horizontal surfaces and laws

5032
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
color and horizontal surfaces and laws
 

5033
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,310
color and horizontal surfaces and laws
and roads and

5034
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,320
and roads and
 

5035
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,910
and roads and
you know all your your uh experience

5036
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:33,920
you know all your your uh experience
 

5037
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,629
you know all your your uh experience
from manipulating your environment

5038
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:36,639
from manipulating your environment
 

5039
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,470
from manipulating your environment
like look there's so many factors go

5040
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480
like look there's so many factors go
 

5041
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,830
like look there's so many factors go
into that so then when you learn to

5042
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
into that so then when you learn to
 

5043
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,430
into that so then when you learn to
drive

5044
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
drive
 

5045
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,189
drive
like driving is a subset of this

5046
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
like driving is a subset of this
 

5047
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,750
like driving is a subset of this
conceptual framework that you have

5048
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
conceptual framework that you have
 

5049
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,669
conceptual framework that you have
right and so with self-driving cars

5050
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
right and so with self-driving cars
 

5051
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,430
right and so with self-driving cars
right now we're teaching them to drive

5052
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
right now we're teaching them to drive
 

5053
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,510
right now we're teaching them to drive
with driving data

5054
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
with driving data
 

5055
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,590
with driving data
you never teach a human to do that you

5056
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:53,600
you never teach a human to do that you
 

5057
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,270
you never teach a human to do that you
teach a human all kinds of interesting

5058
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:55,280
teach a human all kinds of interesting
 

5059
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,550
teach a human all kinds of interesting
things like

5060
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
things like
 

5061
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,229
things like
language like don't do that you know

5062
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
language like don't do that you know
 

5063
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,990
language like don't do that you know
watch out you know there's all kinds of

5064
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:00,000
watch out you know there's all kinds of
 

5065
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,750
watch out you know there's all kinds of
stuff going on well this is where you i

5066
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
stuff going on well this is where you i
 

5067
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,149
stuff going on well this is where you i
think previous time with we talked about

5068
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:04,159
think previous time with we talked about
 

5069
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,510
think previous time with we talked about
where you poetically uh disagreed with

5070
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
where you poetically uh disagreed with
 

5071
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,550
where you poetically uh disagreed with
my naive

5072
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
my naive
 

5073
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,390
my naive
uh notion about humans i just think that

5074
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
uh notion about humans i just think that
 

5075
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,229
uh notion about humans i just think that
humans will will make this whole driving

5076
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
humans will will make this whole driving
 

5077
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,750
humans will will make this whole driving
thing really difficult

5078
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
thing really difficult
 

5079
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,149
thing really difficult
yeah all right like i said humans don't

5080
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:18,159
yeah all right like i said humans don't
 

5081
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,270
yeah all right like i said humans don't
move that slow

5082
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
move that slow
 

5083
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,870
move that slow
it's a ballistics problem it's a

5084
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
it's a ballistics problem it's a
 

5085
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,550
it's a ballistics problem it's a
ballistic human zero ballistics problem

5086
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
ballistic human zero ballistics problem
 

5087
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,990
ballistic human zero ballistics problem
which is like poetry to me

5088
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
which is like poetry to me
 

5089
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,750
which is like poetry to me
it's very it's very possible that in

5090
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
it's very it's very possible that in
 

5091
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,270
it's very it's very possible that in
driving they're indeed purely a

5092
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
driving they're indeed purely a
 

5093
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,550
driving they're indeed purely a
ballistics problem i

5094
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
ballistics problem i
 

5095
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,830
ballistics problem i
and i think that's probably the right

5096
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
and i think that's probably the right
 

5097
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,590
and i think that's probably the right
way to think about it but

5098
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:31,600
way to think about it but
 

5099
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,149
way to think about it but
i still they still continue to surprise

5100
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
i still they still continue to surprise
 

5101
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:34,790
i still they still continue to surprise
me those

5102
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
me those
 

5103
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,110
me those
and damn pedestrians the cyclists other

5104
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
and damn pedestrians the cyclists other
 

5105
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,709
and damn pedestrians the cyclists other
humans and other cars

5106
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
humans and other cars
 

5107
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,070
humans and other cars
and yeah but it's going to be one of

5108
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
and yeah but it's going to be one of
 

5109
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,550
and yeah but it's going to be one of
these compensating things so

5110
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
these compensating things so
 

5111
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,790
these compensating things so
like when you're driving you have an

5112
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
like when you're driving you have an
 

5113
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,390
like when you're driving you have an
intuition about what humans are going to

5114
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
intuition about what humans are going to
 

5115
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,709
intuition about what humans are going to
do

5116
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
do
 

5117
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,950
do
but you don't have 360 cameras and

5118
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
but you don't have 360 cameras and
 

5119
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,950
but you don't have 360 cameras and
radars and you have an attention problem

5120
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
radars and you have an attention problem
 

5121
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,669
radars and you have an attention problem
so yeah

5122
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
so yeah
 

5123
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,910
so yeah
so so the self-driving car comes in with

5124
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
so so the self-driving car comes in with
 

5125
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,310
so so the self-driving car comes in with
no attention problems 360 cameras right

5126
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,320
no attention problems 360 cameras right
 

5127
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,030
no attention problems 360 cameras right
you know

5128
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
you know
 

5129
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,870
you know
a bunch of other features yeah so

5130
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:58,880
a bunch of other features yeah so
 

5131
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,390
a bunch of other features yeah so
they'll wipe out a whole class of

5132
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
they'll wipe out a whole class of
 

5133
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,590
they'll wipe out a whole class of
accidents

5134
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:01,600
accidents
 

5135
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,470
accidents
right and you know you know emergency

5136
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
right and you know you know emergency
 

5137
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,830
right and you know you know emergency
braking with radar and

5138
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:05,840
braking with radar and
 

5139
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,430
braking with radar and
especially as it gets you know ai

5140
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
especially as it gets you know ai
 

5141
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,070
especially as it gets you know ai
enhanced will eliminate collisions

5142
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
enhanced will eliminate collisions
 

5143
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,510
enhanced will eliminate collisions
right but then you have the other

5144
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
right but then you have the other
 

5145
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,110
right but then you have the other
problems of these unexpected things

5146
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
problems of these unexpected things
 

5147
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,510
problems of these unexpected things
where

5148
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:13,520
where
 

5149
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,030
where
you know you think your human intuition

5150
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
you know you think your human intuition
 

5151
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,750
you know you think your human intuition
is helping but then the cars also have

5152
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:17,760
is helping but then the cars also have
 

5153
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,590
is helping but then the cars also have
you know a set of hardware features that

5154
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
you know a set of hardware features that
 

5155
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,350
you know a set of hardware features that
you're not even close to

5156
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:21,360
you're not even close to
 

5157
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,149
you're not even close to
and the key thing of course is uh if you

5158
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:24,159
and the key thing of course is uh if you
 

5159
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,189
and the key thing of course is uh if you
wipe out

5160
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
wipe out
 

5161
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,189
wipe out
a huge number of kind of accidents then

5162
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:27,199
a huge number of kind of accidents then
 

5163
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,390
a huge number of kind of accidents then
it might be just way

5164
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
it might be just way
 

5165
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,110
it might be just way
safer than the human driver even though

5166
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
safer than the human driver even though
 

5167
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,790
safer than the human driver even though
even if humans are still a problem

5168
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:32,800
even if humans are still a problem
 

5169
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,270
even if humans are still a problem
that's hard to figure out yeah that's

5170
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
that's hard to figure out yeah that's
 

5171
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,950
that's hard to figure out yeah that's
probably what happens autonomous cars

5172
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
probably what happens autonomous cars
 

5173
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,590
probably what happens autonomous cars
will have

5174
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:37,600
will have
 

5175
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,189
will have
a small number of accidents humans would

5176
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,199
a small number of accidents humans would
 

5177
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,870
a small number of accidents humans would
have avoided but they'll wipe

5178
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880
have avoided but they'll wipe
 

5179
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,830
have avoided but they'll wipe
they'll get rid of the bulk of them what

5180
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:43,840
they'll get rid of the bulk of them what
 

5181
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,350
they'll get rid of the bulk of them what
do you think about

5182
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
do you think about
 

5183
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,550
do you think about
uh like tesla's dojo efforts

5184
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
uh like tesla's dojo efforts
 

5185
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,390
uh like tesla's dojo efforts
or it can be bigger than tesla in

5186
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:50,400
or it can be bigger than tesla in
 

5187
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,070
or it can be bigger than tesla in
general it's kind of like the tense

5188
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
general it's kind of like the tense
 

5189
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,669
general it's kind of like the tense

uh trying to innovate like this is the
 

5193
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,270
uh trying to innovate like this is the
dichotomy like

5194
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
dichotomy like
 

5195
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,110
dichotomy like
should a company try to from scratch

5196
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
should a company try to from scratch
 

5197
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,310
should a company try to from scratch
build its own

first i think it's great

5202
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:04,159
first i think it's great
 

5203
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,790
first i think it's great
so we need lots of experiments right and

5204
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
so we need lots of experiments right and
 

5205
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,149
so we need lots of experiments right and
there's lots of

there's lots of
 

5207
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,590
there's lots of
startups working on this and they're

5208
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
startups working on this and they're
 

5209
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,350
startups working on this and they're
pursuing different things

01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,790
pursuing different things
you know i was there when we started

5212
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
you know i was there when we started
 

5213
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,390
you know i was there when we started
dojo and it was sort of like

5214
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
dojo and it was sort of like
 

5215
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,189
dojo and it was sort of like
what's the unconstrained computer

5216
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:17,199
what's the unconstrained computer
 

5217
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:17,830
what's the unconstrained computer
solution

5218
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
solution
 

5219
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,590
solution
to go do very large training problems

5220
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
to go do very large training problems
 

5221
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,510
to go do very large training problems
and then there's fun stuff like you know

5222
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
and then there's fun stuff like you know
 

5223
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,590
and then there's fun stuff like you know
we said well we have this 10 000 watt

5224
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:25,600
we said well we have this 10 000 watt
 

5225
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,030
we said well we have this 10 000 watt
board to cool

5226
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040
board to cool
 

5227
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,030
board to cool
well you go talk to guys at spacex and

5228
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
well you go talk to guys at spacex and
 

5229
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,550
well you go talk to guys at spacex and
they think 10 000 watts is a really

5230
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
they think 10 000 watts is a really
 

5231
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,990
they think 10 000 watts is a really
small number not a big number

5232
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
small number not a big number
 

5233
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,550
small number not a big number
yeah and and there's brilliant people

5234
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
yeah and and there's brilliant people
 

5235
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,430
yeah and and there's brilliant people
working on it i'm

5236
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
working on it i'm
 

5237
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,270
working on it i'm
curious to see how it'll come out i i

5238
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:37,280
curious to see how it'll come out i i
 

5239
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,870
curious to see how it'll come out i i
couldn't tell you you know

5240
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
couldn't tell you you know
 

5241
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,629
couldn't tell you you know
i know it pivoted a few times since i

5242
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:40,639
i know it pivoted a few times since i
 

5243
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,629
i know it pivoted a few times since i
left so so the

5244
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:42,639
left so so the
 

5245
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,550
left so so the
cooling does seem to be a big problem i

5246
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
cooling does seem to be a big problem i
 

5247
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,830
cooling does seem to be a big problem i
do like what

5248
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
do like what
 

5249
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,669
do like what
elon said about it which is like we

5250
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
elon said about it which is like we
 

5251
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,189
elon said about it which is like we
don't want to do the thing

5252
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
don't want to do the thing
 

5253
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,550
don't want to do the thing
unless it's way better than the

5254
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
unless it's way better than the
 

5255
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,310
unless it's way better than the
alternative whatever the alternative

5256
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
alternative whatever the alternative
 

5257
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,830
alternative whatever the alternative
is so it has to be way better than like

5258
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:55,840
is so it has to be way better than like
 

5259
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,110
is so it has to be way better than like
racks of gpus yeah and the other thing

5260
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,120
racks of gpus yeah and the other thing
 

5261
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,910
racks of gpus yeah and the other thing
is just like

5262
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
is just like
 

5263
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,310
is just like
you know you know the tesla autonomous

5264
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:02,320
you know you know the tesla autonomous
 

5265
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,750
you know you know the tesla autonomous
driving hardware

5266
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
driving hardware
 

5267
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,390
driving hardware
it was only serving one software stack

5268
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
it was only serving one software stack
 

5269
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,750
it was only serving one software stack
and the hardware team and the software

5270
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:07,760
and the hardware team and the software
 

5271
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,669
and the hardware team and the software
team were tightly coupled

5272
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679
team were tightly coupled
 

5273
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:10,870
team were tightly coupled
you know if you're building a general

5274
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:10,880
you know if you're building a general
 

5275
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,709
you know if you're building a general
purpose ai solution then you know

5276
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
purpose ai solution then you know
 

5277
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,229
purpose ai solution then you know
there's so many different customers with

5278
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:14,239
there's so many different customers with
 

5279
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,310
there's so many different customers with
so many different needs

5280
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
so many different needs
 

5281
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,870
so many different needs
now something andre said is i think this

5282
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
now something andre said is i think this
 

5283
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,669
now something andre said is i think this
is amazing

5284
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
is amazing
 

5285
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,910
is amazing
10 years ago like vision recommendation

5286
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
10 years ago like vision recommendation
 

5287
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,750
10 years ago like vision recommendation
language were completely different

5288
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
language were completely different
 

5289
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,030
language were completely different
disciplines

5290
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
disciplines
 

5291
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,709
disciplines
we said the people literally couldn't

5292
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
we said the people literally couldn't
 

5293
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,790
we said the people literally couldn't
talk to each other and three years ago

5294
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
talk to each other and three years ago
 

5295
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,950
talk to each other and three years ago
it was all neural networks but the very

5296
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:32,960
it was all neural networks but the very
 

5297
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,629
it was all neural networks but the very
different neural networks

5298
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:34,639
different neural networks
 

5299
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,390
different neural networks
and recently it's converging on one set

5300
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:36,400
and recently it's converging on one set
 

5301
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,790
and recently it's converging on one set
of networks they vary a lot in size

5302
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
of networks they vary a lot in size
 

5303
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,390
of networks they vary a lot in size
obviously they vary in data

5304
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:40,400
obviously they vary in data
 

5305
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,110
obviously they vary in data
varying outputs but the technology has

5306
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
varying outputs but the technology has
 

5307
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,790
varying outputs but the technology has
converged a good bit

5308
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
converged a good bit
 

5309
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,350
converged a good bit
yeah these transformers behind gbt3 it

5310
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
yeah these transformers behind gbt3 it
 

5311
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,550
yeah these transformers behind gbt3 it
seems like they could be applied to

5312
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
seems like they could be applied to
 

5313
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,149
seems like they could be applied to
video they could be applied to a lot of

5314
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
video they could be applied to a lot of
 

5315
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,510
video they could be applied to a lot of
yeah and it's like and they're all

5316
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,520
yeah and it's like and they're all
 

5317
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,390
yeah and it's like and they're all
really

5318
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400
really
 

5319
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,550
really
it was like to literally replace letters

5320
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:54,560
it was like to literally replace letters
 

5321
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,750
it was like to literally replace letters
with pixels

5322
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
with pixels
 

5323
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,350
with pixels
yeah it does vision it's amazing so

5324
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
yeah it does vision it's amazing so
 

5325
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,189
yeah it does vision it's amazing so
and then size actually improves the

5326
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
and then size actually improves the
 

5327
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,350
and then size actually improves the
thing so the bigger it gets the more

5328
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
thing so the bigger it gets the more
 

5329
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,709
thing so the bigger it gets the more
compute you throw at it the better it

5330
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:04,719
compute you throw at it the better it
 

5331
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:05,590
compute you throw at it the better it
gets

5332
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600

the more data you have the better it

5334
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
the more data you have the better it
 

5335
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,270
the more data you have the better it
gets so

gets so
so so then you start to wonder well is

5338
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:11,199
so so then you start to wonder well is
 

5339
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,030
so so then you start to wonder well is
that a fundamental thing or is

5340
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
that a fundamental thing or is
 

5341
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,510
that a fundamental thing or is
is this just another step to some

5342
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:15,520
is this just another step to some
 

5343
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,790
is this just another step to some
fundamental understanding about this

physics by reasoning well big things
 

5375
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,550
physics by reasoning well big things
should false faster than small things

5376
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
should false faster than small things
 

5377
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:42,870
should false faster than small things
right

5378
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
right
 

5379
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,870
right
that's reasoning and then there's

5380
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
that's reasoning and then there's
 

5381
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,790
that's reasoning and then there's

5385
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,229
like you know but the number of programs
in the world that are solved with the

in the world that are solved with the
 

5387
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,149

all programs have you know

5390
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
all programs have you know
 

5391
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,350
all programs have you know
more than one line of code maybe 100

5392
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
more than one line of code maybe 100
 

5393

so you said that now we're going to

5396
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:58,560
so you said that now we're going to
 

5397

01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,750
and trying to design deep learning
architectures

5496
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:45,760
architectures
 

5497
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,870
architectures
uh do you do you think about the brain

5498
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
uh do you do you think about the brain
 

5499
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,990
uh do you do you think about the brain
at all

5500
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
at all
 

5501
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,470
at all
maybe from a hardware designer

5502
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:52,480
maybe from a hardware designer
 

5503
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,350
maybe from a hardware designer
perspective

5504
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,360
perspective
 

5505
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,510
perspective
if you could uh change something about

5506
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
if you could uh change something about
 

5507
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,350
if you could uh change something about
the brain what would you change

5508
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,360
the brain what would you change
 

5509
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,790
the brain what would you change
or do funny question like how would you

5510
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800
or do funny question like how would you
 

5511
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,709
or do funny question like how would you
so your brain is really weird like you

5512
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
so your brain is really weird like you
 

5513
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,229
so your brain is really weird like you
know your cereal cortex where we think

5514
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
know your cereal cortex where we think
 

5515
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,910
know your cereal cortex where we think
we do most of our thinking

5516
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
we do most of our thinking
 

5517
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,550
we do most of our thinking
is what like six or seven neurons thick

5518
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:08,560
is what like six or seven neurons thick
 

5519
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,430
is what like six or seven neurons thick
yeah like

5520
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
yeah like
 

5521
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,270
yeah like
that's weird like all the big networks

5522
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280
that's weird like all the big networks
 

5523
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,030
that's weird like all the big networks
are way bigger than that

5524
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,040
are way bigger than that
 

5525
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,070
are way bigger than that
like way deeper so that seems odd

5526
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
like way deeper so that seems odd
 

5527
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,910
like way deeper so that seems odd
and then you know when you're thinking

5528
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:17,920
and then you know when you're thinking
 

5529
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,709
and then you know when you're thinking
if it's if if the input generates a

5530
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:20,719
if it's if if the input generates a
 

5531
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,629
if it's if if the input generates a
result you can lose it goes really fast

5532
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:22,639
result you can lose it goes really fast
 

5533
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,110
result you can lose it goes really fast
but if it can't that generates an output

5534
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,120
but if it can't that generates an output
 

5535
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,629
but if it can't that generates an output
that's interesting which turns into an

5536
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
that's interesting which turns into an
 

5537
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,310
that's interesting which turns into an
input and then your brain

5538
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
input and then your brain
 

5539
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,990
input and then your brain
to the point where you mold things over

5540
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,000
to the point where you mold things over
 

5541
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,750
to the point where you mold things over
for days and how many trips through your

5542
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
for days and how many trips through your
 

5543
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,149
for days and how many trips through your
brain

5544
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
brain
 

5545
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,030
brain
is that right like it's you know 300

5546
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
is that right like it's you know 300
 

5547
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,390
is that right like it's you know 300
milliseconds or something to get through

5548
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
milliseconds or something to get through
 

5549
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,669
milliseconds or something to get through
seven levels of neurons

5550
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
seven levels of neurons
 

5551
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,149
seven levels of neurons
i forget the number exactly but then it

5552
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
i forget the number exactly but then it
 

5553
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,990
i forget the number exactly but then it
does it over and over and over as it

5554
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
does it over and over and over as it
 

5555
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,270
does it over and over and over as it
searches

5556
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:43,280
searches
 

5557
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,350
searches
and the brain clearly is looks like some

5558
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
and the brain clearly is looks like some
 

5559
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,030
and the brain clearly is looks like some
kind of graph because you have a neuron

5560
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
kind of graph because you have a neuron
 

5561
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,470
kind of graph because you have a neuron
with you know connections and it talks

5562
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:48,480
with you know connections and it talks
 

5563
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,830
with you know connections and it talks
to other ones and

5564
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:49,840
to other ones and
 

5565
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,750
to other ones and
it's locally very computationally

5566
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:51,760
it's locally very computationally
 

5567
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,910
it's locally very computationally
intense but it's also

5568
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:53,920
intense but it's also
 

5569
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,229
intense but it's also
does sparse computations across a pretty

5570
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:56,239
does sparse computations across a pretty
 

5571
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:57,669
does sparse computations across a pretty
big area

5572
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:57,679
big area
 

5573
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,149
big area
there's a lot of messy biological type

5574
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:00,159
there's a lot of messy biological type
 

5575
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,270
there's a lot of messy biological type
of things and it's

5576
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
of things and it's
 

5577
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,830
of things and it's
it's meaning like first of all there's

5578
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
it's meaning like first of all there's
 

5579
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,510
it's meaning like first of all there's
mechanical chemical and electrical

5580
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
mechanical chemical and electrical
 

5581
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,430
mechanical chemical and electrical
signals that's all that's going on

5582
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,440
signals that's all that's going on
 

5583
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,110
signals that's all that's going on
then the there's a the asynchronicity

5584
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:11,120
then the there's a the asynchronicity
 

5585
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,510
then the there's a the asynchronicity
of signals and there's like there's just

5586
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,520
of signals and there's like there's just
 

5587
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,030
of signals and there's like there's just
a lot of variability that seems

5588
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
a lot of variability that seems
 

5589
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,110
a lot of variability that seems
continuous and messy and just a

5590
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
continuous and messy and just a
 

5591
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,910
continuous and messy and just a
mess of biology and it's unclear whether

5592
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
mess of biology and it's unclear whether
 

5593
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,110
mess of biology and it's unclear whether
that's a

5594
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:21,120
that's a
 

5595
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,910
that's a
good thing yeah or it's a bad thing

5596
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:23,920
good thing yeah or it's a bad thing
 

5597
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,350
good thing yeah or it's a bad thing
because if

5598
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:25,360
because if
 

5599
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,950
because if
if it's a good thing that we need to run

5600
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:26,960
if it's a good thing that we need to run
 

5601
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,189
if it's a good thing that we need to run
the entirety of the evolution

5602
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:29,199
the entirety of the evolution
 

5603
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,629
the entirety of the evolution
well we're going to have to start with

5604
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:30,639
well we're going to have to start with
 

5605
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,709
well we're going to have to start with
basic bacteria to create some imaging

5606
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:32,719
basic bacteria to create some imaging
 

5607
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,110
basic bacteria to create some imaging
we could you could build a brain with 10

5608
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:35,120
we could you could build a brain with 10
 

5609
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,270
we could you could build a brain with 10
layers would that be better or worse

5610
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
layers would that be better or worse
 

5611
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,189
layers would that be better or worse
or more more connections or less

5612
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
or more more connections or less
 

5613
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,470
or more more connections or less
connections or you know

5614
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:40,480
connections or you know
 

5615
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,470
connections or you know
we don't know to what level our brains

5616
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
we don't know to what level our brains
 

5617
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,070
we don't know to what level our brains
are optimized

5618
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:44,080
are optimized
 

5619
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,149
are optimized
but if i was changing things like yeah

5620
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
but if i was changing things like yeah
 

5621
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,430
but if i was changing things like yeah
like you know you can only hold like

5622
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,440
like you know you can only hold like
 

5623
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,070
like you know you can only hold like
seven numbers

5624
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,080
seven numbers
 

5625
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,550
seven numbers
in your head yeah like why not 100 or a

5626
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:50,560
in your head yeah like why not 100 or a
 

5627
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,750
in your head yeah like why not 100 or a
million

5628
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:51,760
million
 

5629
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,229
million
never thought of that like and why can't

5630
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:54,239
never thought of that like and why can't
 

5631
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,910
never thought of that like and why can't
like why can't we have like a floating

5632
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
like why can't we have like a floating
 

5633
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,590
like why can't we have like a floating
point processor that can compute

5634
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
point processor that can compute
 

5635
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,189
point processor that can compute
anything we want

5636
01:30:59,189 --> 01:30:59,199
anything we want
 

5637
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,430
anything we want
like and see it all properly like that

5638
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
like and see it all properly like that
 

5639
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,950
like and see it all properly like that
would be kind of fun

5640
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:02,960
would be kind of fun
 

5641
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,870
would be kind of fun
and why can't we we see in four or eight

5642
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
and why can't we we see in four or eight
 

5643
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,550
and why can't we we see in four or eight
dimensions

5644
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
dimensions
 

5645
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,790
dimensions
like because you know 3d is kind of a

5646
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
like because you know 3d is kind of a
 

5647
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,830
like because you know 3d is kind of a
drag

5648
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:09,840
drag
 

5649
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,750
drag
like all the hard mass transforms are up

5650
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:11,760
like all the hard mass transforms are up
 

5651
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,750
like all the hard mass transforms are up
in multiple dimensions

5652
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:13,760
in multiple dimensions
 

5653
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,030
in multiple dimensions
so there's that you know you could

5654
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,040
so there's that you know you could
 

5655
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,750
so there's that you know you could
imagine a brain architecture that

5656
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
imagine a brain architecture that
 

5657
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,149
imagine a brain architecture that
you know you could enhance with a whole

5658
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
you know you could enhance with a whole
 

5659
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,149
you know you could enhance with a whole
bunch of features that would be

5660
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:22,159
bunch of features that would be
 

5661
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:23,510
bunch of features that would be
you know really useful for thinking

5662
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,520
you know really useful for thinking
 

5663
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,110
you know really useful for thinking
about things it's possible that the

5664
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,120
about things it's possible that the
 

5665
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,950
about things it's possible that the
limitations you're describing are

5666
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
limitations you're describing are
 

5667
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,669
limitations you're describing are
actually

5668
01:31:27,669 --> 01:31:27,679
actually
 

5669
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,830
actually
essential for like the constraints are

5670
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
essential for like the constraints are
 

5671
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,990
essential for like the constraints are
essential for creating

5672
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,000
essential for creating
 

5673
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,590
essential for creating
like the depth of intelligence like that

5674
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:35,600
like the depth of intelligence like that
 

5675
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,550
like the depth of intelligence like that
the ability to reason you know it's hard

5676
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:38,560
the ability to reason you know it's hard
 

5677
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,830
the ability to reason you know it's hard
to say because

5678
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
to say because
 

5679
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,910
to say because
like your brain is clearly a parallel

5680
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:41,920
like your brain is clearly a parallel
 

5681
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,870
like your brain is clearly a parallel
processor

5682
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:42,880
processor
 

5683
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,189
processor
you know you know 10 billion neurons

5684
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:45,199
you know you know 10 billion neurons
 

5685
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,790
you know you know 10 billion neurons
talking to each other at a relatively

5686
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:46,800
talking to each other at a relatively
 

5687
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,310
talking to each other at a relatively
low clock rate

5688
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:48,320
low clock rate
 

5689
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,709
low clock rate
but it produces something that looks

5690
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:50,719
but it produces something that looks
 

5691
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,470
but it produces something that looks
like a serial thought process

5692
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:52,480
like a serial thought process
 

5693
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,470
like a serial thought process
it's a serial narrative in your head

5694
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:54,480
it's a serial narrative in your head
 

5695
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,149
it's a serial narrative in your head
that's true right but then

5696
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
that's true right but then
 

5697
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,229
that's true right but then
there are people famously who are visual

5698
01:31:58,229 --> 01:31:58,239
there are people famously who are visual
 

5699
01:31:58,239 --> 01:31:59,830
there are people famously who are visual
thinkers like

5700
01:31:59,830 --> 01:31:59,840
thinkers like
 

5701
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,070
thinkers like
i think i'm a relatively visual thinker

5702
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:02,080
i think i'm a relatively visual thinker
 

5703
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,750
i think i'm a relatively visual thinker
i can imagine any object

5704
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:03,760
i can imagine any object
 

5705
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,229
i can imagine any object
and rotate it in my head and look at it

5706
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
and rotate it in my head and look at it
 

5707
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:07,590
and rotate it in my head and look at it
and there are people who say they don't

5708
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:07,600
and there are people who say they don't
 

5709
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,430
and there are people who say they don't
think that way at all

5710
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:09,440
think that way at all
 

5711
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,189
think that way at all
and recently i read an article about

5712
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:11,199
and recently i read an article about
 

5713
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,830
and recently i read an article about
people people who say they don't have a

5714
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:13,840
people people who say they don't have a
 

5715
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,070
people people who say they don't have a
they don't have a voice in their heads

5716
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
they don't have a voice in their heads
 

5717
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,950
they don't have a voice in their heads
they

5718
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:16,960
they
 

5719
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,430
they
can talk but when they you know it's

5720
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
can talk but when they you know it's
 

5721
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,950
can talk but when they you know it's
like well what are you thinking

5722
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:20,960
like well what are you thinking
 

5723
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,229
like well what are you thinking
they'll they'll describe something

5724
01:32:22,229 --> 01:32:22,239
they'll they'll describe something
 

5725
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,229
they'll they'll describe something
that's visual

5726
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
that's visual
 

5727
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:28,390
that's visual
so that's curious

5728
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400

 

5729
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,669

now if if you're saying

5730
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
now if if you're saying
 

5731
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,229
now if if you're saying
if we dedicated more hardware to holding

5732
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:34,239
if we dedicated more hardware to holding
 

5733
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,590
if we dedicated more hardware to holding
information like you know

5734
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:35,600
information like you know
 

5735
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,070
information like you know
10 numbers or a million numbers like

5736
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
10 numbers or a million numbers like
 

5737
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,590
10 numbers or a million numbers like
would that

5738
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
would that
 

5739
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,830
would that
just distract us from our ability to

5740
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:41,840
just distract us from our ability to
 

5741
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,350
just distract us from our ability to
form this kind of

5742
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
form this kind of
 

5743
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,669
form this kind of
singular identity like it dissipates

5744
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
singular identity like it dissipates
 

5745
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:46,870
singular identity like it dissipates
somehow right

5746
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
somehow right
 

5747
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,270
somehow right
but but maybe you know future humans

5748
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,280
but but maybe you know future humans
 

5749
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,270
but but maybe you know future humans
will have many identities that

5750
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:51,280
will have many identities that
 

5751
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,110
will have many identities that
have some higher level organization but

5752
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,120
have some higher level organization but
 

5753
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,550
have some higher level organization but
can actually do lots more things in

5754
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
can actually do lots more things in
 

5755
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,430
can actually do lots more things in
parallel

5756
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:55,440
parallel
 

5757
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,030
parallel
yeah there's no reason if we're thinking

5758
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
yeah there's no reason if we're thinking
 

5759
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,629
yeah there's no reason if we're thinking
modularly there's no reason we can't

5760
01:32:58,629 --> 01:32:58,639
modularly there's no reason we can't
 

5761
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,550
modularly there's no reason we can't
have multiple consciousnesses in one

5762
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:00,560
have multiple consciousnesses in one
 

5763
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,350
have multiple consciousnesses in one
brain

5764
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
brain
 

5765
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,030
brain
yeah and maybe there's some way to make

5766
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,040
yeah and maybe there's some way to make
 

5767
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,510
yeah and maybe there's some way to make
it faster so that the

5768
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
it faster so that the
 

5769
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,830
it faster so that the
you know the the area the computation

5770
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
you know the the area the computation
 

5771
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,229
you know the the area the computation
could

5772
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:10,239

 

5773
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,270

could still have a unified feel to it

5774
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,280
could still have a unified feel to it
 

5775
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,590
could still have a unified feel to it
but while still having way more ability

5776
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:15,600
but while still having way more ability
 

5777
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,430
but while still having way more ability
to do parallel stuff at the same time

5778
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440
to do parallel stuff at the same time
 

5779
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,270
to do parallel stuff at the same time
could definitely be improved it could be

5780
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,280
could definitely be improved it could be
 

5781
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,470
could definitely be improved it could be
improved okay

5782
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
improved okay
 

5783
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,790
improved okay
well it's it's pretty good right now

5784
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
well it's it's pretty good right now
 

5785
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,229
well it's it's pretty good right now
actually people don't give it enough

5786
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:24,239
actually people don't give it enough
 

5787
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,709
actually people don't give it enough
credit the thing is pretty nice the

5788
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
credit the thing is pretty nice the
 

5789
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,870
credit the thing is pretty nice the
the you know the the fact that the right

5790
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
the you know the the fact that the right
 

5791
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,790
the you know the the fact that the right
ends seem to be

5792
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
ends seem to be
 

5793
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,470
ends seem to be
on give a nice like spark

5794
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
on give a nice like spark
 

5795
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,830
on give a nice like spark
of uh beauty to the whole experience

5796
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:37,840
of uh beauty to the whole experience
 

5797
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,110
of uh beauty to the whole experience
i don't know i don't know if it can be

5798
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
i don't know i don't know if it can be
 

5799
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,110
i don't know i don't know if it can be
improved easily it could be more

5800
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
improved easily it could be more
 

5801
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,390
improved easily it could be more
beautiful

5802
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
beautiful
 

5803
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,030
beautiful
i don't know how yeah what do you mean

5804
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,040
i don't know how yeah what do you mean
 

5805
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,149
i don't know how yeah what do you mean
what do you mean how

5806
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
what do you mean how
 

5807
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,470
what do you mean how
all the ways you can't imagine no but

5808
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480
all the ways you can't imagine no but
 

5809
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,430
all the ways you can't imagine no but
that's the whole point

5810
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,440
that's the whole point
 

5811
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,270
that's the whole point
i wouldn't be able to i'm at the fact

5812
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,280
i wouldn't be able to i'm at the fact
 

5813
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,709
i wouldn't be able to i'm at the fact
that i can imagine ways in

5814
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:52,719
that i can imagine ways in
 

5815
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,430
that i can imagine ways in
in in which it could be more beautiful

5816
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:55,440
in in which it could be more beautiful
 

5817
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:55,750
in in which it could be more beautiful
means

5818
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
means
 

5819
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,149
means
so do you know you know ian banks his

5820
01:33:58,149 --> 01:33:58,159
so do you know you know ian banks his
 

5821
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,270
so do you know you know ian banks his
stories

5822
01:33:59,270 --> 01:33:59,280
stories
 

5823
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,030
stories
so the the super smart ais there

5824
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
so the the super smart ais there
 

5825
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,709
so the the super smart ais there
live mostly live in the world of what

5826
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
live mostly live in the world of what
 

5827
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,350
live mostly live in the world of what
they call infinite fun

5828
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,360
they call infinite fun
 

5829
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,709
they call infinite fun
because they can create arbitrary

5830
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:10,719
because they can create arbitrary
 

5831
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,590
because they can create arbitrary
worlds so they interact and you know the

5832
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
worlds so they interact and you know the
 

5833
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,430
worlds so they interact and you know the
story has it they interact in the normal

5834
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
story has it they interact in the normal
 

5835
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,709
story has it they interact in the normal
world and they're very smart and they

5836
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
world and they're very smart and they
 

5837
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,470
world and they're very smart and they
can do all kinds of stuff

5838
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:18,480
can do all kinds of stuff
 

5839
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,310
can do all kinds of stuff
and you know a given mind can you know

5840
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,320
and you know a given mind can you know
 

5841
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,669
and you know a given mind can you know
talk to a million humans at the same

5842
01:34:21,669 --> 01:34:21,679
talk to a million humans at the same
 

5843
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,830
talk to a million humans at the same
time because we're very slow and

5844
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:23,840
time because we're very slow and
 

5845
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,510
time because we're very slow and
for reasons you know artificial the

5846
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
for reasons you know artificial the
 

5847
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,430
for reasons you know artificial the
story they're interested in people and

5848
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:27,440
story they're interested in people and
 

5849
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,709
story they're interested in people and
doing stuff but

5850
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
doing stuff but
 

5851
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,669
doing stuff but
they mostly live in this this other land

5852
01:34:31,669 --> 01:34:31,679
they mostly live in this this other land
 

5853
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:32,950
they mostly live in this this other land
of thinking

5854
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
of thinking
 

5855
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,910
of thinking
my inclination is to think that the

5856
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
my inclination is to think that the
 

5857
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,910
my inclination is to think that the
ability to create infinite fun will

5858
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:37,920
ability to create infinite fun will
 

5859
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,950
ability to create infinite fun will
um will not be so fun

5860
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
um will not be so fun
 

5861
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,350
um will not be so fun
that's sad there are so many things to

5862
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,360
that's sad there are so many things to
 

5863
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,070
that's sad there are so many things to
do imagine be able to make a star

5864
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080
do imagine be able to make a star
 

5865
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,629
do imagine be able to make a star
move planets around yeah yeah but

5866
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:48,639
move planets around yeah yeah but
 

5867
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:50,550
move planets around yeah yeah but
because we can imagine that as wildlife

5868
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:50,560
because we can imagine that as wildlife
 

5869
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,189
because we can imagine that as wildlife
is fun

5870
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
is fun
 

5871
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,109
is fun
if we can if we actually were able to do

5872
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:53,119
if we can if we actually were able to do
 

5873
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,950
if we can if we actually were able to do
it it'd be a slippery slope

5874
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:54,960
it it'd be a slippery slope
 

5875
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,629
it it'd be a slippery slope
where fun wouldn't even have a meaning

5876
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
where fun wouldn't even have a meaning
 

5877
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,950
where fun wouldn't even have a meaning
because we just consistently

5878
01:34:58,950 --> 01:34:58,960
because we just consistently
 

5879
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,910
because we just consistently
desensitize ourselves by the infinite

5880
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
desensitize ourselves by the infinite
 

5881
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,910
desensitize ourselves by the infinite
amounts of fun we're having

5882
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
amounts of fun we're having
 

5883
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,149
amounts of fun we're having
and the sadness uh the the dark stuff is

5884
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:06,159
and the sadness uh the the dark stuff is
 

5885
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,350
and the sadness uh the the dark stuff is
what makes it fun

5886
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
what makes it fun
 

5887
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,310
what makes it fun
i think i mean that could be the russian

5888
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,320
i think i mean that could be the russian
 

5889
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,109
i think i mean that could be the russian
it could be the

5890
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:11,119
it could be the
 

5891
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,550
it could be the
could be the fun makes it fun and the

5892
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:12,560
could be the fun makes it fun and the
 

5893
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,470
could be the fun makes it fun and the
sadnesses makes it bittersweet

5894
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480

 

5895
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,629

yeah that's true fun could be uh the

5896
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
yeah that's true fun could be uh the
 

5897
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,310
yeah that's true fun could be uh the
thing that makes it fun

5898
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:20,320
thing that makes it fun
 

5899
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,470
thing that makes it fun
so what do you think about the expansion

5900
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,480
so what do you think about the expansion
 

5901
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,229
so what do you think about the expansion
not through the biology side but through

5902
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:24,239
not through the biology side but through
 

5903
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:27,189
not through the biology side but through
the bci the brain computer interfaces

5904
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:27,199
the bci the brain computer interfaces
 

5905
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,870
the bci the brain computer interfaces
yeah you got a chance to check out the

5906
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:28,880
yeah you got a chance to check out the
 

5907
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,430
yeah you got a chance to check out the
neural link stuff it's super interesting

5908
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
neural link stuff it's super interesting
 

5909
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:35,030
neural link stuff it's super interesting
like like humans like like our thoughts

5910
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
like like humans like like our thoughts
 

5911
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,430
like like humans like like our thoughts
to manifest as action

5912
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:37,440
to manifest as action
 

5913
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,430
to manifest as action
you know like like as a kid you know

5914
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
you know like like as a kid you know
 

5915
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,590
you know like like as a kid you know
like shooting a rifle was super fun

5916
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:41,600
like shooting a rifle was super fun
 

5917
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,229
like shooting a rifle was super fun
driving a mini bike doing things and

5918
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
driving a mini bike doing things and
 

5919
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,990
driving a mini bike doing things and
then computer games i think

5920
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
then computer games i think
 

5921
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,990
then computer games i think
for a lot of kids became the thing where

5922
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
for a lot of kids became the thing where
 

5923
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,149
for a lot of kids became the thing where
they you know they can do what they want

5924
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
they you know they can do what they want
 

5925
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:50,950
they you know they can do what they want
they can fly a

5926
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:50,960
they can fly a
 

5927
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,709
they can fly a
plane they can do this they can do this

5928
01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:52,719
plane they can do this they can do this
 

5929
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,229
plane they can do this they can do this
right but you have to

5930
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
right but you have to
 

5931
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,990
right but you have to
have this physical interaction now

5932
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,000
have this physical interaction now
 

5933
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,510
have this physical interaction now
imagine

5934
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:57,520
imagine
 

5935
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,149
imagine
you know you could just imagine stuff

5936
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
you know you could just imagine stuff
 

5937
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,149
you know you could just imagine stuff
and it happens

5938
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
and it happens
 

5939
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:05,350
and it happens
right like really richly

5940
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360
right like really richly
 

5941
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,189
right like really richly
and interestingly like we kind of do

5942
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
and interestingly like we kind of do
 

5943
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,470
and interestingly like we kind of do
that when we dream like dream

5944
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,480
that when we dream like dream
 

5945
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,629
that when we dream like dream
dreams are funny because like if you

5946
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:10,639
dreams are funny because like if you
 

5947
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,790
dreams are funny because like if you
have some control or awareness in your

5948
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:12,800
have some control or awareness in your
 

5949
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,229
have some control or awareness in your
dreams

5950
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
dreams
 

5951
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,030
dreams
like it's very realistic looking or not

5952
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,040
like it's very realistic looking or not
 

5953
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,750
like it's very realistic looking or not
realistic

5954
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:17,760
realistic
 

5955
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,990
realistic
it depends on the dream but you can also

5956
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,000
it depends on the dream but you can also
 

5957
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,310
it depends on the dream but you can also
manipulate that

5958
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
manipulate that
 

5959
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,470
manipulate that
and you know what what's possible there

5960
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
and you know what what's possible there
 

5961
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,590
and you know what what's possible there
is is

5962
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:25,600
is is
 

5963
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,950
is is
is odd and the fact that nobody

5964
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
is odd and the fact that nobody
 

5965
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,030
is odd and the fact that nobody
understands it's hilarious but

5966
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
understands it's hilarious but
 

5967
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,750
understands it's hilarious but
um do you think it's possible to expand

5968
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
um do you think it's possible to expand
 

5969
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,910
um do you think it's possible to expand
that capability through computing

5970
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:33,920
that capability through computing
 

5971
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,950
that capability through computing
sure is there some interesting so from a

5972
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:36,960
sure is there some interesting so from a
 

5973
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,390
sure is there some interesting so from a
hardware designer perspective

5974
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
hardware designer perspective
 

5975
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,390
hardware designer perspective
is there do you think you'll present

5976
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
is there do you think you'll present
 

5977
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,990
is there do you think you'll present
totally new challenges and the kind of

5978
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
totally new challenges and the kind of
 

5979
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,629
totally new challenges and the kind of
hardware that

5980
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
hardware that
 

5981
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,870
hardware that
required that like so this hardware

5982
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:44,880
required that like so this hardware
 

5983
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:45,750
required that like so this hardware
isn't

5984
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:45,760
isn't
 

5985
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,310
isn't
standalone computing well this just

5986
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
standalone computing well this just
 

5987
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,430
standalone computing well this just
knows

5988
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
knows
 

5989
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,590
knows
today computer games are rendered by

5990
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
today computer games are rendered by
 

5991
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,709
today computer games are rendered by
gpus

5992
01:36:52,709 --> 01:36:52,719
gpus
 

5993
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,189
gpus
right right so but you've seen the gans

5994
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:55,199
right right so but you've seen the gans
 

5995
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:55,910
right right so but you've seen the gans
stuff

5996
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:55,920
stuff
 

5997
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,189
stuff
yep right where trained neural networks

5998
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199
yep right where trained neural networks
 

5999
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,350
yep right where trained neural networks
render realistic images but there's no

6000
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
render realistic images but there's no
 

6001
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,590
render realistic images but there's no
pixels no triangles no shaders

6002
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
pixels no triangles no shaders
 

6003
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,070
pixels no triangles no shaders
no light maps no nothing so the future

6004
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:06,080
no light maps no nothing so the future
 

6005
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:06,709
no light maps no nothing so the future
of

6006
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
of
 

6007
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,830
of
graphics is probably ai right yes

6008
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:09,840
graphics is probably ai right yes
 

6009
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,470
graphics is probably ai right yes
now that ai is heavily trained by lots

6010
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
now that ai is heavily trained by lots
 

6011
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,030
now that ai is heavily trained by lots
of real

6012
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,040
of real
 

6013
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,310
of real
data right so if you have an interface

6014
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
data right so if you have an interface
 

6015
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,189
data right so if you have an interface
with a

6016
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:17,199
with a
 

6017
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,229
with a
aai renderer right

6018
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:20,239
aai renderer right
 

6019
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:23,270
aai renderer right
so if you say render a cat it won't say

6020
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,280
so if you say render a cat it won't say
 

6021
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,950
so if you say render a cat it won't say
well how tall is the cat and how big it

6022
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:24,960
well how tall is the cat and how big it
 

6023
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,229
well how tall is the cat and how big it
you know it'll render a cat and you

6024
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:26,239
you know it'll render a cat and you
 

6025
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:27,590
you know it'll render a cat and you
might say well a little bigger a little

6026
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:27,600
might say well a little bigger a little
 

6027
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,109
might say well a little bigger a little
smaller you know

6028
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:29,119
smaller you know
 

6029
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,189
smaller you know
make it a tabby shorter hair you know

6030
01:37:31,189 --> 01:37:31,199
make it a tabby shorter hair you know
 

6031
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:32,790
make it a tabby shorter hair you know
like you could tweak it

6032
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
like you could tweak it
 

6033
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,550
like you could tweak it
like the the amount of data you'll have

6034
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
like the the amount of data you'll have
 

6035
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,910
like the the amount of data you'll have
to

6036
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
to
 

6037
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,270
to
send to interact with a very powerful ai

6038
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:39,280
send to interact with a very powerful ai
 

6039
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:39,990
send to interact with a very powerful ai
renderer

6040
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:40,000
renderer
 

6041
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,270
renderer
could be low but the question is for

6042
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,280
could be low but the question is for
 

6043
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,709
could be low but the question is for
brain computer interfaces

6044
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
brain computer interfaces
 

6045
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:47,669
brain computer interfaces
would need to render not onto a screen

6046
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
would need to render not onto a screen
 

6047
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:47,990
would need to render not onto a screen
but

6048
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,000
but
 

6049
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,109
but
render onto the brain and

6050
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
render onto the brain and
 

6051
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,470
render onto the brain and
like directly so that there's a

6052
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
like directly so that there's a
 

6053
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,830
like directly so that there's a
bandwidth you could do it both ways i

6054
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:53,840
bandwidth you could do it both ways i
 

6055
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,830
bandwidth you could do it both ways i
mean our eyes are really good sensors

6056
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:55,840
mean our eyes are really good sensors
 

6057
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,950
mean our eyes are really good sensors
it could render onto a screen and

6058
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:58,960
it could render onto a screen and
 

6059
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,550
it could render onto a screen and
we could feel like we're participating

6060
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
we could feel like we're participating
 

6061
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,070
we could feel like we're participating
in it you know they're gonna

6062
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
in it you know they're gonna
 

6063
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,510
in it you know they're gonna
they're gonna have you know like the

6064
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:03,520
they're gonna have you know like the
 

6065
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,350
they're gonna have you know like the
oculus kind of stuff it's gonna be so

6066
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,360
oculus kind of stuff it's gonna be so
 

6067
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,030
oculus kind of stuff it's gonna be so
good when a projection to your eyes you

6068
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
good when a projection to your eyes you
 

6069
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,870
good when a projection to your eyes you
think it's real

6070
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:08,880
think it's real
 

6071
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,790
think it's real
you know they're slowly solving those

6072
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:10,800
you know they're slowly solving those
 

6073
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,390
you know they're slowly solving those
problems

6074
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
problems
 

6075
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,990
problems
and i suspect when the renderer

6076
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
and i suspect when the renderer
 

6077
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,990
and i suspect when the renderer
of that information into your head is

6078
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
of that information into your head is
 

6079
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,390
of that information into your head is
also ai mediated

6080
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,400
also ai mediated
 

6081
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,149
also ai mediated
you know they'll be able to give you the

6082
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:22,159
you know they'll be able to give you the
 

6083
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,550
you know they'll be able to give you the
cues that you know you really want for

6084
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:24,560
cues that you know you really want for
 

6085
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,750
cues that you know you really want for
depth and all kinds of stuff like your

6086
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:27,760
depth and all kinds of stuff like your
 

6087
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,590
depth and all kinds of stuff like your
your brain is probably faking your your

6088
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,600
your brain is probably faking your your
 

6089
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:29,990
your brain is probably faking your your
visual

6090
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
visual
 

6091
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,149
visual
field right like your eyes are twitching

6092
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
field right like your eyes are twitching
 

6093
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,669
field right like your eyes are twitching
around but you don't notice that

6094
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
around but you don't notice that
 

6095
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,350
around but you don't notice that
occasionally they blank you don't notice

6096
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:35,360
occasionally they blank you don't notice
 

6097
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,350
occasionally they blank you don't notice
that you know there's all kinds of

6098
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,360
that you know there's all kinds of
 

6099
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,950
that you know there's all kinds of
things like you think you see over here

6100
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
things like you think you see over here
 

6101
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,870
things like you think you see over here
but you don't really see there yeah it's

6102
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
but you don't really see there yeah it's
 

6103
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,070
but you don't really see there yeah it's
all fabricated

6104
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,080
all fabricated
 

6105
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,310
all fabricated
yeah so yeah peripheral vision is

6106
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
yeah so yeah peripheral vision is
 

6107
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,430
yeah so yeah peripheral vision is
fascinating

6108
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:45,440
fascinating
 

6109
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,990
fascinating
so if you have an ai renderer that's

6110
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,000
so if you have an ai renderer that's
 

6111
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,510
so if you have an ai renderer that's
trained to understand

6112
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:49,520
trained to understand
 

6113
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,950
trained to understand
exactly how you see and the kind of

6114
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:52,960
exactly how you see and the kind of
 

6115
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,870
exactly how you see and the kind of
things that enhance the realism of the

6116
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
things that enhance the realism of the
 

6117
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,990
things that enhance the realism of the
experience

6118
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:56,000
experience
 

6119
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,950
experience
it could be super real actually

6120
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960

 

6121
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,430

so i don't know what the limits that are

6122
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:03,440
so i don't know what the limits that are
 

6123
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,070
so i don't know what the limits that are
but

6124
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
but
 

6125
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,310
but
obviously if if we have a brain

6126
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
obviously if if we have a brain
 

6127
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,149
obviously if if we have a brain
interface that goes in

6128
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
interface that goes in
 

6129
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,550
interface that goes in
inside your you know visual cortex in a

6130
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:10,560
inside your you know visual cortex in a
 

6131
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,990
inside your you know visual cortex in a
better way than your eyes do

6132
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
better way than your eyes do
 

6133
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,270
better way than your eyes do
which is possible it's a lot neurons

6134
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
which is possible it's a lot neurons
 

6135
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,550
which is possible it's a lot neurons
yeah um maybe that will be even

6136
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:18,560
yeah um maybe that will be even
 

6137
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,030
yeah um maybe that will be even
cooler well the really cool thing is it

6138
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:21,040
cooler well the really cool thing is it
 

6139
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,990
cooler well the really cool thing is it
has to do with the

6140
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,000
has to do with the
 

6141
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,510
has to do with the
the infinite fun that you're referring

6142
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:23,520
the infinite fun that you're referring
 

6143
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,990
the infinite fun that you're referring
to which is our brains seem to be very

6144
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,000
to which is our brains seem to be very
 

6145
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,149
to which is our brains seem to be very
limited and like you said computational

6146
01:39:28,149 --> 01:39:28,159
limited and like you said computational
 

6147
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:29,830
limited and like you said computational
so very plastic

6148
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
so very plastic
 

6149
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,910
so very plastic
very plastic yeah yeah so it's a it's a

6150
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
very plastic yeah yeah so it's a it's a
 

6151
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,229
very plastic yeah yeah so it's a it's a
com interesting combination

6152
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:34,239
com interesting combination
 

6153
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,790
com interesting combination
now the the interesting open question is

6154
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:36,800
now the the interesting open question is
 

6155
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,109
now the the interesting open question is
the limits of that neuroplasticity like

6156
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
the limits of that neuroplasticity like
 

6157
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:42,149
the limits of that neuroplasticity like
how how flexible is that thing

6158
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
how how flexible is that thing
 

6159
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,590
how how flexible is that thing
because we don't we haven't really

6160
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,600
because we don't we haven't really
 

6161
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,149
because we don't we haven't really
tested it we know about that experiments

6162
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,159
tested it we know about that experiments
 

6163
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,669
tested it we know about that experiments
where they they put like a pressure pad

6164
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
where they they put like a pressure pad
 

6165
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:48,950
where they they put like a pressure pad
on somebody's head

6166
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:48,960
on somebody's head
 

6167
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,350
on somebody's head
and had a visual transducer pressurize

6168
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
and had a visual transducer pressurize
 

6169
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,350
and had a visual transducer pressurize
it and somebody slowly learned to see

6170
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:53,360
it and somebody slowly learned to see
 

6171
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,310
it and somebody slowly learned to see
yep that's like it's especially at a

6172
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:56,320
yep that's like it's especially at a
 

6173
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:56,950
yep that's like it's especially at a
young age

6174
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:56,960
young age
 

6175
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,510
young age
if you throw a lot at it like what what

6176
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
if you throw a lot at it like what what
 

6177
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,990
if you throw a lot at it like what what
can it uh

6178
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
can it uh
 

6179
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,790
can it uh
uh can it completely so can you like

6180
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,800
uh can it completely so can you like
 

6181
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,470
uh can it completely so can you like
arbitrarily expand it with computing

6182
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
arbitrarily expand it with computing
 

6183
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,510
arbitrarily expand it with computing
power so

6184
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
power so
 

6185
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,189
power so
connected to the internet directly

6186
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,199
connected to the internet directly
 

6187
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:11,830
connected to the internet directly
somehow yeah the answer's probably yes

6188
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:11,840
somehow yeah the answer's probably yes
 

6189
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,750
somehow yeah the answer's probably yes
so the problem with biology and ethics

6190
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:13,760
so the problem with biology and ethics
 

6191
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,430
so the problem with biology and ethics
is like there's a mess there

6192
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:15,440
is like there's a mess there
 

6193
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,350
is like there's a mess there
like us humans are perhaps unwilling to

6194
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:19,360
like us humans are perhaps unwilling to
 

6195
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,790
like us humans are perhaps unwilling to
take

6196
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:20,800
take
 

6197
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,070
take
risks in uh into directions that are

6198
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
risks in uh into directions that are
 

6199
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,430
risks in uh into directions that are
full of uncertainty

6200
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:25,440
full of uncertainty
 

6201
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,669
full of uncertainty
so that's like 90 of the population is

6202
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
so that's like 90 of the population is
 

6203
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,590
so that's like 90 of the population is
unwilling to take risks the other 10

6204
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
unwilling to take risks the other 10
 

6205
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,470
unwilling to take risks the other 10
is rushing into the risks unaided by any

6206
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:32,480
is rushing into the risks unaided by any
 

6207
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,070
is rushing into the risks unaided by any
infrastructure whatsoever

6208
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
infrastructure whatsoever
 

6209
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,709
infrastructure whatsoever
and you know and that that's where all

6210
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
and you know and that that's where all
 

6211
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:37,109
and you know and that that's where all
the fun

6212
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:37,119
the fun
 

6213
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:39,189
the fun
happens in you know society there's been

6214
01:40:39,189 --> 01:40:39,199
happens in you know society there's been
 

6215
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,550
happens in you know society there's been
huge transformations

6216
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,560
huge transformations
 

6217
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,149
huge transformations
yeah in the last you know a couple

6218
01:40:42,149 --> 01:40:42,159
yeah in the last you know a couple
 

6219
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:43,750
yeah in the last you know a couple
thousand years yeah

6220
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:43,760
thousand years yeah
 

6221
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,430
thousand years yeah
it's funny i mean i got a chance to

6222
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
it's funny i mean i got a chance to
 

6223
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,109
it's funny i mean i got a chance to
interact with uh uh

6224
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:47,119
interact with uh uh
 

6225
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:48,709
interact with uh uh
this is matthew johnson from johns

6226
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:48,719
this is matthew johnson from johns

hopkins he's doing this large-scale

6228
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:50,480
hopkins he's doing this large-scale
 

6229
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,470
hopkins he's doing this large-scale
study of psychedelics

6230
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
study of psychedelics
 

6231
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,149
study of psychedelics
it's it's becoming more and more i've

6232
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
it's it's becoming more and more i've
 

6233
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:55,270
it's it's becoming more and more i've
gotten a chance to interact with that

6234
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
gotten a chance to interact with that
 

6235
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,709
gotten a chance to interact with that
community of scientists working on

6236
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:56,719
community of scientists working on
 

6237
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:57,669
community of scientists working on
psychedelics

6238
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
psychedelics
 

6239
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,669
psychedelics
but because of that that opened the door

6240
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
but because of that that opened the door
 

6241
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,950
but because of that that opened the door
to me to

6242
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
to me to
 

6243
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,709
to me to
all these uh what are they called

6244
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:02,719
all these uh what are they called
 

6245
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:03,990
all these uh what are they called
psychonauts the

6246
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,000
psychonauts the
 

6247
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,990
psychonauts the
people who like you said the ten percent

6248
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:06,000
people who like you said the ten percent

i don't care i don't know if there's a
 

6253
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,470
i don't care i don't know if there's a
science behind this i'm taking the

6254
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:10,480
science behind this i'm taking the
 

6255
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,109
science behind this i'm taking the
spaceship

6256
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
spaceship
 

6257
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,669
spaceship
to if i'm being the first on mars i'll

6258
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:13,679
to if i'm being the first on mars i'll
 

6259
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:14,709
to if i'm being the first on mars i'll
be uh

6260
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:14,719
be uh
 

6261
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,310
be uh
the you know you know psychedelic's

6262
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:16,320
the you know you know psychedelic's
 

6263
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,390
the you know you know psychedelic's
interesting in the sense that

6264
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
interesting in the sense that
 

6265
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,270
interesting in the sense that
in another dimension uh like you said

6266
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
in another dimension uh like you said
 

6267
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,590
in another dimension uh like you said
it's a way to explore the

6268
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:23,600
it's a way to explore the
 

6269
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,149
it's a way to explore the
with the limits of the human mind like

6270
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
with the limits of the human mind like
 

6271
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,070
with the limits of the human mind like
what is this thing capable of doing

6272
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:28,080
what is this thing capable of doing
 

6273
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,470
what is this thing capable of doing
because you kind of like when you dream

6274
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:30,480
because you kind of like when you dream
 

6275
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,149
because you kind of like when you dream
you detach it i don't know exactly in

6276
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
you detach it i don't know exactly in
 

6277
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,669
you detach it i don't know exactly in
your science of it but

6278
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:33,679
your science of it but
 

6279
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,109
your science of it but
you detach your like reality

6280
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:37,119
you detach your like reality
 

6281
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:39,750
you detach your like reality
from what your mind the images your mind

6282
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:39,760
from what your mind the images your mind
 

6283
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,430
from what your mind the images your mind
is able to conjure up and your mind goes

6284
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
is able to conjure up and your mind goes
 

6285
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,950
is able to conjure up and your mind goes
into weird places

6286
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:42,960
into weird places
 

6287
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,629
into weird places
and like entities appear freudian type

6288
01:41:46,629 --> 01:41:46,639
and like entities appear freudian type
 

6289
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:47,750
and like entities appear freudian type
of

6290
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:47,760
of
 

6291
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,510
of
like trauma is probably connected in

6292
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:49,520
like trauma is probably connected in
 

6293
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,109
like trauma is probably connected in
there somehow but you start to have like

6294
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
there somehow but you start to have like
 

6295
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:51,990
there somehow but you start to have like
these

6296
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
these
 

6297
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,470
these
weird vivid worlds that like so do you

6298
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
weird vivid worlds that like so do you
 

6299
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,229
weird vivid worlds that like so do you
actively dream

6300
01:41:56,229 --> 01:41:56,239

and and i got somewhat good at it like
 

6357
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,990
and and i got somewhat good at it like
but my mostly when i'm thinking about

6358
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,000
but my mostly when i'm thinking about
 

6359
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,350
but my mostly when i'm thinking about
things or working on problems

6360
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360
things or working on problems
 

6361

6363
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,669
i i i prep myself before i go to sleep
it's like

6364
01:43:09,669 --> 01:43:09,679
it's like
 

6365
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:13,109
it's like
i i pull into my mind all the things i

6366
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:13,119
i i pull into my mind all the things i

want to work on or think about
 

6369
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:19,030
want to work on or think about
and then that let's say greatly improves

6370
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:19,040
and then that let's say greatly improves
 

6371
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,229
and then that let's say greatly improves
the chances that i'll

6372
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:20,239
the chances that i'll
 

6373
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:23,270
the chances that i'll
i'll work on that while i'm sleeping

6374
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
i'll work on that while i'm sleeping

i'll work on that while i'm sleeping
and then and then i also

6460
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:55,040
the best ideas hit them
 

6461
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,790
the best ideas hit them
if you talk about like newton apple

6462
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
if you talk about like newton apple
 

6463
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,470
if you talk about like newton apple

no i i found that a long time ago i'm i
process things somewhat slowly

6468
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:03,119
process things somewhat slowly
 

6469
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,109
process things somewhat slowly
so like in college i had friends that

6470
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:05,119
so like in college i had friends that
 

6471
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:06,550
so like in college i had friends that
could study at the last minute get an a

6472
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:06,560
could study at the last minute get an a
 

6473
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,430
could study at the last minute get an a
next day

6474
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
next day
 

6475
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,750
next day
i can't do that at all so i always front

6476
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:09,760
i can't do that at all so i always front
 

6477
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,870
i can't do that at all so i always front

loaded all the work
 

6479
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,750
loaded all the work
like i do all the problems early you

6480
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:13,760
like i do all the problems early you
 

6481
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:14,070
like i do all the problems early you
know

6482
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:14,080
know
 

6483
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,830
know
for finals like the last three days i

6484
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
for finals like the last three days i
 

6485
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,590
for finals like the last three days i
wouldn't look at a book

6486
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:17,600
wouldn't look at a book
 

6487
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,590
wouldn't look at a book
because i want you know because like a

6488
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:19,600
because i want you know because like a
 

6489
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,950
because i want you know because like a
new fact the day before

6490
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:20,960
new fact the day before
 

6491
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,870
new fact the day before
finals may screw up my understanding of

6492
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:22,880
finals may screw up my understanding of
 

6493
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,629
finals may screw up my understanding of
what i thought i knew so my

6494
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:24,639
what i thought i knew so my
 

6495
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,750
what i thought i knew so my
my goal was to always get it in and and

6496
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:27,760
my goal was to always get it in and and
 

6497
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,750
my goal was to always get it in and and
give it time to soak

6498
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:29,760
give it time to soak
 

6499
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,390
give it time to soak
and i used to you know i remember we

6500
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,400
and i used to you know i remember we
 

6501
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,070
and i used to you know i remember we
were doing like 3d calculus i would have

6502
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,080
were doing like 3d calculus i would have
 

6503
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,310
were doing like 3d calculus i would have
these amazing dreams of 3d surfaces with

6504
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
these amazing dreams of 3d surfaces with
 

6505
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,109
these amazing dreams of 3d surfaces with
normal

6506
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:37,119
normal
 

6507
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,550
normal
you know calculating the gradient and

6508
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:38,560
you know calculating the gradient and
 

6509
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,470
you know calculating the gradient and
this is like all come up so

6510
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
this is like all come up so
 

6511
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,149
this is like all come up so
it was really fun like very visual and

6512
01:45:44,149 --> 01:45:44,159
it was really fun like very visual and
 

6513
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:44,709
it was really fun like very visual and
uh

6514
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:44,719
uh
 

6515
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,709
uh
and if i got cycles of that that was

6516
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:46,719
and if i got cycles of that that was
 

6517
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:47,750
and if i got cycles of that that was
useful

6518
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
useful
 

6519
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,990
useful
um and the other is don't over filter

6520
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
um and the other is don't over filter
 

6521
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:50,870
um and the other is don't over filter
your ideas

6522
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
your ideas
 

6523
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,750
your ideas
like i like that process of

6524
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:53,760
like i like that process of
 

6525
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,270
like i like that process of
brainstorming where lots of ideas can

6526
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:55,280
brainstorming where lots of ideas can
 

6527
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,629
brainstorming where lots of ideas can
happen i like people who have lots of

6528
01:45:56,629 --> 01:45:56,639
happen i like people who have lots of
 

6529
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:57,189
happen i like people who have lots of
ideas

6530
01:45:57,189 --> 01:45:57,199
ideas
 

6531
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:58,870
ideas
and things but that's what's up then

6532
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
and things but that's what's up then
 

6533
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,470
and things but that's what's up then
there's a yeah let them sit and let it

6534
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:00,480
there's a yeah let them sit and let it
 

6535
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,470
there's a yeah let them sit and let it
breathe a little bit

6536
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:02,480
breathe a little bit
 

6537
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,669
breathe a little bit
and then reduce it to practice like at

6538
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:05,679
and then reduce it to practice like at
 

6539
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:08,310
and then reduce it to practice like at
some point you really have to

6540
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:08,320
some point you really have to
 

6541
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,870
some point you really have to
does it really work like you know is

6542
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
does it really work like you know is
 

6543
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,950
does it really work like you know is
this real or not

6544
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
this real or not
 

6545
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,870
this real or not
right but you but you have to do both

6546
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:14,880
right but you but you have to do both
 

6547
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,390
right but you but you have to do both
there's creative tension there like how

6548
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,400
there's creative tension there like how
 

6549
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:16,790
there's creative tension there like how
do you

6550
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:16,800
do you
 

6551
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,310
do you
be both open and you know precise

6552
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,320
be both open and you know precise
 

6553
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,030
be both open and you know precise
if you had ideas that you just that sit

6554
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
if you had ideas that you just that sit
 

6555
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,709
if you had ideas that you just that sit
in your mind for like years

6556
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
in your mind for like years
 

6557
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,030
in your mind for like years
before the sure it's an interesting uh

6558
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
before the sure it's an interesting uh
 

6559
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,149
before the sure it's an interesting uh
way to is generate ideas and just let

6560
01:46:32,149 --> 01:46:32,159
way to is generate ideas and just let
 

6561
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,030
way to is generate ideas and just let
them sit

6562
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,040
them sit
 

6563
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,310
them sit
let them sit there for a while

6564
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:36,320
let them sit there for a while
 

6565
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,390
let them sit there for a while
i think i have a few of those ideas you

6566
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:38,400
i think i have a few of those ideas you
 

6567
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,990
i think i have a few of those ideas you
know that was so funny

6568
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
know that was so funny
 

6569
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,350
know that was so funny
yeah i think that's you know creativity

6570
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:43,360
yeah i think that's you know creativity
 

6571
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,229

uh this one or something for the slow
 

6573
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:47,189
uh this one or something for the slow
thinkers in the

6574
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:47,199
thinkers in the
 

6575
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:50,390
thinkers in the
in the room i suppose as i some people

6576
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:50,400
in the room i suppose as i some people
 

6577

people think
 

6585
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,350
people think
you know how fast or slow they are how

6586
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,360
you know how fast or slow they are how
 

6587
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,510
you know how fast or slow they are how
well they remember don't

6588
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:01,520
well they remember don't
 

6589

well they remember don't
like you know i'm not super good at

6590
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:03,040
like you know i'm not super good at
 

6591
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,030
like you know i'm not super good at
remembering facts but processes and

6592
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
remembering facts but processes and
 

6593
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,310
remembering facts but processes and
methods

6594
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:06,320
methods
 

6595
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,669
methods
like in our engineering i went to penn

6596
01:47:07,669 --> 01:47:07,679
like in our engineering i went to penn
 

6597
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,149
like in our engineering i went to penn
state and almost all our engineering

6598
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
state and almost all our engineering
 

6599
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,470
state and almost all our engineering
tests were open book i could remember

6600
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
tests were open book i could remember
 

6601
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,550
tests were open book i could remember
the page and not the formula

6602
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:14,560
the page and not the formula
 

6603
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,070
the page and not the formula
but as soon as i saw the formula i could

6604
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:16,080
but as soon as i saw the formula i could
 

6605
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,830
but as soon as i saw the formula i could
remember the whole method if i

6606
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:17,840
remember the whole method if i
 

6607
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,790
remember the whole method if i
if i'd learned it yeah you know so it's

6608
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:20,800
if i'd learned it yeah you know so it's
 

6609
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,310
if i'd learned it yeah you know so it's
just a funny

6610
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,320
just a funny
 

6611

swatched friends like flipping through
 

6615
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:27,350
swatched friends like flipping through
the book trying to find the formula

6616
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:27,360
the book trying to find the formula
 

6617
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,109
the book trying to find the formula
even knowing that they'd done just as

6618
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119

01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,030
even knowing that they'd done just as
much work and i would just open the book

6620
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
much work and i would just open the book
 

6621
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,950
much work and i would just open the book
i was on page 27

6622
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:32,960
i was on page 27
 

6623
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,830
i was on page 27
about half i could see the whole thing

6624
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:34,840
about half i could see the whole thing
 

6625
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,990
about half i could see the whole thing
visually

6626
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:36,000
visually
 

6627
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,149
visually
yeah and you know and you have to learn

6628
01:47:38,149 --> 01:47:38,159
yeah and you know and you have to learn
 

6629
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:39,510
yeah and you know and you have to learn
that about yourself and figure out what

6630
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:39,520
that about yourself and figure out what
 

6631
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,229
that about yourself and figure out what
to do with the

6632
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:40,239
to do with the
 

6633
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,310
to do with the
function optimally i had a friend who he

6634
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:42,320
function optimally i had a friend who he
 

6635
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,750
function optimally i had a friend who he
was always concerned he didn't know how

6636
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:43,760
was always concerned he didn't know how
 

6637
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,510
was always concerned he didn't know how
he came up with ideas

6638
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520
he came up with ideas
 

6639
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,109
he came up with ideas
he had lots of ideas but he said they

6640
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:47,119
he had lots of ideas but he said they
 

6641
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:48,950
he had lots of ideas but he said they
just sort of popped up

6642
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:48,960
just sort of popped up
 

6643
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,070
just sort of popped up
like you'd be working on something

6644
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:50,080
like you'd be working on something
 

6645
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,669
like you'd be working on something
having this idea like where does it come

6646
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
having this idea like where does it come
 

6647
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,109
having this idea like where does it come
from

6648
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:53,119
from
 

6649
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:54,790
from
but you can have more awareness of it

6650
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
but you can have more awareness of it
 

6651
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,709
but you can have more awareness of it
like like

6652
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
like like
 

6653
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,870
like like
like like how you how your brain works

6654
01:47:58,870 --> 01:47:58,880
like like how you how your brain works
 

6655
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,390
like like how you how your brain works
is a little murky as you go down

6656
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:00,400
is a little murky as you go down
 

6657
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,830
is a little murky as you go down
from the voice in your head or the

6658
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:01,840
from the voice in your head or the
 

6659
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,669
from the voice in your head or the
obvious visualizations

6660
01:48:03,669 --> 01:48:03,679
obvious visualizations
 

6661
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,189
obvious visualizations
like when you visualize something how

6662
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:05,199
like when you visualize something how
 

6663
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:06,870
like when you visualize something how
does that happen yes

6664
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:06,880
does that happen yes
 

6665
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,390
does that happen yes
you know if i say you know visualize

6666
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,400
you know if i say you know visualize
 

6667
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,149
you know if i say you know visualize
volcano it's easy to do right

6668
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:10,159
volcano it's easy to do right
 

6669
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,350
volcano it's easy to do right
and what does it actually look like when

6670
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:11,360
and what does it actually look like when
 

6671
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,430
and what does it actually look like when
you visualize it i can visualize to the

6672
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
you visualize it i can visualize to the
 

6673
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,390
you visualize it i can visualize to the
point where i don't see

6674
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
point where i don't see
 

6675
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,830
point where i don't see
very much out of my eyes and i see the

6676
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
very much out of my eyes and i see the
 

6677
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,149
very much out of my eyes and i see the
colors of the thing i'm visualizing

6678
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
colors of the thing i'm visualizing
 

6679
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,750
colors of the thing i'm visualizing
yeah but there's like a there's a shape

6680
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:19,760
yeah but there's like a there's a shape
 

6681
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,189
yeah but there's like a there's a shape
there's a texture there's a color but

6682
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
there's a texture there's a color but
 

6683
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,030
there's a texture there's a color but
there's also conceptual visualization

6684
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:23,040
there's also conceptual visualization
 

6685
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,990
there's also conceptual visualization
like

6686
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:24,000
like
 

6687
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,669
like
what are you actually visualizing when

6688
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:25,679
what are you actually visualizing when
 

6689
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:27,430
what are you actually visualizing when
you're visualizing volcano just like

6690
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
you're visualizing volcano just like
 

6691
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,030
you're visualizing volcano just like
with peripheral vision you think you see

6692
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
with peripheral vision you think you see
 

6693
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,390
with peripheral vision you think you see
the whole thing yeah yeah

6694
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:30,400
the whole thing yeah yeah
 

6695
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,990
the whole thing yeah yeah
that's a good way to say it you know you

6696
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:32,000
that's a good way to say it you know you
 

6697
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,510
that's a good way to say it you know you
have this kind of

6698
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:33,520
have this kind of
 

6699
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,109
have this kind of
almost peripheral vision of your

6700
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
almost peripheral vision of your
 

6701
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:38,310
almost peripheral vision of your
visualizations they're like these ghosts

6702
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:38,320
visualizations they're like these ghosts
 

6703
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,070
visualizations they're like these ghosts
but if you know if you if you work on it

6704
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,080
but if you know if you if you work on it
 

6705
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,270
but if you know if you if you work on it
you can get a pretty high level of

6706
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,280
you can get a pretty high level of
 

6707
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,070
you can get a pretty high level of
detail

6708
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
detail
 

6709
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,590
detail
and somehow you can walk along those

6710
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600
and somehow you can walk along those
 

6711
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,350
and somehow you can walk along those
visualizations to come up with an idea

6712
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:45,360
visualizations to come up with an idea
 

6713
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,470
visualizations to come up with an idea
which is uh

6714
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:46,480
which is uh
 

6715
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,629
which is uh
but weird but when you're thinking about

6716
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:48,639
but weird but when you're thinking about
 

6717
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,870
but weird but when you're thinking about
solving problems

6718
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:50,880
solving problems
 

6719
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,709
solving problems
like you're you're putting information

6720
01:48:52,709 --> 01:48:52,719
like you're you're putting information
 

6721
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,709
like you're you're putting information
and you're exercising the stuff you do

6722
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
and you're exercising the stuff you do
 

6723
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:55,590
and you're exercising the stuff you do
know

6724
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:55,600
know
 

6725
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,070
know
you're sort of teasing the area that's

6726
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:58,080
you're sort of teasing the area that's
 

6727
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,550
you're sort of teasing the area that's
you don't understand and don't know

6728
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:00,560
you don't understand and don't know
 

6729
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,470
you don't understand and don't know
but you can almost you know feel

6730
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,480
but you can almost you know feel
 

6731
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,709
but you can almost you know feel
you know that process happening you know

6732
01:49:06,709 --> 01:49:06,719
you know that process happening you know
 

6733
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:07,830
you know that process happening you know
that's that's how i

6734
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:07,840
that's that's how i
 

6735
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,350
that's that's how i
like like like i know sometimes when i'm

6736
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
like like like i know sometimes when i'm
 

6737
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,030
like like like i know sometimes when i'm
working really hard on something like

6738
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,040
working really hard on something like
 

6739
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,790
working really hard on something like
like i get really hot when i'm sleeping

6740
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:14,800
like i get really hot when i'm sleeping
 

6741
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,149
like i get really hot when i'm sleeping
and you know it's like

6742
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:16,159
and you know it's like
 

6743
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:17,910
and you know it's like
we got the blank throw i wake up all the

6744
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:17,920
we got the blank throw i wake up all the
 

6745
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,910
we got the blank throw i wake up all the
blankets are on the floor

6746
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:19,920
blankets are on the floor
 

6747
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,910
blankets are on the floor
and you know every time it's while i

6748
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:21,920
and you know every time it's while i
 

6749
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,709
and you know every time it's while i
wake up and think wow that was great

6750
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:24,719
wake up and think wow that was great
 

6751
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,109
wake up and think wow that was great
you know are you able to uh to reverse

6752
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
you know are you able to uh to reverse
 

6753
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,709
you know are you able to uh to reverse
engineer what the hell happened there

6754
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:28,719
engineer what the hell happened there
 

6755
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,310
engineer what the hell happened there
oh sometimes it's vivid dreams and

6756
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,320
oh sometimes it's vivid dreams and
 

6757
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,390
oh sometimes it's vivid dreams and
sometimes it's this kind of like you say

6758
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,400
sometimes it's this kind of like you say
 

6759
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,229
sometimes it's this kind of like you say
like shadow thinking that you you sort

6760
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
like shadow thinking that you you sort
 

6761
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:35,669
like shadow thinking that you you sort
of have this feeling you're

6762
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:35,679
of have this feeling you're
 

6763
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:37,189
of have this feeling you're
you're going through this stuff but it's

6764
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:37,199
you're going through this stuff but it's
 

6765
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,109
you're going through this stuff but it's
it's not that obvious isn't that so

6766
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
it's not that obvious isn't that so
 

6767
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:40,629
it's not that obvious isn't that so
amazing that the mind just

6768
01:49:40,629 --> 01:49:40,639
amazing that the mind just
 

6769
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,870
amazing that the mind just
does all these little experiments i

6770
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:42,880
does all these little experiments i
 

6771
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,550
does all these little experiments i
never you know i thought i always

6772
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
never you know i thought i always
 

6773
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,109
never you know i thought i always
thought

6774
01:49:45,109 --> 01:49:45,119
thought
 

6775
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,790
thought
it's like a river that you can't you're

6776
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:46,800
it's like a river that you can't you're
 

6777
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,790
it's like a river that you can't you're
just there for the ride but you're right

6778
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:48,800
just there for the ride but you're right
 

6779
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,430
just there for the ride but you're right
if you prep

6780
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
if you prep
 

6781
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,950
if you prep
it no it's all understandable meditation

6782
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:52,960
it no it's all understandable meditation
 

6783
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,669
it no it's all understandable meditation
really helps

6784
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:53,679
really helps
 

6785
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,270
really helps
you you got to start figuring out you

6786
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280
you you got to start figuring out you
 

6787
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,109
you you got to start figuring out you
need to learn language of your own mind

6788
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119

 

6789
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:02,550

and there's multiple levels of it but

6790
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:02,560
and there's multiple levels of it but
 

6791
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,990
and there's multiple levels of it but
the abstractions again right it's

6792
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,000
the abstractions again right it's
 

6793
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,550
the abstractions again right it's
somewhat comprehensible and observable

6794
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
somewhat comprehensible and observable
 

6795
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,750
somewhat comprehensible and observable
and

6796
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:07,760
and
 

6797
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,229
and
feelable or whatever the right word is

6798
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:10,239
feelable or whatever the right word is
 

6799
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:11,830
feelable or whatever the right word is
no it's

6800
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:11,840
no it's
 

6801
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,830
no it's
you know you're not long for the ride

6802
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:13,840
you know you're not long for the ride
 

6803
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,510
you know you're not long for the ride
you are the ride

6804
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,520
you are the ride
 

6805
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,830
you are the ride
i have to ask you hardware engineer

6806
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:17,840
i have to ask you hardware engineer
 

6807
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,229
i have to ask you hardware engineer
working on neural networks now

6808
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
working on neural networks now

01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,830
working on neural networks now
what's consciousness what the hell is

6810
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:21,840
what's consciousness what the hell is
 

6811
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,870
what's consciousness what the hell is
that thing is that is that just some

6812
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:24,880
that thing is that is that just some
 

6813
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,750
that thing is that is that just some
little weird quirk of our particular uh

6814
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:27,760
little weird quirk of our particular uh
 

6815
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,030
little weird quirk of our particular uh
computing device

6816

computing device
 

6817
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,709
computing device
or is it something fundamental that we

6818
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
or is it something fundamental that we
 

6819
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:33,750
or is it something fundamental that we
really need to crack open if we're to

6820
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:33,760
really need to crack open if we're to
 

6821
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,709
really need to crack open if we're to
to build like good computers do you ever

6822
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
to build like good computers do you ever
 

6823
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,149
to build like good computers do you ever
think about consciousness like

6824
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
think about consciousness like
 

6825
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:40,070
think about consciousness like
why it feels like something to be i know

6826
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,080
why it feels like something to be i know
 

6827
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,550
why it feels like something to be i know
it's it's it's really weird

6828
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:42,560
it's it's it's really weird
 

6829
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,070
it's it's it's really weird
so yeah i mean

6830
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
so yeah i mean
 

6831
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,310
so yeah i mean
everything about it is weird first it's

6832
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:48,320
everything about it is weird first it's
 

6833
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,629
everything about it is weird first it's
a half a second behind reality

6834
01:50:50,629 --> 01:50:50,639
a half a second behind reality
 

6835
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,629
a half a second behind reality
right it's a post-hoc narrative about

6836
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:52,639
right it's a post-hoc narrative about
 

6837
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,709
right it's a post-hoc narrative about
what happened you've already

6838
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:54,719
what happened you've already
 

6839
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:57,589
what happened you've already
done stuff by the time you're conscious

6840
01:50:57,589 --> 01:50:57,599
done stuff by the time you're conscious
 

6841
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:58,709
done stuff by the time you're conscious
of it

6842
01:50:58,709 --> 01:50:58,719
of it
 

6843
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:00,229
of it
and your consciousness generally is a

6844
01:51:00,229 --> 01:51:00,239
and your consciousness generally is a
 

6845
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:01,669
and your consciousness generally is a
single threaded thing but we know your

6846
01:51:01,669 --> 01:51:01,679
single threaded thing but we know your
 

6847
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,669
single threaded thing but we know your
brain is 10 billion neurons

6848
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
brain is 10 billion neurons
 

6849
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,830
brain is 10 billion neurons
running some crazy parallel thing

6850
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:07,840
running some crazy parallel thing
 

6851
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,910
running some crazy parallel thing
and there's a really big sorting thing

6852
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:09,920
and there's a really big sorting thing
 

6853
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,950
and there's a really big sorting thing
going on there

6854
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:10,960
going on there
 

6855
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,030
going on there
it also seems to be really reflective in

6856
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
it also seems to be really reflective in
 

6857
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,669
it also seems to be really reflective in
the sense that

6858
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:15,679
the sense that
 

6859
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,830
the sense that
you create a space in your head right

6860
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:17,840
you create a space in your head right
 

6861
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,510
you create a space in your head right
like we don't really see anything right

6862
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,520
like we don't really see anything right
 

6863
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:20,310
like we don't really see anything right
like

6864
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:20,320
like
 

6865
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,990
like
photons hit your eyes it gets turned

6866
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,000
photons hit your eyes it gets turned
 

6867
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,510
photons hit your eyes it gets turned
into signals it goes through multiple

6868
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:23,520
into signals it goes through multiple
 

6869
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,430
into signals it goes through multiple
layers the neurons

6870
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:25,440
layers the neurons
 

6871
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,830
layers the neurons
you know like i'm so curious that you

6872
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:27,840
you know like i'm so curious that you
 

6873
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,669
you know like i'm so curious that you
know that looks glassy and that looks

6874
01:51:29,669 --> 01:51:29,679
know that looks glassy and that looks
 

6875
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:30,870
know that looks glassy and that looks
not glassy like

6876
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:30,880
not glassy like
 

6877
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,790
not glassy like
like how the resolution of your vision

6878
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:32,800
like how the resolution of your vision
 

6879
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,149
like how the resolution of your vision
is so high you have to go through all

6880
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
is so high you have to go through all
 

6881
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,510
is so high you have to go through all
this processing

6882
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:35,520
this processing
 

6883
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,510
this processing
yeah where for most of it it looks

6884
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
yeah where for most of it it looks
 

6885
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,950
yeah where for most of it it looks
nothing like vision

6886
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:38,960
nothing like vision
 

6887
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,669
nothing like vision
okay like like there's no theater in

6888
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
okay like like there's no theater in
 

6889
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,189
okay like like there's no theater in
your mind

6890
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
your mind
 

6891
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:47,589
your mind
right so we we have a world in our heads

6892
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:47,599
right so we we have a world in our heads
 

6893
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:50,470
right so we we have a world in our heads
we're literally just isolated behind our

6894
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
we're literally just isolated behind our
 

6895
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,589
we're literally just isolated behind our
sensors

6896
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:51,599
sensors
 

6897
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:55,510
sensors
but we can look at it speculate about it

6898
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,520
but we can look at it speculate about it
 

6899
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,629
but we can look at it speculate about it
speculate about alternatives problem

6900
01:51:58,629 --> 01:51:58,639
speculate about alternatives problem
 

6901
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,870
speculate about alternatives problem
solve what if you know there's so many

6902
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
solve what if you know there's so many
 

6903
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,790
solve what if you know there's so many
things going on

6904
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:02,800
things going on
 

6905
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,070
things going on
and that process is lagging reality

6906
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
and that process is lagging reality
 

6907
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,070
and that process is lagging reality
and it's single threaded even though the

6908
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
and it's single threaded even though the
 

6909
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,430
and it's single threaded even though the
underlying thing is like

6910
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:09,440
underlying thing is like
 

6911
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,550
underlying thing is like
massively parallel so it's so curious

6912
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:12,560
massively parallel so it's so curious
 

6913
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,990
massively parallel so it's so curious
so imagine you're building an ai

6914
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:14,000
so imagine you're building an ai
 

6915
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,910
so imagine you're building an ai
computer if you wanted to replicate

6916
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:15,920
computer if you wanted to replicate
 

6917
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,510
computer if you wanted to replicate
humans well you'd have huge arrays of

6918
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,520
humans well you'd have huge arrays of
 

6919
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,870
humans well you'd have huge arrays of
neural networks and

6920
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:18,880
neural networks and
 

6921
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,030
neural networks and
apparently only six or seven deep which

6922
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,040
apparently only six or seven deep which
 

6923
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,310
apparently only six or seven deep which
clarious

6924
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,320
clarious
 

6925
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,830
clarious
they only remember seven numbers but i

6926
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:23,840
they only remember seven numbers but i
 

6927
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,830
they only remember seven numbers but i
think we can upgrade that a lot

6928
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:25,840
think we can upgrade that a lot
 

6929
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,310
think we can upgrade that a lot
right and then somewhere in there you

6930
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
right and then somewhere in there you
 

6931
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,910
right and then somewhere in there you
would train the network to create

6932
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:29,920
would train the network to create
 

6933
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,550
would train the network to create
basically

6934
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,560
basically
 

6935
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,430
basically
the world that you live in right so like

6936
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:33,440
the world that you live in right so like
 

6937
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:33,750
the world that you live in right so like
tell

01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,830
tell
stories to itself about the world that

6940
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:35,840
stories to itself about the world that
 

6941
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,030
stories to itself about the world that
it's perceiving well

6942
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,040
it's perceiving well
 

6943
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,109
it's perceiving well
create this create the world tell

6944
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:39,119
create this create the world tell
 

6945
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,709
create this create the world tell
stories in the world

6946
01:52:40,709 --> 01:52:40,719
stories in the world
 

6947
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,629
stories in the world
and then have many dimensions of

6948
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639
and then have many dimensions of
 

6949
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:47,830
and then have many dimensions of
you know like sideshows to it like we

6950
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
you know like sideshows to it like we
 

6951
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,189
you know like sideshows to it like we
have an emotional structure

6952
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
have an emotional structure
 

6953
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,430
have an emotional structure
like we have a biological structure and

6954
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,440
like we have a biological structure and
 

6955
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,709
like we have a biological structure and
that seems hierarchical too

6956
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:52,719
that seems hierarchical too
 

6957
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,950
that seems hierarchical too
like like if you're hungry it dominates

6958
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
like like if you're hungry it dominates
 

6959
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,629
like like if you're hungry it dominates
your thinking if you're mad it dominates

6960
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
your thinking if you're mad it dominates
 

6961
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:57,669
your thinking if you're mad it dominates
your thinking

6962
01:52:57,669 --> 01:52:57,679
your thinking
 

6963
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,910
your thinking
like and we don't know if that's

6964
01:52:59,910 --> 01:52:59,920
like and we don't know if that's
 

6965
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,510
like and we don't know if that's
important to consciousness or not but it

6966
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
important to consciousness or not but it
 

6967
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,229
important to consciousness or not but it
certainly

6968
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:02,239
certainly
 

6969
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,990
certainly
disrupts you know in truths in the

6970
01:53:03,990 --> 01:53:04,000
disrupts you know in truths in the
 

6971
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,589
disrupts you know in truths in the
consciousness

6972
01:53:05,589 --> 01:53:05,599
consciousness
 

6973
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:07,030
consciousness
like so there's lots of structure to

6974
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:07,040
like so there's lots of structure to
 

6975
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,830
like so there's lots of structure to
that and we like to dwell on the past we

6976
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
that and we like to dwell on the past we
 

6977
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,430
that and we like to dwell on the past we
like to think about the future we like

6978
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:11,440
like to think about the future we like
 

6979
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,070
like to think about the future we like
to imagine

6980
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,080
to imagine
 

6981
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,510
to imagine
we'd like to fantasize right and

6982
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520
we'd like to fantasize right and
 

6983
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,149
we'd like to fantasize right and
the somewhat circular observation of

6984
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159
the somewhat circular observation of
 

6985
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,270
the somewhat circular observation of
that is the thing

6986
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:19,280
that is the thing
 

6987
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,390
that is the thing
we call consciousness now if you created

6988
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
we call consciousness now if you created
 

6989
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,830
we call consciousness now if you created
a computer system it did all things

6990
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
a computer system it did all things
 

6991
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,510
a computer system it did all things
create world views created future

6992
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:25,520
create world views created future
 

6993
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,189
create world views created future
alternate histories

6994
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
alternate histories
 

6995
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,350
alternate histories
you know dwelled on past events you know

6996
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:29,360
you know dwelled on past events you know
 

6997
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,589
you know dwelled on past events you know
accurately or semi-accurately

6998
01:53:31,589 --> 01:53:31,599
accurately or semi-accurately
 

6999
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:33,910
accurately or semi-accurately
you know it's it's consciousness just

7000
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
you know it's it's consciousness just
 

7001
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,950
you know it's it's consciousness just
bring up like

7002
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:34,960
bring up like
 

7003
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,310
bring up like
natural well would that feel look and

7004
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
natural well would that feel look and
 

7005
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:41,910
natural well would that feel look and
feel conscious to you like do you think

7006
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920

 

7007
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,589

do you think the thing that looks

7008
01:53:43,589 --> 01:53:43,599
do you think the thing that looks
 

7009
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,350
do you think the thing that looks
conscious is conscious like

7010
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,360
conscious is conscious like
 

7011
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,510
conscious is conscious like
do you uh again this is like an

7012
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
do you uh again this is like an
 

7013
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,189
do you uh again this is like an
engineering kind of question i think

7014
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,199
engineering kind of question i think
 

7015
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:51,189
engineering kind of question i think
because

7016
01:53:51,189 --> 01:53:51,199
because
 

7017
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,709
because
uh like

7018
01:53:54,709 --> 01:53:54,719
uh like
 

7019
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:56,790
uh like
if we want to engineer consciousness is

7020
01:53:56,790 --> 01:53:56,800
if we want to engineer consciousness is
 

7021
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,629
if we want to engineer consciousness is
it okay to engineer something that just

7022
01:53:58,629 --> 01:53:58,639
it okay to engineer something that just
 

7023
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:00,629
it okay to engineer something that just
looks conscious

7024
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
looks conscious
 

7025
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:02,550
looks conscious
or is it is there a difference between

7026
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:02,560
or is it is there a difference between
 

7027
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,149
or is it is there a difference between
well we have all consciousness because

7028
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
well we have all consciousness because
 

7029
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:05,990
well we have all consciousness because
it's a super effective way to manage our

7030
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
it's a super effective way to manage our
 

7031
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,030
it's a super effective way to manage our
affairs

7032
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
affairs
 

7033
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,629
affairs
yeah it's right the social development

7034
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
yeah it's right the social development
 

7035
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,070
yeah it's right the social development
yeah well it gives us the planning

7036
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,080
yeah well it gives us the planning
 

7037
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:10,870
yeah well it gives us the planning
system

7038
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:10,880
system
 

7039
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,109
system
you know we have a huge amount of stuff

7040
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
you know we have a huge amount of stuff
 

7041
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,550
you know we have a huge amount of stuff
like when we're talking

7042
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
like when we're talking
 

7043
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,070
like when we're talking
like the reason we can talk really fast

7044
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:16,080
like the reason we can talk really fast
 

7045
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,750
like the reason we can talk really fast
is we're modeling each other a really

7046
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:17,760
is we're modeling each other a really
 

7047
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:19,750
is we're modeling each other a really
high level of detail and consciousness

7048
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:19,760
high level of detail and consciousness
 

7049
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,189
high level of detail and consciousness
is required for that right and

7050
01:54:21,189 --> 01:54:21,199
is required for that right and
 

7051
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:23,589
is required for that right and
well all those components together

7052
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:23,599
well all those components together
 

7053
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:26,070
well all those components together
manifest consciousness

7054
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
manifest consciousness
 

7055
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,310
manifest consciousness
right so if we make intelligent beings

7056
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,320
right so if we make intelligent beings
 

7057
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,830
right so if we make intelligent beings
that we want to interact with that we're

7058
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:29,840
that we want to interact with that we're
 

7059
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,390
that we want to interact with that we're
like

7060
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:30,400
like
 

7061
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,910
like
you know wondering what they're thinking

7062
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:31,920
you know wondering what they're thinking
 

7063
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,510
you know wondering what they're thinking
you know you know looking forward to

7064
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:33,520
you know you know looking forward to
 

7065
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,709
you know you know looking forward to
seeing them

7066
01:54:34,709 --> 01:54:34,719
seeing them
 

7067
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:36,149
seeing them
you know when they interact with them

7068
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
you know when they interact with them
 

7069
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:38,870
you know when they interact with them
they they're interesting surprising

7070
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
they they're interesting surprising
 

7071
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,669
they they're interesting surprising
you know fascinating you know they will

7072
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:41,679
you know fascinating you know they will
 

7073
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:42,149
you know fascinating you know they will
probably

7074
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:42,159
probably
 

7075
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:43,750
probably
feel conscious like we do and we'll

7076
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:43,760
feel conscious like we do and we'll
 

7077
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,950
feel conscious like we do and we'll
we'll perceive them as conscious

7078
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:46,960
we'll perceive them as conscious
 

7079
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,830
we'll perceive them as conscious
i don't know why not but you never know

7080
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:49,840
i don't know why not but you never know
 

7081
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:52,390
i don't know why not but you never know
another fun question on this because

7082
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:52,400
another fun question on this because
 

7083
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,030
another fun question on this because
in in from a computing perspective we're

7084
01:54:55,030 --> 01:54:55,040
in in from a computing perspective we're
 

7085
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,070
in in from a computing perspective we're
trying to create something that's

7086
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:56,080
trying to create something that's
 

7087
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,430
trying to create something that's
human-like or superhuman-like

7088
01:54:59,430 --> 01:54:59,440
human-like or superhuman-like
 

7089
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:03,189
human-like or superhuman-like
let me ask you about aliens aliens

7090
01:55:03,189 --> 01:55:03,199
let me ask you about aliens aliens
 

7091
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:06,550
let me ask you about aliens aliens
uh do you think there's intelligent

7092
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:06,560
uh do you think there's intelligent
 

7093
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,430
uh do you think there's intelligent
alien civilizations out there and do you

7094
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
alien civilizations out there and do you
 

7095
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,709
alien civilizations out there and do you
think

7096
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719
think
 

7097
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:14,310
think
their technology their computing

7098
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:14,320
their technology their computing
 

7099
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,149
their technology their computing
their ai bots their uh their chips

7100
01:55:18,149 --> 01:55:18,159
their ai bots their uh their chips
 

7101
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:21,189
their ai bots their uh their chips
are of the same nature as ours

7102
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:21,199
are of the same nature as ours
 

7103
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,669
are of the same nature as ours
yeah i got i have no idea i mean if

7104
01:55:23,669 --> 01:55:23,679
yeah i got i have no idea i mean if
 

7105
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:25,030
yeah i got i have no idea i mean if
there's lots of aliens out there they've

7106
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:25,040
there's lots of aliens out there they've
 

7107
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,109
there's lots of aliens out there they've
been awfully quiet

7108
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
been awfully quiet
 

7109
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,550
been awfully quiet
you know there's there's speculation

7110
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
you know there's there's speculation
 

7111
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,550
you know there's there's speculation
about why

7112
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:30,560
about why
 

7113
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,950
about why
there seems to be more than enough

7114
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:32,960
there seems to be more than enough
 

7115
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:33,750
there seems to be more than enough
planets

7116
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:33,760
planets
 

7117
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,270
planets
out there there's a lot yeah um

7118
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,280
out there there's a lot yeah um
 

7119
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,790
out there there's a lot yeah um
there's intelligent life on this planet

7120
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800
there's intelligent life on this planet
 

7121
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,270
there's intelligent life on this planet
that seems quite different you know like

7122
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
that seems quite different you know like
 

7123
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,830
that seems quite different you know like
you know dolphins seem like plausibly

7124
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:43,840
you know dolphins seem like plausibly
 

7125
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,589
you know dolphins seem like plausibly
understandable octopuses don't seem

7126
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599
understandable octopuses don't seem
 

7127
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,350
understandable octopuses don't seem
understandable at all

7128
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:47,360
understandable at all
 

7129
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,950
understandable at all
if they live longer than a year maybe

7130
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
if they live longer than a year maybe
 

7131
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,870
if they live longer than a year maybe
they would be running the planet

7132
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:50,880
they would be running the planet
 

7133
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,669
they would be running the planet
they seem really smart and their neural

7134
01:55:53,669 --> 01:55:53,679
they seem really smart and their neural
 

7135
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:54,950
they seem really smart and their neural
architecture is completely different

7136
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:54,960
architecture is completely different
 

7137
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,390
architecture is completely different
than ours

7138
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
than ours
 

7139
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,550
than ours
now who knows how they perceive things i

7140
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,560
now who knows how they perceive things i
 

7141
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,990
now who knows how they perceive things i
mean that's the question is for us

7142
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:00,000
mean that's the question is for us
 

7143
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,750
mean that's the question is for us
intelligent beings who might not be able

7144
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:01,760
intelligent beings who might not be able
 

7145
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,510
intelligent beings who might not be able
to perceive other kinds of intelligence

7146
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:03,520
to perceive other kinds of intelligence
 

7147
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,030
to perceive other kinds of intelligence
if they become sufficiently different

7148
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
if they become sufficiently different
 

7149
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,629
if they become sufficiently different
than us so yeah

7150
01:56:06,629 --> 01:56:06,639
than us so yeah
 

7151
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,629
than us so yeah
we live in the current constrained world

7152
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
we live in the current constrained world
 

7153
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:09,830
we live in the current constrained world
that you know it's three-dimensional

7154
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
that you know it's three-dimensional
 

7155
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,189
that you know it's three-dimensional
geometry and

7156
01:56:11,189 --> 01:56:11,199
geometry and
 

7157
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:13,030
geometry and
the geometry defines a certain amount of

physics
 

7161
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,229
physics
and you know you know there's like how

7162
01:56:16,229 --> 01:56:16,239
and you know you know there's like how
 

7163
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:18,070
and you know you know there's like how
time works seems to work

7164
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:18,080
time works seems to work
 

7165
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,629
time works seems to work
like there's so many things that seem

7166
01:56:20,629 --> 01:56:20,639
like there's so many things that seem
 

7167
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,149
like there's so many things that seem
like a whole bunch of the input

7168
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:22,159
like a whole bunch of the input
 

7169
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:23,750
like a whole bunch of the input
parameters to the you know another

7170
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:23,760
parameters to the you know another
 

7171
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:26,310
parameters to the you know another
conscious being are the same

7172
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:26,320
conscious being are the same
 

7173
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,030
conscious being are the same
yes like if it's biological biological

7174
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:29,040
yes like if it's biological biological
 

7175
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,790
yes like if it's biological biological
things seem to be in a relatively narrow

7176
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:30,800
things seem to be in a relatively narrow
 

7177
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,550
things seem to be in a relatively narrow
temperature range

7178
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:32,560
temperature range
 

7179
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,470
temperature range
right because you know organic stones

7180
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:34,480
right because you know organic stones
 

7181
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:37,510
right because you know organic stones
aren't stable too cold or too hot

7182
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:37,520
aren't stable too cold or too hot
 

7183
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,149
aren't stable too cold or too hot
you know so so there's if you specified

7184
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:40,159
you know so so there's if you specified
 

7185
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:43,830
you know so so there's if you specified
the list of things that

7186
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:43,840
the list of things that
 

7187
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,070
the list of things that
input to that but as soon as we make

7188
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
input to that but as soon as we make
 

7189
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,149
input to that but as soon as we make
really smart

7190
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
really smart
 

7191
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:50,470
really smart
you know beings and they go solve about

7192
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:50,480
you know beings and they go solve about
 

7193
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,070
you know beings and they go solve about
how to think about a billion numbers at

7194
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:52,080
how to think about a billion numbers at
 

7195
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,350
how to think about a billion numbers at
the same time and

7196
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:53,360
the same time and
 

7197
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,390
the same time and
and how to think in n there's a funny

7198
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
and how to think in n there's a funny
 

7199
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,990
and how to think in n there's a funny
science fiction book where the all the

7200
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000
science fiction book where the all the
 

7201
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:58,950
science fiction book where the all the
society

7202
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:58,960
society
 

7203
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,750
society
had uploaded into this matrix and at

7204
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:01,760
had uploaded into this matrix and at
 

7205
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,750
had uploaded into this matrix and at
some point some some of the beans in the

7206
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,760
some point some some of the beans in the
 

7207
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,310
some point some some of the beans in the
matrix

7208
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:04,320
matrix
 

7209
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,310
matrix
thought i wonder if there's intelligent

7210
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
thought i wonder if there's intelligent
 

7211
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,750
thought i wonder if there's intelligent
life out there

7212
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:07,760
life out there
 

7213
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,109
life out there
so they had to do a whole bunch of work

7214
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:09,119
so they had to do a whole bunch of work
 

7215
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,629
so they had to do a whole bunch of work
to figure out like how to make a

7216
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
to figure out like how to make a
 

7217
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,229
to figure out like how to make a
physical thing

7218
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:12,239
physical thing
 

7219
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,790
physical thing
because their matrix was self-sustaining

7220
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
because their matrix was self-sustaining
 

7221
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,149
because their matrix was self-sustaining
and they made a little spaceship and

7222
01:57:16,149 --> 01:57:16,159
and they made a little spaceship and
 

7223
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:17,750
and they made a little spaceship and
they traveled to another planet when

7224
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
they traveled to another planet when
 

7225
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,390
they traveled to another planet when
they got there

7226
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:18,400
they got there
 

7227
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,550
they got there
there was like life running around but

7228
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:20,560
there was like life running around but
 

7229
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,550
there was like life running around but
there was no intelligent life

7230
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
there was no intelligent life
 

7231
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,990
there was no intelligent life
and then they figured out that there was

7232
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
and then they figured out that there was
 

7233
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,070
and then they figured out that there was
these huge

7234
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,080
these huge
 

7235
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,229
these huge
you know organic matrix all over the

7236
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:28,239
you know organic matrix all over the
 

7237
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:29,990
you know organic matrix all over the
planet inside there where intelligent

7238
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,000
planet inside there where intelligent
 

7239
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,390
planet inside there where intelligent
beings had uploaded themselves

7240
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:32,400
beings had uploaded themselves
 

7241
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:36,149
beings had uploaded themselves
into that matrix so everywhere

7242
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:36,159
into that matrix so everywhere
 

7243
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:39,030
into that matrix so everywhere
intelligent life was as soon as it got

7244
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
intelligent life was as soon as it got
 

7245
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,390
intelligent life was as soon as it got
smart

7246
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
smart
 

7247
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,790
smart
it up leveled itself into something way

7248
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:42,800
it up leveled itself into something way
 

7249
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,030
it up leveled itself into something way
more interesting than 3d geometry and

7250
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,040
more interesting than 3d geometry and
 

7251
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,430
more interesting than 3d geometry and
yeah it escaped whatever this is not

7252
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:47,440
yeah it escaped whatever this is not
 

7253
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,709
yeah it escaped whatever this is not
escaped

7254
01:57:48,709 --> 01:57:48,719
escaped
 

7255
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:51,109
escaped
better yeah the the essence of what we

7256
01:57:51,109 --> 01:57:51,119
better yeah the the essence of what we
 

7257
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:53,030
better yeah the the essence of what we
think of as an intelligent being

7258
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
think of as an intelligent being
 

7259
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:57,030
think of as an intelligent being
i tend to like the thought experiment of

7260
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:57,040
i tend to like the thought experiment of
 

7261
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,109
i tend to like the thought experiment of
the organism like humans aren't the

7262
01:57:59,109 --> 01:57:59,119
the organism like humans aren't the
 

7263
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:00,229
the organism like humans aren't the

dawkins and memes
 

7269
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,910
dawkins and memes
that ideas themselves are the organisms

7270
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:07,920
that ideas themselves are the organisms
 

7271
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,629
that ideas themselves are the organisms
like that are just using our minds to

7272
01:58:10,629 --> 01:58:10,639
like that are just using our minds to
 

7273
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:11,350
like that are just using our minds to
evolve

7274
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:11,360
evolve
 

7275
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:15,189
evolve
so like we're just like meat receptacles

7276
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:15,199
so like we're just like meat receptacles
 

7277
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:17,750
so like we're just like meat receptacles
for ideas to breed and multiply and so

7278
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:17,760
for ideas to breed and multiply and so
 

7279
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,270
for ideas to breed and multiply and so
on and

7280
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:19,280
on and
 

7281
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:23,910
on and
maybe those are the aliens yes so

7282
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:23,920
maybe those are the aliens yes so
 

7283
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,310
maybe those are the aliens yes so
uh jordan peterson has a line says you

7284
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:26,320
uh jordan peterson has a line says you
 

7285
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,229
uh jordan peterson has a line says you
know you think you have ideas but ideas

7286
01:58:28,229 --> 01:58:28,239
know you think you have ideas but ideas
 

7287
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:29,109
know you think you have ideas but ideas
have you

7288
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
have you
 

7289
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:32,149
have you
yeah right good line which and and then

7290
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:32,159
yeah right good line which and and then
 

7291
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:33,270
yeah right good line which and and then
we know about the phenomena of

7292
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:33,280
we know about the phenomena of
 

7293
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,229
we know about the phenomena of
groupthink

7294
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
groupthink
 

7295
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:36,149
groupthink
and there's so many things that

7296
01:58:36,149 --> 01:58:36,159
and there's so many things that
 

7297
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:37,830
and there's so many things that
constrain us

7298
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
constrain us
 

7299
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,990
constrain us
but i think you can examine all that and

7300
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,000
but i think you can examine all that and
 

7301
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,270
but i think you can examine all that and
not be

7302
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:41,280
not be
 

7303
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,270
not be
completely owned by the ideas and

7304
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:43,280
completely owned by the ideas and
 

7305
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,990
completely owned by the ideas and
completely sucked into groupthink

7306
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
completely sucked into groupthink
 

7307
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,070
completely sucked into groupthink
and part of your responsibility as a as

7308
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,080
and part of your responsibility as a as
 

7309
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,669
and part of your responsibility as a as
a human

7310

a human
 

7311
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,589
a human
is to escape that kind of phenomena

7312
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599
is to escape that kind of phenomena
 

7313
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,430
is to escape that kind of phenomena
which isn't you know it's

7314
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,440
which isn't you know it's
 

7315
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,870
which isn't you know it's
you know it's it's one of the creative

7316
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:54,880
you know it's it's one of the creative
 

7317
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,870
you know it's it's one of the creative
tension things again you're constructed

7318
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:56,880
tension things again you're constructed
 

7319
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,750
tension things again you're constructed
by it

7320
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:57,760
by it
 

7321
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,830
by it
but you can still observe it and you can

7322
01:58:59,830 --> 01:58:59,840
but you can still observe it and you can
 

7323
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,669
but you can still observe it and you can
think about it and you can make choices

7324
01:59:01,669 --> 01:59:01,679
think about it and you can make choices
 

7325
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:02,390
think about it and you can make choices
about

7326
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,400
about
 

7327
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,270
about
to some level how constrained you are by

7328
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:05,280
to some level how constrained you are by
 

7329
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:06,870
to some level how constrained you are by
it

7330
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
it
 

7331
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,910
it
and you know it's useful to do that

7332
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920

 

7333
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:15,589

and but but at the same time

7334
01:59:15,589 --> 01:59:15,599
and but but at the same time
 

7335
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,589
and but but at the same time
and it could be by doing that that you

7336
01:59:17,589 --> 01:59:17,599
and it could be by doing that that you
 

7337
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,990
and it could be by doing that that you
know the the the group and society

7338
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:20,000
know the the the group and society
 

7339
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,629
know the the the group and society
you're

7340
01:59:20,629 --> 01:59:20,639
you're
 

7341
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:22,629
you're
you're part of becomes collectively even

7342
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:22,639
you're part of becomes collectively even

you're part of becomes collectively even
more interesting

more interesting
 

7345
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,550
more interesting
so you know so the outside observer will

7346
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
so you know so the outside observer will
 

7347
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,149
so you know so the outside observer will
think wow

7348
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:28,159
think wow

you know all these lexus running around
 

7351
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,430
you know all these lexus running around
with all these really independent ideas

7352
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:31,440
with all these really independent ideas
 

7353
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,790
with all these really independent ideas
have created something even more

horrible it's for all symptoms if you go
 

7427
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:51,669
horrible it's for all symptoms if you go
back on them at the same level you won't

7428
02:00:51,669 --> 02:00:51,679
back on them at the same level you won't
 

7429
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:53,189
back on them at the same level you won't
be stable

7430
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:53,199
be stable
 

7431
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,750
be stable
and that unfortunately happened to him

7432
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:55,760
and that unfortunately happened to him
 

7433
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:57,350
and that unfortunately happened to him
because it's so deeply integrated into

7434
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
because it's so deeply integrated into
 

7435
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,870
because it's so deeply integrated into
all the kinds of systems in the body it

7436
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
all the kinds of systems in the body it
 

7437
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,790
all the kinds of systems in the body it
literally changes the size and numbers

7438
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800
literally changes the size and numbers
 

7439
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:01,270
literally changes the size and numbers
of

7440
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,280
of
 

7441
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:03,109
of
neurotransmitter sites in your brain

7442
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:03,119
neurotransmitter sites in your brain
 

7443
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:05,510
neurotransmitter sites in your brain
yeah so there's a there's a

7444
02:01:05,510 --> 02:01:05,520
yeah so there's a there's a
 

7445
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,510
yeah so there's a there's a
process called the ashton protocol where

7446
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
process called the ashton protocol where
 

7447
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,550
process called the ashton protocol where
you taper it down

7448
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
you taper it down
 

7449
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,870
you taper it down
slowly over two years to people go

7450
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
slowly over two years to people go
 

7451
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,550
slowly over two years to people go
through that goes through unbelievable

7452
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,560
through that goes through unbelievable
 

7453
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,589
through that goes through unbelievable
hell

7454
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
hell
 

7455
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,109
hell

is
heartbreaking and tough so you put some

02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,030
heartbreaking and tough so you put some
of the fault that the doctors that just

7542

oh no it's hard to say it's it's one of
 

7547
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,589
oh no it's hard to say it's it's one of
those commonly prescribed things like

7548
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
those commonly prescribed things like
 

7549
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,070
those commonly prescribed things like
one doctor said what happens is if

7550
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:46,080
one doctor said what happens is if
 

7551
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,669
one doctor said what happens is if
you're prescribed them for a reason

7552
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
you're prescribed them for a reason
 

7553
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,030
you're prescribed them for a reason
and then you have a hard time getting

7554
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,040
and then you have a hard time getting
 

7555
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,350
and then you have a hard time getting
off the protocol basically says you're

7556
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
off the protocol basically says you're
 

7557
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,990
off the protocol basically says you're
either crazy or dependent

7558
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:54,000
either crazy or dependent
 

7559
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,629
either crazy or dependent
and you get kind of pushed into a

7560
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:56,639
and you get kind of pushed into a
 

7561
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:58,229
and you get kind of pushed into a
different treatment regime

7562
02:02:58,229 --> 02:02:58,239
different treatment regime
 

7563
02:02:58,239 --> 02:02:59,750
different treatment regime

and it's bloody scary and some people
are stable on them but they're on them

7588
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:25,440
are stable on them but they're on them
 

7589
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,070
are stable on them but they're on them
for life

02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:29,119
those drugs that
 

7595

people talk about the benzo bubble where
 

7601
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:36,310
people talk about the benzo bubble where
you get disassociated from reality and

mind is terrifying we were talking about
 

7609
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,030
mind is terrifying we were talking about
how

7610
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,040
how
 

7611
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,589
how
how the infinite possibility of fun but

7612
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
how the infinite possibility of fun but
 

7613
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:46,390
how the infinite possibility of fun but
like

7614
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:46,400
like
 

7615
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,830
like
it's the infinite possibility of

7616
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:47,840
it's the infinite possibility of
 

7617
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,350
it's the infinite possibility of
suffering too which is one of the

7618
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
suffering too which is one of the
 

7619
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,950
suffering too which is one of the
dangers of

7620
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:50,960
dangers of
 

7621
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:53,589
dangers of
uh like expansion of the human mind it's

7622
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:53,599
uh like expansion of the human mind it's
 

7623
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:55,030
uh like expansion of the human mind it's
like

7624
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
like
 

7625
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,189
like
i wonder if all the possible huma

7626
02:03:57,189 --> 02:03:57,199
i wonder if all the possible huma
 

7627
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:58,950
i wonder if all the possible huma
experiences that a

7628
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
experiences that a
 

7629
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,069
experiences that a
intelligent computer can have is it

7630
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:02,079
intelligent computer can have is it
 

7631
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:04,470
intelligent computer can have is it
mostly fun or is it mostly

7632
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:04,480
mostly fun or is it mostly
 

7633
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,750
mostly fun or is it mostly
suffering so like if you if you uh brute

7634
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:07,760
suffering so like if you if you uh brute
 

7635
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,990
suffering so like if you if you uh brute
force expand

7636
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
force expand
 

7637
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,910
force expand
the set of possibilities like are you

7638
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:11,920
the set of possibilities like are you
 

7639
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:13,830
the set of possibilities like are you
going to run into some trouble

7640
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:13,840
going to run into some trouble
 

7641
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,669
going to run into some trouble
in terms of like torture and suffering

7642
02:04:15,669 --> 02:04:15,679
in terms of like torture and suffering
 

7643
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:18,069
in terms of like torture and suffering
and so on maybe our human brain is just

7644
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:18,079
and so on maybe our human brain is just
 

7645
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:20,709
and so on maybe our human brain is just
protecting us from much more possible

7646
02:04:20,709 --> 02:04:20,719
protecting us from much more possible
 

7647
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:22,149
protecting us from much more possible
pain and suffering

7648
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:22,159
pain and suffering
 

7649
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:25,510
pain and suffering
maybe the space of pain is like much

7650
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:25,520
maybe the space of pain is like much
 

7651
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,430
maybe the space of pain is like much
larger than we could possibly imagine

7652
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:27,440
larger than we could possibly imagine
 

7653
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,629
larger than we could possibly imagine
and that the world's in the balance

7654
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:30,639
and that the world's in the balance
 

7655
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:32,790
and that the world's in the balance
you know all the all the literature on

7656
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
you know all the all the literature on
 

7657
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,149
you know all the all the literature on
religion and stuff is

7658
02:04:34,149 --> 02:04:34,159
religion and stuff is
 

7659
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:35,910
religion and stuff is
you know the struggle between good and

7660
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:35,920
you know the struggle between good and
 

7661
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:38,310
you know the struggle between good and
evil is is balanced versus

7662
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:38,320
evil is is balanced versus
 

7663
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:40,069
evil is is balanced versus
very finely tuned for reasons that are

7664
02:04:40,069 --> 02:04:40,079
very finely tuned for reasons that are
 

7665
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:41,430
very finely tuned for reasons that are
complicated

7666
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:41,440
complicated
 

7667
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,270
complicated
but that's a that's a long philosophical

7668
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:43,280
but that's a that's a long philosophical
 

7669
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:44,550
but that's a that's a long philosophical
conversation

7670
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
conversation
 

7671
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,830
conversation
uh speaking of balance that's

7672
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
uh speaking of balance that's
 

7673
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,830
uh speaking of balance that's
complicated i i wonder because we're

7674
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:47,840
complicated i i wonder because we're
 

7675
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,310
complicated i i wonder because we're
living through one of the more important

7676
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:50,320
living through one of the more important
 

7677
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:51,910
living through one of the more important
moments in human history with this

7678
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:51,920
moments in human history with this
 

7679
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,669
moments in human history with this
particular virus

7680
02:04:53,669 --> 02:04:53,679
particular virus
 

7681
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:56,310
particular virus
it seems like pandemics have at least

7682
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:56,320
it seems like pandemics have at least
 

7683
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,990
it seems like pandemics have at least
the ability to

7684
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,000
the ability to
 

7685
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,270
the ability to
uh kill off most of the human population

7686
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:01,280
uh kill off most of the human population
 

7687
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,669
uh kill off most of the human population
at their worst and they're just

7688
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
at their worst and they're just
 

7689
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:04,870
at their worst and they're just
fascinating because there's so many

7690
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:04,880
fascinating because there's so many
 

7691
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,990
fascinating because there's so many
viruses in this world

7692
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
viruses in this world
 

7693
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,750
viruses in this world
there's so many i mean viruses basically

7694
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
there's so many i mean viruses basically
 

7695
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,910
there's so many i mean viruses basically
around the world in the sense that uh

7696
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:09,920
around the world in the sense that uh
 

7697
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,149
around the world in the sense that uh
they've been around very long time

7698
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:12,159
they've been around very long time
 

7699
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:13,510
they've been around very long time
they're everywhere

7700
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
they're everywhere
 

7701
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,270
they're everywhere
they seem to be extremely powerful and

7702
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280
they seem to be extremely powerful and
 

7703
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,870
they seem to be extremely powerful and
they're just in a distributed kind of

7704
02:05:16,870 --> 02:05:16,880
they're just in a distributed kind of
 

7705
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:17,510
they're just in a distributed kind of
way but

7706
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
way but
 

7707
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,430
way but
at the same time they're not intelligent

7708
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:19,440
at the same time they're not intelligent
 

7709
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,030
at the same time they're not intelligent
and they're not even living

7710
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:21,040
and they're not even living
 

7711
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,709
and they're not even living
do you have like high level thoughts

7712
02:05:22,709 --> 02:05:22,719
do you have like high level thoughts
 

7713
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:25,510
do you have like high level thoughts
about this virus that uh

7714
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:25,520
about this virus that uh
 

7715
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,189
about this virus that uh
like in terms of you being fascinated

7716
02:05:27,189 --> 02:05:27,199
like in terms of you being fascinated
 

7717
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:28,709
like in terms of you being fascinated
about terrified or

7718
02:05:28,709 --> 02:05:28,719
about terrified or
 

7719
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:31,430
about terrified or
not somewhere in between so i believe in

7720
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:31,440
not somewhere in between so i believe in
 

7721
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,390
not somewhere in between so i believe in
frameworks right

7722
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:32,400
frameworks right
 

7723
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,149
frameworks right
so like one of them is the evolution

7724
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
so like one of them is the evolution
 

7725
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,870
so like one of them is the evolution
like we're evolved creatures right yes

7726
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:38,880
like we're evolved creatures right yes
 

7727
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:39,510
like we're evolved creatures right yes
and

7728
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:39,520
and
 

7729
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,950
and
one of the things about evolution is

7730
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:40,960
one of the things about evolution is
 

7731
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,550
one of the things about evolution is
it's hyper competitive

7732
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:42,560
it's hyper competitive
 

7733
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,310
it's hyper competitive
and it's not competitive out of a sense

7734
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,320
and it's not competitive out of a sense
 

7735
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,390
and it's not competitive out of a sense
of evil it's competitive in the sense of

7736
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:46,400
of evil it's competitive in the sense of
 

7737
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,390
of evil it's competitive in the sense of
there's endless variation in variations

7738
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
there's endless variation in variations
 

7739
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,229
there's endless variation in variations
that work better when

7740
02:05:50,229 --> 02:05:50,239
that work better when
 

7741
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:52,470
that work better when
and then over time there's so many

7742
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:52,480
and then over time there's so many
 

7743
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:54,709
and then over time there's so many
levels of that competition

7744
02:05:54,709 --> 02:05:54,719
levels of that competition
 

7745
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,189
levels of that competition
you know like multi-cellular life partly

7746
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
you know like multi-cellular life partly
 

7747
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:58,149
you know like multi-cellular life partly
exists because

7748
02:05:58,149 --> 02:05:58,159
exists because
 

7749
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:01,669
exists because
of you know the the competition between

7750
02:06:01,669 --> 02:06:01,679
of you know the the competition between
 

7751
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:04,069
of you know the the competition between
you know different kinds of life forms

7752
02:06:04,069 --> 02:06:04,079
you know different kinds of life forms
 

7753
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:05,669
you know different kinds of life forms
and we know sex partly exists to

7754
02:06:05,669 --> 02:06:05,679
and we know sex partly exists to
 

7755
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:07,990
and we know sex partly exists to
scramble our genes so that we have

7756
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:08,000
scramble our genes so that we have
 

7757
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,510
scramble our genes so that we have
you know genetic variation against

7758
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:11,520
you know genetic variation against
 

7759
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,270
you know genetic variation against
the invasion of the bacteria and the

7760
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:13,280
the invasion of the bacteria and the
 

7761
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,470
the invasion of the bacteria and the
viruses and it's endless like

7762
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:16,480
viruses and it's endless like
 

7763
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:18,229
viruses and it's endless like
i read some funny statistic like the

7764
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:18,239
i read some funny statistic like the
 

7765
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:20,229
i read some funny statistic like the
density of viruses and bacteria in the

7766
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:20,239
density of viruses and bacteria in the
 

7767
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:20,629
density of viruses and bacteria in the
ocean

7768
02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:20,639
ocean
 

7769
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:22,629
ocean
is really high and one third of the

7770
02:06:22,629 --> 02:06:22,639
is really high and one third of the
 

7771
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:24,470
is really high and one third of the
bacteria die every day because the virus

7772
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:24,480
bacteria die every day because the virus
 

7773
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,990
bacteria die every day because the virus
is invading them

7774
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:26,000
is invading them
 

7775
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,430
is invading them
like one-third of them wow like

7776
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,440
like one-third of them wow like
 

7777
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,870
like one-third of them wow like
like i don't know if that number is true

7778
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:30,880
like i don't know if that number is true
 

7779
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,550
like i don't know if that number is true
but it was like it's

7780
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:32,560
but it was like it's
 

7781
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,990
but it was like it's
like there's like the amount of

7782
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:34,000
like there's like the amount of
 

7783
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,669
like there's like the amount of
competition and what's going on is

7784
02:06:35,669 --> 02:06:35,679
competition and what's going on is
 

7785
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,109
competition and what's going on is
stunning

7786
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:37,119
stunning
 

7787
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:39,270
stunning
and there's a theory as we age we slowly

7788
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:39,280
and there's a theory as we age we slowly
 

7789
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,669
and there's a theory as we age we slowly
accumulate bacterias and viruses

7790
02:06:41,669 --> 02:06:41,679
accumulate bacterias and viruses
 

7791
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:44,709
accumulate bacterias and viruses
and as our immune system kind of goes

7792
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
and as our immune system kind of goes
 

7793
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:45,189
and as our immune system kind of goes
down

7794
02:06:45,189 --> 02:06:45,199
down
 

7795
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:47,589
down
you know that's what slowly kills us and

7796
02:06:47,589 --> 02:06:47,599
you know that's what slowly kills us and
 

7797
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,510
you know that's what slowly kills us and
it just feels so peaceful from a human

7798
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:49,520
it just feels so peaceful from a human
 

7799
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:51,109
it just feels so peaceful from a human
perspective when we sit back and they're

7800
02:06:51,109 --> 02:06:51,119
perspective when we sit back and they're
 

7801
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:53,830
perspective when we sit back and they're
able to have a relaxed conversation

7802
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:53,840
able to have a relaxed conversation
 

7803
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,629
able to have a relaxed conversation
uh and there's wars going on out there

7804
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
uh and there's wars going on out there
 

7805
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:58,470
uh and there's wars going on out there
like right now

7806
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
like right now
 

7807
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,149
like right now
you're you're harboring how many

7808
02:07:00,149 --> 02:07:00,159
you're you're harboring how many
 

7809
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,550
you're you're harboring how many
bacteria and you know the ones

7810
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:02,560
bacteria and you know the ones
 

7811
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,870
bacteria and you know the ones
many of them are parasites on you and

7812
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:04,880
many of them are parasites on you and
 

7813
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,310
many of them are parasites on you and
some of them are helpful and some of

7814
02:07:06,310 --> 02:07:06,320
some of them are helpful and some of
 

7815
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,750
some of them are helpful and some of
them are modifying your behavior and

7816
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:07,760
them are modifying your behavior and
 

7817
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,350

you know it's just really it's really
 

7821
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,470
you know it's just really it's really
wild but

7822
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:12,480
wild but
 

7823
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,470
wild but
you know this particular manifestation

02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,480
you know this particular manifestation
 

7825
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,069

02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:18,310
is unusual
you know in the demographic how it hit

7828
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320
you know in the demographic how it hit
 

7829
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,350
you know in the demographic how it hit
and the political

7830

technology it's gendered it's kind of
 

7839
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,870
technology it's gendered it's kind of
wild

7840
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:26,880
wild
 

7841
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,629
wild
yeah the communication on twitter that

7842
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
yeah the communication on twitter that
 

7843
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,030
yeah the communication on twitter that
it uh every level all that kind of stuff

7844
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,040
it uh every level all that kind of stuff
 

7845
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,470
it uh every level all that kind of stuff
at every single level yeah

7846
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:32,480
at every single level yeah
 

7847
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,790
at every single level yeah
but but what usually kills life the big

7848
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
but but what usually kills life the big
 

7849
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,950
but but what usually kills life the big
extinctions are caused by

7850
02:07:36,950 --> 02:07:36,960
extinctions are caused by
 

7851
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,910
extinctions are caused by
meteors and volcanoes that's the one

7852
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:39,920
meteors and volcanoes that's the one
 

7853
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,910
meteors and volcanoes that's the one
you're worried about as opposed to

7854
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:41,920
you're worried about as opposed to
 

7855
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,109
you're worried about as opposed to
human-created bombs solar flares are

7856
02:07:45,109 --> 02:07:45,119
human-created bombs solar flares are
 

7857
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:46,229
human-created bombs solar flares are
another good one

7858
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:46,239
another good one
 

7859
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:47,589
another good one
you know occasionally solar flares hit

7860
02:07:47,589 --> 02:07:47,599
you know occasionally solar flares hit
 

7861
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:50,470
you know occasionally solar flares hit
the planet so it's nature

7862
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:50,480
the planet so it's nature
 

7863
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:53,790
the planet so it's nature
oh yes yeah it's all pretty wild on

7864
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:53,800
oh yes yeah it's all pretty wild on
 

7865
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,910
oh yes yeah it's all pretty wild on
another historic moment

7866
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:55,920
another historic moment
 

7867
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,910
another historic moment
this is perhaps outside but perhaps

7868
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:57,920
this is perhaps outside but perhaps
 

7869
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,350
this is perhaps outside but perhaps
within your uh

7870
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:01,360

 

7871
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,189

space of frameworks that you think about

7872
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:03,199
space of frameworks that you think about
 

7873
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:04,470
space of frameworks that you think about
that just happened

7874
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:04,480
that just happened
 

7875
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,709
that just happened
i guess a couple weeks ago is um i don't

7876
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
i guess a couple weeks ago is um i don't
 

7877
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:07,990
i guess a couple weeks ago is um i don't
know if you're paying attention at all

7878
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,000
know if you're paying attention at all
 

7879
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,030
know if you're paying attention at all
it's the

7880
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040
it's the
 

7881
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:14,069
it's the
the game stop and wall street bets

7882
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
the game stop and wall street bets
 

7883
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:16,870
the game stop and wall street bets
so it's really fascinating there's kind

7884
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:16,880
so it's really fascinating there's kind
 

7885
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,470
so it's really fascinating there's kind
of a theme to this conversation

7886
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,480
of a theme to this conversation
 

7887
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,149
of a theme to this conversation
today because it's like you know that

7888
02:08:20,149 --> 02:08:20,159
today because it's like you know that
 

7889
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:21,990
today because it's like you know that
works the

7890
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:22,000
works the
 

7891
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,550
works the
it's cool how there's a large number of

7892
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
it's cool how there's a large number of
 

7893
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,350
it's cool how there's a large number of
people in a distributed way

7894
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,360
people in a distributed way
 

7895
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,709
people in a distributed way
almost having a kind of fun we're able

7896
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
almost having a kind of fun we're able
 

7897

to take on
 

7899
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:35,750
to take on
the powerful elites elite hedge funds

7900
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
the powerful elites elite hedge funds
 

7901
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:39,510

centralized powers and overpower them
 

7903
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:43,350
centralized powers and overpower them
uh do you have thoughts i mean saga

7904
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:43,360
uh do you have thoughts i mean saga
 

7905
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:45,109
uh do you have thoughts i mean saga
i don't know enough about finance but it

7906

02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:56,960
right he was treating like the the
 

7919
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:58,629
right he was treating like the the
people who settled the transactions as a

7920
02:08:58,629 --> 02:08:58,639
people who settled the transactions as a
 

7921
02:08:58,639 --> 02:08:59,830
people who settled the transactions as a
black box

7922
02:08:59,830 --> 02:08:59,840
black box
 

7923
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,270

and suddenly somebody called him up and
 

7925
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,430
and suddenly somebody called him up and
said hey black box calling you

7926
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
said hey black box calling you
 

7927
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,109
said hey black box calling you
your transaction volume means you need

7928
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:05,119
your transaction volume means you need
 

7929
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:06,550
your transaction volume means you need
to put up three billion dollars right

7930
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:06,560
to put up three billion dollars right
 

7931
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,589
to put up three billion dollars right
now and he's like i don't have three

7932
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
now and he's like i don't have three
 

7933
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:08,709
now and he's like i don't have three
billion dollars

7934
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719

trade
so so there was a set of abstractions

7944
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:15,520
so so there was a set of abstractions
 

7945
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,629
so so there was a set of abstractions
that

7946
02:09:16,629 --> 02:09:16,639
that
 

7947
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:18,310
that
you know i don't think either like like

7948
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:18,320
you know i don't think either like like
 

7949
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,750
you know i don't think either like like
now he understands it like

7950
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,760
now he understands it like
 

7951
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,310
now he understands it like
this happens in chip design like you buy

7952
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,320
this happens in chip design like you buy
 

7953
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,510
this happens in chip design like you buy
wafers from tsmc or samsung or intel

7954
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:25,520
wafers from tsmc or samsung or intel
 

7955
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,270
wafers from tsmc or samsung or intel
and you know they say it works like this

7956
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:27,280
and you know they say it works like this
 

7957
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:28,950
and you know they say it works like this
and you do your design based on that and

7958
02:09:28,950 --> 02:09:28,960
and you do your design based on that and
 

7959
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,109
and you do your design based on that and
then chip comes back and doesn't work

7960
02:09:31,109 --> 02:09:31,119
then chip comes back and doesn't work
 

7961
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:32,550
then chip comes back and doesn't work
and then suddenly you start having to

7962
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,560
and then suddenly you start having to
 

7963
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,229
and then suddenly you start having to
open the black boxes like the

7964
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:34,239
open the black boxes like the
 

7965
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:35,990
open the black boxes like the
transistors really work like they said

7966
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,000
transistors really work like they said
 

7967
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,990
transistors really work like they said
you know what's the real issue

7968
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,000
you know what's the real issue
 

7969
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,589
you know what's the real issue
so so the

7970
02:09:41,589 --> 02:09:41,599
so so the
 

7971
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,350
so so the
there's a whole set of things that

7972
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:43,360
there's a whole set of things that
 

7973
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:45,270
there's a whole set of things that
created this opportunity and somebody

7974
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,280
created this opportunity and somebody
 

7975
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,149
created this opportunity and somebody
spotted it

7976
02:09:46,149 --> 02:09:46,159
spotted it
 

7977
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:48,550
spotted it
now people spot these kinds of

7978
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:48,560
now people spot these kinds of
 

7979
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,229
now people spot these kinds of
opportunities all the times there's been

7980
02:09:50,229 --> 02:09:50,239
opportunities all the times there's been
 

7981
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:52,310
opportunities all the times there's been
flash crashes there's been

7982
02:09:52,310 --> 02:09:52,320
flash crashes there's been
 

7983
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:53,910
flash crashes there's been
you know there's always short squeezes

in a way that they make money
 

7995
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:06,229
in a way that they make money
and you know deprive value from both

7996
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:06,239
and you know deprive value from both
 

7997
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:07,589
and you know deprive value from both
this you know the company and the

7998

investors
 

8001
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:11,830
investors
so the fact that

8002
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:11,840
so the fact that
 

8003
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,270
so the fact that
you know some of these stocks were so

8004
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:13,280
you know some of these stocks were so
 

8005
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,669
you know some of these stocks were so
short it's hilarious

8006
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
short it's hilarious
 

8007
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,430
short it's hilarious
that this hasn't happened before i don't

8008
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:17,440
that this hasn't happened before i don't
 

8009
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,750
that this hasn't happened before i don't
know why and i don't actually know why

8010
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:19,760
know why and i don't actually know why
 

8011
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,990
know why and i don't actually know why
some serious hedge funds didn't do it to

8012
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:22,000
some serious hedge funds didn't do it to
 

8013
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,270
some serious hedge funds didn't do it to
other hedge funds

8014
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,280
other hedge funds
 

8015
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,470
other hedge funds
and some of the hedge funds actually

8016
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:24,480
and some of the hedge funds actually
 

8017
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,830
and some of the hedge funds actually
made a lot of money on this yes

8018
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:26,840
made a lot of money on this yes
 

8019
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:29,669
made a lot of money on this yes
so my my guess is we know

8020
02:10:29,669 --> 02:10:29,679
so my my guess is we know
 

8021
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:32,149
so my my guess is we know
five percent of what really happened and

8022
02:10:32,149 --> 02:10:32,159
five percent of what really happened and
 

8023
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:33,510
five percent of what really happened and
that a lot of the players don't know

8024
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
that a lot of the players don't know
 

8025
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:34,390
that a lot of the players don't know
what happened

8026
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
what happened
 

8027
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,790
what happened
and the people who probably made the

8028
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:36,800
and the people who probably made the
 

8029
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,069
and the people who probably made the
most money aren't the people that

8030
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:38,079
most money aren't the people that
 

8031
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:39,430
most money aren't the people that
they're talking about

8032
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,440
they're talking about
 

8033
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,589
they're talking about
yeah that's do you think there was

8034
02:10:41,589 --> 02:10:41,599
yeah that's do you think there was
 

8035
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:42,470
yeah that's do you think there was
something uh

8036
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
something uh
 

8037
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,470
something uh
i mean this is the this is the cool kind

8038
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:44,480
i mean this is the this is the cool kind
 

8039
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:45,589
i mean this is the this is the cool kind
of uh

8040
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
of uh
 

8041
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:49,109
of uh
elon uh you're the same kind of

8042
02:10:49,109 --> 02:10:49,119
elon uh you're the same kind of
 

8043
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:51,430
elon uh you're the same kind of
conversationalist which is like first

8044
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:51,440
conversationalist which is like first
 

8045
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:52,310
conversationalist which is like first
principles

8046
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:52,320
principles
 

8047
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:55,830
principles
questions of like what the hell happened

8048
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:55,840
questions of like what the hell happened
 

8049
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,990
questions of like what the hell happened
uh just very basic questions of like was

8050
02:10:57,990 --> 02:10:58,000
uh just very basic questions of like was
 

8051
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,229
uh just very basic questions of like was
there something shady going on

8052
02:11:00,229 --> 02:11:00,239
there something shady going on
 

8053
02:11:00,239 --> 02:11:03,189
there something shady going on
uh what you know who are the parties

uh what you know who are the parties
 

8055
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:04,550
uh what you know who are the parties
involved it's the basic questions that

8056
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:04,560
involved it's the basic questions that
 

8057
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,149
involved it's the basic questions that
everybody wants to know about

8058
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:06,159
everybody wants to know about
 

8059
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:08,629
everybody wants to know about
yeah so like we're in a very hyper

8060
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
yeah so like we're in a very hyper
 

8061
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,149
yeah so like we're in a very hyper
competitive world right

8062
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:10,159
competitive world right
 

8063
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:11,830
competitive world right
but transactions like buying and selling

8064
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:11,840
but transactions like buying and selling
 

8065
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,350
but transactions like buying and selling

02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:16,790
representing themselves properly you
know

8072
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:16,800
know
 

8073
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,229
know
i bought the stock because i think it's

8074
02:11:18,229 --> 02:11:18,239
i bought the stock because i think it's
 

8075
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:20,229
i bought the stock because i think it's
going to go up i trust that the

8076
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:20,239
going to go up i trust that the
 

8077
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:22,550
going to go up i trust that the
regulations are solid

8078
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,560
regulations are solid
 

8079
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:25,589
regulations are solid
now inside of that there's all kinds of

8080
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:25,599
now inside of that there's all kinds of
 

8081
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:26,709
now inside of that there's all kinds of
places where

8082
02:11:26,709 --> 02:11:26,719
places where
 

8083
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:29,750
places where
you know humans over trust and

8084
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:29,760
you know humans over trust and
 

8085
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,310
you know humans over trust and
you know this this expose let's say some

8086
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:32,320
you know this this expose let's say some
 

8087
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,470
you know this this expose let's say some
weak points in the system

8088
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:34,480
weak points in the system
 

8089
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,709
weak points in the system
i don't know if it's going to get

8090
02:11:36,709 --> 02:11:36,719
i don't know if it's going to get
 

8091
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:38,390
i don't know if it's going to get
corrected i don't know if the

8092
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,400
corrected i don't know if the
 

8093
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:39,910
corrected i don't know if the
i don't know if we have close to the

8094
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:39,920
i don't know if we have close to the
 

8095
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:41,589
i don't know if we have close to the
real story

8096
02:11:41,589 --> 02:11:41,599
real story
 

8097
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:44,470
real story
yeah my suspicion is we don't yeah and

yeah my suspicion is we don't yeah and
 

8099
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,149
yeah my suspicion is we don't yeah and
listen to that guy he was

8100
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
listen to that guy he was
 

8101
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:47,669
listen to that guy he was
like a little wide-eyed about and then

8102
02:11:47,669 --> 02:11:47,679
like a little wide-eyed about and then
 

8103
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:49,030
like a little wide-eyed about and then
he did this and then they did that and

8104
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:49,040
he did this and then they did that and
 

8105
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,870
he did this and then they did that and
it was like

8106
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:50,880
it was like
 

8107
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,390
it was like
i think you should know more about that

8108
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
i think you should know more about that
 

8109
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,990
i think you should know more about that
your business than that

8110

and now it's
 

8145
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,910
and now it's
you know so but part of the problem here

8146
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:25,920
you know so but part of the problem here
 

8147
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:26,950
you know so but part of the problem here
with vlad this

8148
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:26,960
with vlad this
 

8149
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,510
with vlad this
the ceo of robin hood is the scaling is

8150
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:29,520
the ceo of robin hood is the scaling is
 

8151
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,830
the ceo of robin hood is the scaling is
that what we've been talking about is

8152
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:31,840
that what we've been talking about is
 

8153
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:34,709
that what we've been talking about is
there's a lot of unexpected things that

8154
02:12:34,709 --> 02:12:34,719
there's a lot of unexpected things that
 

8155
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:35,910
there's a lot of unexpected things that
happen with the scaling

8156
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:35,920
happen with the scaling
 

8157
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:39,030
happen with the scaling
and you have to be i think the scaling

8158
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,040
and you have to be i think the scaling
 

8159
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,629
and you have to be i think the scaling
forces you to then return to the

8160
02:12:40,629 --> 02:12:40,639
forces you to then return to the
 

8161
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:41,750
forces you to then return to the
fundamentals

8162
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
fundamentals
 

8163
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,350
fundamentals
well it's interesting because when you

8164
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,360
well it's interesting because when you
 

8165
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,189
well it's interesting because when you
buy and sell stocks the scaling is you

8166
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:45,199
buy and sell stocks the scaling is you
 

8167
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:46,790
buy and sell stocks the scaling is you
know the stocks only move in a certain

8168
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:46,800
know the stocks only move in a certain
 

8169
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,310
know the stocks only move in a certain
range and if you buy a stock you can

8170
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:48,320
range and if you buy a stock you can
 

8171
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,910
range and if you buy a stock you can
only lose that amount of money

8172
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:49,920
only lose that amount of money
 

8173
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,830
only lose that amount of money
on the short short market you can lose a

8174
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:51,840
on the short short market you can lose a
 

8175
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,950
on the short short market you can lose a
lot more than you can

8176
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:52,960
lot more than you can
 

8177
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:55,750
lot more than you can

02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
the right word for that is
 

8183
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,350
the right word for that is
so he was trading in a market where he

8184
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:01,360
so he was trading in a market where he
 

8185
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:02,950
so he was trading in a market where he
wasn't actually capitalized for the

but at some point the

8196
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:14,239
but at some point the
 

8197
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:15,910
but at some point the
financial risk to both him and his

financial risk to both him and his
 

8199
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,589

and his understanding how the system
 

8205
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:22,709
and his understanding how the system
work was clearly

8206
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:22,719
work was clearly
 

8207
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:25,189
work was clearly
weak or or he didn't represent himself i

qualities of

8230
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,520
qualities of
 

8231
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,750
qualities of
a good leader is under fire you have to

8232
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:47,760
a good leader is under fire you have to
 

8233
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:48,950
a good leader is under fire you have to
perform

8234
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:48,960
perform
 

8235
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,350
perform
and that means to think clearly and to

8236
02:13:51,350 --> 02:13:51,360
and that means to think clearly and to
 

8237
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:52,950
and that means to think clearly and to
speak clearly

8238

speak clearly
 

8239

and he dropped the ball on those things
 

8241
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:56,149
and he dropped the ball on those things
because

8242
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
because
 

8243
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,310
because
and understand the problem quickly learn

and understand the problem
 

8247
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:03,030
and understand the problem
like at this like basic level

8248
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:03,040
like at this like basic level
 

8249
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,750
like at this like basic level
like what the hell happened and my guess

8250
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:05,760
like what the hell happened and my guess
 

8251
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,030
like what the hell happened and my guess
is

8252
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,040
is
 

8253
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,270
is
you know at some level it was amateurs

8254
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:09,280
you know at some level it was amateurs
 

8255

02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:14,800
people with you know special information
 

8261
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:17,589
people with you know special information
outsiders is insiders yeah and the

8262
02:14:17,589 --> 02:14:17,599
outsiders is insiders yeah and the
 

8263
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:18,790
outsiders is insiders yeah and the
insiders

8264
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:18,800
insiders
 

8265
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,709
insiders
you know my guess is the next time this

8266
02:14:20,709 --> 02:14:20,719
you know my guess is the next time this
 

8267
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:22,790
you know my guess is the next time this
happens we'll make money on it

8268
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
happens we'll make money on it
 

8269
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,750
happens we'll make money on it
the insiders always win well they have

8270
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:25,760
the insiders always win well they have
 

8271
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:25,990
the insiders always win well they have
more

8272
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,000
more
 

8273
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,669
more
tools and more incentive i mean this

8274
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:27,679
tools and more incentive i mean this
 

8275
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:29,589
tools and more incentive i mean this
always happens like the outsiders are

8276
02:14:29,589 --> 02:14:29,599
always happens like the outsiders are
 

8277
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:31,430
always happens like the outsiders are
doing this for fun the insiders are

8278
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:31,440
doing this for fun the insiders are
 

8279
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,189
doing this for fun the insiders are
doing this 24 7.

8280
02:14:33,189 --> 02:14:33,199
doing this 24 7.
 

8281
02:14:33,199 --> 02:14:35,510
doing this 24 7.
but there's numbers in the outsiders

8282
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
but there's numbers in the outsiders
 

8283
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,709
but there's numbers in the outsiders
this is the interesting thing

8284
02:14:36,709 --> 02:14:36,719
this is the interesting thing
 

8285
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,229
this is the interesting thing
well there's numbers on the insiders too

8286
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:40,239
well there's numbers on the insiders too
 

8287
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:42,149
well there's numbers on the insiders too
like different kind of numbers different

8288
02:14:42,149 --> 02:14:42,159
like different kind of numbers different
 

8289
02:14:42,159 --> 02:14:43,830
like different kind of numbers different
kind of numbers

8290
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:43,840
kind of numbers
 

8291
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,669
kind of numbers
but this could be a new era because i

8292
02:14:45,669 --> 02:14:45,679
but this could be a new era because i
 

8293
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:47,350
but this could be a new era because i
don't know at least i didn't expect that

8294
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:47,360
don't know at least i didn't expect that
 

8295
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,950
don't know at least i didn't expect that
uh a bunch of redditors could

8296
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
uh a bunch of redditors could
 

8297
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,870
uh a bunch of redditors could
you know there's uh you know millions of

8298
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:50,880
you know there's uh you know millions of
 

8299
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,149
you know there's uh you know millions of
people who can get together

8300
02:14:52,149 --> 02:14:52,159
people who can get together
 

8301
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:54,229
people who can get together
the next one won't be a surprise but

8302
02:14:54,229 --> 02:14:54,239
the next one won't be a surprise but
 

8303
02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:55,430
the next one won't be a surprise but
don't you think the

8304
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:55,440
don't you think the
 

8305
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,430
don't you think the
the the crowd the people are planning

8306
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:57,440
the the crowd the people are planning
 

8307
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:59,030
the the crowd the people are planning
the next attack

8308
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,040
the next attack
 

8309
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,270
the next attack
we'll see but it has to be a surprise

8310
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:01,280
we'll see but it has to be a surprise
 

8311
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,390
we'll see but it has to be a surprise
can't be the same game

8312
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:04,400

 

8313
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:07,270

as to the end it could be there's a very

8314
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:07,280
as to the end it could be there's a very
 

8315
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,950
as to the end it could be there's a very
large number of games to play and they

8316
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:08,960
large number of games to play and they
 

8317
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:09,510
large number of games to play and they
can be

8318
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:09,520
can be
 

8319
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,430
can be
agile about it i don't know i'm not an

8320
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:11,440
agile about it i don't know i'm not an
 

8321
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,669
agile about it i don't know i'm not an
expert right that's a good question how

8322
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:13,679
expert right that's a good question how
 

8323
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:16,149
expert right that's a good question how
the space of games how how restricted is

8324
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:16,159
the space of games how how restricted is
 

8325
02:15:16,159 --> 02:15:17,830
the space of games how how restricted is
it

8326
02:15:17,830 --> 02:15:17,840
it
 

8327
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:20,149
it
yeah and the system is so complicated it

8328
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
yeah and the system is so complicated it
 

8329
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:22,550
yeah and the system is so complicated it
could be relatively unrestricted

8330
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:22,560
could be relatively unrestricted
 

8331
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,550
could be relatively unrestricted
and also like you know during the last

8332
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:24,560
and also like you know during the last
 

8333
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,470
and also like you know during the last
couple financial crashes

8334
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
couple financial crashes
 

8335
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,629
couple financial crashes
you know what set it off was you know

8336
02:15:28,629 --> 02:15:28,639
you know what set it off was you know
 

8337
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:30,790
you know what set it off was you know
sets of derivative events where

8338
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800
sets of derivative events where
 

8339
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:33,589
sets of derivative events where
you know the you know nasim talibs you

8340
02:15:33,589 --> 02:15:33,599
you know the you know nasim talibs you
 

8341
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:34,470
you know the you know nasim talibs you
know thing is

8342
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:34,480
know thing is
 

8343
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:37,189
know thing is
they're they're they're trying to lower

8344
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:37,199
they're they're they're trying to lower
 

8345
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:38,550
they're they're they're trying to lower
volatility

8346
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:38,560
volatility
 

8347
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:40,149
volatility
in the short run but creating tail

8348
02:15:40,149 --> 02:15:40,159
in the short run but creating tail
 

8349
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:41,990
in the short run but creating tail
events and

8350
02:15:41,990 --> 02:15:42,000
events and
 

8351
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,669
events and
systems always evolve towards that and

8352
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
systems always evolve towards that and
 

8353
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,350
systems always evolve towards that and
then they always crash like

8354
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
then they always crash like
 

8355
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:48,790
then they always crash like
the gas curve is the you know star low

8356
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:48,800
the gas curve is the you know star low
 

8357
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,310
the gas curve is the you know star low
ramp plateau crash it's 100

02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:28,469
it i guess the ultimate goal is for it
to be the same well if you want

9190
02:29:28,469 --> 02:29:28,479
to be the same well if you want
 

9191
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:30,070
to be the same well if you want
something to be bigger and interesting

9192
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
something to be bigger and interesting
 

9193
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:30,710
something to be bigger and interesting
you should find

9194
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:30,720
you should find
 

9195
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,150
you should find
all its components and differentiate

9196
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:32,160
all its components and differentiate
 

9197
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,630
all its components and differentiate
them not climb it together

9198
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:34,640
them not climb it together
 

9199
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,550
them not climb it together
people do this all the time they yeah

9200
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
people do this all the time they yeah
 

9201
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,990
people do this all the time they yeah
and the modularity

9202
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:38,000
and the modularity
 

9203
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,429
and the modularity
get your abstraction layers right and

9204
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:39,439
get your abstraction layers right and
 

9205
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:41,429
get your abstraction layers right and
then you can you have room to breathe

9206
02:29:41,429 --> 02:29:41,439
then you can you have room to breathe
 

9207
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:42,790
then you can you have room to breathe
well maybe you can write the forward to

9208
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:42,800
well maybe you can write the forward to
 

9209
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,469
well maybe you can write the forward to
my book about love

9210
02:29:44,469 --> 02:29:44,479
my book about love
 

9211
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:46,710
my book about love
yeah or the afterwards and the after you

9212
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,720
yeah or the afterwards and the after you
 

9213
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:49,190
yeah or the afterwards and the after you
really tried

9214
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:49,200
really tried
 

9215
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:50,550
really tried
i feel like lex has made a lot of

9216
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,560
i feel like lex has made a lot of
 

9217
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:53,349
i feel like lex has made a lot of
progress in this book but

9218
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
progress in this book but
 

9219
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:54,950
progress in this book but
uh well you have things in your life

9220
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:54,960
uh well you have things in your life
 

9221
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:56,550
uh well you have things in your life
that you love yeah

9222
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:56,560
that you love yeah
 

9223
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,630
that you love yeah
yeah you know so and they are you're

9224
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:58,640
yeah you know so and they are you're
 

9225
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:01,190
yeah you know so and they are you're
right they're modular it's

9226
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:01,200
right they're modular it's
 

9227
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,590
right they're modular it's
and you can have multiple things with

9228
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:03,600
and you can have multiple things with
 

9229
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,030
and you can have multiple things with
the same person or the same

9230
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:05,040
the same person or the same
 

9231
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:08,309
the same person or the same
thing and yeah but yeah

9232
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
thing and yeah but yeah
 

9233
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:09,750
thing and yeah but yeah
depending on the moment of the day yeah

9234
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:09,760
depending on the moment of the day yeah
 

9235
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,389
depending on the moment of the day yeah
there's like what bukowski

9236
02:30:12,389 --> 02:30:12,399
there's like what bukowski
 

9237
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:14,230
there's like what bukowski
described as that moment you go from

9238
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:14,240
described as that moment you go from
 

9239
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:16,150
described as that moment you go from
being in love to having

9240
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:16,160
being in love to having
 

9241
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,309
being in love to having
a different kind of love yeah right and

9242
02:30:18,309 --> 02:30:18,319
a different kind of love yeah right and
 

9243
02:30:18,319 --> 02:30:19,349
a different kind of love yeah right and
that's the transition

9244
02:30:19,349 --> 02:30:19,359
that's the transition
 

9245
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:20,870
that's the transition
but when it happens if you read the

9246
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:20,880
but when it happens if you read the
 

9247
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:22,630
but when it happens if you read the
owner's manual and you believed it

9248
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
owner's manual and you believed it
 

9249
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:25,270
owner's manual and you believed it
you would have said oh this happened it

9250
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:25,280
you would have said oh this happened it
 

9251
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,550
you would have said oh this happened it
doesn't mean it's not love it's a

9252
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
doesn't mean it's not love it's a
 

9253
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,790
doesn't mean it's not love it's a
different kind of love

9254
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:28,800
different kind of love
 

9255
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,750
different kind of love
but but maybe there's something better

9256
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:31,760
but but maybe there's something better
 

9257
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:31,990
but but maybe there's something better
about

9258
02:30:31,990 --> 02:30:32,000
about
 

9259
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,309
about
that as you grow old if all you do is

9260
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
that as you grow old if all you do is
 

9261
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,510
that as you grow old if all you do is
regret

9262
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
regret
 

9263
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:39,110
regret
how you used to be it's sad right

9264
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:39,120
how you used to be it's sad right
 

9265
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:40,630
how you used to be it's sad right
you should have learned a lot of things

9266
02:30:40,630 --> 02:30:40,640
you should have learned a lot of things
 

9267
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,469
you should have learned a lot of things
because like who you can be in your

9268
02:30:42,469 --> 02:30:42,479
because like who you can be in your
 

9269
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:43,830
because like who you can be in your
future self is

9270
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
future self is
 

9271
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,670
future self is
is actually more interesting and

9272
02:30:45,670 --> 02:30:45,680
is actually more interesting and
 

9273
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,510
is actually more interesting and
possibly delightful than

9274
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
possibly delightful than
 

9275
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,990
possibly delightful than
you know being a mad kid in love with

the
the next person like that's super fun

the next person like that's super fun
 

9281
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:55,590
the next person like that's super fun
when it happens but

9282
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:55,600
when it happens but
 

9283
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:57,910
when it happens but
that's that's you know five percent of

9284
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:57,920
that's that's you know five percent of
 

9285
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:00,950
that's that's you know five percent of
the possibility

9286
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:00,960
the possibility
 

9287
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:02,710
the possibility
yeah that's right that there's a lot

9288
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:02,720
yeah that's right that there's a lot
 

9289
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:04,630
yeah that's right that there's a lot
more fun to be had in the long lasting

9290
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:04,640
more fun to be had in the long lasting
 

9291
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:05,190
more fun to be had in the long lasting
stuff

9292
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:05,200
stuff
 

9293
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:07,510
stuff
yeah or meaning you know if that's me

9294
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,520
yeah or meaning you know if that's me
 

9295
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,110
yeah or meaning you know if that's me
which is a kind of fun

which is a kind of fun
 

9297
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,790
which is a kind of fun
it's a deeper kind of fun and it's

9298
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:10,800
it's a deeper kind of fun and it's
 

9299

surprising you know that's
 

9301
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,830
surprising you know that's
like like the thing i like is surprises

02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:15,840
like like the thing i like is surprises
 

9303
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,910
like like the thing i like is surprises
you know and you just never know what's

9304

you know and you just never know what's
gonna happen yeah

9306
02:31:19,270 --> 02:31:19,280
gonna happen yeah
 

9307
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,630
gonna happen yeah
but you have to look carefully and you

9308
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
but you have to look carefully and you
 

9309
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:21,750
but you have to look carefully and you
have to work at it you have to think

9310
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:21,760
have to work at it you have to think
 

9311
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:22,550
have to work at it you have to think
about it and

9312
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:22,560
about it and
 

9313
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,950
about it and
you know it's yeah you have to see the

9314
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:24,960
you know it's yeah you have to see the
 

9315
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:26,150
you know it's yeah you have to see the
surprises when they happen

9316
02:31:26,150 --> 02:31:26,160
surprises when they happen
 

9317
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:28,309
surprises when they happen
right you have to be looking for it from

9318
02:31:28,309 --> 02:31:28,319
right you have to be looking for it from
 

9319
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:29,750
right you have to be looking for it from
the branching perspective

9320
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
the branching perspective
 

9321
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:33,349
the branching perspective
you mentioned regrets uh

9322
02:31:33,349 --> 02:31:33,359
you mentioned regrets uh
 

9323
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:35,270

02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:38,000
trajectory oh yeah of course
 

9327
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,990
trajectory oh yeah of course
yeah some of it's painful but you want

9328
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:40,000
yeah some of it's painful but you want
 

9329
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,030
yeah some of it's painful but you want
to hear the painful stuff

9330
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:43,040
to hear the painful stuff
 

9331
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,349
to hear the painful stuff
i'd say like in terms of working with

9332
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
i'd say like in terms of working with
 

9333
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:46,710
i'd say like in terms of working with
people

9334
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:46,720
people
 

9335
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,630
people
when people did say stuff i didn't like

9336
02:31:48,630 --> 02:31:48,640
when people did say stuff i didn't like
 

9337
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:50,550
when people did say stuff i didn't like
especially if it was a bit nefarious

9338
02:31:50,550 --> 02:31:50,560
especially if it was a bit nefarious
 

9339
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:53,830
especially if it was a bit nefarious
i took it personally and i also felt it

9340
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:53,840
i took it personally and i also felt it
 

9341

and like a big time factor rather than a
you know well that requires a lot of

9508
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:29,840
you know well that requires a lot of

yeah and it's it's it's effective in the
 

9517
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:40,309
yeah and it's it's it's effective in the
sense that coordinating thousands of

9518
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:40,319
sense that coordinating thousands of
 

9519
02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:42,550
sense that coordinating thousands of
people to do really hard things

9520
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:42,560
people to do really hard things
 

9521
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,870
people to do really hard things
where many of the people in there don't

9522
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:44,880
where many of the people in there don't
 

9523
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,469
where many of the people in there don't
understand themselves much less how

9524
02:34:46,469 --> 02:34:46,479
understand themselves much less how
 

9525
02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:47,590
understand themselves much less how
they're participating

9526
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:47,600
they're participating
 

9527
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,630
they're participating
yeah creates all kinds of

9528
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
yeah creates all kinds of
 

9529
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:53,110
yeah creates all kinds of
you know drama and problems that you

9530
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:53,120
you know drama and problems that you
 

9531
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:55,670
you know drama and problems that you
know our solution is political in nature

9532
02:34:55,670 --> 02:34:55,680
know our solution is political in nature
 

9533
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,110
know our solution is political in nature
like how do you convince people how do

9534
02:34:57,110 --> 02:34:57,120

them how do you get rid of them how you
 

9539
02:35:00,319 --> 02:35:01,110
them how do you get rid of them how you
know like there's

9540
02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:01,120
know like there's
 

9541
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:03,110
know like there's
there's so many layers of that that are

9542
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:03,120
there's so many layers of that that are
 

9543
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,389
there's so many layers of that that are
interesting

9544
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
interesting
 

9545
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,469
interesting
and even though some some of it let's

9546
02:35:06,469 --> 02:35:06,479
and even though some some of it let's
 

9547
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:08,469
and even though some some of it let's
say may be tough

9548
02:35:08,469 --> 02:35:08,479
say may be tough
 

9549
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:12,150
say may be tough
it's not evil

9550
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,160
it's not evil
 

9551
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,150
it's not evil
unless you know you use that skill to

9552

unless you know you use that skill to
 

9553

unless you know you use that skill to
evil purposes which some people

9554
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:15,600
evil purposes which some people
 

9555
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,270
evil purposes which some people
obviously do but

9556
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:17,280
obviously do but
 

9557
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,270
obviously do but
but it's a skill set that operates you

9558
02:35:19,270 --> 02:35:19,280
but it's a skill set that operates you
 

9559
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:20,710
but it's a skill set that operates you
know and i wish i'd

9560
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,720
know and i wish i'd
 

9561
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,710
know and i wish i'd
you know i was interested in it but i

9562
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:22,720
you know i was interested in it but i
 

9563
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:24,309
you know i was interested in it but i
you know it was sort of like i'm an

9564
02:35:24,309 --> 02:35:24,319
you know it was sort of like i'm an
 

9565
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:26,630
you know it was sort of like i'm an
engineer i do my thing

9566
02:35:26,630 --> 02:35:26,640
engineer i do my thing
 

9567
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,389
engineer i do my thing
and you know there's there's times when

9568
02:35:28,389 --> 02:35:28,399
and you know there's there's times when
 

9569
02:35:28,399 --> 02:35:29,670
and you know there's there's times when
i could have way bigger

9570
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:29,680
i could have way bigger
 

9571
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:33,110
i could have way bigger
impact if i you know knew how to

9572
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:33,120
impact if i you know knew how to
 

9573
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:34,950
impact if i you know knew how to
if i paid more attention and knew more

9574
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:34,960
if i paid more attention and knew more
 

9575
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:36,870
if i paid more attention and knew more
about that

9576
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:36,880
about that
 

9577
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:39,110
about that
about the human layer of the stack yeah

9578
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:39,120
about the human layer of the stack yeah
 

9579
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:39,990
about the human layer of the stack yeah
that human

9580
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:40,000
that human
 

9581
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,990
that human
political power you know expression

9582
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:42,000
political power you know expression
 

9583
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,030
political power you know expression
layer of the stack

9584
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:43,040
layer of the stack
 

9585
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,270
layer of the stack
which is complicated and there's lots to

9586
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,280
which is complicated and there's lots to
 

9587
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,790
which is complicated and there's lots to
know about it i mean people are good at

9588
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:46,800
know about it i mean people are good at
 

9589
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:49,270
know about it i mean people are good at
it are just amazing

9590
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:49,280
it are just amazing
 

9591
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:51,190
it are just amazing
and when they're good at it and let's

9592
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,200
and when they're good at it and let's
 

9593
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,830
and when they're good at it and let's
say

9594
02:35:52,830 --> 02:35:52,840
say
 

9595
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:55,510
say
relatively kind and oriented in a good

9596
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:55,520
relatively kind and oriented in a good
 

9597
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,469
relatively kind and oriented in a good
direction

9598
02:35:56,469 --> 02:35:56,479
direction
 

9599
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:59,270
direction
you can really feel it can get lots of

9600
02:35:59,270 --> 02:35:59,280
you can really feel it can get lots of
 

9601
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:00,630
you can really feel it can get lots of
stuff done and coordinate things you

9602
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:00,640
stuff done and coordinate things you
 

9603
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:03,510
stuff done and coordinate things you
never thought possible

9604
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:03,520
never thought possible
 

9605
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:05,830
never thought possible
but all people like that also have some

9606
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
but all people like that also have some
 

9607
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:07,670
but all people like that also have some
pretty hard edges because

9608
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:07,680
pretty hard edges because
 

9609
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,670
pretty hard edges because
you know it's it's a heavy lift and i

9610
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680
you know it's it's a heavy lift and i
 

9611
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,270
you know it's it's a heavy lift and i
wish i'd spent more time with that when

9612
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:11,280
wish i'd spent more time with that when
 

9613
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,030
wish i'd spent more time with that when
i was younger but

9614

a big pyramid
 

9693
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,590
a big pyramid
so i had a debate with a friend about

9694
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:33,600
so i had a debate with a friend about
 

9695
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,710

whether pyramids or craters are cooler
 

9697
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:38,790
whether pyramids or craters are cooler
and you realize that there's craters

9698

and you realize that there's craters
 

9699
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:39,990
and you realize that there's craters
everywhere but you know they built a

9700
02:37:39,990 --> 02:37:40,000
everywhere but you know they built a
 

9701
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,349

ago in there
 

9705
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,429
ago in there
and they remember you think that would

9706
02:37:45,429 --> 02:37:45,439
