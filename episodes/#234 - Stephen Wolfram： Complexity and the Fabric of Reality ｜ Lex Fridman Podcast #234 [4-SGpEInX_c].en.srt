almost 20 years ago you published a new

48
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
almost 20 years ago you published a new
 

49
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,630
almost 20 years ago you published a new
kind of science where you presented a

50
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
kind of science where you presented a
 

51
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,350
kind of science where you presented a
study of complexity and an approach for

52
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
study of complexity and an approach for
 

53
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,789
study of complexity and an approach for
modeling of complex systems so

54
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
modeling of complex systems so
 

55
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,190
modeling of complex systems so
let us return again to the core idea of

56
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
let us return again to the core idea of
 

57
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,550
let us return again to the core idea of
complexity

58
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
complexity
 

59
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,429
complexity
what

60
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
what
 

61
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,230
what
is

62
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
is
 

63
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,469
is
complexity i don't know i think that's

64
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
complexity i don't know i think that's
 

65
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,550
complexity i don't know i think that's
not the most interesting question it's

66
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
not the most interesting question it's
 

67
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,270
not the most interesting question it's
like

68
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
like
 

69
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,350
like
you know if you ask a biologist what is

70
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
you know if you ask a biologist what is
 

71
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,670
you know if you ask a biologist what is
life yeah that's not the question they

72
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
life yeah that's not the question they
 

73
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,510
life yeah that's not the question they
care the most about

74
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
care the most about
 

75
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,429
care the most about
what i was interested in is

76
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
what i was interested in is
 

77
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,030
what i was interested in is
how does

78
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
how does
 

79
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,350
how does
something that we would usually identify

80
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
something that we would usually identify
 

81
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,270
something that we would usually identify
as complexity arise in nature and i got

82
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
as complexity arise in nature and i got
 

83
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,190
as complexity arise in nature and i got
interested in that question like 50

84
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
interested in that question like 50
 

85
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,710
interested in that question like 50
years ago which is really embarrassingly

86
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
years ago which is really embarrassingly
 

87
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,069
years ago which is really embarrassingly
a long time ago

88
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
a long time ago
 

89
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,870
a long time ago
and you know i i was uh you know how

90
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
and you know i i was uh you know how
 

91
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,789
and you know i i was uh you know how
does snowflakes get to have complicated

92
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
does snowflakes get to have complicated
 

93
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,469
does snowflakes get to have complicated
forms how do galaxies get to have

94
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
forms how do galaxies get to have
 

95
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,389
forms how do galaxies get to have
complicated shapes how does you know how

96
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
complicated shapes how does you know how
 

97
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,550
complicated shapes how does you know how
do living systems get produced things

98
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
do living systems get produced things
 

99
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,870
do living systems get produced things
like that and the question is what's the

100
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
like that and the question is what's the
 

101
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,109
like that and the question is what's the
sort of underlying scientific basis for

102
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
sort of underlying scientific basis for
 

103
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,550
sort of underlying scientific basis for
those kinds of things

104
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
those kinds of things
 

105
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,190
those kinds of things
and the thing that i was at first very

106
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
and the thing that i was at first very
 

107
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,550
and the thing that i was at first very
surprised by because i've been doing

108
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
surprised by because i've been doing
 

109
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,630
surprised by because i've been doing
physics and particle physics and fancy

110
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
physics and particle physics and fancy
 

111
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,469
physics and particle physics and fancy
mathematical physics and so on and it's

112
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
mathematical physics and so on and it's
 

113
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,310
mathematical physics and so on and it's
like i know all this fancy stuff i

114
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
like i know all this fancy stuff i
 

115
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,749
like i know all this fancy stuff i
should be able to solve this sort of

116
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
should be able to solve this sort of
 

117
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,550
should be able to solve this sort of
basic science question and i couldn't

118
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
basic science question and i couldn't
 

119
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,229
basic science question and i couldn't
this was like early maybe

120
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:11,239
this was like early maybe
 

121
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,869
this was like early maybe
1980-ish time frame and it's like okay

122
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
1980-ish time frame and it's like okay
 

123
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,350
1980-ish time frame and it's like okay
what can one do to understand the sort

124
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
what can one do to understand the sort
 

125
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,190
what can one do to understand the sort
of basic secret that nature seems to

126
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
of basic secret that nature seems to
 

127
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,869
of basic secret that nature seems to
have because it seems like nature you

128
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
have because it seems like nature you
 

129
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,229
have because it seems like nature you
look around in the natural world it's

130
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
look around in the natural world it's
 

131
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,550
look around in the natural world it's
full of incredibly complicated forms you

132
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
full of incredibly complicated forms you
 

133
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,589
full of incredibly complicated forms you
look at

134
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
look at
 

135
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,990
look at
sort of most engineered kinds of things

136
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
sort of most engineered kinds of things
 

137
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,830
sort of most engineered kinds of things
for instance they tend to be you know

138
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
for instance they tend to be you know
 

139
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,229
for instance they tend to be you know
we've got sort of circles and

140
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
we've got sort of circles and
 

141
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,630
we've got sort of circles and
lines and things like this the question

142
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
lines and things like this the question
 

143
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,790
lines and things like this the question
is what secret does nature have that

144
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
is what secret does nature have that
 

145
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,190
is what secret does nature have that
lets it make all this complexity that we

146
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
lets it make all this complexity that we
 

147
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,589
lets it make all this complexity that we
in doing engineering for example don't

148
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
in doing engineering for example don't
 

149
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,670
in doing engineering for example don't
naturally seem to have and so that was

150
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
naturally seem to have and so that was
 

151
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,790
naturally seem to have and so that was
the kind of the thing that i got

152
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
the kind of the thing that i got
 

153
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,869
the kind of the thing that i got
interested in and then the question was

154
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
interested in and then the question was
 

155
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,030
interested in and then the question was
you know could i understand that with

156
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
you know could i understand that with
 

157
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,710
you know could i understand that with
things like mathematical physics well

158
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
things like mathematical physics well
 

159
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,949
things like mathematical physics well
didn't work very well so then i got to

160
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
didn't work very well so then i got to
 

161
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,869
didn't work very well so then i got to
thinking about okay is there some other

162
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
thinking about okay is there some other
 

163
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,110
thinking about okay is there some other
way to try to understand this and then

164
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
way to try to understand this and then
 

165
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,790
way to try to understand this and then
the question was if you're going to look

166
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
the question was if you're going to look
 

167
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,869
the question was if you're going to look
at some system in nature how do you make

168
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
at some system in nature how do you make
 

169
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,390
at some system in nature how do you make
a model for that system for what that

170
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
a model for that system for what that
 

171
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,470
a model for that system for what that
system does so you know a model is some

172
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
system does so you know a model is some
 

173
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,630
system does so you know a model is some
abstract representation of the system

174
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
abstract representation of the system
 

175
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,190
abstract representation of the system
some formal representation system what

176
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
some formal representation system what
 

177
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,869
some formal representation system what
are what is the raw material that you

178
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
are what is the raw material that you
 

179
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,830
are what is the raw material that you
can make that model out of and so what i

180
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
can make that model out of and so what i
 

181
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,710
can make that model out of and so what i
realized was well actually programs are

182
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
realized was well actually programs are
 

183
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,030
realized was well actually programs are
really good source of raw material for

184
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
really good source of raw material for
 

185
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,350
really good source of raw material for
making models of things and you know in

186
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
making models of things and you know in
 

187
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,390
making models of things and you know in
terms of my personal history the to me

188
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
terms of my personal history the to me
 

189
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,309
terms of my personal history the to me
that seemed really obvious and the

190
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
that seemed really obvious and the
 

191
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,670
that seemed really obvious and the
reason it seemed really obvious is

192
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
reason it seemed really obvious is
 

193
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,110
reason it seemed really obvious is
because i just spent several years

194
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
because i just spent several years
 

195
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,110
because i just spent several years
building this big piece of software that

196
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
building this big piece of software that
 

197
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,869
building this big piece of software that
was sort of a predecessor to mathematica

198
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
was sort of a predecessor to mathematica
 

199
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,190
was sort of a predecessor to mathematica
and multiple language thing called smp

200
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
and multiple language thing called smp
 

201
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,589
and multiple language thing called smp
symbolic manipulation program which was

202
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
symbolic manipulation program which was
 

203
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,390
symbolic manipulation program which was
something that had this idea of starting

204
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
something that had this idea of starting
 

205
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,110
something that had this idea of starting
from just these computational primitives

206
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
from just these computational primitives
 

207
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,390
from just these computational primitives
and building up everything one had to

208
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
and building up everything one had to
 

209
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,630
and building up everything one had to
build up and so kind of the notion of

210
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
build up and so kind of the notion of
 

211
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
build up and so kind of the notion of
well let's just try and make models by

212
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
well let's just try and make models by
 

213
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,990
well let's just try and make models by
starting from computational primitives

214
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
starting from computational primitives
 

215
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
starting from computational primitives
and seeing what we can build up that

216
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
and seeing what we can build up that
 

217
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,350
and seeing what we can build up that
seemed like a totally obvious thing to

218
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
seemed like a totally obvious thing to
 

219
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,070
seemed like a totally obvious thing to
do

220
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
do
 

221
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,550
do
in uh in retrospect it might not have

222
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
in uh in retrospect it might not have
 

223
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,229
in uh in retrospect it might not have
been externally quite so obvious but it

224
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
been externally quite so obvious but it
 

225
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,149
been externally quite so obvious but it
was obvious to me at the time given the

226
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
was obvious to me at the time given the
 

227
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,390
was obvious to me at the time given the
path that i happened to have been on so

228
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
path that i happened to have been on so
 

229
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,589
path that i happened to have been on so
you know so that got me into this

230
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
you know so that got me into this
 

231
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,550
you know so that got me into this
question of let's use programs to model

232
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
question of let's use programs to model
 

233
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,229
question of let's use programs to model
what happens in nature

234
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
what happens in nature
 

235
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,990
what happens in nature
and the question then is well what kind

236
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
and the question then is well what kind
 

237
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,470
and the question then is well what kind
of programs and you know we're used to

238
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
of programs and you know we're used to
 

239
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,149
of programs and you know we're used to
programs that you write for some

240
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
programs that you write for some
 

241
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,750
programs that you write for some
particular purpose it's a big long piece

242
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
particular purpose it's a big long piece
 

243
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,990
particular purpose it's a big long piece
of code and it does some specific thing

244
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
of code and it does some specific thing
 

245
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,629
of code and it does some specific thing
but what i got interested in was okay if

246
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
but what i got interested in was okay if
 

247
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,390
but what i got interested in was okay if
you just go out into the sort of

248
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
you just go out into the sort of
 

249
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,830
you just go out into the sort of
computational universe of possible

250
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
computational universe of possible
 

251
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,350
computational universe of possible
programs you say

252
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
programs you say
 

253
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,710
programs you say
take the simplest program you can

254
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
take the simplest program you can
 

255
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,629
take the simplest program you can
imagine what does it do

256
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
imagine what does it do
 

257
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,790
imagine what does it do
and so i started studying these things

258
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
and so i started studying these things
 

259
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950
and so i started studying these things
called cellular automata um actually i

260
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
called cellular automata um actually i
 

261
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,070
called cellular automata um actually i
didn't know at first they were called

262
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
didn't know at first they were called
 

263
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,390
didn't know at first they were called
cellular automata but i found that out

264
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
cellular automata but i found that out
 

265
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,230
cellular automata but i found that out
subsequently but it's just a line of

266
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
subsequently but it's just a line of
 

267
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,670
subsequently but it's just a line of
cells you know each one is black or

268
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
cells you know each one is black or
 

269
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,070
cells you know each one is black or
white and it's just some rule that says

270
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
white and it's just some rule that says
 

271
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,150
white and it's just some rule that says
the color of the cell is determined by

272
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
the color of the cell is determined by
 

273
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,350
the color of the cell is determined by
the color that it had on the previous

274
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
the color that it had on the previous
 

275
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,790
the color that it had on the previous
step and it's two neighbors on the

276
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
step and it's two neighbors on the
 

277
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,350
step and it's two neighbors on the
previous step and i had initially

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
previous step and i had initially
 

279
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,550
previous step and i had initially
thought

280
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
thought
 

281
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,629
thought
that's you know sufficiently simple

282
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
that's you know sufficiently simple
 

283
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,469
that's you know sufficiently simple

behavior okay but then i actually ran

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
behavior okay but then i actually ran
 

291
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,550
behavior okay but then i actually ran
the computer experiment which was pretty

292
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
the computer experiment which was pretty
 

293
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,710
the computer experiment which was pretty
easy to do um i mean it probably took a

294
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
easy to do um i mean it probably took a
 

295
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,790
easy to do um i mean it probably took a
few hours um originally and um the and

296
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
few hours um originally and um the and
 

297
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,870
few hours um originally and um the and
the results were not what i'd expected

298
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
the results were not what i'd expected
 

299
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,790
the results were not what i'd expected
at all now needless to say in the way

300
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
at all now needless to say in the way
 

301
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,350
at all now needless to say in the way
that science actually works the results

302
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
that science actually works the results
 

303
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,110
that science actually works the results
that i got a lot of unexpected things

304
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
that i got a lot of unexpected things
 

305
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,710
that i got a lot of unexpected things
which i thought were really interesting

306
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
which i thought were really interesting
 

307
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,870
which i thought were really interesting
but the really strongest results which

308
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
but the really strongest results which
 

309
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,469
but the really strongest results which
was already right there in the printouts

310
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
was already right there in the printouts
 

311
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,310
was already right there in the printouts
i made i didn't really understand for a

312
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
i made i didn't really understand for a
 

313
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,590
i made i didn't really understand for a
couple more years

314
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
couple more years
 

315
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,590
couple more years
so it was it was not you know the

316
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
so it was it was not you know the
 

317
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,990
so it was it was not you know the
compressed version of the story is

318
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
compressed version of the story is
 

319
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,270
compressed version of the story is
you run the experiment and you

320
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
you run the experiment and you
 

321
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,430
you run the experiment and you
immediately see what's going on but i

322
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
immediately see what's going on but i
 

323
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,270
immediately see what's going on but i
wasn't smart enough to to do that so to

324
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
wasn't smart enough to to do that so to
 

325
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,150
wasn't smart enough to to do that so to
speak

326
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160

but the big the big thing is

328
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
but the big the big thing is
 

329
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,950
but the big the big thing is
even with very simple rules of that type

330
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
even with very simple rules of that type
 

331
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,550
even with very simple rules of that type
sort of the minimal

332
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
sort of the minimal
 

333
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,110
sort of the minimal
tiniest program sort of the the the one

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
tiniest program sort of the the the one

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
line program or something it's possible
 

337
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,590
line program or something it's possible
to get very complicated behavior my

338
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
to get very complicated behavior my
 

339
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,029
to get very complicated behavior my
favorite example is this thing called

340
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
favorite example is this thing called
 

341
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,350
favorite example is this thing called
rule 30 which is a particular cellular

342
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
rule 30 which is a particular cellular
 

343
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,870
rule 30 which is a particular cellular
automaton rule you just started off from

344
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
automaton rule you just started off from
 

345
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,350
automaton rule you just started off from
one black cell and it makes this really

346
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
one black cell and it makes this really
 

347
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,870
one black cell and it makes this really
complicated pattern

348
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
complicated pattern
 

349
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,749
complicated pattern
and so that for me was sort of a

350
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
and so that for me was sort of a
 

351
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,670
and so that for me was sort of a
critical discovery

352
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
critical discovery
 

353
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,430
critical discovery
that then kind of said playing back onto

354
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
that then kind of said playing back onto
 

355
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,909
that then kind of said playing back onto
you know how does nature make complexity

356
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
you know how does nature make complexity
 

357
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,990
you know how does nature make complexity
i sort of realized that might be how it

358
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
i sort of realized that might be how it
 

359
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
i sort of realized that might be how it
does it that might be kind of the secret

360
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
does it that might be kind of the secret
 

361
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,950
does it that might be kind of the secret
that it's using

362
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
that it's using
 

363
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,390
that it's using
is that in this kind of computational

364
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
is that in this kind of computational
 

365
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,390
is that in this kind of computational
universe of possible programs

366
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
universe of possible programs
 

367
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,990
universe of possible programs
it's actually pretty easy to get

368
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
it's actually pretty easy to get
 

369
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,510
it's actually pretty easy to get
programs where even though the program

370
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
programs where even though the program
 

371
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,510
programs where even though the program
is simple the behavior when you run the

372
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
is simple the behavior when you run the
 

373
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,350
is simple the behavior when you run the
program is not simple at all

374
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
program is not simple at all
 

375
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,909
program is not simple at all
and that was so for me that was the the

376
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
and that was so for me that was the the
 

377
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,110
and that was so for me that was the the
kind of the the story of kind of how

378
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
kind of the the story of kind of how
 

379
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,110
kind of the the story of kind of how
that that was sort of the the indication

380
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
that that was sort of the the indication
 

381
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,629
that that was sort of the the indication
that one had got an idea of what the

382
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
that one had got an idea of what the
 

383
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,110
that one had got an idea of what the
sort of secret that nature uses to make

384
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
sort of secret that nature uses to make
 

385
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,029
sort of secret that nature uses to make
complexity and that complexity how

386
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
complexity and that complexity how
 

387
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,510
complexity and that complexity how
complexity can be made in other places

388
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
complexity can be made in other places
 

389
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,150
complexity can be made in other places
now if you say what is complexity you

390
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
now if you say what is complexity you
 

391
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,150
now if you say what is complexity you
know it's it's

392
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
know it's it's
 

393
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,710
know it's it's
complexity is it's not easy to tell

394
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
complexity is it's not easy to tell
 

395
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,029
complexity is it's not easy to tell
what's going on that's the informal

396
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
what's going on that's the informal
 

397
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,670
what's going on that's the informal
version of what is complexity but there

398
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
version of what is complexity but there
 

399
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,830
version of what is complexity but there
is something going on but there's a rule

400
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
is something going on but there's a rule
 

401
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,469
is something going on but there's a rule
to know what right well no the rules can

402
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
to know what right well no the rules can
 

403
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,589
to know what right well no the rules can
generate just randomness

404
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
generate just randomness
 

405
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,749
generate just randomness
well that that's not obvious

406
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
well that that's not obvious
 

407
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,430
well that that's not obvious
in other words that's not how it is not

408
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
in other words that's not how it is not
 

409
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,189
in other words that's not how it is not
obvious at all and it wasn't what i

410
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
obvious at all and it wasn't what i
 

411
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,870
obvious at all and it wasn't what i
expected it's not what people's

know for a long time that is one might

416
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
know for a long time that is one might
 

417
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,430
know for a long time that is one might
think you have a rule

418
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
think you have a rule
 

419
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,870
think you have a rule
you can tell

420
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
you can tell
 

421
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,309
you can tell
there's a rule behind it i mean it's

422
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
there's a rule behind it i mean it's
 

423
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,029
there's a rule behind it i mean it's
just like you know the early you know

424
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
just like you know the early you know
 

425
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,350
just like you know the early you know
robots and science fiction movies right

426
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
robots and science fiction movies right
 

427
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,749
robots and science fiction movies right
you can tell it's a robot because it

428
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
you can tell it's a robot because it
 

429
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,350
you can tell it's a robot because it
does simple things

430
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
does simple things
 

431
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,270
does simple things
right turns out that isn't actually the

432
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
right turns out that isn't actually the
 

433
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,390
right turns out that isn't actually the
right story

434
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
right story
 

435
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,749
right story
but it's not obvious that isn't the

436
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
but it's not obvious that isn't the
 

437
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,670
but it's not obvious that isn't the
right story because people assume simple

438
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
right story because people assume simple
 

439
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,430
right story because people assume simple
rules simple behavior

sort of the the what is complexity is
well you can't easily tell what it's

456
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
well you can't easily tell what it's
 

457
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,550
well you can't easily tell what it's
going to do you could just run the rule

00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
going to do you could just run the rule
 

459
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,629
going to do you could just run the rule
and see what happens but you can't just

460
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
and see what happens but you can't just
 

461
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,589
and see what happens but you can't just
say oh you know show me the rule great

462
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
say oh you know show me the rule great
 

463
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,270
say oh you know show me the rule great

irreducibility this fact that in
something like rule 30 you might say

472
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
something like rule 30 you might say
 

473
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,830
something like rule 30 you might say
well what's it going to do after a

474
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
well what's it going to do after a
 

475
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,110
well what's it going to do after a
million steps

476
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
million steps
 

477
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,270
million steps
well you can run it for a million steps

478
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
well you can run it for a million steps
 

479
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,749
well you can run it for a million steps
and just do what it does to find out

but you can't compress that you can't

but you can't compress that you can't
 

483
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,510
but you can't compress that you can't
reduce that and say i'm going to be able

484
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
reduce that and say i'm going to be able
 

485
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,430
reduce that and say i'm going to be able

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,389
anybody succeeded at that you had a

a number of people have sent things in

502
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
a number of people have sent things in
 

503
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,350
a number of people have sent things in
and and sort of people are picking away

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
and and sort of people are picking away
 

505
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,070
and and sort of people are picking away
at it but it's hard i mean it's it's uh

506
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
at it but it's hard i mean it's it's uh
 

507
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,190
at it but it's hard i mean it's it's uh
i've been i've been actually uh even

that's something i think might be doable

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
that's something i think might be doable
 

515
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,710
that's something i think might be doable
okay mathematically proving yes and so

516
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
okay mathematically proving yes and so
 

517
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,550
okay mathematically proving yes and so
that's analogous to

518
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
that's analogous to
 

519
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,310
that's analogous to
a similar kind of things like the digits

520
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
a similar kind of things like the digits
 

521
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,310
a similar kind of things like the digits
of pi which are also generated in this

522
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
of pi which are also generated in this
 

523
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,990
of pi which are also generated in this
very deterministic way

524
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
very deterministic way
 

525
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,070
very deterministic way
and so a question is how random are the

526
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
and so a question is how random are the
 

527
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,550
and so a question is how random are the
digits of pi for example does every

528
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
digits of pi for example does every
 

529
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,150
digits of pi for example does every
first of all do the digits of pi ever

530
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
first of all do the digits of pi ever
 

531
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,070
first of all do the digits of pi ever
repeat or we know they don't because it

532
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
repeat or we know they don't because it
 

533
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,550
repeat or we know they don't because it
was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a

534
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a
 

535
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,030
was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a
rational number so that means only

536
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
rational number so that means only
 

537
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,550
rational number so that means only
rational numbers have digit sequences

538
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
rational numbers have digit sequences
 

539
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,550
rational numbers have digit sequences
that repeat so we know the digits of pi

540
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
that repeat so we know the digits of pi
 

541
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,110
that repeat so we know the digits of pi
don't repeat so now the question is does

542
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
don't repeat so now the question is does
 

543
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,750
don't repeat so now the question is does
you know 0 1 2 3 or whatever do all the

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
you know 0 1 2 3 or whatever do all the

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
work it out do they all occur with equal
 

549
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,630
work it out do they all occur with equal
frequency

550

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,870
be useful other places
but you started in 1980 with this idea

596
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
but you started in 1980 with this idea
 

597
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,829
but you started in 1980 with this idea
before i think you realized

598
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
before i think you realized
 

599
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,389
before i think you realized
you know this idea of programs

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
you know this idea of programs

kind of thermodynamic like randomness
 

605
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,269
kind of thermodynamic like randomness

619
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,750

how do we know that's not actually

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
how do we know that's not actually
 

621
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,710
how do we know that's not actually
what's happening so just because you

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
what's happening so just because you
 

623
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,030
what's happening so just because you
were then able to develop

624
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
were then able to develop
 

625
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,150

look you don't need this like incredible

626
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
look you don't need this like incredible
 

627
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,470
look you don't need this like incredible
randomness you can just have very simple

it's uh filtering randomness and the
 

639
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,269
it's uh filtering randomness and the
inputs well the point is

640
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
inputs well the point is
 

641
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,430
inputs well the point is
when you have quotes randomised in the

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
when you have quotes randomised in the
 

643
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,030
when you have quotes randomised in the
input that means there's all kinds of

645
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,870

646
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
information in the input yeah and in a
 

647
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,590
information in the input yeah and in a
sense what you get out will be maybe

648
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
sense what you get out will be maybe
 

649
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,990
sense what you get out will be maybe
just something close to what you put in

650
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
just something close to what you put in
 

651
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,150
just something close to what you put in
like people are very in dynamical

652

systems theory sort of big area

654
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
systems theory sort of big area

mathematics that developed

656
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
mathematics that developed
 

657
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,150
mathematics that developed
from the early 1900s and and really got

658
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
from the early 1900s and and really got
 

659
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,870
from the early 1900s and and really got
big in the 1980s you know an example of

660
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
big in the 1980s you know an example of
 

661
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,790
big in the 1980s you know an example of
what people study there a lot and it's

662
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
what people study there a lot and it's
 

663
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,910
what people study there a lot and it's
popular version is chaos theory um an

664
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
popular version is chaos theory um an
 

665
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,310
popular version is chaos theory um an
example what people study a lot is the

666
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
example what people study a lot is the
 

667
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,990
example what people study a lot is the
shift map which is basically taking 2x

668
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
shift map which is basically taking 2x
 

669
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,389
shift map which is basically taking 2x
mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x which

670
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x which
 

671
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,310
mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x which
is basically just taking digits in

672
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
is basically just taking digits in
 

673
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,870
is basically just taking digits in
binary and shifting them to the left so

674
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
binary and shifting them to the left so
 

675
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,269
binary and shifting them to the left so
at every step you get to see if you say

676
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
at every step you get to see if you say
 

677
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,430
at every step you get to see if you say
how big is this number that i got out

678
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
how big is this number that i got out
 

679
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,110
how big is this number that i got out
well the most important digit in that

680
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
well the most important digit in that
 

681
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,269
well the most important digit in that
number is whatever ended up at the at

682
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
number is whatever ended up at the at
 

683
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,509
number is whatever ended up at the at
the left-hand end but now if you start

the left-hand end but now if you start
 

685
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,910

off from an arbitrary random number

686
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
off from an arbitrary random number
 

687
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,910
off from an arbitrary random number
which is quotes randomly chosen so all

688
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
which is quotes randomly chosen so all
 

689
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,470
which is quotes randomly chosen so all
its digits are random then when you run

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
fluid mechanics for example if there was
 

705
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,550
fluid mechanics for example if there was
that phenomenon in fluid mechanics then

706
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
that phenomenon in fluid mechanics then
 

707
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,150
that phenomenon in fluid mechanics then
the equations of fluid mechanics can't

708
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
the equations of fluid mechanics can't
 

709
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,069
the equations of fluid mechanics can't
be right because what that would be

710
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
be right because what that would be
 

711
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,310
be right because what that would be
saying is the equations of that that it

saying is the equations of that that it
 

713
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,190
saying is the equations of that that it

at which you're hitting kind of sizes of
 

723
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,110
at which you're hitting kind of sizes of
molecules and things like that so it's

724
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
molecules and things like that so it's
 

725
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,269
molecules and things like that so it's
kind of almost explaining

it's kind of telling you that the you

730
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
it's kind of telling you that the you
 

731
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,710
it's kind of telling you that the you
know fluid dynamics which describes

isn't isn't really right but so you know

736
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
isn't isn't really right but so you know
 

737
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,910
isn't isn't really right but so you know
so this idea that you know there's a

738
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
so this idea that you know there's a
 

739
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,670
so this idea that you know there's a
there's it's a tricky thing because as

740
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
there's it's a tricky thing because as
 

741
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,750
there's it's a tricky thing because as
soon as you put randomness in you have

742
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
soon as you put randomness in you have
 

743
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,310
soon as you put randomness in you have
to know you know what how much of what's

744
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
to know you know what how much of what's
 

745
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,710
to know you know what how much of what's
coming out is what you put in versus how

746
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
coming out is what you put in versus how
 

747
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,990
coming out is what you put in versus how
much is actually something that's being

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
much is actually something that's being
 

749
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,310
much is actually something that's being
generated and what's really nice about

750
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
generated and what's really nice about
 

751
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,670
generated and what's really nice about
these systems where you just have very

752
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
these systems where you just have very
 

753
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,069
these systems where you just have very
simple initial conditions and where you

754
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
simple initial conditions and where you
 

755
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,710
simple initial conditions and where you
get random stuff out or seemingly random

756
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
get random stuff out or seemingly random
 

757
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,710
get random stuff out or seemingly random
stuff out is you don't have that issue

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
conclusively say
 

803
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,509
conclusively say
there's no randomness at the bottom

804
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
there's no randomness at the bottom
 

805
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,590
there's no randomness at the bottom
well it's an interesting question i mean

806
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
well it's an interesting question i mean
 

807
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,470
well it's an interesting question i mean
you know

808
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
you know
 

809
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,790
you know
science natural science is an inductive

810
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
science natural science is an inductive
 

811
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,629
science natural science is an inductive
business right you observe a bunch of

812
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
business right you observe a bunch of
 

813
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,870
business right you observe a bunch of
things and you say can we fit these

814
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
things and you say can we fit these
 

815
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
things and you say can we fit these
together what is our hypothesis for

816
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
together what is our hypothesis for
 

817
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,949
together what is our hypothesis for
what's going on the thing that i think i

818
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
what's going on the thing that i think i
 

819
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,389
what's going on the thing that i think i
can say fairly definitively is at this

820
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
can say fairly definitively is at this
 

821
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,069
can say fairly definitively is at this
point we understand enough about

822
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
point we understand enough about
 

823
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,590
point we understand enough about
fundamental physics

824
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
fundamental physics
 

825
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,710
fundamental physics
that there is if there was sort of an

826
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
that there is if there was sort of an
 

827
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,189
that there is if there was sort of an
extra dice being thrown

828
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
extra dice being thrown
 

829
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,790
extra dice being thrown
it's something that doesn't need to be

830
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
it's something that doesn't need to be
 

831
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,590
it's something that doesn't need to be
there we can get what we see without

832
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
there we can get what we see without
 

833
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,389
there we can get what we see without
that

834
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
that
 

835
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,189
that
now

836
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
now
 

837
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,430
now
you know could you add that in as an

838
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
you know could you add that in as an
 

839
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,189
you know could you add that in as an
extra little featuroid

840
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
extra little featuroid
 

841
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,430
extra little featuroid
um you know without breaking the

842
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
um you know without breaking the
 

843
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,870
um you know without breaking the
universe uh probably but in fact almost

844
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
universe uh probably but in fact almost
 

845
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,509
universe uh probably but in fact almost
certainly yes but is it necessary for

846
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
certainly yes but is it necessary for
 

847
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,030
certainly yes but is it necessary for
understanding the universe no and i

848
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
understanding the universe no and i
 

849
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,350
understanding the universe no and i
think actually from a a more fundamental

850
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
think actually from a a more fundamental
 

851
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,470
think actually from a a more fundamental
point of view

852
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
point of view
 

853
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,350
point of view
it's

854
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
it's
 

855
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,629
it's
it's

856
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
it's
 

857
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,629
it's
i think i might be able to argue so so

858
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
i think i might be able to argue so so
 

859
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,750
i think i might be able to argue so so
one of the things that i've been

860
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
one of the things that i've been
 

861
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,509
one of the things that i've been
interested in have been pretty surprised

862
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
interested in have been pretty surprised
 

863
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,430
interested in have been pretty surprised
that i've had anything sentient to say

864
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
that i've had anything sentient to say
 

865
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,509
that i've had anything sentient to say
about is the question of why does the

866
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
about is the question of why does the
 

867
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,110
about is the question of why does the
universe exist

868
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
universe exist
 

869
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,470
universe exist
i didn't think that was a question that

870
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
i didn't think that was a question that
 

871
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,629
i didn't think that was a question that
i would you know i thought that was a

872
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
i would you know i thought that was a
 

873
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,150
i would you know i thought that was a
far out there metaphysical kind of thing

874
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
far out there metaphysical kind of thing
 

875
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,829
far out there metaphysical kind of thing
uh even the philosophers have stayed

876
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
uh even the philosophers have stayed
 

877
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,110
uh even the philosophers have stayed
away from that question for the most

878
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
away from that question for the most
 

879
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,670
away from that question for the most
part it's so such a kind of

880
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
part it's so such a kind of
 

881
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,389
part it's so such a kind of
you know difficult to address question

882
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
you know difficult to address question
 

883
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,230
you know difficult to address question
but i actually think to my great

884
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
but i actually think to my great
 

885
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,990
but i actually think to my great
surprise that from our physics project

886
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
surprise that from our physics project
 

887
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,910
surprise that from our physics project
and so on that it is possible to

888
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
and so on that it is possible to
 

889
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,389
and so on that it is possible to
actually uh address that question and

890
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
actually uh address that question and
 

891
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,310
actually uh address that question and
explain why the universe exists and i

892
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
explain why the universe exists and i
 

893
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,150
explain why the universe exists and i
kind of have a suspicion i've not

894
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
kind of have a suspicion i've not
 

895
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,749
kind of have a suspicion i've not
thought it through i kind of have a

896
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
thought it through i kind of have a
 

897
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,910
thought it through i kind of have a
suspicion that that explanation will

898
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
suspicion that that explanation will
 

899
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,829
suspicion that that explanation will
eventually show you that

900
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
eventually show you that
 

901
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,230
eventually show you that
in no meaningful sense can there be

902
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
in no meaningful sense can there be
 

903
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,310
in no meaningful sense can there be
randomness underneath the universe that

904
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
randomness underneath the universe that
 

905
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,749
randomness underneath the universe that
is that if there is

906
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
is that if there is
 

907
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,550
is that if there is
it's something that is necessarily

908
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
it's something that is necessarily
 

909
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,870
it's something that is necessarily
irrelevant to our perception of the

910
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
irrelevant to our perception of the
 

911
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,670
irrelevant to our perception of the
universe that is that it could be there

912
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
universe that is that it could be there
 

913
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,150
universe that is that it could be there
but it doesn't matter because in a sense

914
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
but it doesn't matter because in a sense
 

915
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,150
but it doesn't matter because in a sense
we've already you know whatever it would

916
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
we've already you know whatever it would
 

917
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,030
we've already you know whatever it would
do whatever extra thing it would add is

918
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
do whatever extra thing it would add is
 

919
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,550
do whatever extra thing it would add is
not relevant to our perception of what's

920
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
not relevant to our perception of what's
 

921
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,790
not relevant to our perception of what's
going on so why

922
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
going on so why
 

923
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,590
going on so why
does the universe exist how does uh the

924
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
does the universe exist how does uh the
 

925
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,269
does the universe exist how does uh the
irrelevance of randomness connect to uh

926
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
irrelevance of randomness connect to uh
 

927
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,910
irrelevance of randomness connect to uh
the big why question of silver so okay

928
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
the big why question of silver so okay
 

929
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,069
the big why question of silver so okay
so i mean why does the universe exist

930
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
so i mean why does the universe exist
 

931
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,389
so i mean why does the universe exist
well let's see and uh is this the only

932
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
well let's see and uh is this the only
 

933
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,949
well let's see and uh is this the only
universe we got it's the only one

934
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
universe we got it's the only one
 

935
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,269
universe we got it's the only one
that about that i'm pretty sure so now

936
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
that about that i'm pretty sure so now
 

937
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,949
that about that i'm pretty sure so now
you may be which one

938
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
you may be which one
 

939
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,189
you may be which one
which of these topics is better to enter

940
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
which of these topics is better to enter
 

941
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,110
which of these topics is better to enter
first why does the universe exist and uh

942
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
first why does the universe exist and uh
 

943
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,790
first why does the universe exist and uh
why you think it's the only one that

944
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
why you think it's the only one that
 

945
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,710
why you think it's the only one that
exists well i think they're very closely

946
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
exists well i think they're very closely
 

947
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,389
exists well i think they're very closely
related okay okay

948
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
related okay okay
 

949
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,629
related okay okay
so i mean the first thing

950
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
so i mean the first thing
 

951
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,910
so i mean the first thing
let's see i mean this why does the

952
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
let's see i mean this why does the
 

953
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,670
let's see i mean this why does the
universe exist question

954
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
universe exist question
 

955
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,389
universe exist question
is built on top of all these things that

956
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
is built on top of all these things that
 

957
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,670
is built on top of all these things that
we've been figuring out about

958
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
we've been figuring out about
 

959
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,189
we've been figuring out about
fundamental physics

960
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
fundamental physics
 

961
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,470
fundamental physics
because if you want to know why the

962
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
because if you want to know why the
 

963
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,829
because if you want to know why the
universe exists you kind of have to know

964
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
universe exists you kind of have to know
 

965
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,509
universe exists you kind of have to know
what the universe is made of

966
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
what the universe is made of
 

967
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,310
what the universe is made of
and

968
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
and
 

969
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,590
and
i think the um well let me let me uh

970
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
i think the um well let me let me uh
 

971
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,350
i think the um well let me let me uh
describe a little bit about

972
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
describe a little bit about
 

973
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,110
describe a little bit about
the why does the universe exist question

974
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
the why does the universe exist question
 

975
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,110
the why does the universe exist question
so the main issue is let's say you have

976
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
so the main issue is let's say you have
 

977
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,870
so the main issue is let's say you have
a model for the universe

978
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
a model for the universe
 

979
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,189
a model for the universe
and you say i've got this this program

980
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
and you say i've got this this program
 

981
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,710
and you say i've got this this program
or something and you run it and you make

982
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
or something and you run it and you make
 

983
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,829
or something and you run it and you make
the universe

984
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
the universe
 

985
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,669
the universe
now you say well how do you actually why

986
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
now you say well how do you actually why
 

987
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,669
now you say well how do you actually why
is that program actually running and

988
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
is that program actually running and
 

989
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,510
is that program actually running and
people say you've got this program that

990
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
people say you've got this program that
 

991
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,949
people say you've got this program that
makes the universe what computer is it

992
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
makes the universe what computer is it
 

993
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,069
makes the universe what computer is it
running on

994
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
running on
 

995
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,230
running on
right what what does it mean what

996
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
right what what does it mean what
 

997
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,069
right what what does it mean what
actualizes something you know two plus

998
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
actualizes something you know two plus
 

999
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,990
actualizes something you know two plus
two equals four but that's different

1000
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
two equals four but that's different
 

1001
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,830
two equals four but that's different
from saying there's two a pile of two

1002
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
from saying there's two a pile of two
 

1003
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,430
from saying there's two a pile of two
rocks another pile of two rocks and so

1004
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
rocks another pile of two rocks and so
 

1005
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,510
rocks another pile of two rocks and so
many moves them together and makes four

1006
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
many moves them together and makes four
 

1007
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,390
many moves them together and makes four
so to speak and so what is it that kind

1008
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
so to speak and so what is it that kind
 

1009
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,789
so to speak and so what is it that kind
of turns it from being just this formal

1010
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
of turns it from being just this formal
 

1011
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,630
of turns it from being just this formal
thing to being something that is

1012
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
thing to being something that is
 

1013
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,990
thing to being something that is
actualized

1014
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
actualized
 

1015
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,470
actualized
okay so there we have to start thinking

1016
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
okay so there we have to start thinking
 

1017
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,029
okay so there we have to start thinking
about well well what do we actually know

1018
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
about well well what do we actually know
 

1019
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,390
about well well what do we actually know
about what's going on in the universe

1020
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
about what's going on in the universe
 

1021
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,430
about what's going on in the universe
well we are observers of this universe

1022
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
well we are observers of this universe
 

1023
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,190
well we are observers of this universe
but confusingly enough we're part of

1024
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
but confusingly enough we're part of
 

1025
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,549
but confusingly enough we're part of
this universe so in a sense we what what

1026
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
this universe so in a sense we what what
 

1027
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,870
this universe so in a sense we what what
what if we say what do we what do we

1028
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
what if we say what do we what do we
 

1029
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,990
what if we say what do we what do we
know about what's going on in the

1030
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
know about what's going on in the
 

1031
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,070
know about what's going on in the
universe well what we know is what sort

1032
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
universe well what we know is what sort
 

1033
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,470
universe well what we know is what sort
of our consciousness records about

1034
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
of our consciousness records about
 

1035
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,230
of our consciousness records about
what's going on in the universe

1036
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
what's going on in the universe
 

1037
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,070
what's going on in the universe
and so consciousness is part of the

1038
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
and so consciousness is part of the
 

1039
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,230
and so consciousness is part of the
fabric of the universe so we're in it

1040
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
fabric of the universe so we're in it
 

1041
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,549
fabric of the universe so we're in it
yes we're in it and and maybe i should

1042
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
yes we're in it and and maybe i should
 

1043
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,150
yes we're in it and and maybe i should
maybe i should start off by saying

1044
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
maybe i should start off by saying
 

1045
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,710
maybe i should start off by saying
something about the consciousness story

1046
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
something about the consciousness story
 

1047
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,510
something about the consciousness story
because that that's um yes

1048
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
because that that's um yes
 

1049
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,270
because that that's um yes
maybe we should begin

1050
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
maybe we should begin
 

1051
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,230
maybe we should begin
even before that at the very base layer

1052
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
even before that at the very base layer
 

1053
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,789
even before that at the very base layer
of the wolfram physics project

1054
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
of the wolfram physics project
 

1055
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,430
of the wolfram physics project
maybe you can give a broad overview once

1056
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
maybe you can give a broad overview once
 

1057
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,549
maybe you can give a broad overview once
again

1058
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
again
 

1059
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,270
again
really quick about this hypergraph model

1060
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
really quick about this hypergraph model
 

1061
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,750
really quick about this hypergraph model
yes and also what is it a year and a

1062
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
yes and also what is it a year and a
 

1063
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,070
yes and also what is it a year and a
half ago since you've brought this

1064
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
half ago since you've brought this
 

1065
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,310
half ago since you've brought this
project to the world what is the status

1066
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
project to the world what is the status
 

1067
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,270
project to the world what is the status
update

1068
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
update
 

1069
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,430
update
where what are all the beautiful ideas

1070
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
where what are all the beautiful ideas
 

1071
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,510
where what are all the beautiful ideas
you have come across

1072
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
you have come across
 

1073
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,029
you have come across
uh what are the interesting things you

1074
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
uh what are the interesting things you
 

1075
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,350
uh what are the interesting things you
can always mention it's i mean it's a

1076
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
can always mention it's i mean it's a
 

1077
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,270
can always mention it's i mean it's a
it's a freaking cambrian explosion i

1078
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
it's a freaking cambrian explosion i
 

1079
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,909
it's a freaking cambrian explosion i
mean it's it's crazy i mean there are

1080
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
mean it's it's crazy i mean there are
 

1081
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,270
mean it's it's crazy i mean there are
all these things which i've kind of

1082
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
all these things which i've kind of
 

1083
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,630
all these things which i've kind of
wondered about for years and suddenly

1084
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
wondered about for years and suddenly
 

1085
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,990
wondered about for years and suddenly
there's actually a way to think about

1086
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
there's actually a way to think about
 

1087
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,870
there's actually a way to think about
them and i really did not see

1088
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
them and i really did not see
 

1089
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,310
them and i really did not see
i mean the real strength of what's

1090
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
i mean the real strength of what's
 

1091
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,310
i mean the real strength of what's
happened i absolutely did not see coming

1092
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
happened i absolutely did not see coming
 

1093
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,470
happened i absolutely did not see coming
and the real strength of it is we've got

1094
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
and the real strength of it is we've got
 

1095
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,310
and the real strength of it is we've got
this model for physics but it turns out

1096
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
this model for physics but it turns out
 

1097
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,549
this model for physics but it turns out
it's a foundational kind of model that's

1098
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
it's a foundational kind of model that's
 

1099
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,549
it's a foundational kind of model that's
a different kind of computation-like

1100
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
a different kind of computation-like
 

1101
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,549
a different kind of computation-like
model that i'm kind of calling the sort

1102
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
model that i'm kind of calling the sort
 

1103
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,110
model that i'm kind of calling the sort
of multi-computational model

1104
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
of multi-computational model
 

1105
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,230
of multi-computational model
and that that kind of model is

1106
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
and that that kind of model is
 

1107
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,070
and that that kind of model is
applicable not only to physics but also

1108
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
applicable not only to physics but also
 

1109
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,070
applicable not only to physics but also
to lots of other kinds of things

1110
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
to lots of other kinds of things
 

1111
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,630
to lots of other kinds of things
and one reason that's extremely powerful

1112
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
and one reason that's extremely powerful
 

1113
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,830
and one reason that's extremely powerful
is because physics has been very

1114
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
is because physics has been very
 

1115
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,390
is because physics has been very
successful so we know a lot based on

1116
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
successful so we know a lot based on
 

1117
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,070
successful so we know a lot based on
what we figured out in physics and if we

1118
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
what we figured out in physics and if we
 

1119
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,950
what we figured out in physics and if we
know that the same model governs physics

1120
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
know that the same model governs physics
 

1121
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,549
know that the same model governs physics

things that we've successfully

1130
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
things that we've successfully
 

1131
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,710
things that we've successfully
discovered in physics and applying those

1132
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
discovered in physics and applying those
 

1133
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,789
discovered in physics and applying those
intuitions in all these other areas and

1134
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
intuitions in all these other areas and
 

1135
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,950
intuitions in all these other areas and
that's that's pretty exciting and and

1136
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
that's that's pretty exciting and and
 

1137
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,190
that's that's pretty exciting and and
very surprising to me um and in fact

1138
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
very surprising to me um and in fact
 

1139
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,430
very surprising to me um and in fact
it's kind of like in the original story

1140
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
it's kind of like in the original story
 

1141
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,310
it's kind of like in the original story
of sort of you go and you explain why is

1142
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
of sort of you go and you explain why is
 

1143
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,789
of sort of you go and you explain why is
there complexity in the natural world

1144
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
there complexity in the natural world
 

1145
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,070
there complexity in the natural world
then you realize well there's all this

1146
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
then you realize well there's all this
 

1147
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,190
then you realize well there's all this
complexity there's all this

1148
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
complexity there's all this
 

1149
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,270
complexity there's all this
computational irreducibility you know

1150
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
computational irreducibility you know
 

1151
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,110
computational irreducibility you know
there's a lot we can't know about what's

1152
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
there's a lot we can't know about what's
 

1153
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,789
there's a lot we can't know about what's
going to happen it's kind of it's kind

1154
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
going to happen it's kind of it's kind
 

1155
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,390
going to happen it's kind of it's kind
of very confusing thing for people who

1156
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
of very confusing thing for people who
 

1157
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,070
of very confusing thing for people who
say you know science has nailed

1158
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
say you know science has nailed
 

1159
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,350
say you know science has nailed
everything down we're going to you know

1160
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
everything down we're going to you know
 

1161
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,270
everything down we're going to you know
based on science we can know everything

1162
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
based on science we can know everything
 

1163
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,710
based on science we can know everything
well actually there's this computational

1164
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
well actually there's this computational
 

1165
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,789
well actually there's this computational
irreducibility thing right in the middle

1166
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
irreducibility thing right in the middle
 

1167
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,909
irreducibility thing right in the middle
of that

1168
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
of that
 

1169
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,149
of that
thrown up by science so to speak and

1170
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
thrown up by science so to speak and
 

1171
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,350
thrown up by science so to speak and
then the question is well given

1172
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
then the question is well given
 

1173
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,750
then the question is well given
computational irreducibility how can we

1174
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
computational irreducibility how can we
 

1175
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,190
computational irreducibility how can we
actually figure out anything about what

1176
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
actually figure out anything about what
 

1177
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,190
actually figure out anything about what
happens in the world why aren't we

1178
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
happens in the world why aren't we
 

1179
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,789
happens in the world why aren't we
why are we able to predict anything why

1180
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
why are we able to predict anything why
 

1181
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,870
why are we able to predict anything why
are we able to operate in the world and

1182
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
are we able to operate in the world and
 

1183
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,310
are we able to operate in the world and
the answer is that we sort of live in

1184
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
the answer is that we sort of live in
 

1185
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,909
the answer is that we sort of live in
these slices of computational

1186
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
these slices of computational
 

1187
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,789
these slices of computational
reusability that exists in this kind of

1188
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
reusability that exists in this kind of
 

1189
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,110
reusability that exists in this kind of
ocean of computational irreducibility

1190
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
ocean of computational irreducibility
 

1191
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,750
ocean of computational irreducibility
and it turns out that seems that it's a

1192
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
and it turns out that seems that it's a
 

1193
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,430
and it turns out that seems that it's a
very fundamental feature of the kind of

1194
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
very fundamental feature of the kind of
 

1195
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,870
very fundamental feature of the kind of
model that seems to operate in physics

1196
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
model that seems to operate in physics
 

1197
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,029
model that seems to operate in physics
and perhaps in a lot of these other

1198
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
and perhaps in a lot of these other
 

1199
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,190
and perhaps in a lot of these other
areas that there are these particular

1200
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
areas that there are these particular
 

1201
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,750
areas that there are these particular
slices of computational reducibility

1202
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
slices of computational reducibility
 

1203
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,510
slices of computational reducibility
that are relevant to us

1204
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
that are relevant to us
 

1205
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,990
that are relevant to us
and those are the things that both allow

1206
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
and those are the things that both allow
 

1207
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,310
and those are the things that both allow
us to operate in the world and not just

1208
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
us to operate in the world and not just
 

1209
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,350
us to operate in the world and not just
have everything be completely

1210
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,360
have everything be completely
 

1211
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,190
have everything be completely
unpredictable but there are also things

1212
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
unpredictable but there are also things
 

1213
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,590
unpredictable but there are also things
that potentially give us what amount to

1214
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
that potentially give us what amount to
 

1215
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,070
that potentially give us what amount to
sort of physics-like laws in all these

1216
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
sort of physics-like laws in all these
 

1217
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,470
sort of physics-like laws in all these
other areas so that's that's been sort

1218
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
other areas so that's that's been sort
 

1219
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,390
other areas so that's that's been sort
of an exciting thing but but i would say

1220
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
of an exciting thing but but i would say
 

1221
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,630
of an exciting thing but but i would say
that in general for our project it's

1222
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
that in general for our project it's
 

1223
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,549
that in general for our project it's
been going spectacularly well i mean i

1224
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
been going spectacularly well i mean i
 

1225
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,430
been going spectacularly well i mean i
you know i it's very honestly it wasn't

1226
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
you know i it's very honestly it wasn't
 

1227
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,590
you know i it's very honestly it wasn't
something i expected to happen in my

1228
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
something i expected to happen in my
 

1229
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,190
something i expected to happen in my
lifetime i mean it's you know it's

1230
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
lifetime i mean it's you know it's
 

1231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,470
lifetime i mean it's you know it's
something where

1232
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
something where
 

1233
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,870
something where
where it's it's and in fact

1234
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
where it's it's and in fact
 

1235
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,470
where it's it's and in fact
one of the things about it some of the

1236
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
one of the things about it some of the
 

1237
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,630
one of the things about it some of the
things that we've discovered are things

1238
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
things that we've discovered are things
 

1239
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,950
things that we've discovered are things
where i was pretty sure that wasn't how

1240
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
where i was pretty sure that wasn't how
 

1241
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,310
where i was pretty sure that wasn't how
things worked

1242
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
things worked
 

1243
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,029
things worked
and turns out i'm wrong and you know

1244
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
and turns out i'm wrong and you know
 

1245
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,110
and turns out i'm wrong and you know
in a major area in metal mathematics i

1246
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
in a major area in metal mathematics i
 

1247
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,270
in a major area in metal mathematics i
i'd be realizing that i something i've

1248
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
i'd be realizing that i something i've
 

1249
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,270
i'd be realizing that i something i've
long believed we can talk about it

1250
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,280
long believed we can talk about it
 

1251
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,909
long believed we can talk about it
later that that that uh just just really

1252
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
later that that that uh just just really
 

1253
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,110
later that that that uh just just really
isn't right but but i think that um

1254
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
isn't right but but i think that um
 

1255
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,590
isn't right but but i think that um
the um the thing that uh so so what's

1256
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
the um the thing that uh so so what's
 

1257
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,510
the um the thing that uh so so what's
happened with the physics project i mean

1258
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
happened with the physics project i mean
 

1259
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,190
happened with the physics project i mean
you know it's a

1260
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
you know it's a
 

1261
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,710
you know it's a
it can explain a little bit about how

1262
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
it can explain a little bit about how
 

1263
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,870
it can explain a little bit about how
the how the model works but basically we

1264
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
the how the model works but basically we
 

1265
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,789
the how the model works but basically we
can maybe ask you uh the following

1266
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
can maybe ask you uh the following
 

1267
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,390
can maybe ask you uh the following
question so

1268
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
question so
 

1269
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,470
question so
it's easy through words describe how

1270
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
it's easy through words describe how
 

1271
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,230
it's easy through words describe how
cellular automotive works you've

1272
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,240
cellular automotive works you've
 

1273
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,750
cellular automotive works you've
explained this

1274
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
explained this
 

1275
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,510
explained this
and uh it's the fundamental mechanism by

1276
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
and uh it's the fundamental mechanism by
 

1277
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,750
and uh it's the fundamental mechanism by
which you in your book and your kind of

1278
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
which you in your book and your kind of
 

1279
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,990
which you in your book and your kind of
science explored the idea of complexity

1280
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
science explored the idea of complexity
 

1281
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,430
science explored the idea of complexity
and how to do science in this world of

1282
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
and how to do science in this world of
 

1283
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,630
and how to do science in this world of
isla reducible islands and irreducible

1284
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
isla reducible islands and irreducible
 

1285
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,750
isla reducible islands and irreducible
general irreducibility okay so how does

1286
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
general irreducibility okay so how does
 

1287
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,789
general irreducibility okay so how does
the model of hypergraphs differ from

1288
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
the model of hypergraphs differ from
 

1289
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,789
the model of hypergraphs differ from
cellular and how does the idea of

1290
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
cellular and how does the idea of
 

1291
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,470
cellular and how does the idea of
multi-computation

1292
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
multi-computation
 

1293
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,230
multi-computation
differ like maybe that's a way to

1294
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
differ like maybe that's a way to
 

1295
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,029
differ like maybe that's a way to
describe it right we're yeah right this

1296
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
describe it right we're yeah right this
 

1297
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,830
describe it right we're yeah right this
is a you know my life is like all of our

1298
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
is a you know my life is like all of our
 

1299
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,110
is a you know my life is like all of our
lives something of a story of

1300
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
lives something of a story of
 

1301
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,669
lives something of a story of
computational irreducibility yes and you

1302
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
computational irreducibility yes and you
 

1303
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,510
computational irreducibility yes and you
know it's been going for a few years now

1304
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
know it's been going for a few years now
 

1305
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,909
know it's been going for a few years now
so it's always a challenge to kind of

1306
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
so it's always a challenge to kind of
 

1307
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,669
so it's always a challenge to kind of
find these appropriate pockets of

1308
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
find these appropriate pockets of
 

1309
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,350
find these appropriate pockets of
reducibility but let me see what i can

1310
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
reducibility but let me see what i can
 

1311
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,149
reducibility but let me see what i can
do great so so i mean first of all let's

1312
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
do great so so i mean first of all let's
 

1313
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,950
do great so so i mean first of all let's
let's talk about physics first of all

1314
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
let's talk about physics first of all
 

1315
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,390
let's talk about physics first of all
and you know a key observation

1316
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
and you know a key observation
 

1317
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,990
and you know a key observation
that one of the starting point of our

1318
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
that one of the starting point of our
 

1319
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,590
that one of the starting point of our
physics project is

1320
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
physics project is
 

1321
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,390
physics project is
things about what is space what is the

1322
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
things about what is space what is the
 

1323
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,830
things about what is space what is the
universe made of

1324
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
universe made of
 

1325
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,070
universe made of
and you know ever since euclid people

1326
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
and you know ever since euclid people
 

1327
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,669
and you know ever since euclid people
just sort of say space is just this

1328
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
just sort of say space is just this
 

1329
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,350
just sort of say space is just this
thing where you can put things at any

1330
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
thing where you can put things at any
 

1331
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,630
thing where you can put things at any
position you want

1332
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
position you want
 

1333
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,230
position you want
and they're just points and they're just

1334
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
and they're just points and they're just
 

1335
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,310
and they're just points and they're just
geometrical things that you can just

1336
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
geometrical things that you can just
 

1337
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,909
geometrical things that you can just
arbitrarily put at different different

1338
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
arbitrarily put at different different
 

1339
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,950
arbitrarily put at different different
coordinate positions so the first thing

1340
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
coordinate positions so the first thing
 

1341
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,710
coordinate positions so the first thing
in our physics project is the idea that

1342
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
in our physics project is the idea that
 

1343
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,950
in our physics project is the idea that
space is made of something just like

1344
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
space is made of something just like
 

1345
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,029
space is made of something just like
water is made of molecules space is made

1346
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
water is made of molecules space is made
 

1347
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,110
water is made of molecules space is made
of kind of atoms of space

1348
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
of kind of atoms of space
 

1349
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,789
of kind of atoms of space
and the only thing we can say about

1350
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
and the only thing we can say about
 

1351
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,470
and the only thing we can say about
these atoms of space is they have some

1352
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
these atoms of space is they have some
 

1353
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,549
these atoms of space is they have some
identity there's a there's a there is

1354
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
identity there's a there's a there is
 

1355
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,029
identity there's a there's a there is
it's this atom as opposed to this atom

1356
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
it's this atom as opposed to this atom
 

1357
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,230
it's this atom as opposed to this atom
and you know you could give them if

1358
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
and you know you could give them if
 

1359
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,430
and you know you could give them if
you're a computer person you give them

1360
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
you're a computer person you give them
 

1361
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,549
you're a computer person you give them
uuids or something

1362
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
uuids or something
 

1363
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,029
uuids or something
yes and and um but that's all there is

1364
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
yes and and um but that's all there is
 

1365
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,269
yes and and um but that's all there is
to say about them so to speak um and

1366
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
to say about them so to speak um and
 

1367
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,549
to say about them so to speak um and
then

1368
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
then
 

1369
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,990
then
all we know about these atoms of space

1370
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
all we know about these atoms of space
 

1371
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,230
all we know about these atoms of space
is how they relate to each other so we

1372
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
is how they relate to each other so we
 

1373
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,590
is how they relate to each other so we
say these three atoms of space

1374
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
say these three atoms of space
 

1375
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,590
say these three atoms of space
are associated with each other in some

1376
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
are associated with each other in some
 

1377
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,830
are associated with each other in some
relation so you can think about that as

1378
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
relation so you can think about that as
 

1379
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,070
relation so you can think about that as
you know what atom of space is friends

1380
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
you know what atom of space is friends
 

1381
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,230
you know what atom of space is friends
with what other atom of space you can

1382
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
with what other atom of space you can
 

1383
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,070
with what other atom of space you can
build this essentially friend network of

1384
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
build this essentially friend network of
 

1385
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,750
build this essentially friend network of
the atoms of space

1386
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
the atoms of space
 

1387
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,669
the atoms of space
and the sort of starting point of our

1388
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
and the sort of starting point of our
 

1389
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,190
and the sort of starting point of our
physics project is that's what our

1390
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
physics project is that's what our
 

1391
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,669
physics project is that's what our
universe is it's a giant friend network

1392
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
universe is it's a giant friend network
 

1393
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,269
universe is it's a giant friend network
of the atoms of space

1394
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
of the atoms of space
 

1395
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,230
of the atoms of space
and so how can that possibly represent

1396
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
and so how can that possibly represent
 

1397
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,430
and so how can that possibly represent
our universe well it's like in

1398
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
our universe well it's like in
 

1399
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,950
our universe well it's like in
something like water you know they're

1400
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
something like water you know they're
 

1401
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,110
something like water you know they're
molecules bouncing around but on a large

1402
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
molecules bouncing around but on a large
 

1403
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,789
molecules bouncing around but on a large
scale that

1404
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
scale that
 

1405
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,630
scale that
you know that produces fluid flow and we

1406
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
you know that produces fluid flow and we
 

1407
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,310
you know that produces fluid flow and we
have fluid vortices and we have all of

1408
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
have fluid vortices and we have all of
 

1409
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,310
have fluid vortices and we have all of
these phenomena that are sort of the

1410
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
these phenomena that are sort of the
 

1411
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,269
these phenomena that are sort of the
emergent phenomena from that underlying

1412
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
emergent phenomena from that underlying
 

1413
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,029
emergent phenomena from that underlying
uh kind of collection of molecules

1414
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
uh kind of collection of molecules
 

1415
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,710
uh kind of collection of molecules
bouncing around and by the way it's

1416
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
bouncing around and by the way it's
 

1417
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,750
bouncing around and by the way it's
important that that collection of

1418
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
important that that collection of
 

1419
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,430
important that that collection of
molecules bouncing around

1420
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
molecules bouncing around
 

1421
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,950
molecules bouncing around
have this phenomenon of computational

1422
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
have this phenomenon of computational
 

1423
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,710
have this phenomenon of computational
irreducibility that's actually what

1424
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
irreducibility that's actually what
 

1425
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,590
irreducibility that's actually what
leads to the second law of

1426
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
leads to the second law of
 

1427
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,590
leads to the second law of
thermodynamics among other things

1428
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
thermodynamics among other things
 

1429
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,149
thermodynamics among other things
and that leads to the sort of randomness

1430
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
and that leads to the sort of randomness
 

1431
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,470
and that leads to the sort of randomness
of the underlying behavior which is what

1432
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
of the underlying behavior which is what
 

1433
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,230
of the underlying behavior which is what
gives you something which on a large

1434
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
gives you something which on a large
 

1435
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,470
gives you something which on a large
scale seems like it's a smooth

1436
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
scale seems like it's a smooth
 

1437
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,909
scale seems like it's a smooth
continuous

1438
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
continuous
 

1439
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,310
continuous
type of thing and so so okay so first

1440
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
type of thing and so so okay so first
 

1441
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,269
type of thing and so so okay so first
thing is space is made of something it's

1442
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
thing is space is made of something it's
 

1443
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,269
thing is space is made of something it's
made of all these atoms of space

1444
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
made of all these atoms of space
 

1445
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,350
made of all these atoms of space
connected together in this network and

1446
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
connected together in this network and
 

1447
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,630
connected together in this network and
then everything that we experience

1448
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
then everything that we experience
 

1449
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,710
then everything that we experience
is sort of features of the of that

1450
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
is sort of features of the of that
 

1451
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,230
is sort of features of the of that
structure of space so you know when we

1452
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
structure of space so you know when we
 

1453
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,590
structure of space so you know when we
have an electron or something or a

1454
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
have an electron or something or a
 

1455
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,390
have an electron or something or a
photon it's some kind of tangle in the

1456
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
photon it's some kind of tangle in the
 

1457
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,070
photon it's some kind of tangle in the
structure of space much like kind of a

1458
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
structure of space much like kind of a
 

1459
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,390
structure of space much like kind of a
vortex and a fluid would be just this

1460
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
vortex and a fluid would be just this
 

1461
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,549
vortex and a fluid would be just this
thing that is you know it it can

1462
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
thing that is you know it it can
 

1463
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,390
thing that is you know it it can
actually the vortex can move around it

1464
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
actually the vortex can move around it
 

1465
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,149
actually the vortex can move around it
can involve different molecules in the

1466
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
can involve different molecules in the
 

1467
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,710
can involve different molecules in the
fluid but the vortex still stays there

1468
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
fluid but the vortex still stays there
 

1469
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,710
fluid but the vortex still stays there
and if you zoom out enough the vortex

1470
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
and if you zoom out enough the vortex
 

1471
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,870
and if you zoom out enough the vortex
looks like an atom itself like a basic

1472
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
looks like an atom itself like a basic
 

1473
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,630
looks like an atom itself like a basic
element yes so there's the levels of

1474
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
element yes so there's the levels of
 

1475
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,070
element yes so there's the levels of
abstraction

1476
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
abstraction
 

1477
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,430
abstraction
if you squint and kind of blur things

1478
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
if you squint and kind of blur things
 

1479
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,669
if you squint and kind of blur things
out it looks like at every level of

1480
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
out it looks like at every level of
 

1481
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,669
out it looks like at every level of
abstraction you can define what is a

1482
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
abstraction you can define what is a
 

1483
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,789
abstraction you can define what is a
basic

1484
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
basic
 

1485
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,950
basic
individual entities yes but but you know

1486
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
individual entities yes but but you know
 

1487
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,789
individual entities yes but but you know
in in this model

1488
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
in in this model
 

1489
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,310
in in this model
there's a bottom level yeah you know

1490
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
there's a bottom level yeah you know
 

1491
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,590
there's a bottom level yeah you know
there's an elementary length maybe

1492
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
there's an elementary length maybe
 

1493
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,390
there's an elementary length maybe
that's

1494
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
that's
 

1495
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,630
that's
100 10 to the minus 100 meters let's say

1496
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
100 10 to the minus 100 meters let's say
 

1497
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,230
100 10 to the minus 100 meters let's say
which is really small you know proton is

1498
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
which is really small you know proton is
 

1499
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,710
which is really small you know proton is
10 to the minus 15 meters the smallest

1500
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
10 to the minus 15 meters the smallest
 

1501
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,430
10 to the minus 15 meters the smallest
we've ever been able to sort of see

1502
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
we've ever been able to sort of see
 

1503
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,870
we've ever been able to sort of see
where the particle accelerator is around

1504
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
where the particle accelerator is around
 

1505
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,390
where the particle accelerator is around
10 to the minus 21 meters so you know if

1506
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
10 to the minus 21 meters so you know if
 

1507
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,230
10 to the minus 21 meters so you know if
we don't know precisely what the correct

1508
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
we don't know precisely what the correct
 

1509
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,070
we don't know precisely what the correct
scale is but it's perhaps over the order

1510
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
scale is but it's perhaps over the order
 

1511
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,590
scale is but it's perhaps over the order
of 10 to the minus 100 meters so it's

1512
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
of 10 to the minus 100 meters so it's
 

1513
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,230
of 10 to the minus 100 meters so it's
pretty small um and but but that's

1514
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
pretty small um and but but that's
 

1515
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,390
pretty small um and but but that's
that's the end that's that's what things

1516
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
that's the end that's that's what things
 

1517
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,149
that's the end that's that's what things
are made of what's your intuition where

1518
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
are made of what's your intuition where
 

1519
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,029
are made of what's your intuition where
the 10 to the minus 100 comes from

1520
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
the 10 to the minus 100 comes from
 

1521
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,350
the 10 to the minus 100 comes from
what's your intuition about this scale

1522
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
what's your intuition about this scale
 

1523
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,269
what's your intuition about this scale
well okay so there's a calculation which

1524
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
well okay so there's a calculation which
 

1525
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,830
well okay so there's a calculation which
i consider to be somewhat rickety okay

1526
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
i consider to be somewhat rickety okay
 

1527
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,350
i consider to be somewhat rickety okay
which has to do with comparing so so

1528
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
which has to do with comparing so so
 

1529
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,789
which has to do with comparing so so
there are various fundamental constants

1530
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
there are various fundamental constants
 

1531
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,549
there are various fundamental constants
there's the speed of light the speed of

1532
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
there's the speed of light the speed of
 

1533
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,950
there's the speed of light the speed of
light once you know the elementary time

1534
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
light once you know the elementary time
 

1535
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,110
light once you know the elementary time
the speed of light is tells you the

1536
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
the speed of light is tells you the
 

1537
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,549
the speed of light is tells you the
conversion from the elementary time to

1538
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
conversion from the elementary time to
 

1539
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,710
conversion from the elementary time to
the elementary length then there's the

1540
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
the elementary length then there's the
 

1541
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,310
the elementary length then there's the
question of how do you convert to the

1542
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
question of how do you convert to the
 

1543
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,029
question of how do you convert to the
elementary energy and how do you convert

1544
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,039
elementary energy and how do you convert
 

1545
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,350
elementary energy and how do you convert
to between other things and the various

1546
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
to between other things and the various
 

1547
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,789
to between other things and the various
constants we know we know the speed of

1548
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
constants we know we know the speed of
 

1549
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,350
constants we know we know the speed of
light we know the gravitational constant

1550
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,360
light we know the gravitational constant
 

1551
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,870
light we know the gravitational constant
we know planck's constant and quantum

1552
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
we know planck's constant and quantum
 

1553
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,789
we know planck's constant and quantum
mechanics those are the three important

1554
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
mechanics those are the three important
 

1555
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,269
mechanics those are the three important
ones and we actually know some other

1556
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
ones and we actually know some other
 

1557
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,630
ones and we actually know some other
things we know things like the size of

1558
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
things we know things like the size of
 

1559
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,950
things we know things like the size of
the universe the hubble constant things

1560
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
the universe the hubble constant things
 

1561
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,990
the universe the hubble constant things
like that

1562
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
like that
 

1563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,470
like that
and essentially this calculation of the

1564
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
and essentially this calculation of the
 

1565
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,750
and essentially this calculation of the
elementary length comes from looking at

1566
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
elementary length comes from looking at
 

1567
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,590
elementary length comes from looking at
these sort of combination of those okay

1568
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
these sort of combination of those okay
 

1569
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,430
these sort of combination of those okay
so the most obvious thing people have

1570
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
so the most obvious thing people have
 

1571
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,510
so the most obvious thing people have
sort of assumed that quantum gravity

1572
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,520
sort of assumed that quantum gravity
 

1573
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,110
sort of assumed that quantum gravity
happens at this thing the planck scale

1574
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
happens at this thing the planck scale
 

1575
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,149
happens at this thing the planck scale
10 minus 34 meters which is the sort of

1576
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
10 minus 34 meters which is the sort of
 

1577
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,470
10 minus 34 meters which is the sort of
the the combination of planck's constant

1578
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
the the combination of planck's constant
 

1579
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,830
the the combination of planck's constant
and the gravitational constant the speed

1580
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
and the gravitational constant the speed
 

1581
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,830
and the gravitational constant the speed
of light that gives you that kind of

1582
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
of light that gives you that kind of
 

1583
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,350
of light that gives you that kind of
length

1584
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
length
 

1585
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,669
length
turns out in our model there is an

1586
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
turns out in our model there is an
 

1587
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,750
turns out in our model there is an
additional parameter which is

1588
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
additional parameter which is
 

1589
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,830
additional parameter which is
essentially the number of simultaneous

1590
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
essentially the number of simultaneous
 

1591
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,990
essentially the number of simultaneous
threads of execution of the universe

1592
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
threads of execution of the universe
 

1593
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,190
threads of execution of the universe
which is essentially the number of sort

1594
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
which is essentially the number of sort
 

1595
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,149
which is essentially the number of sort
of independent quantum uh processes that

1596
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
of independent quantum uh processes that
 

1597
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,389
of independent quantum uh processes that
are going on and that number let's see

1598
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
are going on and that number let's see
 

1599
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,070
are going on and that number let's see
if i remember that number that number is

1600
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
if i remember that number that number is
 

1601
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,190
if i remember that number that number is
10 to 170 i think and and so it's a big

1602
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
10 to 170 i think and and so it's a big
 

1603
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,990
10 to 170 i think and and so it's a big
number but um that number

1604
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
number but um that number
 

1605
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,269
number but um that number
then connects you know sort of modifies

1635
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,269
um but the planck energy is like uh is
like the the energy of a of a lightning

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
and uh presumably the
 

1749
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,110
and uh presumably the
the the detailed accurate detection of

1750
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
the the detailed accurate detection of
 

1751
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,029
the the detailed accurate detection of
gravitational waves from since black

1752
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
gravitational waves from since black
 

1753
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,590
gravitational waves from since black
holes can reveal the discreteness of

1754
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
holes can reveal the discreteness of
 

1755
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,789
holes can reveal the discreteness of
space

1756
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:42,799
space
 

1757
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,870
space
okay first thing is what is a black hole

1758
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
okay first thing is what is a black hole
 

1759
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,470
okay first thing is what is a black hole
uh actually we we need to go a little

1760
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
uh actually we we need to go a little
 

1761
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,230
uh actually we we need to go a little
bit further in the story of what space

1762
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
bit further in the story of what space
 

1763
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,350
bit further in the story of what space
time is because i explained a little bit

1764
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
time is because i explained a little bit
 

1765
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,190
time is because i explained a little bit
about what space is but it didn't talk

1766
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
about what space is but it didn't talk
 

1767
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,350
about what space is but it didn't talk
about what time is and that's sort of

1768
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
about what time is and that's sort of
 

1769
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,669
about what time is and that's sort of
important in in understanding space time

1770
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
important in in understanding space time
 

1771
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,990
important in in understanding space time
so to speak and your sense is both space

1772
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
so to speak and your sense is both space
 

1773
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,990
so to speak and your sense is both space
and time in the story are discreet

1774
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
and time in the story are discreet
 

1775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,190
and time in the story are discreet
absolutely

1776
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
absolutely
 

1777
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,430
absolutely
absolutely but it's a complicated story

1778
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
absolutely but it's a complicated story
 

1779
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,750
absolutely but it's a complicated story
yes and um needless to say well it's

1780
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
yes and um needless to say well it's
 

1781
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,269
yes and um needless to say well it's
simple at the bottom

1782
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
simple at the bottom
 

1783
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,590
simple at the bottom
it's it's very simple at the bottom it's

1784
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600
it's it's very simple at the bottom it's
 

1785
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,590
it's it's very simple at the bottom it's
it's very in the end

1786
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
it's very in the end
 

1787
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,630
it's very in the end
it's simple but deeply abstract and um

1788
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
it's simple but deeply abstract and um
 

1789
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,310
it's simple but deeply abstract and um
and something that is

1790
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
and something that is
 

1791
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,950
and something that is
simple in conception but kind of

1792
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
simple in conception but kind of
 

1793
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,389
simple in conception but kind of
wrapping one's head around what's going

1794
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
wrapping one's head around what's going
 

1795
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,630
wrapping one's head around what's going
on is pretty hard

1796
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
on is pretty hard
 

1797
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,509
on is pretty hard
um but so so first of all we have this

1798
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:25,519
um but so so first of all we have this
 

1799
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,110
um but so so first of all we have this
so you know i've described these kind of

1800
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
so you know i've described these kind of
 

1801
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,190
so you know i've described these kind of
atoms of space and their connections you

1802
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
atoms of space and their connections you
 

1803
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,549
atoms of space and their connections you
can think about these things as a

1804
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
can think about these things as a
 

1805
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,630
can think about these things as a
hypergraph you know a graph is just you

1806
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
hypergraph you know a graph is just you
 

1807
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,710
hypergraph you know a graph is just you
connect nodes to nodes but a hypergraph

1808
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
connect nodes to nodes but a hypergraph
 

1809
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,789
connect nodes to nodes but a hypergraph
you can have you know uh you can have

1810
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
you can have you know uh you can have
 

1811
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,870
you can have you know uh you can have
sort of not just friends

1812
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:38,880
sort of not just friends
 

1813
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,310
sort of not just friends
individual friends to friends but you

1814
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
individual friends to friends but you
 

1815
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,710
individual friends to friends but you
can have these triplets of of friends or

1816
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
can have these triplets of of friends or
 

1817
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,269
can have these triplets of of friends or
whatever else it's it's um and so we're

1818
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
whatever else it's it's um and so we're
 

1819
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,710
whatever else it's it's um and so we're
just saying and that's just the

1820
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
just saying and that's just the
 

1821
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,110
just saying and that's just the
relations between atoms of space are the

1822
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
relations between atoms of space are the
 

1823
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,110
relations between atoms of space are the
hyper edges of the hypograph and so

1824
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
hyper edges of the hypograph and so
 

1825
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,029
hyper edges of the hypograph and so
we've got some big collection of of

1826
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
we've got some big collection of of
 

1827
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,950
we've got some big collection of of
these atoms of space maybe 10 to the 400

1828
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
these atoms of space maybe 10 to the 400
 

1829
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,750
these atoms of space maybe 10 to the 400
or something in our in our universe um

1830
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
or something in our in our universe um
 

1831
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,470
or something in our in our universe um
and that's the structure of space that's

1832
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
and that's the structure of space that's
 

1833
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,669
and that's the structure of space that's
and every feature of what we experience

1834
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
and every feature of what we experience
 

1835
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,630
and every feature of what we experience
in the world is a feature of that that

1836
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
in the world is a feature of that that
 

1837
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,950
in the world is a feature of that that
hypergraph that spatial hypograph

1838
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
hypergraph that spatial hypograph
 

1839
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,870
hypergraph that spatial hypograph
so then the question is well how does

1840
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
so then the question is well how does
 

1841
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,950
so then the question is well how does
what does that spatial hypergraph do

1842
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
what does that spatial hypergraph do
 

1843
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,750
what does that spatial hypergraph do
well the idea is that there are rules

1844
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
well the idea is that there are rules
 

1845
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,389
well the idea is that there are rules
that that update that spatial hypograph

1846
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
that that update that spatial hypograph
 

1847
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,830
that that update that spatial hypograph
and you know in a cellular automaton

1848
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
and you know in a cellular automaton
 

1849
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,750
and you know in a cellular automaton
you've just got this line of cells and

1850
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
you've just got this line of cells and
 

1851
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
you've just got this line of cells and
you just say it every step at every time

1852
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
you just say it every step at every time
 

1853
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,909
you just say it every step at every time
step you've got fixed time steps fixed

1854
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:25,919
step you've got fixed time steps fixed
 

1855
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,870
step you've got fixed time steps fixed
array of cells at every step uh every

1856
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
array of cells at every step uh every
 

1857
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,630
array of cells at every step uh every
cell gets updated according to a certain

1858
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640
cell gets updated according to a certain
 

1859
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,430
cell gets updated according to a certain
rule

1860
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
rule
 

1861
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,590
rule
and that's um that's kind of the that's

1862
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
and that's um that's kind of the that's
 

1863
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,669
and that's um that's kind of the that's
the way it works now in this hypograph

1864
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
the way it works now in this hypograph
 

1865
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,990
the way it works now in this hypograph
it's sort of vaguely the same kind of

1866
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
it's sort of vaguely the same kind of
 

1867
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,149
it's sort of vaguely the same kind of
thing we say every time you see a little

1868
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
thing we say every time you see a little
 

1869
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,710
thing we say every time you see a little
piece of hypergraph that looks like this

1870
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
piece of hypergraph that looks like this
 

1871
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,110
piece of hypergraph that looks like this
update it to one that looks like this so

1872
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
update it to one that looks like this so
 

1873
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,350
update it to one that looks like this so
it's just keep rewriting this hypergraph

1874
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
it's just keep rewriting this hypergraph
 

1875
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,789
it's just keep rewriting this hypergraph
every time you see something looks like

1876
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
every time you see something looks like
 

1877
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,029
every time you see something looks like
that anywhere in the universe it gets

1878
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
that anywhere in the universe it gets
 

1879
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,110
that anywhere in the universe it gets
rewritten now one thing that's tricky

1880
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
rewritten now one thing that's tricky
 

1881
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,950
rewritten now one thing that's tricky
about that which we'll come to is this

1882
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
about that which we'll come to is this
 

1883
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,269
about that which we'll come to is this
multi-computational idea which has to do

1884
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
multi-computational idea which has to do
 

1885
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,909
multi-computational idea which has to do
with you're not saying in in some kind

1886
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
with you're not saying in in some kind
 

1887
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,149
with you're not saying in in some kind
of lock-step way do this one then this

1888
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
of lock-step way do this one then this
 

1889
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,230
of lock-step way do this one then this
one then this one it's just whenever you

1890
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
one then this one it's just whenever you
 

1891
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,470
one then this one it's just whenever you
see one you can do you can go ahead and

1892
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
see one you can do you can go ahead and
 

1893
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,870
see one you can do you can go ahead and
do it and that leads one not to have a

1894
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
do it and that leads one not to have a
 

1895
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,190
do it and that leads one not to have a
single thread of time in the universe

1896
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
single thread of time in the universe
 

1897
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,830
single thread of time in the universe
because if you knew which one to do you

1898
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
because if you knew which one to do you
 

1899
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,430
because if you knew which one to do you
just say okay we do this one then we do

1900
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
just say okay we do this one then we do
 

1901
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,110
just say okay we do this one then we do
this one then we do this one but if you

1902
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,120
this one then we do this one but if you
 

1903
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,110
this one then we do this one but if you
say just do whichever one you feel like

1904
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
say just do whichever one you feel like
 

1905
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,710
say just do whichever one you feel like
you end up with these multiple threads

1906
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:20,720
you end up with these multiple threads
 

1907
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,230
you end up with these multiple threads
of time these kind of multiple histories

1908
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
of time these kind of multiple histories
 

1909
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,070
of time these kind of multiple histories
of the universe depending on which order

1910
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
of the universe depending on which order
 

1911
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,389
of the universe depending on which order
you happen to do the things you could do

1912
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
you happen to do the things you could do
 

1913
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,190
you happen to do the things you could do
in

1914
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
in
 

1915
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,950
in
so it's fundamentally asynchronous and

1916
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
so it's fundamentally asynchronous and
 

1917
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,710
so it's fundamentally asynchronous and
parallel yes

1918
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
parallel yes
 

1919
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,710
parallel yes
yes which is very uncomfortable for the

1920
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
yes which is very uncomfortable for the
 

1921
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,190
yes which is very uncomfortable for the
human brain that seeks for things to be

1922
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
human brain that seeks for things to be
 

1923
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,310
human brain that seeks for things to be
sequential

1924
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
sequential
 

1925
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,110
sequential
and synchronous right well i think that

1926
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
and synchronous right well i think that
 

1927
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,350
and synchronous right well i think that
this is this is part of the story of

1928
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
this is this is part of the story of
 

1929
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,549
this is this is part of the story of
consciousness

1930
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
consciousness
 

1931
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,870
consciousness
is i think the key aspect of

1932
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
is i think the key aspect of
 

1933
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,870
is i think the key aspect of
consciousness that is important for sort

1934
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
consciousness that is important for sort
 

1935
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,190
consciousness that is important for sort
of parsing the universe is this point

1936
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
of parsing the universe is this point
 

1937
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,110
of parsing the universe is this point
that we have a single thread of

1938
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120
that we have a single thread of
 

1939
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,190
that we have a single thread of
experience right we have a memory of

1940
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
experience right we have a memory of
 

1941
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,190
experience right we have a memory of
what happened in the past we can say

1942
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
what happened in the past we can say
 

1943
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,389
what happened in the past we can say
something predict something about the

1944
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
something predict something about the
 

1945
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,990
something predict something about the
future but there's a single thread of

1946
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
future but there's a single thread of
 

1947
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,509
future but there's a single thread of
experience and it's not obvious it

1948
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
experience and it's not obvious it
 

1949
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,710
experience and it's not obvious it
should work that way i mean we've got

1950
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
should work that way i mean we've got
 

1951
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,470
should work that way i mean we've got
100 billion neurons in our brains and

1952
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
100 billion neurons in our brains and
 

1953
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,590
100 billion neurons in our brains and
they're all firing in all kinds of

1954
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
they're all firing in all kinds of
 

1955
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,590
they're all firing in all kinds of
different ways but yet our experiences

1956
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
different ways but yet our experiences
 

1957
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,990
different ways but yet our experiences
that there is the single thread of of of

1958
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,000
that there is the single thread of of of
 

1959
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,629
that there is the single thread of of of
time that that goes that that goes along

1960
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
time that that goes that that goes along
 

1961
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,310
time that that goes that that goes along
and i think that you know one of the

1962
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
and i think that you know one of the
 

1963
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,589
and i think that you know one of the
things i've kind of realized with a lot

1964
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
things i've kind of realized with a lot
 

1965
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,430
things i've kind of realized with a lot
more clarity in the last year

1966
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
more clarity in the last year
 

1967
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,470
more clarity in the last year
is the fact that our the fact that we

1968
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
is the fact that our the fact that we
 

1969
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,389
is the fact that our the fact that we
conclude that the universe has the laws

1970
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:22,399
conclude that the universe has the laws
 

1971
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,109
conclude that the universe has the laws
it has is a consequence of the fact that

1972
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
it has is a consequence of the fact that
 

1973
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,869
it has is a consequence of the fact that
we have consciousness the way we have

1974
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879
we have consciousness the way we have
 

1975
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,389
we have consciousness the way we have
consciousness

1976
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
consciousness
 

1977
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,950
consciousness
and so the fact so i mean just to go on

1978
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
and so the fact so i mean just to go on
 

1979
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,669
and so the fact so i mean just to go on
with kind of the the basic setup it's uh

1980
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679
with kind of the the basic setup it's uh
 

1981
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,589
with kind of the the basic setup it's uh
so we've got this spatial hypograph it's

1982
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
so we've got this spatial hypograph it's
 

1983
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,589
so we've got this spatial hypograph it's
got all these atoms of space they're

1984
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599
got all these atoms of space they're
 

1985
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,030
got all these atoms of space they're
getting they're getting these little

1986
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
getting they're getting these little
 

1987
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,389
getting they're getting these little
clumps of atoms of space they're getting

1988
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
clumps of atoms of space they're getting
 

1989
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,669
clumps of atoms of space they're getting
turned into other clumps of atoms of

1990
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
turned into other clumps of atoms of
 

1991
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,790
turned into other clumps of atoms of
space and that's happening everywhere in

1992
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
space and that's happening everywhere in
 

1993
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,950
space and that's happening everywhere in
the universe all the time and so one

1994
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
the universe all the time and so one
 

1995
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,790
the universe all the time and so one
thing it's a little bit weird is there's

1996
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
thing it's a little bit weird is there's
 

1997
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,470
thing it's a little bit weird is there's
nothing permanent in the universe

1998
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
nothing permanent in the universe
 

1999
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,829
nothing permanent in the universe
the universe is getting rewritten

2000
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
the universe is getting rewritten
 

2001
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,669
the universe is getting rewritten
everywhere all the time and if it wasn't

2002
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
everywhere all the time and if it wasn't
 

2003
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,109
everywhere all the time and if it wasn't
getting rewritten it would space

2004
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
getting rewritten it would space
 

2005
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,030
getting rewritten it would space
wouldn't be knitted together that is

2006
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
wouldn't be knitted together that is
 

2007
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,550
wouldn't be knitted together that is
space would just fall apart there

2008
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
space would just fall apart there
 

2009
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,390
space would just fall apart there
wouldn't be any way in which we could

2010
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
wouldn't be any way in which we could
 

2011
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,069
wouldn't be any way in which we could
say this part of space is next to this

2012
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
say this part of space is next to this
 

2013
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,150
say this part of space is next to this
part of space you know one of the things

2014
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
part of space you know one of the things
 

2015
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,670
part of space you know one of the things
that i was

2016
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
that i was
 

2017
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,510
that i was
people were confused about back in

2018
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
people were confused about back in
 

2019
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,589
people were confused about back in
antiquity you know the ancient greek

2020
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
antiquity you know the ancient greek
 

2021
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,109
antiquity you know the ancient greek
philosophers and so on is how does

2022
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119
philosophers and so on is how does
 

2023
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,550
philosophers and so on is how does
motion work

2024
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,560
motion work
 

2025
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,150
motion work
you know how can it be the case that you

2026
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
you know how can it be the case that you
 

2027
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,390
you know how can it be the case that you
can take a thing that we can walk around

2028
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
can take a thing that we can walk around
 

2029
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,550
can take a thing that we can walk around
and it's still us when we walked you

2030
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,560
and it's still us when we walked you
 

2031
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,190
and it's still us when we walked you
know a foot forward so to speak and in a

2032
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
know a foot forward so to speak and in a
 

2033
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,589
know a foot forward so to speak and in a
sense with our models that's again a

2034
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
sense with our models that's again a
 

2035
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,910
sense with our models that's again a
question because it's a different set of

2036
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
question because it's a different set of
 

2037
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,990
question because it's a different set of
atoms of space when we you know when i

2038
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
atoms of space when we you know when i
 

2039
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,390
atoms of space when we you know when i
move my hand it's it's moving into a

2040
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
move my hand it's it's moving into a
 

2041
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,310
move my hand it's it's moving into a
different set of atoms of space it's

2042
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
different set of atoms of space it's
 

2043
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,630
different set of atoms of space it's
having to be recreated it's not the

2044
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
having to be recreated it's not the
 

2045
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,470
having to be recreated it's not the
thing itself is not there it's it's

2046
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
thing itself is not there it's it's
 

2047
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,310
thing itself is not there it's it's
being continuously recreated all the

2048
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
being continuously recreated all the
 

2049
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,390
being continuously recreated all the
time now it's a little bit like waves in

2050
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
time now it's a little bit like waves in
 

2051
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,550
time now it's a little bit like waves in
an ocean you know vortices in a fluid

2052
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
an ocean you know vortices in a fluid
 

2053
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,790
an ocean you know vortices in a fluid
which again the actual molecules that

2054
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:42,800
which again the actual molecules that
 

2055
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,349
which again the actual molecules that
exist in those are not what define the

identity of the thing
 

2059
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,670

and but it's a little bit uh you know

2060
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
and but it's a little bit uh you know
 

2061
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,310
and but it's a little bit uh you know
this idea that there can be pure motion

2062
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
this idea that there can be pure motion
 

2063
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,550
this idea that there can be pure motion
that it can that it is even possible for

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
that it can that it is even possible for
 

2065
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,470
that it can that it is even possible for
an object to just move around in the

an object to just move around in the
 

2067
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,470
an object to just move around in the

universe and not change
 

2069
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,310

is it's not self-evident that such a

2070
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
is it's not self-evident that such a
 

2071
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,710
is it's not self-evident that such a
thing should be possible and that is

2072
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
thing should be possible and that is
 

2073
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,630
thing should be possible and that is
part of our perception of the universe

2074
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
part of our perception of the universe
 

2075
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,910
part of our perception of the universe
is that we

2076
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
is that we
 

2077
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,910
is that we
we parse those aspects of the universe

2078
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
we parse those aspects of the universe
 

2079
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,270
we parse those aspects of the universe

motion is it that same teacup that's the

motion is it that same teacup that's the
 

2099
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,550
motion is it that same teacup that's the
same shape well it's a bit of a

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,870
that so so anyway the the thing that
that's happening is we've got space

that's happening is we've got space

that's happening is we've got space
we've got this notion of time so time is

these atoms of space time is this
 

2175
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,630
these atoms of space time is this
computational process so the thing that

2176
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,640
computational process so the thing that
 

2177
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,870

the first sort of surprising thing is

2178

the first sort of surprising thing is
 

2179
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,470
the first sort of surprising thing is
well it turns out you get relativity

2180
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,480
well it turns out you get relativity
 

2181
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,190
well it turns out you get relativity
anyway and the reason that happens the

2182
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
anyway and the reason that happens the
 

2183
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,349
anyway and the reason that happens the
few bits and pieces here which one has

2184
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
few bits and pieces here which one has
 

2185
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,270
few bits and pieces here which one has
to understand but but the the

2186
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
to understand but but the the
 

2187
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,589
to understand but but the the
fundamental point is if you are an

2188
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:05,599
fundamental point is if you are an
 

2189
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,390
fundamental point is if you are an
observer embedded in the system

2190
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
observer embedded in the system
 

2191
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,030
observer embedded in the system
that are part of this whole story of

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
that are part of this whole story of
 

2193
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,710
that are part of this whole story of
things getting updated in this way and

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,510
things getting updated in this way and
that

2196
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:13,520
that
 

2197
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,109
that
there are there's sort of a limit to

00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
there are there's sort of a limit to
 

2199
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,349
there are there's sort of a limit to
what you can tell about what's going on

2200
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
what you can tell about what's going on
 

2201
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,790
what you can tell about what's going on
and really in the end the only thing you

2202
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:18,800
and really in the end the only thing you
 

2203
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,150
and really in the end the only thing you
can tell is what are the causal

2204
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
can tell is what are the causal
 

2205
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,950
can tell is what are the causal
relationships between events

2206
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
relationships between events
 

2207
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,230
relationships between events
so an event

2208
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
so an event
 

2209
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,670
so an event
in this sort of

2210
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
in this sort of
 

2211
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,310
in this sort of
an elementary event is a little piece of

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
an elementary event is a little piece of
 

2213
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,030
an elementary event is a little piece of
hypograph got rewritten and that means a

2214
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
hypograph got rewritten and that means a
 

2215
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,870
hypograph got rewritten and that means a
few hyper edges of the hyper graph were

2216
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
few hyper edges of the hyper graph were
 

2217
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,710
few hyper edges of the hyper graph were
consumed by the event

2218
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
consumed by the event
 

2219
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,790
consumed by the event
and you produce some other hyperedges

2220
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:36,800
and you produce some other hyperedges
 

2221
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,710
and you produce some other hyperedges
and that's an elementary event

2222
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
and that's an elementary event
 

2223
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,030
and that's an elementary event
and so then the question is uh what we

2224
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
and so then the question is uh what we
 

2225
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,069
and so then the question is uh what we
can tell is kind of what the network of

2226
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
can tell is kind of what the network of
 

2227
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,069
can tell is kind of what the network of
causal relationships between elementary

2228
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,079
causal relationships between elementary
 

2229
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,310
causal relationships between elementary
events is that's the ultimate thing the

2230
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,320
events is that's the ultimate thing the
 

2231
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,470
events is that's the ultimate thing the
causal graph of the universe

2232
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
causal graph of the universe
 

2233
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,790
causal graph of the universe
and it it turns out that well there's

2234
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
and it it turns out that well there's
 

2235
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,069
and it it turns out that well there's
this property of causal invariance that

2236
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
this property of causal invariance that
 

2237
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,670
this property of causal invariance that
is true of a bunch of these models and i

2238
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
is true of a bunch of these models and i
 

2239
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,750
is true of a bunch of these models and i
think is inevitably true for a variety

2240
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,760
think is inevitably true for a variety
 

2241
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,310
think is inevitably true for a variety
of reasons um that

2242
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
of reasons um that
 

2243
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,630
of reasons um that
makes it be the case that it doesn't

2244
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
makes it be the case that it doesn't
 

2245
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,270
makes it be the case that it doesn't
matter kind of if if you are

2246
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
matter kind of if if you are
 

2247
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,630
matter kind of if if you are
sort of saying well i've got this

2248
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
sort of saying well i've got this
 

2249
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,310
sort of saying well i've got this
hypograph and i can rewrite this piece

2250
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
hypograph and i can rewrite this piece
 

2251
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,069
hypograph and i can rewrite this piece
here and this piece here and i do them

2252
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079
here and this piece here and i do them
 

2253
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,670
here and this piece here and i do them
all in different orders when you

2254
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,680
all in different orders when you
 

2255
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,430
all in different orders when you
construct the causal graph for each of

2256
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,440
construct the causal graph for each of
 

2257
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,990
construct the causal graph for each of
those orders that you choose to do

2258
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
those orders that you choose to do
 

2259
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,990
those orders that you choose to do
things in you'll end up with the same

2260
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,000
things in you'll end up with the same
 

2261
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,349
things in you'll end up with the same
causal graph

2262
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
causal graph
 

2263
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,069
causal graph
and so that's essentially why

2264
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079
and so that's essentially why
 

2265
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,990
and so that's essentially why
uh well that's in the end why relativity

2266
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
uh well that's in the end why relativity
 

2267
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,950
uh well that's in the end why relativity
works

2268
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
works
 

2269
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,510
works
it's why our perception of space and

2270
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
it's why our perception of space and
 

2271
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,390
it's why our perception of space and
time is is as as having this kind of

2272
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
time is is as as having this kind of
 

2273
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,750
time is is as as having this kind of
connection that relativity says they

2274
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
connection that relativity says they
 

2275
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,950
connection that relativity says they
should have

2276
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
should have
 

2277
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,470
should have
and that's that's kind of that's kind of

2278
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:36,480
and that's that's kind of that's kind of
 

2279
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,829
and that's that's kind of that's kind of
how that works

2280
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
how that works
 

2281
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,670
how that works
i think i'm missing a little piece uh if

2282
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
i think i'm missing a little piece uh if
 

2283
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,910
i think i'm missing a little piece uh if
you can go there again you said

2284
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:41,920
you can go there again you said
 

2285
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,990
you can go there again you said
the fact that the observer is embedded

2286
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
the fact that the observer is embedded
 

2287
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,150
the fact that the observer is embedded
in this hypergraph

2288
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
in this hypergraph
 

2289
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,470
in this hypergraph
what's missing uh what is the observer

2290
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
what's missing uh what is the observer
 

2291
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,670
what's missing uh what is the observer
not able

2292
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
not able
 

2293
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,230
not able
to state about this universe so

2294
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
to state about this universe so
 

2295
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,390
to state about this universe so
basically if you look from the outside

2296
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
basically if you look from the outside
 

2297
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,030
basically if you look from the outside
you can say oh i see

2298
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
you can say oh i see
 

2299
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,910
you can say oh i see
this

2300
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
this
 

2301
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,750
this
uh

2302
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
uh
 

2303
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,470
uh
i see this particular place was updated

2304
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
i see this particular place was updated
 

2305
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,309
i see this particular place was updated
and then this one was updated and and

2306
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
and then this one was updated and and
 

2307
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,910
and then this one was updated and and
i'm seeing which order things were

2308
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:05,920
i'm seeing which order things were
 

2309
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,390
i'm seeing which order things were
updated in but the observer embedded in

2310
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
updated in but the observer embedded in
 

2311
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,829
updated in but the observer embedded in
the universe doesn't know which order

2312
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:09,839
the universe doesn't know which order
 

2313
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,589
the universe doesn't know which order
things were updated in because until

2314
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:11,599
things were updated in because until
 

2315
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,589
things were updated in because until
they've been updated they have no idea

2316
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
they've been updated they have no idea
 

2317
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,430
they've been updated they have no idea
what else happened so the only thing

2318
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
what else happened so the only thing
 

2319
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,349
what else happened so the only thing
they know is the set of causal

2320
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
they know is the set of causal
 

2321
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,430
they know is the set of causal
relationships let me give an extreme

2322
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
relationships let me give an extreme
 

2323
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,750
relationships let me give an extreme
example let's imagine that the universe

2324
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
example let's imagine that the universe
 

2325
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,750
example let's imagine that the universe
is a turing machine turing machines have

2326
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
is a turing machine turing machines have
 

2327
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,790
is a turing machine turing machines have
just this one update head which does

2328
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
just this one update head which does
 

2329
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,390
just this one update head which does
something and otherwise the turing

2330
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
something and otherwise the turing
 

2331
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,710
something and otherwise the turing
machine just does nothing right and and

2332
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
machine just does nothing right and and
 

2333
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,309
machine just does nothing right and and
the turing machine works by having this

2334
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
the turing machine works by having this
 

2335
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,870
the turing machine works by having this
head move around and do its updating uh

2336
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:34,880
head move around and do its updating uh
 

2337
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,470
head move around and do its updating uh
you know just where the head happens to

2338
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
you know just where the head happens to
 

2339
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,550
you know just where the head happens to
be the question is could the universe be

2340
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,560
be the question is could the universe be
 

2341
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,790
be the question is could the universe be
a turing machine could the universe just

2342
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
a turing machine could the universe just
 

2343
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,470
a turing machine could the universe just
have a single updating head that's just

2344
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,480
have a single updating head that's just
 

2345
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,230
have a single updating head that's just
zipping around all over the place you

2346
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
zipping around all over the place you
 

2347
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,309
zipping around all over the place you
say that's crazy because you know i'm

2348
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:46,319
say that's crazy because you know i'm
 

2349
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,829
say that's crazy because you know i'm
i'm talking to you you seem to be

2350
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
i'm talking to you you seem to be
 

2351
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,870
i'm talking to you you seem to be
updating i'm updating etc but the thing

2352
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
updating i'm updating etc but the thing
 

2353
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,630
updating i'm updating etc but the thing
is there's no way to know that because

2354
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
is there's no way to know that because
 

2355
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,910
is there's no way to know that because
if there was just this head moving

2356
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
if there was just this head moving
 

2357
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,710
if there was just this head moving
around it's like okay it updates me

2358
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
around it's like okay it updates me
 

2359
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,390
around it's like okay it updates me
but you're completely frozen at that

2360
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,400
but you're completely frozen at that
 

2361
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,309
but you're completely frozen at that
point until the head has come over and

2362
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:00,319
point until the head has come over and
 

2363
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,150
point until the head has come over and
updated you you have no idea what

2364
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
updated you you have no idea what
 

2365
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,349
updated you you have no idea what
happened to me

2366
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
happened to me
 

2367
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,190
happened to me
and so if you sort of unravel that

2368
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
and so if you sort of unravel that
 

2369
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,870
and so if you sort of unravel that
argument you realize the only thing we

2370
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
argument you realize the only thing we
 

2371
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,309
argument you realize the only thing we
actually can tell

2372
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:08,319
actually can tell
 

2373
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,630
actually can tell
is what the network of causal

2374
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:10,640
is what the network of causal
 

2375
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,309
is what the network of causal
relationships between the things that

2376
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
relationships between the things that
 

2377
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,109
relationships between the things that
happened were we don't get to know from

2378
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
happened were we don't get to know from
 

2379
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,150
happened were we don't get to know from
some sort of outside sort of god's eye

2380
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
some sort of outside sort of god's eye
 

2381
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,550
some sort of outside sort of god's eye
view of the thing we don't get to know

2382
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
view of the thing we don't get to know
 

2383
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,790
view of the thing we don't get to know
what sort of from the outside what

2384
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
what sort of from the outside what
 

2385
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,670
what sort of from the outside what
happened we only get to know sort of

2386
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
happened we only get to know sort of
 

2387
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,910
happened we only get to know sort of
what the set of relationships between

2388
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
what the set of relationships between
 

2389
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,750
what the set of relationships between
the things that happened actually were

2390
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
the things that happened actually were
 

2391
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,230
the things that happened actually were
yeah but if i somehow record like a

2392
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
yeah but if i somehow record like a
 

2393
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
yeah but if i somehow record like a
trace of this

2394
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
trace of this
 

2395
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,270
trace of this
i guess would be called

2396
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,280
i guess would be called
 

2397
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,950
i guess would be called
multi-computation

2398
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
multi-computation
 

2399
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,390
multi-computation
can't i uh then look back

2400
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
can't i uh then look back
 

2401
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,510
can't i uh then look back
in the way where do you look for the

2402
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
in the way where do you look for the
 

2403
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,790
in the way where do you look for the
trace

2404
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
trace
 

2405
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,030
trace
some you place throughout the universe

2406
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
some you place throughout the universe
 

2407
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,030
some you place throughout the universe
like throughout

2408
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
like throughout
 

2409
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,510
like throughout
like a log that records

2410
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,520
like a log that records

see the problem is and this is where

2424
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
see the problem is and this is where
 

2425
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,630
see the problem is and this is where
things start getting

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
things start getting
 

2427
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,030
things start getting
very entangled in terms of what one

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
very entangled in terms of what one
 

2429
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,470
very entangled in terms of what one
understands the problem is that any such

recording device is itself part of the

2432
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
recording device is itself part of the
 

2433
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,750
recording device is itself part of the
universe yeah

2434
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
universe yeah
 

2435
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,470
universe yeah
so you don't get to say you never get to

2436
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480
so you don't get to say you never get to
 

2437
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,390
so you don't get to say you never get to
say let's go outside the universe and go

2438
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
say let's go outside the universe and go
 

2439
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,510
say let's go outside the universe and go
do this

2440
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
do this
 

2441
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,910
do this
and and that's why i mean lots of the

2442
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:19,920
and and that's why i mean lots of the
 

2443
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,829
and and that's why i mean lots of the
features of this of this model and the

2444
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
features of this of this model and the
 

2445
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,990
features of this of this model and the
way things work end up being a result of

2446
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
way things work end up being a result of
 

2447
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,829
way things work end up being a result of
that so but what

2448
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:25,839
that so but what
 

2449
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,870
that so but what
i guess from on a human level what is

2450
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
i guess from on a human level what is
 

2451
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,470
i guess from on a human level what is
the cost you're paying what are you

2452
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
the cost you're paying what are you
 

2453
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,630
the cost you're paying what are you
missing from not getting an updated

2454
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
missing from not getting an updated
 

2455
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,030
missing from not getting an updated
picture all the time okay i got i i

2456
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
picture all the time okay i got i i
 

2457
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,150
picture all the time okay i got i i
understand what you should say yeah yeah

2458
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
understand what you should say yeah yeah
 

2459
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,990
understand what you should say yeah yeah
right but like what like how does

2460
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,000
right but like what like how does
 

2461
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,910
right but like what like how does
consciousness emerge from that

2462
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
consciousness emerge from that
 

2463
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,750
consciousness emerge from that
like how

2464
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
like how
 

2465
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,910
like how
like what are the limitations of that

2466
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
like what are the limitations of that
 

2467
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,750
like what are the limitations of that
observer i understand you're getting a

2468
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:45,760
observer i understand you're getting a
 

2469
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,589
observer i understand you're getting a
delay well that's true there's a okay

2470
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
delay well that's true there's a okay
 

2471
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,870
delay well that's true there's a okay
there's there's

2472
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
there's there's
 

2473
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,710
there's there's
a bunch of limitations of the observer i

2474
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
a bunch of limitations of the observer i
 

2475
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,430
a bunch of limitations of the observer i
think

2476
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,440
think
 

2477
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,790
think
maybe just explain something about

2478
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
maybe just explain something about
 

2479
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,309
maybe just explain something about
quantum mechanics because that maybe is

2480
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
quantum mechanics because that maybe is
 

2481
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,309
quantum mechanics because that maybe is
a is an extreme version of some of these

2482
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,319
a is an extreme version of some of these
 

2483
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,870
a is an extreme version of some of these
issues which helps to kind of motivate

2484
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
issues which helps to kind of motivate
 

2485
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,470
issues which helps to kind of motivate
why one should sort of think things

2486
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
why one should sort of think things
 

2487
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,150
why one should sort of think things
through a little bit more carefully

2488
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
through a little bit more carefully
 

2489
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,030
through a little bit more carefully
so one feature of the of this

2490
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,040
so one feature of the of this
 

2491
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,390
so one feature of the of this
okay so

2492
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,400
okay so
 

2493
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,309
okay so
in standard physics like high school

2494
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
in standard physics like high school
 

2495
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,390
in standard physics like high school
physics you learn you know the equations

2496
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,400
physics you learn you know the equations
 

2497
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,270
physics you learn you know the equations
of motion for a ball and the the you

2498
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
of motion for a ball and the the you
 

2499
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,349
of motion for a ball and the the you
know it says you throw the ball this

2500
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:15,359
know it says you throw the ball this
 

2501
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,589
know it says you throw the ball this
angle this velocity things will move in

2502
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599
angle this velocity things will move in
 

2503
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,829
angle this velocity things will move in
this way and there's a definite answer

2504
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
this way and there's a definite answer
 

2505
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,069
this way and there's a definite answer
right the story the the key story of

2506
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:22,079
right the story the the key story of
 

2507
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,190
right the story the the key story of
quantum mechanics is there aren't

2508
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,200
quantum mechanics is there aren't
 

2509
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,790
quantum mechanics is there aren't
definite answers to where does the ball

2510
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:24,800
definite answers to where does the ball
 

2511
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,190
definite answers to where does the ball
go there's kind of this whole sort of

2512
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
go there's kind of this whole sort of
 

2513
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,230
go there's kind of this whole sort of
bundle of possible paths and all we say

2514
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
bundle of possible paths and all we say
 

2515
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,230
bundle of possible paths and all we say
we know from quantum mechanics is

2516
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
we know from quantum mechanics is
 

2517
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,470
we know from quantum mechanics is
certain probabilities for where the ball

2518
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:34,480
certain probabilities for where the ball
 

2519
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,710
certain probabilities for where the ball
will end up okay so that's kind of the

2520
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
will end up okay so that's kind of the
 

2521
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,710
will end up okay so that's kind of the
the core idea of quantum mechanics so in

2522
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
the core idea of quantum mechanics so in
 

2523
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,670
the core idea of quantum mechanics so in
our models you quantum mechanics is not

2524
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:41,680
our models you quantum mechanics is not
 

2525
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,390
our models you quantum mechanics is not
some kind of plug-in add-on type thing

2526
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
some kind of plug-in add-on type thing
 

2527
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,750
some kind of plug-in add-on type thing
you absolutely cannot get away from

2528
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760
you absolutely cannot get away from
 

2529
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,750
you absolutely cannot get away from
quantum mechanics because as you think

2530
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:47,760
quantum mechanics because as you think
 

2531
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,670
quantum mechanics because as you think
about updating this hyper graph there

2532
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
about updating this hyper graph there
 

2533
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,990
about updating this hyper graph there
isn't just one sequence of things one

2534
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,000
isn't just one sequence of things one
 

2535
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,270
isn't just one sequence of things one
definite sequence of things that can

2536
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
definite sequence of things that can
 

2537
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,870
definite sequence of things that can
happen there are all these different

2538
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
happen there are all these different
 

2539
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,109
happen there are all these different
possible update sequences that can occur

2540
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
possible update sequences that can occur
 

2541
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,550
possible update sequences that can occur
you could do this you know piece of the

2542
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,560
you could do this you know piece of the
 

2543
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,390
you could do this you know piece of the
hypograph now and then this one later

2544
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
hypograph now and then this one later
 

2545
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,109

and etc etc etc all those different
 

2547
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,349
and etc etc etc all those different
paths of history correspond to these

quantum quantum

2550
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:06,960
quantum quantum

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
paths and quantum mechanics these
 

2553
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,790

00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:10,800
different possible quantum histories and
 

2555
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,910
different possible quantum histories and
one of the things that's kind of

2556
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:11,920
one of the things that's kind of
 

2557
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,109
one of the things that's kind of
surprising about it is they they branch

2558
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
surprising about it is they they branch
 

2559
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,710
surprising about it is they they branch
you know there can be a certain state of

2560
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
you know there can be a certain state of
 

2561
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,030
you know there can be a certain state of
the universe and it could do this or it

2562
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
the universe and it could do this or it
 

2563
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,349
the universe and it could do this or it
could do that but they can also merge

2564
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
could do that but they can also merge
 

2565
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,950
could do that but they can also merge
there can be two states of the universe

2566
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:22,960
there can be two states of the universe
 

2567
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,510
there can be two states of the universe
which their next state the next state

2568
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:25,520
which their next state the next state
 

2569
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,270
which their next state the next state
they produce is the same for both of

2570
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
they produce is the same for both of
 

2571
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,510
they produce is the same for both of
them and that process of branching and

2572
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
them and that process of branching and
 

2573
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,270
them and that process of branching and
merging is kind of critical and the idea

2574
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
merging is kind of critical and the idea
 

2575
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,270
merging is kind of critical and the idea
that they can be merging is critical and

2576
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,280
that they can be merging is critical and
 

2577
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,390
that they can be merging is critical and
somewhat non-trivial for these

2578
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
somewhat non-trivial for these
 

2579
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,550
somewhat non-trivial for these
hypographs because there's a whole graph

2580
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,560
hypographs because there's a whole graph
 

2581
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,710
hypographs because there's a whole graph
isomorphism story and there's a whole

2582
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
isomorphism story and there's a whole
 

2583
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,390
isomorphism story and there's a whole
very elaborate settlement that's where

2584
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
very elaborate settlement that's where
 

2585
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,030
very elaborate settlement that's where
the causal invariance comes in yes

2586
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,040
the causal invariance comes in yes
 

2587
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,270
the causal invariance comes in yes
among other things right okay yes that's

2588
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
among other things right okay yes that's
 

2589
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,470
among other things right okay yes that's
but but so so then what happens is that

2590
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,480
but but so so then what happens is that
 

2591
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,270
but but so so then what happens is that
what what one's seeing okay so we've got

2592
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280
what what one's seeing okay so we've got
 

2593
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,030
what what one's seeing okay so we've got
this thing it's branching it's merging

2594
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
this thing it's branching it's merging
 

2595
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,550
this thing it's branching it's merging
et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so

2596
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so
 

2597
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,030
et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so
now the question is how do we perceive

2598
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
now the question is how do we perceive
 

2599
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,829
now the question is how do we perceive
that

2600
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
that
 

2601
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,390
that
what do you know how do we do we why

2602
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
what do you know how do we do we why
 

2603
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,829
what do you know how do we do we why
don't we notice that the universe is

2604
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
don't we notice that the universe is
 

2605
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,349
don't we notice that the universe is
branching and merging

2606
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
branching and merging
 

2607
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,030
branching and merging
why you know why is it the case that we

2608
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040
why you know why is it the case that we
 

2609
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,390
why you know why is it the case that we
just think a definite set of things

2610
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
just think a definite set of things
 

2611
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,190
just think a definite set of things
happen

2612
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,200
happen
 

2613
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,349
happen
well the answer is we are embedded in

2614
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
well the answer is we are embedded in
 

2615
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,589
well the answer is we are embedded in
that universe and our brains are

2616
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
that universe and our brains are
 

2617
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,510
that universe and our brains are
branching and merging too

2618
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
branching and merging too
 

2619
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,670
branching and merging too
and so what quantum mechanics becomes a

2620
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
and so what quantum mechanics becomes a
 

2621
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,150
and so what quantum mechanics becomes a
story of is how does a branching brain

2622
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160
story of is how does a branching brain
 

2623
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,390
story of is how does a branching brain
perceive a branching universe

2624
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
perceive a branching universe
 

2625
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,750
perceive a branching universe
and the key thing is as soon as you say

2626
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
and the key thing is as soon as you say
 

2627
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,430
and the key thing is as soon as you say
i think definite things happen in the

2628
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
i think definite things happen in the
 

2629
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,670
i think definite things happen in the
universe that means you are essentially

2630
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
universe that means you are essentially
 

2631
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,829
universe that means you are essentially
conflating lots of different parts of

2632
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
conflating lots of different parts of
 

2633
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,750
conflating lots of different parts of
history you're saying

2634
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,760
history you're saying
 

2635
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,829
history you're saying
actually as far as i'm concerned because

2636
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
actually as far as i'm concerned because
 

2637
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,750
actually as far as i'm concerned because
i'm convinced that definite things

2638
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
i'm convinced that definite things
 

2639
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,589
i'm convinced that definite things
happen in the universe all these parts

2640
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:37,599
happen in the universe all these parts
 

2641
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,589
happen in the universe all these parts
of history must be equivalent now it's

2642
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
of history must be equivalent now it's
 

2643
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,950
of history must be equivalent now it's
not obvious that that would be a

2644
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
not obvious that that would be a
 

2645
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,870
not obvious that that would be a
consistent thing to do it might be you

2646
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
consistent thing to do it might be you
 

2647
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,069
consistent thing to do it might be you
say all these paths of history are

2648
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079
say all these paths of history are
 

2649
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,270
say all these paths of history are
equivalent but by golly moments later

2650
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
equivalent but by golly moments later
 

2651
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,710
equivalent but by golly moments later
that would be a completely inconsistent

2652
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:48,720
that would be a completely inconsistent
 

2653
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,150
that would be a completely inconsistent
point of view everything would have you

2654
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
point of view everything would have you
 

2655
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,550
point of view everything would have you
know gone to hell in different ways the

2656
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
know gone to hell in different ways the
 

2657
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,390
know gone to hell in different ways the
fact that that doesn't happen

2658
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,400
fact that that doesn't happen
 

2659
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,750
fact that that doesn't happen
is well that's a consequence of this

2660
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
is well that's a consequence of this
 

2661
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,150
is well that's a consequence of this
causal and variance thing but that's and

2662
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
causal and variance thing but that's and
 

2663
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,670
causal and variance thing but that's and
the fact that that does happen a little

2664
00:45:59,670 --> 00:45:59,680
the fact that that does happen a little
 

2665
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,589
the fact that that does happen a little
bit is what causes little quantum

2666
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
bit is what causes little quantum
 

2667
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,630
bit is what causes little quantum
effects

2668
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,640
effects
 

2669
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,630
effects
and that term if that didn't happen at

2670
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
and that term if that didn't happen at
 

2671
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,349
and that term if that didn't happen at
all there wouldn't be anything that sort

2672
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
all there wouldn't be anything that sort
 

2673
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,470
all there wouldn't be anything that sort
of is like quantum mechanics it would be

2674
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
of is like quantum mechanics it would be
 

2675
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,990
of is like quantum mechanics it would be
quantum mechanics is kind of like in

2676
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
quantum mechanics is kind of like in
 

2677
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,790
quantum mechanics is kind of like in
this uh in this kind of this bundle of

2678
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
this uh in this kind of this bundle of
 

2679
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,630
this uh in this kind of this bundle of
paths it's a little bit like what

2680
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
paths it's a little bit like what
 

2681
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,069
paths it's a little bit like what
happens in statistical mechanics and

2682
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
happens in statistical mechanics and
 

2683
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,550
happens in statistical mechanics and
fluid mechanics whatever that most of

2684
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
fluid mechanics whatever that most of
 

2685
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,990
fluid mechanics whatever that most of
the time you just see this continuous

2689
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,349
fluid you just see the world just
progressing in this kind of way that's

2690
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
progressing in this kind of way that's
 

2691
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,109
progressing in this kind of way that's
like this continuous fluid but every so

2692
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
like this continuous fluid but every so
 

2693
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,470
like this continuous fluid but every so
often if you look at the exact right

2694
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:28,480
often if you look at the exact right
 

2695
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,550
often if you look at the exact right
experiment you can start seeing well

2696
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
experiment you can start seeing well
 

2697
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,230
experiment you can start seeing well
actually it's made of these molecules

2698
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
actually it's made of these molecules
 

2699
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,510
actually it's made of these molecules
where they might go that way or they

2700
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:33,520
where they might go that way or they
 

2701
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,190
where they might go that way or they
might go this way and that's kind of

2702
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
might go this way and that's kind of
 

2703
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,630
might go this way and that's kind of
quantum effects and and so that's so the

2704
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
quantum effects and and so that's so the
 

2705
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,030
quantum effects and and so that's so the
this kind of idea of

2706
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
this kind of idea of
 

2707
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,550
this kind of idea of
where we're sort of embedded in the

2708
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
where we're sort of embedded in the
 

2709
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,630
where we're sort of embedded in the
universe this branching brain is

2710
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
universe this branching brain is
 

2711
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,710
universe this branching brain is
perceiving this branching universe and

2712
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
perceiving this branching universe and
 

2713
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,390
perceiving this branching universe and
that ends up being sort of a story of

2714
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
that ends up being sort of a story of
 

2715
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,870
that ends up being sort of a story of
quantum mechanics that's that's part of

2716
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
quantum mechanics that's that's part of
 

2717
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,710
quantum mechanics that's that's part of
the the whole picture of what's going on

2718
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
the the whole picture of what's going on
 

2719
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,950
the the whole picture of what's going on
but i think i mean to come back to sort

2720
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
but i think i mean to come back to sort
 

2721
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,390
but i think i mean to come back to sort
of where does conscious what is what is

2722
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
of where does conscious what is what is
 

2723
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,790
of where does conscious what is what is
the story of consciousness so in the

2724
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
the story of consciousness so in the
 

2725
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,390

we've got you know whatever it is 10 to
the 400 atoms of space they're all doing

the 400 atoms of space they're all doing
 

2731
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,349
the 400 atoms of space they're all doing
these complicated things

2732
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:05,359
these complicated things
 

2733
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,270
these complicated things
it's all a big complicated irreducible

2734
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
it's all a big complicated irreducible
 

2735
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,670
it's all a big complicated irreducible
computation the question is what do we

2736
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
computation the question is what do we
 

2737
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,670
computation the question is what do we
perceive from all of that

2738
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
perceive from all of that
 

2739
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,950
perceive from all of that
and the answer is that we are we are

2740
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:14,960
and the answer is that we are we are
 

2741
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,710
and the answer is that we are we are
parsing the universe

2742
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:16,720
parsing the universe
 

2743
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,309
parsing the universe
in a particular way

00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:18,319
in a particular way

in a particular way
let me again go back to the the gas

2746
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
let me again go back to the the gas

2751
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,950
this room there are molecules bouncing

00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
around all kinds of complicated patterns
 

2753
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,069
around all kinds of complicated patterns
but we don't care all we notice is

2754
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
but we don't care all we notice is
 

2755
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,910
but we don't care all we notice is
there's you know the gas laws are

2756
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:31,920
there's you know the gas laws are
 

2757
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,910
there's you know the gas laws are
satisfied maybe there's some fluid

00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
satisfied maybe there's some fluid
 

2759
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,870

dynamics these are kind of features of

2760
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880

that assembly molecules that we notice
 

2763
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,510
that assembly molecules that we notice
and then lots of details we don't notice

2764
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:41,520
and then lots of details we don't notice
 

2765
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,349
and then lots of details we don't notice
when you say we do you mean the tools of

00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
when you say we do you mean the tools of
 

2767
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,109
when you say we do you mean the tools of
physics or do you mean literally are the

2768
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
physics or do you mean literally are the

human brain in its perception system

2770
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:47,680
human brain in its perception system
 

2771
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,829
human brain in its perception system
well okay so the human brain is where it

2772
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
well okay so the human brain is where it
 

2773
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,270
well okay so the human brain is where it
starts but we've built a bunch of

2774
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
starts but we've built a bunch of
 

2775
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,549
starts but we've built a bunch of
instruments to do a bit better than the

2776
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
instruments to do a bit better than the
 

2777
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,549
instruments to do a bit better than the
human brain but they still have many of

2778
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:54,559
human brain but they still have many of
 

2779
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,150
human brain but they still have many of
the same kinds of ideas you know their

2780
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
the same kinds of ideas you know their
 

2781
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,390
the same kinds of ideas you know their
cameras and their pressure sensors and

2782
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
cameras and their pressure sensors and
 

2783
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,870
cameras and their pressure sensors and
their these kinds of things they're not

2784
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
their these kinds of things they're not
 

2785
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,349
their these kinds of things they're not
uh you know at this point we don't know

2786
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
uh you know at this point we don't know
 

2787
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,670
uh you know at this point we don't know
how to make fundamentally qualitatively

2788
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
how to make fundamentally qualitatively
 

2789
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,309
how to make fundamentally qualitatively
different sensory devices right and so

2790
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
different sensory devices right and so
 

2791
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,750
different sensory devices right and so
it's always just an extension of the

2792
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760
it's always just an extension of the
 

2793
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,790
it's always just an extension of the
conscious

2794
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:10,800
conscious
 

2795
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,589
conscious
experience or a sensory experience

2796
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
experience or a sensory experience
 

2797
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,470
experience or a sensory experience
sensory experience but

2798
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
sensory experience but
 

2799
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,750
sensory experience but
sensory experience that's somehow

2800
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
sensory experience that's somehow
 

2801
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,430
sensory experience that's somehow
intricately tied to

2802
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
intricately tied to
 

2803
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,390
intricately tied to
consciousness

2804
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
consciousness
 

2805
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,549
consciousness
right well so so one question is when we

2806
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:22,559
right well so so one question is when we
 

2807
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,910
right well so so one question is when we
are looking at all these molecules of

2808
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:23,920
are looking at all these molecules of
 

2809
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,510
are looking at all these molecules of
the in the gas and there might be 10 to

2810
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
the in the gas and there might be 10 to
 

2811
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,750
the in the gas and there might be 10 to
20 molecules in some little little box

2812
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
20 molecules in some little little box
 

2813
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,750
20 molecules in some little little box
or something it's like

2814
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
or something it's like
 

2815
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,589
or something it's like
what what do we notice about those

2816
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
what what do we notice about those
 

2817
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,270
what what do we notice about those
molecules so one thing that we can say

2818
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,280
molecules so one thing that we can say
 

2819
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,589
molecules so one thing that we can say
is we don't notice that much

2820
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
is we don't notice that much
 

2821
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,549
is we don't notice that much
we are you know we are computationally

2822
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
we are you know we are computationally
 

2823
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,910
we are you know we are computationally
bounded observers we can't go in and say

2824
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:41,920
bounded observers we can't go in and say
 

2825
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,670
bounded observers we can't go in and say
okay i'm they're 10 to the 20th

2826
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
okay i'm they're 10 to the 20th
 

2827
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,990
okay i'm they're 10 to the 20th
molecules and i know that i can sort of

2828
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
molecules and i know that i can sort of
 

2829
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,670
molecules and i know that i can sort of
decrypt their motions and i can figure

2830
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
decrypt their motions and i can figure
 

2831
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,430
decrypt their motions and i can figure
out this and that it's like i'm just

2832
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
out this and that it's like i'm just
 

2833
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,790
out this and that it's like i'm just
going to say what's the average density

2834
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
going to say what's the average density
 

2835
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,589
going to say what's the average density
of molecules and so one key feature of

2836
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
of molecules and so one key feature of
 

2837
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,510
of molecules and so one key feature of
us is that we are computationally

2838
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:55,520
us is that we are computationally
 

2839
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,309
us is that we are computationally
bounded and that when you are looking at

2840
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,319
bounded and that when you are looking at
 

2841
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,790
bounded and that when you are looking at
a universe which is full of computation

2842
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
a universe which is full of computation
 

2843
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,109
a universe which is full of computation
and doing huge amounts of computation

2844
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
and doing huge amounts of computation
 

2845
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,349
and doing huge amounts of computation
but we are computationally bounded

2846
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:05,359
but we are computationally bounded
 

2847
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,950
but we are computationally bounded
there's only certain things about that

2848
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
there's only certain things about that
 

2849
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,829
there's only certain things about that
universe that we're going to be

2850
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839
universe that we're going to be
 

2851
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,309
universe that we're going to be
sensitive to we're not going to be you

2853
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,990
sensitive to we're not going to be you
know figuring out what all the atoms of

2854
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
know figuring out what all the atoms of
 

2855
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,230
know figuring out what all the atoms of
space are doing because we're just

2856
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
space are doing because we're just
 

2857
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,309
space are doing because we're just
computationally bounded observers and we

2858
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:16,319
computationally bounded observers and we
 

2859
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,990
computationally bounded observers and we
are only sampling these these small set

2860
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,000
are only sampling these these small set
 

2861
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,990
are only sampling these these small set
of features so i i think the two

2862
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,000
of features so i i think the two
 

2863
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,670
of features so i i think the two
defining features of consciousness that

and i
 

2867
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,150
and i
you know i would say that the the sort

00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
you know i would say that the the sort

of the the preamble to this is
 

2871
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,549

for years you know because i've talked
 

2873
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,750
for years you know because i've talked
about sort of computation and

2874
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
about sort of computation and
 

2875
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,430
about sort of computation and
fundamental features of physics and

consciousness
 

2883
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,030
consciousness
and i for years i've said i have nothing

00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
and i for years i've said i have nothing
 

2885
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,710
and i for years i've said i have nothing
to say about consciousness

00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:40,720
to say about consciousness
 

2887
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,390
to say about consciousness
and you know i've kind of told this

2888
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
and you know i've kind of told this
 

2889
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,750
and you know i've kind of told this
story you know you talk about

2890
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:43,760
story you know you talk about
 

2891

these are both features where you say

2894
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
these are both features where you say
 

2895
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,069
these are both features where you say
what's the abstract definition of life

2896
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
what's the abstract definition of life
 

2897
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,270
what's the abstract definition of life
we don't really know the abstract

2898
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,280
we don't really know the abstract
 

2899
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,710
we don't really know the abstract
definition we know the one for life on

2900
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
definition we know the one for life on
 

2901
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,790

membranes it's got all this kind of

2904
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
membranes it's got all this kind of
 

2905
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:56,950
membranes it's got all this kind of
stuff

2906
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
stuff
 

2907
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,109
stuff
similarly for intelligence we know the

2908
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
similarly for intelligence we know the
 

2909
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,870
similarly for intelligence we know the
human definition of intelligence but

2910
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
human definition of intelligence but
 

2911
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,790
human definition of intelligence but
what is intelligence abstractly we don't

2912
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:02,800
what is intelligence abstractly we don't
 

2913
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,270
what is intelligence abstractly we don't
really know and so what i've long

2914
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,280
really know and so what i've long
 

2915
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,349
really know and so what i've long
believed is that sort of the abstract

2916
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
believed is that sort of the abstract
 

2917
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,270
believed is that sort of the abstract
definition of intelligence is just

2918

definition of intelligence is just
 

2919

definition of intelligence is just
computational sophistication that is

2920
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:11,839
computational sophistication that is
 

2921
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,109
computational sophistication that is
that as soon as you can be

2922
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
that as soon as you can be
 

2923
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,109
that as soon as you can be
computationally sophisticated that's

2924
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:15,119
computationally sophisticated that's
 

2925
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,510
computationally sophisticated that's
kind of the abstract version the

2926
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
kind of the abstract version the
 

2927
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,829
kind of the abstract version the
generalized version of intelligence so

2928
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
generalized version of intelligence so
 

2929
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:20,790
generalized version of intelligence so
then the question is what about

2930
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:20,800
then the question is what about
 

2931
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,950
then the question is what about
consciousness and what i sort of

2932
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
consciousness and what i sort of
 

2933
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,390
consciousness and what i sort of
realized is that consciousness is

2934
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
realized is that consciousness is
 

2935
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,430
realized is that consciousness is
actually a step down from intelligence

2936
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
actually a step down from intelligence
 

2937
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,790
actually a step down from intelligence
that is that you might think oh you know

2938
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:30,800
that is that you might think oh you know
 

2939
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,109
that is that you might think oh you know
consciousness is the is the is the top

2940
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
consciousness is the is the is the top
 

2941
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,030
consciousness is the is the is the top
of the pile but actually i don't think

2942
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,040
of the pile but actually i don't think
 

2943
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,109
of the pile but actually i don't think
it is i think that there's this notion

2944
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
it is i think that there's this notion
 

2945
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,870
it is i think that there's this notion
of kind of computational sophistication

2946
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
of kind of computational sophistication
 

2947
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,349
of kind of computational sophistication
which is the generalized intelligence

2948
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
which is the generalized intelligence
 

2949
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,069
which is the generalized intelligence
but consciousness has two limitations i

2950
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:44,079
but consciousness has two limitations i
 

2951
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,910
but consciousness has two limitations i
think one of them is computational

2952
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
think one of them is computational
 

2953
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,069
think one of them is computational
boundedness that is that we're only

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,230

um and you know maybe there's something

2986
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
um and you know maybe there's something
 

2987

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,870
is all those other neurons that didn't
make it to be part of our sort of

3004
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
make it to be part of our sort of
 

3005
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,190
make it to be part of our sort of
conscious stream of experience so in

3006
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:41,200
conscious stream of experience so in
 

3007
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,670
conscious stream of experience so in
that sense intelligence as computational

3008
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
that sense intelligence as computational
 

3009
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,390
that sense intelligence as computational
sophistication is much broader

3010
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
sophistication is much broader
 

3011
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,589
sophistication is much broader
than uh yes then the the computational

3012
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
than uh yes then the the computational
 

3013
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,430
than uh yes then the the computational
constraints

3014
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
constraints
 

3015
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,390
constraints
which

3016
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
which
 

3017
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,150
which
consciousness operates under and also

3018
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
consciousness operates under and also
 

3019
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,390
consciousness operates under and also
the sequential like the sequential thing

3020
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
the sequential like the sequential thing
 

3021
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,630
the sequential like the sequential thing
yes like the notion of time

3022
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
yes like the notion of time
 

3023
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,990
yes like the notion of time
that's that's kind of interesting but

3024
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,000
that's that's kind of interesting but
 

3025
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,150
that's that's kind of interesting but
then the the follow-up question is like

3026
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
then the the follow-up question is like
 

3027
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,910
then the the follow-up question is like
okay starting to get a sense of what is

3028
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:03,920
okay starting to get a sense of what is
 

3029
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,069
okay starting to get a sense of what is
intelligence and how does that connect

3030
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
intelligence and how does that connect
 

3031
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,710
intelligence and how does that connect
to a human brain because you're saying

3032
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720
to a human brain because you're saying
 

3033
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,390
to a human brain because you're saying
um

3034
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
um
 

3035
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,710
um
intelligence is almost like a fabric

3036
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
intelligence is almost like a fabric
 

3037
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,549
intelligence is almost like a fabric
like what we like plug into it or

3038
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
like what we like plug into it or
 

3039
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,549
like what we like plug into it or
something like yeah i think you know our

3040
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:16,559
something like yeah i think you know our
 

3041
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,870
something like yeah i think you know our
consciousness plugs into it yeah i mean

3042
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:18,880
consciousness plugs into it yeah i mean
 

3043
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,910
consciousness plugs into it yeah i mean
the intelligence i think the core

3044
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:21,920
the intelligence i think the core
 

3045
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,510
the intelligence i think the core
i mean you know intelligence at some

3046
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:23,520
i mean you know intelligence at some
 

3047
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,430
i mean you know intelligence at some
level is just a word but we're asking

3048
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
level is just a word but we're asking
 

3049
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,430
level is just a word but we're asking
you know what is the the notion of

3050
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,440
you know what is the the notion of
 

3051
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,829
you know what is the the notion of
intelligence as we generalize it beyond

3052
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
intelligence as we generalize it beyond
 

3053
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,670
intelligence as we generalize it beyond
the bounds of humans beyond the bounds

3054
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
the bounds of humans beyond the bounds
 

3055
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,750
the bounds of humans beyond the bounds
of even the ais that we humans have

3056
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
of even the ais that we humans have
 

3057
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,030
of even the ais that we humans have
built and so on you know what what is

3058
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
built and so on you know what what is
 

3059
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,950
built and so on you know what what is
intelligence you know is the weather you

3060
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:38,960
intelligence you know is the weather you
 

3061
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,230
intelligence you know is the weather you
know people say the weather has a mind

3062
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,240
know people say the weather has a mind
 

3063
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,829
know people say the weather has a mind
of its own what does that mean you know

3064
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:41,839
of its own what does that mean you know
 

3065
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,910
of its own what does that mean you know
can the weather be intelligent

3066
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
can the weather be intelligent
 

3067
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,990
can the weather be intelligent
yeah what does agency have to do with

3068
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,000
yeah what does agency have to do with
 

3069
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,150
yeah what does agency have to do with
intelligence here so is intelligence

3070
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
intelligence here so is intelligence
 

3071
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,309
intelligence here so is intelligence
just like your conception of computation

3072
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
just like your conception of computation
 

3073
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,910
just like your conception of computation
just intelligence

3074
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:51,920
just intelligence
 

3075
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,030
just intelligence
is a

3076
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
is a
 

3077
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,430
is a
is the capacity to perform computation

3078
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
is the capacity to perform computation
 

3079
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,069
is the capacity to perform computation
and the sea of yeah i think so i mean i

3080
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079
and the sea of yeah i think so i mean i
 

3081
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,829
and the sea of yeah i think so i mean i
think that's right and i i think that

3082
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
think that's right and i i think that
 

3083
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,870
think that's right and i i think that
you know this question of of is it for a

3084
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
you know this question of of is it for a
 

3085
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,309
you know this question of of is it for a
purpose okay

3086
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
purpose okay
 

3087
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,109
purpose okay
that quickly degenerates into a horrible

3088
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
that quickly degenerates into a horrible
 

3089
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,030
that quickly degenerates into a horrible
philosophical mess because you know

3090
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
philosophical mess because you know
 

3091
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,470
philosophical mess because you know
whenever you say

3092
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,480
whenever you say
 

3093
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,870
whenever you say
did the weather do that for a purpose

3094
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
did the weather do that for a purpose
 

3095
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,950
did the weather do that for a purpose
yeah right well yes it did it was trying

3096
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
yeah right well yes it did it was trying
 

3097
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,790
yeah right well yes it did it was trying
to move a bunch of hot air from the

3098
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
to move a bunch of hot air from the
 

3099
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,710
to move a bunch of hot air from the
equator to the poles or something that's

3100
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
equator to the poles or something that's
 

3101
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,309
equator to the poles or something that's
its purpose but why because i seem to be

3102
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
its purpose but why because i seem to be
 

3103
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,549
its purpose but why because i seem to be
equally as dumb today as i was yesterday

3104
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
equally as dumb today as i was yesterday
 

3105
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,510
equally as dumb today as i was yesterday
so there's some persistence like uh

3106
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
so there's some persistence like uh
 

3107
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,069
so there's some persistence like uh
consistency over time that the

3108
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
consistency over time that the
 

3109
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,390
consistency over time that the
intelligence i plugged into

3110
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
intelligence i plugged into
 

3111
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,390
intelligence i plugged into
so like what's it seems like there's a

3112
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,400
so like what's it seems like there's a
 

3113
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,309
so like what's it seems like there's a
hard constraint

3114
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
hard constraint
 

3115
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,549
hard constraint
well between the amount of computation i

3116
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
well between the amount of computation i
 

3117
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,790
well between the amount of computation i
can perform in my consciousness

3118
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
can perform in my consciousness
 

3119
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,390
can perform in my consciousness
like they seem to be really closely

3120
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
like they seem to be really closely
 

3121
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,390
like they seem to be really closely
connected somehow well i think the point

3122
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
connected somehow well i think the point
 

3123
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,790
connected somehow well i think the point
is that the thing that gives you kind of

3124
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:46,800
is that the thing that gives you kind of
 

3125
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,790
is that the thing that gives you kind of
the ability to have

3126
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
the ability to have
 

3127
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,790
the ability to have
kind of conscious

3128
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
kind of conscious
 

3129
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,870
kind of conscious
intel intelligence

3130
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
intel intelligence
 

3131
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,190
intel intelligence
you you can have kind of this okay so so

3132
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
you you can have kind of this okay so so
 

3133
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,109
you you can have kind of this okay so so
one thing is we don't know

3134
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
one thing is we don't know
 

3135
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,430
one thing is we don't know
intelligences other than the ones that

3136
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
intelligences other than the ones that
 

3137
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,390
intelligences other than the ones that
are very much like us yes right and the

3138
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
are very much like us yes right and the
 

3139
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,309
are very much like us yes right and the
ones that are very much like us i think

3140
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
ones that are very much like us i think
 

3141
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,990
ones that are very much like us i think
have this feature of single thread of

3142
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
have this feature of single thread of
 

3143
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,790
have this feature of single thread of
time

3144
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,800
time
 

3145
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,349
time
bounded you know computationally bounded

3146
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:09,359
bounded you know computationally bounded
 

3147
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,390
bounded you know computationally bounded
now that but you also need computational

3148
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,400
now that but you also need computational
 

3149
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,470
now that but you also need computational
sophistication having a single thread of

3150
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
sophistication having a single thread of
 

3151
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,630
sophistication having a single thread of
time and being computationally bounded

3152
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
time and being computationally bounded
 

3153
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,150
time and being computationally bounded
you could just be a clock going

3154
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
you could just be a clock going
 

3155
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,710
you could just be a clock going
tick-tock you know that would satisfy

3156
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
tick-tock you know that would satisfy
 

3157
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,790
tick-tock you know that would satisfy
those conditions but the fact that we

3158
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
those conditions but the fact that we
 

3159
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,950
those conditions but the fact that we
have this uh sort of uh irreducible

3160
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
have this uh sort of uh irreducible
 

3161
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,670
have this uh sort of uh irreducible
you know computational ability that's

3162
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:29,680
you know computational ability that's
 

3163
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,589
you know computational ability that's
that's an important feature that's

3164
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
that's an important feature that's
 

3165
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,589
that's an important feature that's
that's the sort of the the bedrock on

3166
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
that's the sort of the the bedrock on
 

3167
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,190
that's the sort of the the bedrock on
which we can construct the things we

3168
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
which we can construct the things we
 

3169
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,630
which we can construct the things we
construct now the fact that we have this

3170
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
construct now the fact that we have this
 

3171
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,870
construct now the fact that we have this
experience of the world that has the

3172
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:40,880
experience of the world that has the
 

3173
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,470
experience of the world that has the
single thread of time and computational

3174
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
single thread of time and computational
 

3175
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,789
single thread of time and computational
boundedness the thing that i sort of

3176
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:44,799
boundedness the thing that i sort of
 

3177
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:45,990
boundedness the thing that i sort of
realized is

3178
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
realized is
 

3179
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,630
realized is
it's that that causes us

3180
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
it's that that causes us
 

3181
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,270
it's that that causes us
to deduce from this irreducible mess of

3182
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
to deduce from this irreducible mess of
 

3183
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,510
to deduce from this irreducible mess of
what's going on in the physical world

3184
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
what's going on in the physical world
 

3185
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,710
what's going on in the physical world
the laws of physics that we think exist

3186
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
the laws of physics that we think exist
 

3187
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,750
the laws of physics that we think exist
so in other words if we say why do we

3188
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
so in other words if we say why do we
 

3189
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,390
so in other words if we say why do we
believe that there is you know

3190
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
believe that there is you know
 

3191
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,390
believe that there is you know
continuous space let's say why do we

3192
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
continuous space let's say why do we
 

3193
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,470
continuous space let's say why do we
believe that gravity works the way it

3194
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
believe that gravity works the way it
 

3195
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,349
believe that gravity works the way it
does

3196
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
does
 

3197
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,390
does
well in principle we could be kind of

3198
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
well in principle we could be kind of
 

3199
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,710
well in principle we could be kind of
parsing details of the universe

3200
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
parsing details of the universe
 

3201
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,670
parsing details of the universe
that were uh you know that

3202
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
that were uh you know that
 

3203
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,950
that were uh you know that
okay the analogy is uh again with

3204
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
okay the analogy is uh again with
 

3205
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,109
okay the analogy is uh again with
the you know statistical mechanics and

3206
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
the you know statistical mechanics and
 

3207
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,230
the you know statistical mechanics and
molecules in a box we could be sensitive

3208
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
molecules in a box we could be sensitive
 

3209
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,069
molecules in a box we could be sensitive
to every little detail of the swirling

3210
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
to every little detail of the swirling
 

3211
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,750
to every little detail of the swirling
around those molecules and we could say

3212
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
around those molecules and we could say
 

3213
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,430
around those molecules and we could say
what really matters

3214
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
what really matters
 

3215
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,829
what really matters
is the you know the wiggle effect yes

3216
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
is the you know the wiggle effect yes
 

3217
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,430
is the you know the wiggle effect yes
that is um you know that is something

3218
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440
that is um you know that is something
 

3219
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,430
that is um you know that is something
that we humans just never notice because

3220
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
that we humans just never notice because
 

3221
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,430
that we humans just never notice because
it's some weird thing that happens when

3222
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
it's some weird thing that happens when
 

3223
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,309
it's some weird thing that happens when
there are 15 collisions of air molecules

3224
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:40,319
there are 15 collisions of air molecules
 

3225
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,910
there are 15 collisions of air molecules
and this happens and that happens we

3226
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
and this happens and that happens we
 

3227
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,309
and this happens and that happens we
just see the pure motion of a ball yeah

3228
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
just see the pure motion of a ball yeah
 

3229
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,109
just see the pure motion of a ball yeah
moving about right why do we see that

3230
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:47,119
moving about right why do we see that
 

3231
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,589
moving about right why do we see that
right and the point is that that what

3232
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
right and the point is that that what
 

3233
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,230
right and the point is that that what
seems to be the case is that the things

3234
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
seems to be the case is that the things
 

3235
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,470
seems to be the case is that the things
that if if we say given this sort of

3236
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
that if if we say given this sort of
 

3237
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,230
that if if we say given this sort of
hypergraph that's updating and all the

3238
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
hypergraph that's updating and all the
 

3239
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,950
hypergraph that's updating and all the
details about all the sort of uh sort of

3240
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
details about all the sort of uh sort of
 

3241
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,470
details about all the sort of uh sort of
atoms of space and what they do and we

3242
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
atoms of space and what they do and we
 

3243
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,870
atoms of space and what they do and we
say how do we slice that to what we can

3244
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
say how do we slice that to what we can
 

3245
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,870
say how do we slice that to what we can
be sensitive to what seems to be the

3246
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
be sensitive to what seems to be the
 

3247
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,270
be sensitive to what seems to be the
case is that as soon as we assume

3248
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
case is that as soon as we assume
 

3249
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,510
case is that as soon as we assume
you know computational boundedness

3250
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
you know computational boundedness
 

3251
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,750
you know computational boundedness

00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
general relativity in other words we
 

3255
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,270
general relativity in other words we
can't avoid that that that's the way

3256
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280
can't avoid that that that's the way
 

3257
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,309
can't avoid that that that's the way
that we we will parse the universe given

3258
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
that we we will parse the universe given
 

3259
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,630
that we we will parse the universe given
those constraints we parse the universe

3260
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
those constraints we parse the universe
 

3261
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,829
those constraints we parse the universe
according to

00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:21,839
according to

00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,789
those particular uh
in such a way that we say the aggregate

3266
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
in such a way that we say the aggregate
 

3267
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,549
in such a way that we say the aggregate

00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:37,920
irreducible ocean of behavior is just
 

3277
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,190
irreducible ocean of behavior is just
this one that corresponds to general

3278
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
this one that corresponds to general
 

3279
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,950
this one that corresponds to general
relativity yeah but we don't perceive

3280
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
relativity yeah but we don't perceive
 

3281
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,789
relativity yeah but we don't perceive
general relativity

3282
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799
general relativity
 

3283
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,270
general relativity
well we do if we do fancy experiments so

3284
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
well we do if we do fancy experiments so
 

3285
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,349
well we do if we do fancy experiments so
you're saying so perceive really does

3286
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
you're saying so perceive really does
 

3287
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,190
you're saying so perceive really does
mean the force we drop something that's

3288
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:49,200
mean the force we drop something that's
 

3289
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,630
mean the force we drop something that's
a that's a great example of general

3290
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
a that's a great example of general
 

3291
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,470
a that's a great example of general
relativity in action the graph no but

3292
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:52,480
relativity in action the graph no but
 

3293
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,990
relativity in action the graph no but
like what's the difference between that

3294
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
like what's the difference between that
 

3295
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,829
like what's the difference between that
and newtonian mechanics i mean oh it

3296
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:55,839
and newtonian mechanics i mean oh it
 

3297
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,150
and newtonian mechanics i mean oh it
doesn't i this is i when i say general

3298
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
doesn't i this is i when i say general
 

3299
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,549
doesn't i this is i when i say general
relativity that's gravity uber the uber

3300
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
relativity that's gravity uber the uber
 

3301
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,950
relativity that's gravity uber the uber
theory so to speak i mean newtonian

3302
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
theory so to speak i mean newtonian
 

3303
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,349
theory so to speak i mean newtonian
gravity is just the approximation that

3304
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
gravity is just the approximation that
 

3305
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,870
gravity is just the approximation that
we can make you know

3306
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
we can make you know
 

3307
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,109
we can make you know
on the earth and things like that so so

3308
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
on the earth and things like that so so
 

3309
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,710
on the earth and things like that so so
this is you know the phenomenon of

3310
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
this is you know the phenomenon of
 

3311
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,630
this is you know the phenomenon of
gravity is one that is a consequence of

3312
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
gravity is one that is a consequence of
 

3313
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,470
gravity is one that is a consequence of
you know we would perceive something

3314
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
you know we would perceive something
 

3315
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,470
you know we would perceive something
very different from gravity so so the

3316
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,480
very different from gravity so so the
 

3317
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,430
very different from gravity so so the
way to understand that is when we think

3318
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
way to understand that is when we think
 

3319
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,150
way to understand that is when we think
about okay so

3320
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,160
about okay so
 

3321
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,710
about okay so
we make up reference frames with which

3322
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
we make up reference frames with which
 

3323
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,549
we make up reference frames with which
we parse what's happening in space and

3324
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
we parse what's happening in space and
 

3325
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,349
we parse what's happening in space and
time

3326
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
time
 

3327
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,270
time
so in other words one of the one of the

3328
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
so in other words one of the one of the
 

3329
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,630
so in other words one of the one of the
things that we do

3330
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
things that we do
 

3331
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,549
things that we do
is we say

3332
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
is we say
 

3333
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,309
is we say
as time progresses

3334
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
as time progresses
 

3335
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,630
as time progresses
uh everywhere in space

3336
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
uh everywhere in space
 

3337
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,710
uh everywhere in space
is something happens at a particular

3338
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
is something happens at a particular
 

3339
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,870
is something happens at a particular
time and then we go to the next time and

3340
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
time and then we go to the next time and
 

3341
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,390
time and then we go to the next time and
we say this is what space is like at the

3342
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:44,400
we say this is what space is like at the
 

3343
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,829
we say this is what space is like at the
next time there's what space is like at

3344
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
next time there's what space is like at
 

3345
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,109
next time there's what space is like at
the next time

3346
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:47,119
the next time
 

3347
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,150
the next time
that's it's the reason we are used to

3348
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:50,160
that's it's the reason we are used to
 

3349
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,349
that's it's the reason we are used to
doing that

3350
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
doing that
 

3351
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,589
doing that
is because you know when we look around

3352
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:53,599
is because you know when we look around
 

3353
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,789
is because you know when we look around
we might see you know 10 100 meters away

3354
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
we might see you know 10 100 meters away
 

3355
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,190
we might see you know 10 100 meters away
um the time it takes light to travel

3356
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,200
um the time it takes light to travel
 

3357
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,349
um the time it takes light to travel
that distance is really short compared

3358
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:01,359
that distance is really short compared
 

3359
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,190
that distance is really short compared
to the time it takes our brains to know

3360
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
to the time it takes our brains to know
 

3361
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,190
to the time it takes our brains to know
what happened so as far as our brains

3362
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
what happened so as far as our brains
 

3363
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,430
what happened so as far as our brains
are concerned we are parsing the

3364
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
are concerned we are parsing the
 

3365
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,829
are concerned we are parsing the
universe in this there is a moment in

3366
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
universe in this there is a moment in
 

3367
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,910
universe in this there is a moment in
time it's all of space there's a moment

3368
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
time it's all of space there's a moment
 

3369
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,069
time it's all of space there's a moment
in time it's all of space you know if we

3370
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
in time it's all of space you know if we
 

3371
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,150
in time it's all of space you know if we
were the size of planets or something we

3372
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
were the size of planets or something we
 

3373
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,190
were the size of planets or something we
would have a different perception

3374
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
would have a different perception
 

3375
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,309
would have a different perception
because the speed of light would be much

3376
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:18,319
because the speed of light would be much
 

3377
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,309
because the speed of light would be much
more important to us we wouldn't have

3378
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
more important to us we wouldn't have
 

3379
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,710
more important to us we wouldn't have
this perception that

3380
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
this perception that
 

3381
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,950
this perception that
things happen progressively in time

3382
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:24,960
things happen progressively in time
 

3383
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,789
things happen progressively in time
everywhere in space

3384
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:26,799
everywhere in space
 

3385
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,150
everywhere in space
and so that's an important kind of

3386
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,160
and so that's an important kind of
 

3387
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,230
and so that's an important kind of
constraint and the reason that we kind

3388
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
constraint and the reason that we kind
 

3389
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,470
constraint and the reason that we kind
of parse the universe in the way that

3390
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,480
of parse the universe in the way that
 

3391
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,789
of parse the universe in the way that
causes us to say gravity works the way

3392
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
causes us to say gravity works the way
 

3393
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,950
causes us to say gravity works the way
it does is because we're doing things

3394
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
it does is because we're doing things
 

3395
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,510
it does is because we're doing things
like deciding that we can say the

3396
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,520
like deciding that we can say the
 

3397
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,150
like deciding that we can say the
universe exists space has a definite

3398
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,160
universe exists space has a definite
 

3399
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,430
universe exists space has a definite
structure

3400
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
structure
 

3401
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,349
structure
there is a moment in time space has this

3402
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:45,359
there is a moment in time space has this
 

3403
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,109
there is a moment in time space has this
definite structure we move to the next

3404
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
definite structure we move to the next
 

3405
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,470
definite structure we move to the next
moment in time space as another

3406
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,480
moment in time space as another
 

3407
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,190
moment in time space as another
structure that kind of set up is what

3408
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
structure that kind of set up is what
 

3409
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,510
structure that kind of set up is what
lets us kind of deduce

3410
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:53,520
lets us kind of deduce
 

3411
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,069
lets us kind of deduce
kind of what to parse the universe in

3412
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
kind of what to parse the universe in
 

3413
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,390
kind of what to parse the universe in
such a way that we say gravity works the

3414
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
such a way that we say gravity works the
 

3415
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,030
such a way that we say gravity works the
way it does so uh that kind of reference

3416
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,040
way it does so uh that kind of reference
 

3417
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,230
way it does so uh that kind of reference
frame is that the illusion of that is

3418
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,240
frame is that the illusion of that is
 

3419
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,190
frame is that the illusion of that is
that

3420
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:05,200
that
 

3421
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,349
that
you're saying that somehow useful for

3422
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
you're saying that somehow useful for
 

3423
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,789
you're saying that somehow useful for
consciousness

3424
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
consciousness
 

3425
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,789
consciousness
that's what consciousness does because

3426
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:10,799
that's what consciousness does because
 

3427
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,109
that's what consciousness does because
in a sense what consciousness is doing

3428
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,119
in a sense what consciousness is doing
 

3429
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,430
in a sense what consciousness is doing
is there are uh

3430
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
is there are uh
 

3431
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,309
is there are uh
it's it's insisting that the universe is

3432
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
it's it's insisting that the universe is
 

3433
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,030
it's it's insisting that the universe is
kind of sequentialized right that is um

3434
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
kind of sequentialized right that is um
 

3435
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,270
kind of sequentialized right that is um
and it is not allowing the possibility

3436
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
and it is not allowing the possibility
 

3437
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,710
and it is not allowing the possibility
that oh there are these multiple threads

3438
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
that oh there are these multiple threads
 

3439
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,309
that oh there are these multiple threads
of time and they're all flowing

3440
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
of time and they're all flowing
 

3441
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,950
of time and they're all flowing
differently it's like saying no you know

3442
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
differently it's like saying no you know
 

3443
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,750
differently it's like saying no you know
everything is happening in this one

3444
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
everything is happening in this one
 

3445
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,589
everything is happening in this one
thread of experience that we have and

3446
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
thread of experience that we have and
 

3447
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,349
thread of experience that we have and
that illusion of that one thread of

3448
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
that illusion of that one thread of
 

3449
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,030
that illusion of that one thread of
experience cannot happen at the

3450
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
experience cannot happen at the
 

3451
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,430
experience cannot happen at the
planetary scale so are you saying

3452
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
planetary scale so are you saying
 

3453
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,750
planetary scale so are you saying
typical human are you saying we are at a

3454
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
typical human are you saying we are at a
 

3455
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,910
typical human are you saying we are at a
human level especially

3456
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
human level especially
 

3457
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,390
human level especially
here for consciousness like well for our

3458
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
here for consciousness like well for our
 

3459
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,230
here for consciousness like well for our
kind of consciousness it's it's uh you

3460
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
kind of consciousness it's it's uh you
 

3461
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,390
kind of consciousness it's it's uh you
know if we existed at a scale close to

3462
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
know if we existed at a scale close to
 

3463
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,470
know if we existed at a scale close to
the elementary length for example then

3464
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:52,480
the elementary length for example then
 

3465
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,910
the elementary length for example then
our perception of the universe will be

3466
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
our perception of the universe will be
 

3467
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,990
our perception of the universe will be
absurdly different okay so but this

3468
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
absurdly different okay so but this
 

3469
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,750
absurdly different okay so but this
makes this consciousness seem like a

3470
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
makes this consciousness seem like a
 

3471
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,349
makes this consciousness seem like a
weird side effect to this particular

3472
00:59:59,349 --> 00:59:59,359
weird side effect to this particular
 

3473
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,549
weird side effect to this particular
scale

3474
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
scale
 

3475
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,630
scale
and so who cares i mean

3476
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
and so who cares i mean
 

3477
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,109
and so who cares i mean
consciousness is not that special i i

3478
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
consciousness is not that special i i
 

3479
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,870
consciousness is not that special i i
think look i think that a very

3480
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:06,880
think look i think that a very
 

3481
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,390
think look i think that a very
interesting question is which i've

3482
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
interesting question is which i've
 

3483
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,150
interesting question is which i've
certainly thought a little bit about

3484
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
certainly thought a little bit about
 

3485
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,230
certainly thought a little bit about
is what can you imagine what is a sort

3486
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,240
is what can you imagine what is a sort
 

3487
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,430
is what can you imagine what is a sort
of factoring of something you know what

3488
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
of factoring of something you know what
 

3489
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,270
of factoring of something you know what
are some other possible ways you could

3490
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,280
are some other possible ways you could
 

3491
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,829
are some other possible ways you could
exist so to speak right and you know if

3492
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:19,839
exist so to speak right and you know if
 

3493
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,710
exist so to speak right and you know if
you were a photon if you were sort of

3494
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
you were a photon if you were sort of
 

3495
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,390
you were a photon if you were sort of
you know some kind of thing that was

3496
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
you know some kind of thing that was
 

3497
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,829
you know some kind of thing that was
some uh kind of you know

3498
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:26,839
some uh kind of you know
 

3499
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,030
some uh kind of you know
intelligence represented in terms of

3500
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
intelligence represented in terms of
 

3501
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,069
intelligence represented in terms of
photons you know for example the photons

3502
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
photons you know for example the photons
 

3503
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,670
photons you know for example the photons
we receive in the cosmic microwave

3504
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
we receive in the cosmic microwave
 

3505
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,670
we receive in the cosmic microwave
background those photons as far as

3506
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:35,680
background those photons as far as
 

3507
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,950
background those photons as far as
they're concerned the universe just

3508
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
they're concerned the universe just
 

3509
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,510
they're concerned the universe just
started they they they were emitted you

know 100 000 years after the beginning

3512
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
know 100 000 years after the beginning
 

3513

of the universe they've been traveling

3514
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
of the universe they've been traveling

at the speed of light time stayed still
 

3517
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,710
at the speed of light time stayed still
for them and then they just arrived and

3518
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
for them and then they just arrived and
 

3519
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,430
for them and then they just arrived and
we just detected them so for them the

3520
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
we just detected them so for them the
 

3521
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,349
we just detected them so for them the
universe just started and that's a

3522
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:51,359
universe just started and that's a
 

3523
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,430
universe just started and that's a
different perception of you know that

3524
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
different perception of you know that
 

3525
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,190
different perception of you know that
has implications for a very different

3526
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
has implications for a very different
 

3527
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,789
has implications for a very different
perception of time they don't have that

3528
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
perception of time they don't have that
 

3529
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,270
perception of time they don't have that
single thread that seems to be

3530
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
single thread that seems to be
 

3531
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,710
single thread that seems to be
really important for being able to tell

3532
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,720
really important for being able to tell
 

3533
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,349
really important for being able to tell
a heck of a good story so we humans

3534
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:03,359
a heck of a good story so we humans
 

3535
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,109
a heck of a good story so we humans
we can tell a story

3536
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:05,119
we can tell a story
 

3537
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,630
we can tell a story
right we can tell a story what other

3538
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
right we can tell a story what other
 

3539
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,870
right we can tell a story what other
kind of stories can you tell so photon

3540
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
kind of stories can you tell so photon
 

3541
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,950
kind of stories can you tell so photon
is a really boring story

3542
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
is a really boring story
 

3543
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,870
is a really boring story
yeah i mean so that's a i don't know if

3544
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:12,880
yeah i mean so that's a i don't know if
 

3545
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,390
yeah i mean so that's a i don't know if
they're a boring story but i i think

3546
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
they're a boring story but i i think
 

3547
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,390
they're a boring story but i i think
it's you know i've been wondering about

3548
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
it's you know i've been wondering about
 

3549
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,069
it's you know i've been wondering about
this and i've been asking you know

3550
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,079
this and i've been asking you know
 

3551
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,270
this and i've been asking you know
friends of mine who are science fiction

3552
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
friends of mine who are science fiction
 

3553
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,470
friends of mine who are science fiction
writers and things have you written

3554
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
writers and things have you written
 

3555
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,069
writers and things have you written
stuff about this and i've got one

3556
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
stuff about this and i've got one
 

3557
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,990
stuff about this and i've got one
example good great great

3558

rooker which were um uh which i have to

3562
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,480
rooker which were um uh which i have to
 

3563
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,430
rooker which were um uh which i have to
say the um they're books about uh that

3564
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
say the um they're books about uh that
 

3565
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,270
say the um they're books about uh that
are very informed by a bunch of science

3566
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:33,280
are very informed by a bunch of science
 

3567
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,109
are very informed by a bunch of science
that i've done and the thing that i

that i've done and the thing that i
 

3569
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,190
that i've done and the thing that i
really loved about them is you know you

3570
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
really loved about them is you know you
 

3571
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,270
really loved about them is you know you
know in the in the first chapter of the

3572
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
know in the in the first chapter of the
 

3573
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,510
know in the in the first chapter of the
of the book the the earth is consumed by

3574
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
of the book the the earth is consumed by
 

3575
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,349
of the book the the earth is consumed by
these things he called nance which are

3576
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
these things he called nance which are
 

3577
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,789
these things he called nance which are
nano nanobot type things and

3578
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
nano nanobot type things and
 

3579
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,390
nano nanobot type things and
but so you know so the earth is gone in

3580
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400
but so you know so the earth is gone in
 

3581
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,390
but so you know so the earth is gone in
the first but then it comes back but but

3582
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
the first but then it comes back but but
 

3583
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,470
the first but then it comes back but but
um but then spoiler alert yeah right

3584
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:52,480
um but then spoiler alert yeah right
 

3585
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,069
um but then spoiler alert yeah right
that was uh that was only a microspot

3586
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:54,079
that was uh that was only a microspot
 

3587
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,710
that was uh that was only a microspot
it's only chapter one okay it's it's um

3588
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
it's only chapter one okay it's it's um
 

3589
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,829
it's only chapter one okay it's it's um
the but but uh the thing that um is is

3590
01:01:59,829 --> 01:01:59,839
the but but uh the thing that um is is
 

3591
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,589
the but but uh the thing that um is is
not a real spoiler alert because it's

3592
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:01,599
not a real spoiler alert because it's
 

3593
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,829
not a real spoiler alert because it's
such a complicated concept but but in

3594
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
such a complicated concept but but in
 

3595
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,710
such a complicated concept but but in
the end in the end the the earth is

3596
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
the end in the end the the earth is
 

3597
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,309
the end in the end the the earth is
saved by this thing called the principle

3598
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
saved by this thing called the principle
 

3599
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,910
saved by this thing called the principle
of computational equivalence which is a

3600
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
of computational equivalence which is a
 

3601
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,630
of computational equivalence which is a
kind of a core scientific idea of mine

3602
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,640
kind of a core scientific idea of mine
 

3603
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,789
kind of a core scientific idea of mine
and i was just like like thrilled i i

3604
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
and i was just like like thrilled i i
 

3605
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,950
and i was just like like thrilled i i
don't read fiction books very often um

3606
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
don't read fiction books very often um
 

3607
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,470
don't read fiction books very often um
and i was just thrilled i get to the end

3608
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
and i was just thrilled i get to the end
 

3609
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,549
and i was just thrilled i get to the end
of this and it's like oh my gosh you

3610
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
of this and it's like oh my gosh you
 

3611
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,630
of this and it's like oh my gosh you
know everything is saved by this sort of

3612
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
know everything is saved by this sort of
 

3613
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,630
know everything is saved by this sort of
deep scientific principle can you can

3614
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
deep scientific principle can you can
 

3615
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,710
deep scientific principle can you can
you maybe elaborate how the principle of

3616
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
you maybe elaborate how the principle of
 

3617
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,750
you maybe elaborate how the principle of
computational equivalence

3618
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:29,760
computational equivalence
 

3619
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,270
computational equivalence
can save

3620
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
can save
 

3621
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,870
can save
a planet

3622
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
a planet
 

3623
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,549
a planet
that would that would be a have a

3624
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
that would that would be a have a
 

3625
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,230
that would that would be a have a
terrible spoiler for me that would be a

3626
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
terrible spoiler for me that would be a
 

3627
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,309
terrible spoiler for me that would be a
spoiler okay yeah but but no but let me

3628
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:38,319
spoiler okay yeah but but no but let me
 

3629
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,589
spoiler okay yeah but but no but let me
say what the principle of computational

3630
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
say what the principle of computational
 

3631
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,950
say what the principle of computational
equivalence is

3632
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
equivalence is
 

3633
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,990
equivalence is
um

3634
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
um
 

3635
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,589
um
so the question is

3636
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:43,599
so the question is
 

3637
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,630
so the question is
you are

3638
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
you are
 

3639
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,789
you are
you have a system you have some rule

3640
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
you have a system you have some rule
 

3641
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,309
you have a system you have some rule
you can think of its behavior as

3642
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
you can think of its behavior as
 

3643
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,230
you can think of its behavior as
corresponding to a computation

3644
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
corresponding to a computation
 

3645
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,990
corresponding to a computation
the question is how sophisticated is

3646
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
the question is how sophisticated is
 

3647
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,430
the question is how sophisticated is
that computation

3648
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
that computation
 

3649
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,630
that computation
the statement of the principle of

3650
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
the statement of the principle of
 

3651
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,950
the statement of the principle of
computational equivalence is as soon as

3652
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
computational equivalence is as soon as
 

3653
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,670
computational equivalence is as soon as
it's it's not obviously simple it will

3654
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
it's it's not obviously simple it will
 

3655
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,990
it's it's not obviously simple it will
be as sophisticated as anything and so

3656
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
be as sophisticated as anything and so
 

3657
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,910
be as sophisticated as anything and so
that has the implication that you know

3658
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:03,920
that has the implication that you know
 

3659
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,670
that has the implication that you know
rule 30

3660
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
rule 30
 

3661
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,349
rule 30
you know our brains

3662
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
you know our brains
 

3663
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,349
you know our brains
other things in physics they're all

3664
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:09,359
other things in physics they're all
 

3665
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,549
other things in physics they're all
ultimately equivalent in the

3666
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,559
ultimately equivalent in the
 

3667
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,710
ultimately equivalent in the
computations they can do and that's what

3668
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:12,720
computations they can do and that's what
 

3669
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,829
computations they can do and that's what
leads to this computational

3670
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
leads to this computational
 

3671
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,150
leads to this computational
irreducibility idea because the reason

3672
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
irreducibility idea because the reason
 

3673
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,630
irreducibility idea because the reason
we don't get to jump ahead you know and

3674
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
we don't get to jump ahead you know and
 

3675
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,109
we don't get to jump ahead you know and
out think rule 30 is because we're just

3676
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:21,119
out think rule 30 is because we're just
 

3677
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,270
out think rule 30 is because we're just
computationally equivalent to rule 30 so

3678
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,280
computationally equivalent to rule 30 so
 

3679
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,190
computationally equivalent to rule 30 so
we're kind of just both just running

3680
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
we're kind of just both just running
 

3681
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,549
we're kind of just both just running
computations

3682
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
computations
 

3683
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,190
computations
that are the same sort of raw the same

3684
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
that are the same sort of raw the same
 

3685
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,109
that are the same sort of raw the same
level of computation so to speak so

3686
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
level of computation so to speak so
 

3687
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,430
level of computation so to speak so
that's kind of the the idea there and

3688
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
that's kind of the the idea there and
 

3689
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,470
that's kind of the the idea there and
the question i mean it's it's like uh

3690
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
the question i mean it's it's like uh
 

3691
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,109
the question i mean it's it's like uh
the you know in in the science fiction

3692
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
the you know in in the science fiction
 

3693
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,349
the you know in in the science fiction
version would be okay somebody says we

3694
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:41,359
version would be okay somebody says we
 

3695
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,270
version would be okay somebody says we
just need more servers get us more

3696
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
just need more servers get us more
 

3697
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,670
just need more servers get us more
servers the way to get even more servers

3698
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
servers the way to get even more servers
 

3699
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,309
servers the way to get even more servers
is turn the whole planet into a bunch of

3700
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
is turn the whole planet into a bunch of
 

3701
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,829
is turn the whole planet into a bunch of
micro servers

3702
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:49,839
micro servers
 

3703
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,750
micro servers
and that that's uh that's where it

3704
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
and that that's uh that's where it
 

3705
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,069
and that that's uh that's where it
starts and so the question of you know

3706
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:54,079
starts and so the question of you know
 

3707
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,589
starts and so the question of you know
computational equivalence principle of

3708
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
computational equivalence principle of
 

3709
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,870
computational equivalence principle of
computational equivalence is well

3710
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:56,880
computational equivalence is well
 

3711
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,950
computational equivalence is well
actually you don't need to build those

3712
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
actually you don't need to build those
 

3713
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,870
actually you don't need to build those
custom servers actually you can uh you

3714
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
custom servers actually you can uh you
 

3715
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,230
custom servers actually you can uh you
can just

3716
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
can just
 

3717
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,349
can just
use natural computation to compute

3718
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:07,359
use natural computation to compute
 

3719
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,270
use natural computation to compute
things so to speak you can use nature to

3720
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,280
things so to speak you can use nature to
 

3721
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,270
things so to speak you can use nature to
compute you don't need to have done all

3722
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:11,280
compute you don't need to have done all
 

3723
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,950
compute you don't need to have done all
that engineering i mean it's kind of the

3724
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
that engineering i mean it's kind of the
 

3725
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,630
that engineering i mean it's kind of the
it's it's kind of feels a little

3726
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
it's it's kind of feels a little
 

3727
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,390
it's it's kind of feels a little
disappointing that you say we're going

3728
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
disappointing that you say we're going
 

3729
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,069
disappointing that you say we're going
to build all these servers we're going

3730
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
to build all these servers we're going
 

3731
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,270
to build all these servers we're going
to do all these things we're going to

3732
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,280
to do all these things we're going to
 

3733
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,510
to do all these things we're going to
make you know maybe we're going to have

3734
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
make you know maybe we're going to have
 

3735
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,829
make you know maybe we're going to have
human consciousness uploaded into you

3736
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:23,839
human consciousness uploaded into you
 

3737
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,069
human consciousness uploaded into you
know some elaborate digital environment

3738
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
know some elaborate digital environment
 

3739
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,510
know some elaborate digital environment
and then you look at that thing and you

3740
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
and then you look at that thing and you
 

3741
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,510
and then you look at that thing and you
say it's got electrons moving around

3742
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
say it's got electrons moving around
 

3743
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,029
say it's got electrons moving around
just like in a rock

3744
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:31,039
just like in a rock
 

3745
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,150
just like in a rock
and then you say well what's the

3746
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
and then you say well what's the
 

3747
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,750
and then you say well what's the
difference and the principle of

3748
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:33,760
difference and the principle of
 

3749
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,750
difference and the principle of
computational equivalence says there

3750
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
computational equivalence says there
 

3751
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,549
computational equivalence says there
isn't at some level a fundamental you

3752
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
isn't at some level a fundamental you
 

3753
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,190
isn't at some level a fundamental you
know you can't say mathematically

3754
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:41,200
know you can't say mathematically
 

3755
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,910
know you can't say mathematically
there's a fundamental difference between

3756
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:43,920
there's a fundamental difference between
 

3757
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,510
there's a fundamental difference between
the rock that is the future of human

3758
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
the rock that is the future of human
 

3759
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,670
the rock that is the future of human
consciousness and the rock that's just a

3760
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,680
consciousness and the rock that's just a
 

3761
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,549
consciousness and the rock that's just a
rock

3762
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
rock
 

3763
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,950
rock
now what i've sort of realized with this

3764
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
now what i've sort of realized with this
 

3765
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,510
now what i've sort of realized with this
kind of consciousness thing is there is

3766
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
kind of consciousness thing is there is
 

3767
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,390
kind of consciousness thing is there is
a there is an aspect of this that seems

3768
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
a there is an aspect of this that seems
 

3769
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,109
a there is an aspect of this that seems
to be more special that isn't and and

3770
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
to be more special that isn't and and
 

3771
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,789
to be more special that isn't and and
for example something i i haven't really

3772
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
for example something i i haven't really
 

3773

for example something i i haven't really
teased apart properly is when it comes

3774
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
teased apart properly is when it comes
 

3775
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,549
teased apart properly is when it comes
to something like the weather and the

3776
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:04,559
to something like the weather and the
 

3777
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,910
to something like the weather and the
weather having a mind of its own or

01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:10,319
magnetosphere acting like a sort of
 

3783
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,950
magnetosphere acting like a sort of
intelligent thing how does that relate

3784
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:12,960
intelligent thing how does that relate
 

3785
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,710
intelligent thing how does that relate
to you know how how do how is that

3786
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
to you know how how do how is that
 

3787
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,190
to you know how how do how is that
that entity related to the kind of

that entity related to the kind of
 

3789
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,349
that entity related to the kind of

consciousness that we have and sort of
 

3791
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,109

what would the world look like you know

3792
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
what would the world look like you know
 

3793
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,870
what would the world look like you know
to the weather if we think about the

3794
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:24,880
to the weather if we think about the
 

3795
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,549
to the weather if we think about the
weather as a mind

3796
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
weather as a mind
 

3797
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,549
weather as a mind
what will it perceive what will it laws

3798
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
what will it perceive what will it laws
 

3799
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,710
what will it perceive what will it laws
its laws of physics be i don't really

3800
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
its laws of physics be i don't really
 

3801
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,670
its laws of physics be i don't really
know

3802
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
know
 

3803
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,750
know
because it's very parallel it's very

3804
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
because it's very parallel it's very
 

3805
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,910
because it's very parallel it's very
parallel among other things and it it

3806
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:35,920
parallel among other things and it it
 

3807
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,870
parallel among other things and it it
it's not obvious i mean this is a a

3808
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
it's not obvious i mean this is a a
 

3809
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,390
it's not obvious i mean this is a a
really kind of mind-bending thing

3810
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
really kind of mind-bending thing
 

3811
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,390
really kind of mind-bending thing
because we've got to try and imagine

3812
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,400
because we've got to try and imagine
 

3813
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,190
because we've got to try and imagine
where

3814
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
where
 

3815
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,789
where
uh you know we've got to try and imagine

3816
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:44,799
uh you know we've got to try and imagine
 

3817
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,549
uh you know we've got to try and imagine
a parsing of the universe different from

3818
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
a parsing of the universe different from
 

3819
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,950
a parsing of the universe different from
the one we have and by the way when we

3820
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:48,960
the one we have and by the way when we
 

3821
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,150
the one we have and by the way when we
think about extraterrestrial

3822
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
think about extraterrestrial
 

3823
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,390
think about extraterrestrial
intelligence and so on i think that's

3824
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
intelligence and so on i think that's
 

3825
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,109
intelligence and so on i think that's
kind of the key thing is you know we've

3826
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:55,119
kind of the key thing is you know we've
 

3827
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,430
kind of the key thing is you know we've
always assumed i've always assumed okay

3828
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:57,440
always assumed i've always assumed okay
 

3829
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,270
always assumed i've always assumed okay
the extraterrestrials at least they have

3830
01:05:59,270 --> 01:05:59,280
the extraterrestrials at least they have
 

3831
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,950
the extraterrestrials at least they have
the same physics we all live in the same

3832
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:00,960
the same physics we all live in the same
 

3833
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,270
the same physics we all live in the same
universe they've got the same physics

3834
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,280
universe they've got the same physics
 

3835
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,950
universe they've got the same physics
but actually that's not really right

3836
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
but actually that's not really right
 

3837
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,750
but actually that's not really right
because the extraterrestrials could have

3838
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
because the extraterrestrials could have
 

3839
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,309
because the extraterrestrials could have
a completely different way of parsing

3840
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
a completely different way of parsing
 

3841
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,630
a completely different way of parsing
that the universe so it's as if you know

3842
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
that the universe so it's as if you know
 

3843
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,549
that the universe so it's as if you know
there could be for all we know right

3844
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
there could be for all we know right
 

3845
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,150
there could be for all we know right
here in this room you know in the in the

3846
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
here in this room you know in the in the
 

3847
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,670
here in this room you know in the in the
details of the motion of these gas

3848
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:17,680
details of the motion of these gas
 

3849
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,230
details of the motion of these gas
molecules there could be an amazing

3850
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,240
molecules there could be an amazing
 

3851
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,870
molecules there could be an amazing
intelligence that we were like but we

3852
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
intelligence that we were like but we
 

3853
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,589
intelligence that we were like but we
have no way of we're not parsing the

3854
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
have no way of we're not parsing the
 

3855
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,109
have no way of we're not parsing the
universe in the same way if only we

3856
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
universe in the same way if only we
 

3857
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,870
universe in the same way if only we
could parse the universe in the right

3858
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
could parse the universe in the right
 

3859
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,750
could parse the universe in the right
way you know immediately this amazing

3860
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
way you know immediately this amazing
 

3861
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,589
way you know immediately this amazing
thing that's going on and this you know

3862
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
thing that's going on and this you know
 

3863
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,109
thing that's going on and this you know
huge culture that's developed and all

3864
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
huge culture that's developed and all
 

3865
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,710
huge culture that's developed and all
that kind of thing would be obvious to

3866
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
that kind of thing would be obvious to
 

3867
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,309
that kind of thing would be obvious to
us but it's not because we have a

3868
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:38,319
us but it's not because we have a
 

3869
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,750
us but it's not because we have a
particular way of passing the universe

3870
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760
particular way of passing the universe
 

3871
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,230
particular way of passing the universe
would that thing also have us

3872
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
would that thing also have us
 

3873
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,829
would that thing also have us
agency i don't know the right word to

3874
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
agency i don't know the right word to
 

3875
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,910
agency i don't know the right word to
use but something like consciousness but

3876
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:45,920
use but something like consciousness but
 

3877
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,990
use but something like consciousness but
a different kind of consciousness

3878
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
a different kind of consciousness
 

3879
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,349
a different kind of consciousness
i think it's a question of just what you

3880
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:49,359
i think it's a question of just what you
 

3881
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,950
i think it's a question of just what you
mean by the word because i think that

3882
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
mean by the word because i think that
 

3883
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,470
mean by the word because i think that
the you know this notion of

3884
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
the you know this notion of
 

3885
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,230
the you know this notion of
consciousness and the

3886
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
consciousness and the
 

3887
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,750
consciousness and the
okay so some people think of

3888
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:55,760
okay so some people think of
 

3889
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,670
okay so some people think of
consciousness as sort of a key aspect of

3890
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:57,680
consciousness as sort of a key aspect of
 

3891
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,710
consciousness as sort of a key aspect of
it is that we feel that

3892
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
it is that we feel that
 

3893
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,270
it is that we feel that
the the sort of a feeling of that we

3894
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,280
the the sort of a feeling of that we
 

3895
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,349
the the sort of a feeling of that we
exist in some way that we have this

3896
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
exist in some way that we have this
 

3897
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,990
exist in some way that we have this
intrinsic feeling about ourselves

3898
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
intrinsic feeling about ourselves
 

3899
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,510
intrinsic feeling about ourselves
you know i i suspect that any of these

3900
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
you know i i suspect that any of these
 

3901
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,349
you know i i suspect that any of these
things would also have an intrinsic

3902
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:13,359
things would also have an intrinsic
 

3903
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,630
things would also have an intrinsic
feeling about themselves i've been sort

3904
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
feeling about themselves i've been sort
 

3905
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,309
feeling about themselves i've been sort
of trying to think recently about

3906
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
of trying to think recently about
 

3907
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,789
of trying to think recently about
constructing an experiment about what if

3908
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
constructing an experiment about what if
 

3909
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,230
constructing an experiment about what if
you were just a piece of a cellular

3910
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,240
you were just a piece of a cellular
 

3911
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,549
you were just a piece of a cellular
automaton let's say you know what would

3912
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:22,559
automaton let's say you know what would
 

3913
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,109
automaton let's say you know what would
your feeling about yourself actually be

3914
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
your feeling about yourself actually be
 

3915
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,750
your feeling about yourself actually be
and you know can we put ourselves in the

3916
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:27,760
and you know can we put ourselves in the
 

3917
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,670
and you know can we put ourselves in the
in the shoes and the cells of the

3918
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
in the shoes and the cells of the
 

3919
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,069
in the shoes and the cells of the
cellular automaton so to speak can we

3920
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:32,079
cellular automaton so to speak can we
 

3921
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,990
cellular automaton so to speak can we
can we get ourselves close enough to

3922
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
can we get ourselves close enough to
 

3923
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,470
can we get ourselves close enough to
that that we could have a sense of what

3924
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
that that we could have a sense of what
 

3925
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,870
that that we could have a sense of what
the world would be like if you were

3926
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
the world would be like if you were
 

3927
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,109
the world would be like if you were
operating in that way and it's a little

3928
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
operating in that way and it's a little
 

3929
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,109
operating in that way and it's a little
difficult because you know you have to

3930
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
difficult because you know you have to
 

3931
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,029
difficult because you know you have to
not only think about what are you

3932
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
not only think about what are you
 

3933
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,950
not only think about what are you
perceiving but also what's actually

3934
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
perceiving but also what's actually
 

3935
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,430
perceiving but also what's actually
going on in your brain and our brains do

3936
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
going on in your brain and our brains do
 

3937
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,670
going on in your brain and our brains do
what they actually do and they don't

3938
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
what they actually do and they don't
 

3939
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,510
what they actually do and they don't
it's you know i think there might be

3940
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
it's you know i think there might be
 

3941
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,349
it's you know i think there might be
some experiments that are possible with

3942
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:55,359
some experiments that are possible with
 

3943
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,910
some experiments that are possible with
with uh you know neural nets and so on

3944
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
with uh you know neural nets and so on
 

3945
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,109
with uh you know neural nets and so on
where you can have something where you

3946
01:07:59,109 --> 01:07:59,119
where you can have something where you
 

3947
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,270
where you can have something where you
can at least see in detail what's

3948
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,280
can at least see in detail what's
 

3949
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,510
can at least see in detail what's
happening inside the system and i i've

3950
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:03,520
happening inside the system and i i've
 

3951
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,349
happening inside the system and i i've
been sort of one of the one of my

3952
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
been sort of one of the one of my
 

3953
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,870
been sort of one of the one of my
projects to think about is is there a

3954
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:06,880
projects to think about is is there a
 

3955
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,789
projects to think about is is there a
way of kind of uh

3956
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:08,799
way of kind of uh
 

3957
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,870
way of kind of uh
kind of getting a sense kind of from

3958
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
kind of getting a sense kind of from
 

3959
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,430
kind of getting a sense kind of from
inside the system about what its view of

3960
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:13,440
inside the system about what its view of
 

3961
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,070
inside the system about what its view of
the world is and and how it how it you

3962
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
the world is and and how it how it you
 

3963
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,470
the world is and and how it how it you
know uh can can we make a bridge see the

3964
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
know uh can can we make a bridge see the
 

3965
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,990
know uh can can we make a bridge see the
main issue is this

3966
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,000
main issue is this
 

3967
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,070
main issue is this
where you know it's a it's a sort of

3968
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
where you know it's a it's a sort of
 

3969
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,229
where you know it's a it's a sort of
philosophically difficult thing because

3970
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
philosophically difficult thing because
 

3971
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:26,550
philosophically difficult thing because
it's like we do what we do we understand

3972
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
it's like we do what we do we understand
 

3973
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,590
it's like we do what we do we understand
ourselves um at least to some extent we

3974
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
ourselves um at least to some extent we
 

3975
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,030
ourselves um at least to some extent we
humans understand ourselves that's

3976
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
humans understand ourselves that's
 

3977
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,070
humans understand ourselves that's
correct and but yet okay so what are we

3978
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
correct and but yet okay so what are we
 

3979
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,749
correct and but yet okay so what are we
trying to do for example when we are

3980
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
trying to do for example when we are
 

3981
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,349
trying to do for example when we are
trying to make a model of physics what

3982
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
trying to make a model of physics what
 

3983
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,349
trying to make a model of physics what
are we actually trying to do because you

3984
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
are we actually trying to do because you
 

3985
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:40,950
are we actually trying to do because you
know you say well can we work out what

3986
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:40,960
know you say well can we work out what
 

3987
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,189
know you say well can we work out what
the universe does well of course we can

3988
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
the universe does well of course we can
 

3989
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:44,709
the universe does well of course we can
we just watch the universe the universe

3990
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:44,719
we just watch the universe the universe
 

3991
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,709
we just watch the universe the universe
does what it does but what we're trying

3992
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
does what it does but what we're trying
 

3993
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,789
does what it does but what we're trying
to do when we make a model of physics is

3994
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
to do when we make a model of physics is
 

3995
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,229
to do when we make a model of physics is
we're trying to get to the point where

3996
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
we're trying to get to the point where
 

3997
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,950
we're trying to get to the point where
we can tell a story to ourselves that we

3998
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
we can tell a story to ourselves that we
 

3999
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,229
we can tell a story to ourselves that we
understand

4000
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
understand
 

4001
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,990
understand
that is also a representation of what

4002
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,000
that is also a representation of what
 

4003
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,309
that is also a representation of what
the universe does so it's this kind of

4004
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
the universe does so it's this kind of
 

4005
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,070
the universe does so it's this kind of
you know can we make a bridge between

4006
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
you know can we make a bridge between
 

4007
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,829
you know can we make a bridge between
what we humans can understand in our

4008
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
what we humans can understand in our
 

4009
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,390
what we humans can understand in our
minds and what the universe does

4010
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
minds and what the universe does
 

4011
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,870
minds and what the universe does
and in a sense you know a large part of

4012
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:06,880
and in a sense you know a large part of
 

4013
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,070
and in a sense you know a large part of
my kind of life uh efforts have been

4014
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
my kind of life uh efforts have been
 

4015
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,070
my kind of life uh efforts have been
devoted to making computational language

4016
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
devoted to making computational language
 

4017
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,149
devoted to making computational language
which kind of is a bridge between what

4018
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
which kind of is a bridge between what
 

4019
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,910
which kind of is a bridge between what
is possible in the computational

4020
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
is possible in the computational
 

4021
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,709
is possible in the computational
universe and what we humans can

4022
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
universe and what we humans can
 

4023
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,550
universe and what we humans can
conceptualize and think about in a sense

4024
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:20,560
conceptualize and think about in a sense
 

4025
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,229
conceptualize and think about in a sense
what you know when i built wolfram

4026
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:22,239
what you know when i built wolfram
 

4027
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:23,590
what you know when i built wolfram
language and our whole sort of

language and our whole sort of
 

4029
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,829

computational language story it's all
 

4031
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,630
computational language story it's all
about how do you take sort of raw

4032
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:28,640
about how do you take sort of raw
 

4033
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,990
about how do you take sort of raw
computation and this ocean of

4034
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
computation and this ocean of
 

4035
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,709
computation and this ocean of
computational possibility and how do we

4036
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:32,719
computational possibility and how do we
 

4037
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,189
computational possibility and how do we
sort of represent pieces of it in a way

4038
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
sort of represent pieces of it in a way
 

4039
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,910
sort of represent pieces of it in a way
that we humans can understand and that

4040
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:37,920
that we humans can understand and that
 

4041
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,349
that we humans can understand and that
map on to things that we care about

4042
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
map on to things that we care about
 

4043
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,110
map on to things that we care about
doing and in a sense when you add

4044
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:41,120
doing and in a sense when you add
 

4045
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,669
doing and in a sense when you add
physics you're adding this other piece

4046
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
physics you're adding this other piece
 

4047
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,349
physics you're adding this other piece
where we can you know mediate it by

4048
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
where we can you know mediate it by
 

4049
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,229
where we can you know mediate it by
computer can we get physics to the point

4050
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:48,239
computer can we get physics to the point
 

4051
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:50,630
computer can we get physics to the point
where we humans can understand something

4052
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
where we humans can understand something
 

4053
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,229
where we humans can understand something
about what's happening in it

4054
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
about what's happening in it
 

4055
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:53,669
about what's happening in it
and when we talk about an alien

4056
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:53,679
and when we talk about an alien
 

4057
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,990
and when we talk about an alien
intelligence it's kind of the same story

4058
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,000
intelligence it's kind of the same story
 

4059
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,870
intelligence it's kind of the same story
it's like is there a way of mapping

4060
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
it's like is there a way of mapping
 

4061
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,709
it's like is there a way of mapping
what's happening there onto something

4062
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
what's happening there onto something
 

4063
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,630
what's happening there onto something
that we humans can understand

4064
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
that we humans can understand
 

4065
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,830
that we humans can understand
and you know physics in some sense is

4066
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
and you know physics in some sense is
 

4067
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,630
and you know physics in some sense is
like

4068
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
like
 

4069
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,350
like
our exhibit one of the story of alien

4070
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
our exhibit one of the story of alien
 

4071
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,990
our exhibit one of the story of alien
intelligence it's it's a it's a you know

4072
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
intelligence it's it's a it's a you know
 

4073
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,149
intelligence it's it's a it's a you know
it's an alien intelligence in some sense

4074
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:14,159
it's an alien intelligence in some sense
 

4075
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,910
it's an alien intelligence in some sense
and what we're doing in making a model

4076
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:15,920
and what we're doing in making a model
 

4077
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,950
and what we're doing in making a model
of physics

4078
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
of physics
 

4079
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,950
of physics
is mapping that onto something that we

4080
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:18,960
is mapping that onto something that we
 

4081
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,350
is mapping that onto something that we
understand and i think you know a lot of

4082
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
understand and i think you know a lot of
 

4083
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,709
understand and i think you know a lot of
these other things that have i've

4084
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
these other things that have i've
 

4085
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,030
these other things that have i've
recently been kind of studying uh

4086
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
recently been kind of studying uh
 

4087
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,550
recently been kind of studying uh
whether it's molecular biology other

4088
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
whether it's molecular biology other
 

4089
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,709
whether it's molecular biology other
kinds of things um which we can talk

4090
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
kinds of things um which we can talk
 

4091
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,350
kinds of things um which we can talk
about a bit um the um

4092
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
about a bit um the um
 

4093
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,950
about a bit um the um
uh those are other cases where we're in

4094
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
uh those are other cases where we're in
 

4095
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,430
uh those are other cases where we're in
a sense trying to again make that bridge

4096
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
a sense trying to again make that bridge
 

4097
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,910
a sense trying to again make that bridge
between what we humans understand and

4098
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
between what we humans understand and
 

4099
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,070
between what we humans understand and
sort of the the natural language of that

4100
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,080
sort of the the natural language of that
 

4101
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,229
sort of the the natural language of that
sort of alien intelligence in some sense

4102

sort of alien intelligence in some sense
 

4103
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,110
sort of alien intelligence in some sense
when you're talking about just uh to

4104
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,120
when you're talking about just uh to
 

4105
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,950
when you're talking about just uh to
backtrack a little bit about cellular

4106
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:46,960
backtrack a little bit about cellular
 

4107
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,030
backtrack a little bit about cellular
automata

4108
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,040
automata
 

4109
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,070
automata
being able to uh what's it like to be a

4110
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,080
being able to uh what's it like to be a
 

4111
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,910
being able to uh what's it like to be a
cellular automata

4112
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:53,920
cellular automata
 

4113
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,550
cellular automata
in a way that's equivalent to what is it

4114
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,560
in a way that's equivalent to what is it
 

4115
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,189
in a way that's equivalent to what is it
like to be a conscious human being

4116
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199

 

4117
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,110

how do you approach that so

4118
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
how do you approach that so
 

4119
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,110
how do you approach that so
is it looking at some subset of the

4120
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
is it looking at some subset of the
 

4121
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,870
is it looking at some subset of the
cellular autonomy asking questions of

4122
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
cellular autonomy asking questions of
 

4123
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,470
cellular autonomy asking questions of
that subset

4124
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
that subset
 

4125
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,590
that subset
like how the world is perceived

4126
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,600
like how the world is perceived
 

4127
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,110
like how the world is perceived
how yeah something like as that subset

4128
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
how yeah something like as that subset
 

4129
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,550
how yeah something like as that subset
like for that local pocket of

4130
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
like for that local pocket of
 

4131
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,110
like for that local pocket of
computation what are you able to say

4132
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
computation what are you able to say
 

4133
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,590
computation what are you able to say
about the broader something like that

4134
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
about the broader something like that
 

4135
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,669
about the broader something like that
and that somehow then

4136
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
and that somehow then
 

4137
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,270
and that somehow then
can give you a sense of how to step

4138
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
can give you a sense of how to step
 

4139
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,270
can give you a sense of how to step
outside of that cell right but but the

4140
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,280
outside of that cell right but but the
 

4141
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,790
outside of that cell right but but the
tricky part is

4142
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
tricky part is
 

4143
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,510
tricky part is
that that little subset

4144
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:31,520
that that little subset
 

4145
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,470
that that little subset
it's what it's doing is it has a view of

4146
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
it's what it's doing is it has a view of
 

4147
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,870
it's what it's doing is it has a view of
itself and the question is how do you

4148
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
itself and the question is how do you
 

4149
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,669
itself and the question is how do you
get inside it it's like you know when we

4150
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
get inside it it's like you know when we
 

4151
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,390
get inside it it's like you know when we
with humans right it's like we can't get

4152
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
with humans right it's like we can't get
 

4153
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,709
with humans right it's like we can't get
inside each other's consciousness

4154
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
inside each other's consciousness
 

4155
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,870
inside each other's consciousness
that doesn't really um you know that

4156
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
that doesn't really um you know that
 

4157
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,189
that doesn't really um you know that
doesn't really even make sense it's like

4158
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
doesn't really even make sense it's like
 

4159
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,030
doesn't really even make sense it's like
there is an experience that somebody is

4160
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
there is an experience that somebody is
 

4161
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,590
there is an experience that somebody is
having but you can perceive things from

4162
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
having but you can perceive things from
 

4163
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,830
having but you can perceive things from
the outside but sort of getting inside

4164
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
the outside but sort of getting inside
 

4165
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,070
the outside but sort of getting inside
it it doesn't it doesn't quite make

4166
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,080
it it doesn't it doesn't quite make
 

4167
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,830
it it doesn't it doesn't quite make
sense and i you know for me these sort

4168
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
sense and i you know for me these sort
 

4169
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,189
sense and i you know for me these sort
of philosophical issues and this one i

4170
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:01,199
of philosophical issues and this one i
 

4171
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,350
of philosophical issues and this one i
have not untangled so let's let's be um

4172
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
have not untangled so let's let's be um
 

4173
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,390
have not untangled so let's let's be um
sure um the you know for me the thing

4174
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
sure um the you know for me the thing
 

4175
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,590
sure um the you know for me the thing
that has been really interesting and

4176
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
that has been really interesting and
 

4177
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,430
that has been really interesting and
thinking through some of these things is

4178
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
thinking through some of these things is
 

4179
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,030
thinking through some of these things is
you know when it comes to questions

4180
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
you know when it comes to questions
 

4181
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,950
you know when it comes to questions
about consciousness or whatever else

4182
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:12,960
about consciousness or whatever else
 

4183
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,430
about consciousness or whatever else
it's like when i can run a program and

4184
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
it's like when i can run a program and
 

4185
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,990
it's like when i can run a program and
actually see pictures and you know make

4186
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
actually see pictures and you know make
 

4187
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,070
actually see pictures and you know make
things concrete i have a much better

4188
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
things concrete i have a much better
 

4189
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,669
things concrete i have a much better
chance to understand what's going on

4190
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
chance to understand what's going on
 

4191
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,030
chance to understand what's going on
than when i'm just trying to reason

4192
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
than when i'm just trying to reason
 

4193
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,790
than when i'm just trying to reason
about things in a very abstract way yeah

4194
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
about things in a very abstract way yeah
 

4195
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,149
about things in a very abstract way yeah
but there may be a way to uh

4196
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
but there may be a way to uh
 

4197
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,070
but there may be a way to uh
map

4198
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,080
map
 

4199
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,149
map
the program to your conscious experience

4200
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
the program to your conscious experience
 

4201
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,590
the program to your conscious experience
so for example when you play a video

4202
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
so for example when you play a video
 

4203
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,750
so for example when you play a video
game you do a first person shooter you

4204
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
game you do a first person shooter you
 

4205
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,550
game you do a first person shooter you
walk around inside

4206
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:38,560
walk around inside
 

4207
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,550
walk around inside
this entity yep it's a very different

4208
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
this entity yep it's a very different
 

4209
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,550
this entity yep it's a very different
thing than watching this entity so if

4210
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
thing than watching this entity so if
 

4211
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,149
thing than watching this entity so if
you can somehow

4212
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
you can somehow
 

4213
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,390
you can somehow
connect more and more connect

4214
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
connect more and more connect
 

4215
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,870
connect more and more connect
this full conscious experience

4216
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:48,880
this full conscious experience
 

4217
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,189
this full conscious experience
to the subset of the cellular automata

4218
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:51,199
to the subset of the cellular automata
 

4219
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,630
to the subset of the cellular automata
yeah it's something like that but the

4220
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:52,640
yeah it's something like that but the
 

4221
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,990
yeah it's something like that but the
difference in the first person shooter

4222
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
difference in the first person shooter
 

4223
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,350
difference in the first person shooter
thing is they're still

4224
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
thing is they're still
 

4225
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,990
thing is they're still
your brain and your memory is still

4226
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
your brain and your memory is still
 

4227
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,790
your brain and your memory is still
remembering you know you you still have

4228
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:00,800
remembering you know you you still have
 

4229
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,189
remembering you know you you still have
it's it's hard to i mean again what

4230
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:03,199
it's it's hard to i mean again what
 

4231
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,950
it's it's hard to i mean again what
one's going to get

4232
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
one's going to get
 

4233
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,550
one's going to get
one is not going to actually be able to

4234
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:06,560
one is not going to actually be able to
 

4235
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,470
one is not going to actually be able to
be the cellular automaton one's going to

4236
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
be the cellular automaton one's going to
 

4237
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,750
be the cellular automaton one's going to
be able to watch what the cellular

4238
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
be able to watch what the cellular
 

4239
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,430
be able to watch what the cellular
automaton does but this is the

4240
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
automaton does but this is the
 

4241
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,709
automaton does but this is the
frustrating thing that i'm trying to

4242
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
frustrating thing that i'm trying to
 

4243
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,750
frustrating thing that i'm trying to
understand you know you know how to how

4244
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
understand you know you know how to how
 

4245
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,390
understand you know you know how to how
to think about being it so to speak okay

4246
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
to think about being it so to speak okay
 

4247
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,070
to think about being it so to speak okay
so like in virtual reality there's a

4248
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
so like in virtual reality there's a
 

4249
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,990
so like in virtual reality there's a
concept of immersion like with anything

4250
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
concept of immersion like with anything
 

4251
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,590
concept of immersion like with anything
with video game with books there's a

4252
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:23,600
with video game with books there's a
 

4253
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,830
with video game with books there's a
concept of immersion it feels like over

4254
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:25,840
concept of immersion it feels like over
 

4255
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,590
concept of immersion it feels like over
time if the virtual reality experience

4256
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
time if the virtual reality experience
 

4257
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,669
time if the virtual reality experience
is is well done and maybe in the future

4258
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
is is well done and maybe in the future
 

4259
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,750
is is well done and maybe in the future
would be extremely well done

4260
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
would be extremely well done
 

4261
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,709
would be extremely well done
the immersion leads you to

4262
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
the immersion leads you to
 

4263
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,189
the immersion leads you to
feel like you mentioned memories you

4264
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
feel like you mentioned memories you
 

4265
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,390
feel like you mentioned memories you
forget

4266
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
forget
 

4267
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,390
forget
that you even ever existed outside that

4268
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
that you even ever existed outside that
 

4269
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,510
that you even ever existed outside that
experience

4270
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:43,520
experience
 

4271
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,350
experience
yeah so immersive

4272
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
yeah so immersive
 

4273
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,550
yeah so immersive
i mean you could argue sort of

4274
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
i mean you could argue sort of
 

4275
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,030
i mean you could argue sort of
mathematically that you can never truly

4276
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
mathematically that you can never truly
 

4277
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,750
mathematically that you can never truly
become immersed but maybe you can i mean

4278
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
become immersed but maybe you can i mean
 

4279
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,189
become immersed but maybe you can i mean
well yeah i mean why can't you merge

4280
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
well yeah i mean why can't you merge
 

4281
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,430
well yeah i mean why can't you merge
with the cellular automata yeah right i

4282
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
with the cellular automata yeah right i
 

4283
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,550
with the cellular automata yeah right i
mean you're

4284
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
mean you're
 

4285
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,229
mean you're
just part of the same fabric why can't

4286
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239
just part of the same fabric why can't
 

4287
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,149
just part of the same fabric why can't
you just like well that's a good

4288
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
you just like well that's a good
 

4289
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,990
you just like well that's a good
question i mean so so let's imagine the

4290
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
question i mean so so let's imagine the
 

4291
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,510
question i mean so so let's imagine the
following scenario let's imagine you

4292
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:03,520
following scenario let's imagine you
 

4293
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,790
following scenario let's imagine you
return

4294
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
return
 

4295
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,790
return
what's that well but then can you return

4296
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
what's that well but then can you return
 

4297
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,229
what's that well but then can you return
back well yeah right i mean it's it's

4298
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
back well yeah right i mean it's it's
 

4299
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,990
back well yeah right i mean it's it's
like let's imagine you've uploaded you

4300
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
like let's imagine you've uploaded you
 

4301
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,830
like let's imagine you've uploaded you
know your brain is scanned you've got

4302
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
know your brain is scanned you've got
 

4303
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,390
know your brain is scanned you've got
every synapse you know mapped out

4304
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
every synapse you know mapped out
 

4305
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,790
every synapse you know mapped out
you upload everything about you the

4306
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
you upload everything about you the
 

4307
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,390
you upload everything about you the
brain simulator you upload the brain

4308
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:18,400
brain simulator you upload the brain
 

4309
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,470
brain simulator you upload the brain
simulator and the brain simulator is

4310
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
simulator and the brain simulator is
 

4311
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,709
simulator and the brain simulator is
basically you know some glorified

4312
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:22,719
basically you know some glorified
 

4313
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,350
basically you know some glorified
cellular automaton and then you say well

4314
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:25,360
cellular automaton and then you say well
 

4315
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,709
cellular automaton and then you say well
now we've got an answer to what does it

4316
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
now we've got an answer to what does it
 

4317
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,790
now we've got an answer to what does it
feel like to be a cellular automaton it

4318
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
feel like to be a cellular automaton it
 

4319
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,669
feel like to be a cellular automaton it
feels just like it felt to be ordinary

4320
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
feels just like it felt to be ordinary
 

4321
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,750
feels just like it felt to be ordinary
you because they're both computational

4322
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760
you because they're both computational
 

4323
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,510
you because they're both computational
systems and they're both you know

4324
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
systems and they're both you know
 

4325
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,669
systems and they're both you know
operating in the same way so in a sense

4326
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679
operating in the same way so in a sense
 

4327
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,510
operating in the same way so in a sense
but i think there's there's somehow more

4328
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:39,520
but i think there's there's somehow more
 

4329
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,350
but i think there's there's somehow more
to it because in that sense when you're

4330
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,360
to it because in that sense when you're
 

4331
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,390
to it because in that sense when you're
just making a brain simulator it's just

4332
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:44,400
just making a brain simulator it's just
 

4333
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,070
just making a brain simulator it's just
you know we're just saying there's

4334
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:46,080
you know we're just saying there's
 

4335
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,750
you know we're just saying there's
another version of our consciousness the

4336
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:47,760
another version of our consciousness the
 

4337
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,750
another version of our consciousness the
question that we're asking is if we

4338
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
question that we're asking is if we
 

4339
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,149
question that we're asking is if we
tease away from our consciousness and

4340
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
tease away from our consciousness and
 

4341
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,149
tease away from our consciousness and
get to something that is different how

4342
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
get to something that is different how
 

4343
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,910
get to something that is different how
do we make a bridge to understanding

4344
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
do we make a bridge to understanding
 

4345
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,750
do we make a bridge to understanding
what's going on there and you know

4346
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
what's going on there and you know
 

4347
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,510
what's going on there and you know
there's a way of thinking about this

4348
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
there's a way of thinking about this
 

4349
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,590
there's a way of thinking about this
okay so this is coming on to sort of

4350
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,600
okay so this is coming on to sort of
 

4351
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,790
okay so this is coming on to sort of
questions about the existence of the

4352
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:02,800
questions about the existence of the
 

4353
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,270
questions about the existence of the
universe and so on but one of the things

4354
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
universe and so on but one of the things
 

4355
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,590
universe and so on but one of the things
is there's this notion that we have of

4356
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
is there's this notion that we have of
 

4357
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,110
is there's this notion that we have of
rulial space

4358
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
rulial space
 

4359
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,790
rulial space
so we have this idea of this physical

4360
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
so we have this idea of this physical
 

4361
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,950
so we have this idea of this physical
space which is you know something you

4362
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:12,960
space which is you know something you
 

4363
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,110
space which is you know something you
can move around in that's that's uh

4364
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
can move around in that's that's uh
 

4365
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,270
can move around in that's that's uh
associated with actual the extent of the

4366
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
associated with actual the extent of the
 

4367
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,350
associated with actual the extent of the
spatial hypergraph then there's what we

4368
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,360
spatial hypergraph then there's what we
 

4369
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,590
spatial hypergraph then there's what we
call branchial space the space of

4370
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
call branchial space the space of
 

4371
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,750
call branchial space the space of
quantum branches so in this in this

4372
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
quantum branches so in this in this
 

4373
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,910
quantum branches so in this in this
thing we call the multi-way graph of all

4374
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
thing we call the multi-way graph of all
 

4375
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,990
thing we call the multi-way graph of all
of the sort of branching histories

4376
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
of the sort of branching histories
 

4377
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,149
of the sort of branching histories
there's this idea of a kind of space

4378
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
there's this idea of a kind of space
 

4379
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,430
there's this idea of a kind of space
where instead of moving around in

4380
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
where instead of moving around in
 

4381
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,350
where instead of moving around in
physical space you're moving from

4382
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
physical space you're moving from
 

4383
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,590
physical space you're moving from
history to history so to speak from one

4384
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:35,600
history to history so to speak from one
 

4385
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,950
history to history so to speak from one
possible history to another possible

4386
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
possible history to another possible
 

4387
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,709
possible history to another possible
history and that's kind of a different

4388
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
history and that's kind of a different
 

4389
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,229
history and that's kind of a different
kind of space

4390
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
kind of space
 

4391
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,229
kind of space
that is the space in which quantum

4392
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
that is the space in which quantum
 

4393
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,630
that is the space in which quantum
mechanics plays out quantum mechanics

4394
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
mechanics plays out quantum mechanics
 

4395
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,669
mechanics plays out quantum mechanics
like for example oh something like uh i

4396
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:47,679
like for example oh something like uh i
 

4397
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,189
like for example oh something like uh i
think we're slowly understanding things

4398
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
think we're slowly understanding things
 

4399
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,790
think we're slowly understanding things
like destructive interference in quantum

4400
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:50,800
like destructive interference in quantum
 

4401
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,030
like destructive interference in quantum
mechanics but what's happening is

4402
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
mechanics but what's happening is
 

4403
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,590
mechanics but what's happening is
branchial space is associated with phase

4404
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
branchial space is associated with phase
 

4405
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,189
branchial space is associated with phase
in quantum mechanics and what's

4406
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,199
in quantum mechanics and what's
 

4407
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,790
in quantum mechanics and what's
happening is the two photons that are

4408
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
happening is the two photons that are
 

4409
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,750
happening is the two photons that are
supposed to be interfering and

4410
01:15:59,750 --> 01:15:59,760
supposed to be interfering and
 

4411
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,830
supposed to be interfering and
destructively destructively interfering

4412
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:01,840
destructively destructively interfering
 

4413
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,110
destructively destructively interfering
are winding up at different ends of

4414
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
are winding up at different ends of
 

4415
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,750
are winding up at different ends of
branchial space and so us as these poor

4416
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
branchial space and so us as these poor
 

4417
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,990
branchial space and so us as these poor
observers that are trying to that have

4418
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
observers that are trying to that have
 

4419
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,070
observers that are trying to that have
branching brains that are trying to

4420
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
branching brains that are trying to
 

4421
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,669
branching brains that are trying to
conflate together these different

4422
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
conflate together these different
 

4423
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,830
conflate together these different
threads of history and say we've really

4424
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
threads of history and say we've really
 

4425
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,189
threads of history and say we've really
got a consistent story that we're

4426
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
got a consistent story that we're
 

4427
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,790
got a consistent story that we're
telling here we're really knitting

4428
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
telling here we're really knitting
 

4429
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,630
telling here we're really knitting
together these threads of history by the

4430
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
together these threads of history by the
 

4431
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,870
together these threads of history by the
time the two photons wound up at

4432
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
time the two photons wound up at
 

4433
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,030
time the two photons wound up at
opposite ends of branchial space we just

4434
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
opposite ends of branchial space we just
 

4435
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,550
opposite ends of branchial space we just
can't knit them together to tell a

4436
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,560
can't knit them together to tell a
 

4437
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,510
can't knit them together to tell a
consistent story so for us that's sort

4438
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:27,520
consistent story so for us that's sort
 

4439
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,630
consistent story so for us that's sort
of the analog of destructive

4440
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:28,640
of the analog of destructive
 

4441
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,990
of the analog of destructive
interference

4442
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
interference
 

4443
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,990
interference
got it and then there's rule space too

4444
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
got it and then there's rule space too
 

4445
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,229
got it and then there's rule space too
which is the space of rules yes well

4446
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:34,239
which is the space of rules yes well
 

4447
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,950
which is the space of rules yes well
that's that's a another level up so so

4448
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:36,960
that's that's a another level up so so
 

4449
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,189
that's that's a another level up so so
there's there's the question um actually

4450
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
there's there's the question um actually
 

4451
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,189
there's there's the question um actually
i i do want to mention one thing because

4452
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
i i do want to mention one thing because
 

4453
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,630
i i do want to mention one thing because
it's something i've realized in recent

4454
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:42,640
it's something i've realized in recent
 

4455
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,070
it's something i've realized in recent
times and it's i think it's really

4456
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
times and it's i think it's really
 

4457
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,229
times and it's i think it's really
really kind of cool which is about time

4458
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
really kind of cool which is about time
 

4459
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,590
really kind of cool which is about time
dilation and relativity and it kind of

4460
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
dilation and relativity and it kind of
 

4461
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,750
dilation and relativity and it kind of
helps to understand it's something that

4462
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:49,760
helps to understand it's something that
 

4463
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,830
helps to understand it's something that
kind of helps in understanding what's

4464
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
kind of helps in understanding what's
 

4465
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,110
kind of helps in understanding what's
going on so

4466
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,120
going on so
 

4467
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,070
going on so
in according to relativity if you you

4468
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,080
in according to relativity if you you
 

4469
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,750
in according to relativity if you you
know you have a clock it's ticking at a

4470
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
know you have a clock it's ticking at a
 

4471
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,870
know you have a clock it's ticking at a
certain rate

4472
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:58,880
certain rate
 

4473
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,950
certain rate
you send in a spacecraft that's going at

4474
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
you send in a spacecraft that's going at
 

4475
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,870
you send in a spacecraft that's going at
some significant fraction the speed of

4476
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
some significant fraction the speed of
 

4477
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,669
some significant fraction the speed of
light

4478
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:03,679
light
 

4479
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,350
light
to you as a observer at rest that clock

4480
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
to you as a observer at rest that clock
 

4481
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,270
to you as a observer at rest that clock
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be

4482
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:09,280
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be
 

4483
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,229
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be
ticking much more slowly and so in other

4484
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
ticking much more slowly and so in other
 

4485
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,149
ticking much more slowly and so in other
words you know it's kind of like the

4486
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
words you know it's kind of like the
 

4487
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,070
words you know it's kind of like the
the the twin who goes off to alpha

4488
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
the the twin who goes off to alpha
 

4489
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,630
the the twin who goes off to alpha
centauri and goes very fast will age

4490
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
centauri and goes very fast will age
 

4491
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,310
centauri and goes very fast will age
much less than the twin who's on earth

4492
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
much less than the twin who's on earth
 

4493
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,709
much less than the twin who's on earth
that um that is just hanging out where

4494
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
that um that is just hanging out where
 

4495
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,630
that um that is just hanging out where
they're hanging out okay why does that

4496
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
they're hanging out okay why does that
 

4497
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,110
they're hanging out okay why does that
happen okay so it has to do with what

4498
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
happen okay so it has to do with what
 

4499
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,790
happen okay so it has to do with what
motion is

4500
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,800
motion is
 

4501
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,830
motion is
so in in our models of physics

4502
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
so in in our models of physics
 

4503
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,510
so in in our models of physics
what is motion well when you move from

4504
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
what is motion well when you move from
 

4505
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,669
what is motion well when you move from
somewhere to somewhere it's you're

4506
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:35,679
somewhere to somewhere it's you're
 

4507
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,550
somewhere to somewhere it's you're
having to sort of recreate yourself at a

4508
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
having to sort of recreate yourself at a
 

4509
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,550
having to sort of recreate yourself at a
different place in space

4510
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
different place in space
 

4511
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,709
different place in space
when you exist at a particular place and

4512
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
when you exist at a particular place and
 

4513
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,030
when you exist at a particular place and
you just evolve with time you're again

4514
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
you just evolve with time you're again
 

4515
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,630
you just evolve with time you're again
you're updating yourself you're you're

4516
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:46,640
you're updating yourself you're you're
 

4517
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,229
you're updating yourself you're you're
following these rules to update what

4518
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
following these rules to update what
 

4519
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,270
following these rules to update what
happens

4520
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
happens
 

4521
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,510
happens
well so the question is when you have a

4522
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:51,520
well so the question is when you have a
 

4523
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,669
well so the question is when you have a
certain amount of computation in you so

4524
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
certain amount of computation in you so
 

4525
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,510
certain amount of computation in you so
to speak when there's a certain amount

4526
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
to speak when there's a certain amount
 

4527
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,110
to speak when there's a certain amount
you know you're computing the universe

4528
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
you know you're computing the universe
 

4529
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,189
you know you're computing the universe
is computing at a certain rate you can

4530
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
is computing at a certain rate you can
 

4531
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,070
is computing at a certain rate you can
either use that computation to work out

4532
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,080
either use that computation to work out
 

4533
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,310
either use that computation to work out
sitting still where you are what's going

4534
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
sitting still where you are what's going
 

4535
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,630
sitting still where you are what's going
to happen successively in time or you

4536
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
to happen successively in time or you
 

4537
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,790
to happen successively in time or you
can use that computation to recreate

4538
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
can use that computation to recreate
 

4539
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,030
can use that computation to recreate
yourself as you move around the universe

4540
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,040
yourself as you move around the universe
 

4541
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,669
yourself as you move around the universe
and so time dilation ends up being it's

4542
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:13,679
and so time dilation ends up being it's
 

4543
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:14,950
and so time dilation ends up being it's
really cool actually that this is

4544
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:14,960
really cool actually that this is
 

4545
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,870
really cool actually that this is
explainable in a in a way that isn't

4546
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
explainable in a in a way that isn't
 

4547
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,550
explainable in a in a way that isn't
just imagine the mathematics of

4548
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
just imagine the mathematics of
 

4549
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,350
just imagine the mathematics of
relativity but but um that time dilation

4550
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:21,360
relativity but but um that time dilation
 

4551
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,229
relativity but but um that time dilation
is a story of the fact that as you kind

4552
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:24,239
is a story of the fact that as you kind
 

4553
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,870
is a story of the fact that as you kind
of are recreating yourself as you move

4554
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
of are recreating yourself as you move
 

4555
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,149
of are recreating yourself as you move
you are using up some of your

4556
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
you are using up some of your
 

4557
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,070
you are using up some of your
computation and so you don't have as

4558
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:30,080
computation and so you don't have as
 

4559
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,470
computation and so you don't have as
much computation left over to actually

4560
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
much computation left over to actually
 

4561
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,310
much computation left over to actually
work out what happens progressively with

4562
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
work out what happens progressively with
 

4563
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,790
work out what happens progressively with
time so that means that time is running

4564
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
time so that means that time is running
 

4565
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,830
time so that means that time is running
more slowly for you because it is

4566
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
more slowly for you because it is
 

4567
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,750
more slowly for you because it is
you're you're using up your computation

4568
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:41,760
you're you're using up your computation
 

4569
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,470
you're you're using up your computation
your your clock can't tick as quickly

4570
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:44,480
your your clock can't tick as quickly
 

4571
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,470
your your clock can't tick as quickly
because every tick of the clock is using

4572
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
because every tick of the clock is using
 

4573
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,990
because every tick of the clock is using
up some computation but you already use

4574
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
up some computation but you already use
 

4575
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,310
up some computation but you already use
that computation up on moving at you

4576
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:50,320
that computation up on moving at you
 

4577
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,510
that computation up on moving at you
know half the speed of light or

4578
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:51,520
know half the speed of light or
 

4579
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,910
know half the speed of light or
something and so that's that's why time

4580
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:53,920
something and so that's that's why time
 

4581
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,510
something and so that's that's why time
dilation happens

4582
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,520
dilation happens
 

4583
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,070
dilation happens
and so you can you can start so it's

4584
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:58,080
and so you can you can start so it's
 

4585
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,430
and so you can you can start so it's
kind of interesting that one can sort of

4586
01:18:59,430 --> 01:18:59,440
kind of interesting that one can sort of
 

4587
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,110
kind of interesting that one can sort of
get an intuition about something like

4588
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
get an intuition about something like
 

4589
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,870
get an intuition about something like
that because it has seemed like just a

4590
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:02,880
that because it has seemed like just a
 

4591
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,189
that because it has seemed like just a
mathematical fact about the mathematics

4592
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
mathematical fact about the mathematics
 

4593
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,750
mathematical fact about the mathematics
of special relativity and so on well for

4594
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:07,760
of special relativity and so on well for
 

4595
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,590
of special relativity and so on well for
me it's a little bit confusing what the

4596
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,600
me it's a little bit confusing what the
 

4597
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,470
me it's a little bit confusing what the
u in that picture is because you're

4598
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
u in that picture is because you're
 

4599
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,950
u in that picture is because you're
using up computation

4600
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:14,960
using up computation
 

4601
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,830
using up computation
okay so so we're simply saying the

4602
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
okay so so we're simply saying the
 

4603
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,590
okay so so we're simply saying the
entity is updating itself according to

4604
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
entity is updating itself according to
 

4605
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,070
entity is updating itself according to
the way that the universe updates itself

4606
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
the way that the universe updates itself
 

4607
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,590
the way that the universe updates itself
and the question is

4608
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:25,600
and the question is
 

4609
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,550
and the question is
your

4610
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560
your
 

4611
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,149
your
you know those updates let's imagine the

4612
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:28,159
you know those updates let's imagine the
 

4613
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,590
you know those updates let's imagine the
u is a clock

4614
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:29,600
u is a clock
 

4615
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,590
u is a clock
okay and the clock is you know there's

4616
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
okay and the clock is you know there's
 

4617
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,510
okay and the clock is you know there's
all these little updates the hypograph

4618
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
all these little updates the hypograph
 

4619
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,830
all these little updates the hypograph
and a sequence of updates caused the

4620
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:35,840
and a sequence of updates caused the
 

4621
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,990
and a sequence of updates caused the
pendulum to swing back the other way and

4622
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:38,000
pendulum to swing back the other way and
 

4623
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,550
pendulum to swing back the other way and
then swing back swinging back and forth

4624
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
then swing back swinging back and forth
 

4625
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,990
then swing back swinging back and forth
okay and all of the all of those updates

4626
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
okay and all of the all of those updates
 

4627
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,229
okay and all of the all of those updates
are contributing to the motion of you

4628
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,239
are contributing to the motion of you
 

4629
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,669
are contributing to the motion of you
know the pendulum going back and forth

4630
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:47,679
know the pendulum going back and forth
 

4631
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,709
know the pendulum going back and forth
or the oscillator moving whatever it is

4632
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
or the oscillator moving whatever it is
 

4633
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,870
or the oscillator moving whatever it is
okay but but then the alternative is

4634
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
okay but but then the alternative is
 

4635
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,790
okay but but then the alternative is
that's sort of situation one where the

4636
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
that's sort of situation one where the
 

4637
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,149
that's sort of situation one where the
thing is at rest

4638
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:56,159
thing is at rest
 

4639
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,550
thing is at rest
situation two where it's kind of moving

4640
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
situation two where it's kind of moving
 

4641
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,110
situation two where it's kind of moving
the the what's happening is it is having

4642
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
the the what's happening is it is having
 

4643
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,430
the the what's happening is it is having
to recreate itself at every at every

4644
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:03,440
to recreate itself at every at every
 

4645
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,229
to recreate itself at every at every
moment the thing is going to have to do

4646
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
moment the thing is going to have to do
 

4647
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,950
moment the thing is going to have to do
the computations to be able to

4648
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
the computations to be able to
 

4649
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,550
the computations to be able to
sort of recreate itself at a different

4650
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
sort of recreate itself at a different
 

4651
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,629
sort of recreate itself at a different
position in space and that's kind of the

4652
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:12,639
position in space and that's kind of the
 

4653
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,189
position in space and that's kind of the
intuition behind so it's either going to

4654
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:15,199
intuition behind so it's either going to
 

4655
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,590
intuition behind so it's either going to
spend its computation recreating itself

4656
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
spend its computation recreating itself
 

4657
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,590
spend its computation recreating itself
at a different position in space or it's

4658
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
at a different position in space or it's
 

4659
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,310
at a different position in space or it's
going to spend its computation doing the

4660
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
going to spend its computation doing the
 

4661
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,990
going to spend its computation doing the
um uh sort of doing the updating of the

4662
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
um uh sort of doing the updating of the
 

4663
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,830
um uh sort of doing the updating of the
you know of the the ticking of the clock

4664
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:27,840
you know of the the ticking of the clock
 

4665
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,910
you know of the the ticking of the clock
so to speak so the more updating is

4666
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:29,920
so to speak so the more updating is
 

4667
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,149
so to speak so the more updating is
doing the less the ticking of the clock

4668
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:32,159
doing the less the ticking of the clock
 

4669
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,229
doing the less the ticking of the clock
update is doing that's right the more it

4670
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:34,239
update is doing that's right the more it
 

4671
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,070
update is doing that's right the more it
has having to update because of motion

4672
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
has having to update because of motion
 

4673
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,070
has having to update because of motion
yeah the less it can update the the

4674
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
yeah the less it can update the the
 

4675
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,110
yeah the less it can update the the
clock so that that's um i mean obviously

4676
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
clock so that that's um i mean obviously
 

4677
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,629
clock so that that's um i mean obviously
there's a there's a sort of mathematical

4678
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:42,639
there's a there's a sort of mathematical
 

4679
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,310
there's a there's a sort of mathematical
version of it that relates to how it

4680
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
version of it that relates to how it
 

4681
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,070
version of it that relates to how it
actually works in relativity but that's

4682
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
actually works in relativity but that's
 

4683
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,390
actually works in relativity but that's
kind of to me that was sort of exciting

4684
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
kind of to me that was sort of exciting
 

4685
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,229
kind of to me that was sort of exciting
to me that it's possible to have a a

4686
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
to me that it's possible to have a a
 

4687
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,629
to me that it's possible to have a a
really mechanically explainable story

4688
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
really mechanically explainable story
 

4689
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,189
really mechanically explainable story
there that that isn't um and similarly

4690
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:55,199
there that that isn't um and similarly
 

4691
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,709
there that that isn't um and similarly
in quantum mechanics this notion of

4692
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:56,719
in quantum mechanics this notion of
 

4693
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,390
in quantum mechanics this notion of
branching brains perceiving branching

4694
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
branching brains perceiving branching
 

4695
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,629
branching brains perceiving branching
universes to me that's getting towards a

4696
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:00,639
universes to me that's getting towards a
 

4697
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,709
universes to me that's getting towards a
sort of mechanically explainable version

4698
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
sort of mechanically explainable version
 

4699
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,149
sort of mechanically explainable version
of what happens in quantum mechanics

4700
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
of what happens in quantum mechanics
 

4701
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,030
of what happens in quantum mechanics
even though it's a little bit

4702
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,040
even though it's a little bit
 

4703
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,669
even though it's a little bit
mind-bending uh to see you know these

4704
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
mind-bending uh to see you know these
 

4705
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,830
mind-bending uh to see you know these
things about under what circumstances

4706
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
things about under what circumstances
 

4707
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,390
things about under what circumstances
can you successfully knit together those

4708
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
can you successfully knit together those
 

4709
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,310
can you successfully knit together those
different threads of history and when do

4710
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:14,320
different threads of history and when do
 

4711
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,310
different threads of history and when do
things sort of escape and and those

4712
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:16,320
things sort of escape and and those
 

4713
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,550
things sort of escape and and those
kinds of things but the you know the

4714
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:18,560
kinds of things but the you know the
 

4715
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,270
kinds of things but the you know the
thing about this physical space and

01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,639
of gravity and that tells you how things
 

4723
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,030
of gravity and that tells you how things
move in physical space in bronchial

01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,149
integral which it turns out tells you
essentially how things move in quantum

4730
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
essentially how things move in quantum
 

4731
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,229
essentially how things move in quantum
in the space of quantum phases so it's

4732
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
in the space of quantum phases so it's
 

4733
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,790
in the space of quantum phases so it's
kind of like motion and branchial space

4734
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
kind of like motion and branchial space
 

4735
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,870
kind of like motion and branchial space
and it's kind of a fun thing to start

4736
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
and it's kind of a fun thing to start
 

4737
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,629
and it's kind of a fun thing to start
thinking about what

4738
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
thinking about what
 

4739
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,550
thinking about what
oh you know all these things that we

4740
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
oh you know all these things that we
 

4741
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,870
oh you know all these things that we
know in physical space like uh event

4742
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
know in physical space like uh event
 

4743
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,550
know in physical space like uh event
horizons and black holes and so on what

4744
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
horizons and black holes and so on what
 

4745
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,990
horizons and black holes and so on what
are the analogous things in branchial

4746
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
are the analogous things in branchial
 

4747
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,830
are the analogous things in branchial
space for example the speed of light

4748
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:55,840
space for example the speed of light
 

4749
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,030
space for example the speed of light
what's the analog of the speed of light

4750
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
what's the analog of the speed of light
 

4751
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,629
what's the analog of the speed of light
in branch hill space

4752
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
in branch hill space
 

4753
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,229
in branch hill space
it's the maximum speed of quantum

4754
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:00,239
it's the maximum speed of quantum
 

4755
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,750
it's the maximum speed of quantum
entanglement so the speed of light is a

4756
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
entanglement so the speed of light is a
 

4757
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,830
entanglement so the speed of light is a
flash bulb goes off here what's the

4758
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
flash bulb goes off here what's the
 

4759
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,390
flash bulb goes off here what's the
maximum rate at which the effect of that

4760
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
maximum rate at which the effect of that
 

4761
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,430
maximum rate at which the effect of that
flash bulb is detectable moving away in

4762
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
flash bulb is detectable moving away in
 

4763
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,629
flash bulb is detectable moving away in
space

4764
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639
space
 

4765
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,470
space
so similarly in bronchial space

4766
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
so similarly in bronchial space
 

4767
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,790
so similarly in bronchial space
something happens and the question is

4768
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,800
something happens and the question is
 

4769
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,629
something happens and the question is
how far in this branchial space in the

4770
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
how far in this branchial space in the
 

4771
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,430
how far in this branchial space in the
space of quantum states how far away can

4772
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:21,440
space of quantum states how far away can
 

4773
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,830
space of quantum states how far away can
that get within a certain period of time

4774
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:23,840
that get within a certain period of time
 

4775
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,590
that get within a certain period of time
and so there's this notion of a maximum

4776
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
and so there's this notion of a maximum
 

4777
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,310
and so there's this notion of a maximum
entanglement speed and that might be

4778
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
entanglement speed and that might be
 

4779
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,590
entanglement speed and that might be
observable that's the thing we've been

4780
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:29,600
observable that's the thing we've been
 

4781
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,990
observable that's the thing we've been
sort of poking at is might there be a

4782
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
sort of poking at is might there be a
 

4783
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,830
sort of poking at is might there be a
way to observe it even in some atomic

4784
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
way to observe it even in some atomic
 

4785
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,629
way to observe it even in some atomic
physics kind of situation um

4786
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:36,639
physics kind of situation um
 

4787
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,830
physics kind of situation um
because one of the things that's weird

4788
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:37,840
because one of the things that's weird
 

4789
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,550
because one of the things that's weird
in quantum mechanics is we're you know

4790
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,560
in quantum mechanics is we're you know
 

4791
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,149
in quantum mechanics is we're you know
when we study quantum mechanics we

4792
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159
when we study quantum mechanics we
 

4793
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,149
when we study quantum mechanics we
mostly study it in terms of small

4794
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
mostly study it in terms of small
 

4795
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,510
mostly study it in terms of small
numbers of particles you know this

4796
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
numbers of particles you know this
 

4797
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,430
numbers of particles you know this
electron does this this thing on an ion

4798
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,440
electron does this this thing on an ion
 

4799
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,669
electron does this this thing on an ion
trap does that and so on but when we

4800
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
trap does that and so on but when we
 

4801
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,350
trap does that and so on but when we
deal with large numbers of particles

4802
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
deal with large numbers of particles
 

4803
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,709
deal with large numbers of particles
kind of all bets are off it's kind of

4804
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:52,719
kind of all bets are off it's kind of
 

4805
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,070
kind of all bets are off it's kind of
too complicated to deal with quantum

4806
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:54,080
too complicated to deal with quantum
 

4807
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,790
too complicated to deal with quantum
mechanics and so what ends up happening

4808
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
mechanics and so what ends up happening
 

4809
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,350
mechanics and so what ends up happening
is so this question about maximum

4810
01:22:59,350 --> 01:22:59,360
is so this question about maximum
 

4811
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,189
is so this question about maximum
entanglement speed and things like that

4812
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
entanglement speed and things like that
 

4813
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,590
entanglement speed and things like that
may actually play in one of these in the

4814
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
may actually play in one of these in the
 

4815
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,110
may actually play in one of these in the
sort of story of many body quantum

4816
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,120
sort of story of many body quantum
 

4817
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,590
sort of story of many body quantum
mechanics and even have some suspicions

4818
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,600
mechanics and even have some suspicions
 

4819
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,470
mechanics and even have some suspicions
about

4820
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
about
 

4821
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,950
about
things that might happen even in

4822
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
things that might happen even in
 

4823
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,950
things that might happen even in
one of the things i i realized i'd never

4824
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
one of the things i i realized i'd never
 

4825
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,629
one of the things i i realized i'd never
understood and it's kind of embarrassing

4826
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
understood and it's kind of embarrassing
 

4827
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,390
understood and it's kind of embarrassing
but i think i now understand a little

4828
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
but i think i now understand a little
 

4829
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,870
but i think i now understand a little
better is when you have chemistry

4830
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
better is when you have chemistry
 

4831
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,550
better is when you have chemistry
and you have quantum mechanics

4832
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
and you have quantum mechanics
 

4833
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,149
and you have quantum mechanics
it's like well there's two carbon atoms

4834
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
it's like well there's two carbon atoms
 

4835
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,510
it's like well there's two carbon atoms
there's this molecule and we do a

4836
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
there's this molecule and we do a
 

4837
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,830
there's this molecule and we do a
reaction and we draw a diagram we say

4838
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
reaction and we draw a diagram we say
 

4839
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,990
reaction and we draw a diagram we say
this carbon atom ends up in this place

4840
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
this carbon atom ends up in this place
 

4841
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,510
this carbon atom ends up in this place
and it's like but wait a minute in

4842
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:29,520
and it's like but wait a minute in
 

4843
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,189
and it's like but wait a minute in
quantum mechanics nothing ends up in a

4844
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
quantum mechanics nothing ends up in a
 

4845
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,550
quantum mechanics nothing ends up in a
definite place there's always just some

4846
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
definite place there's always just some
 

4847
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,709
definite place there's always just some
wave function for this to happen how can

4848
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
wave function for this to happen how can
 

4849
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,709
wave function for this to happen how can
it be the case that we can draw these

4850
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
it be the case that we can draw these
 

4851
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,229
it be the case that we can draw these
reasonable it just ended up in this

4852
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:38,239
reasonable it just ended up in this
 

4853
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,070
reasonable it just ended up in this
place and you have to kind of say well

4854
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,080
place and you have to kind of say well
 

4855
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,070
place and you have to kind of say well
the environment of the molecule

4856
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:42,080
the environment of the molecule
 

4857
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,750

effectively made a bunch of measurements

4858
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,760
effectively made a bunch of measurements
 

4859
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,750
effectively made a bunch of measurements
on the molecule to keep it kind of

4860
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
on the molecule to keep it kind of
 

4861
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,149
on the molecule to keep it kind of
classical and that's a story that has to

4862
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
classical and that's a story that has to
 

4863
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,790

do with this whole thing about about you

do with this whole thing about about you
 

4865
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,030

something definite happened because in

just these amplitudes for different
 

4879
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,910
just these amplitudes for different
things to happen then there's this thing

4880
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:05,920
things to happen then there's this thing
 

4881
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,470
things to happen then there's this thing
of and then we make a measurement and we

4882
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:08,480
of and then we make a measurement and we
 

4883
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,830
of and then we make a measurement and we
conclude that something definite

conclude that something definite
 

4885
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,750
conclude that something definite
happened and that has to do with this

01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
happened and that has to do with this
 

4887
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,709
happened and that has to do with this
thing i think about sort of moving about

4888
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
thing i think about sort of moving about
 

4889
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:15,990
thing i think about sort of moving about
knitting together these different

4890
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
knitting together these different
 

4891
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,470
knitting together these different
threads of history and saying this is

4892
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:18,480
threads of history and saying this is
 

4893
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,990
threads of history and saying this is
now something where we can definitively

4894
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
now something where we can definitively
 

4895
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,510
now something where we can definitively
say something definite happen in the

4896
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
say something definite happen in the
 

4897
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,510
say something definite happen in the
traditional theory of quantum mechanics

4898
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
traditional theory of quantum mechanics
 

4899
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,110
traditional theory of quantum mechanics
it's just like

4900
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
it's just like
 

4901
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,070
it's just like
you know after you've done all the

4902
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:26,080
you know after you've done all the
 

4903
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,470
you know after you've done all the
sample sheet computation then this big

4904
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,480
sample sheet computation then this big
 

4905
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,990
sample sheet computation then this big
hammer comes down and you do a

4906
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
hammer comes down and you do a
 

4907
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,990
hammer comes down and you do a
measurement and it's all over and that's

4908
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
measurement and it's all over and that's
 

4909
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,510
measurement and it's all over and that's
been very confusing for example in

4910
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:33,520
been very confusing for example in
 

4911
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,270
been very confusing for example in
quantum computing it's been a very

4912
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
quantum computing it's been a very
 

4913
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,830
quantum computing it's been a very
confusing thing because when you say you

4914
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
confusing thing because when you say you
 

4915
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,669
confusing thing because when you say you
know in quantum computing the basic idea

4916
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
know in quantum computing the basic idea
 

4917
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:40,550
know in quantum computing the basic idea
is you're going to use all these

4918
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:40,560
is you're going to use all these
 

4919
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,030
is you're going to use all these
separate threads of of computation so to

4920
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
separate threads of of computation so to
 

4921
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,550
separate threads of of computation so to
speak to do all the different parts of

4922
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
speak to do all the different parts of
 

4923
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,310
speak to do all the different parts of
you know try these different factors for

4924
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,320
you know try these different factors for
 

4925
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,310
you know try these different factors for
an integer or something like this and it

4926
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,320
an integer or something like this and it
 

4927
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,149
an integer or something like this and it
looks like you can do a lot because

4928
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:50,159
looks like you can do a lot because
 

4929
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,830
looks like you can do a lot because
you've got all these different threads

4930
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
you've got all these different threads
 

4931
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,229
you've got all these different threads
going on but then you have to say well

4932
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
going on but then you have to say well
 

4933
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,750
going on but then you have to say well
at the end of it you've got all these

4934
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
at the end of it you've got all these
 

4935
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,350
at the end of it you've got all these
threads and every thread came up with

4936
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
threads and every thread came up with
 

4937
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,950
threads and every thread came up with
the definite answer but we've got to

4938
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
the definite answer but we've got to
 

4939
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,189
the definite answer but we've got to
conflate those together to figure out a

4940
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:01,199
conflate those together to figure out a
 

4941
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,430
conflate those together to figure out a
definite thing that we humans can take

4942
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
definite thing that we humans can take
 

4943
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,590
definite thing that we humans can take
away from it a definite so the computer

4944
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:05,600
away from it a definite so the computer
 

4945
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,870
away from it a definite so the computer
actually produced this output so having

4946
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
actually produced this output so having
 

4947
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,750
actually produced this output so having
this branchial space and this hypergraph

4948
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:11,760
this branchial space and this hypergraph
 

4949
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,990
this branchial space and this hypergraph
model of physics do you think it's

4950
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,000
model of physics do you think it's
 

4951
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,709
model of physics do you think it's
possible to then make predictions that

4952
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
possible to then make predictions that
 

4953
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,910
possible to then make predictions that
are definite about uh many body quantum

4954
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:19,920
are definite about uh many body quantum
 

4955
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,350
are definite about uh many body quantum
mechanical systems

4956
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
mechanical systems
 

4957
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,870

is that the whole i think it's likely

4958
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
is that the whole i think it's likely
 

4959
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,750
is that the whole i think it's likely
yes but i don't you know this is every

4960
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
yes but i don't you know this is every
 

4961
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,830
yes but i don't you know this is every
one of these things when you when you go

4962
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
one of these things when you when you go
 

4963
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,189
one of these things when you when you go
from the underlying theory which is

4964
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
from the underlying theory which is
 

4965
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,350
from the underlying theory which is
complicated enough and it's i mean the

4966
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360
complicated enough and it's i mean the
 

4967
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,030
complicated enough and it's i mean the
theory at some level is beautifully

4968
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,040
theory at some level is beautifully
 

4969
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,870
theory at some level is beautifully
simple but as soon as you start actually

4970
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:34,880
simple but as soon as you start actually
 

4971
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,550
simple but as soon as you start actually
trying to it's this whole question about

4972
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
trying to it's this whole question about
 

4973
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,310
trying to it's this whole question about
how do you bridge it to things that we

4974
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:38,320
how do you bridge it to things that we
 

4975
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,629
how do you bridge it to things that we
humans can talk about it gets really

4976
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:40,639
humans can talk about it gets really
 

4977
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,110
humans can talk about it gets really
complicated and and this thing about

4978
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
complicated and and this thing about
 

4979
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,189
complicated and and this thing about
actually getting it to a definite

4980
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
actually getting it to a definite
 

4981
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:48,229
actually getting it to a definite
definite prediction um about you know

4982
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
definite prediction um about you know
 

4983
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,510
definite prediction um about you know
definite thing you can say about

4984
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
definite thing you can say about
 

4985
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,669
definite thing you can say about
chemistry or something like this um you

4986
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:51,679
chemistry or something like this um you
 

4987
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,790
chemistry or something like this um you
know that's just a lot of work so i'll

4988
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:52,800
know that's just a lot of work so i'll
 

4989
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,310
know that's just a lot of work so i'll
give you an example there's a thing

4990
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
give you an example there's a thing
 

4991
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,030
give you an example there's a thing
called the quantum zeno effect so

4992
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,040
called the quantum zeno effect so
 

4993
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,189
called the quantum zeno effect so
the idea is you know quantum stuff

4994
01:25:59,189 --> 01:25:59,199
the idea is you know quantum stuff
 

4995
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,030
the idea is you know quantum stuff
happens but then if you make a

4996
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
happens but then if you make a
 

4997
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,030
happens but then if you make a
measurement you're kind of freezing time

4998
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:03,040
measurement you're kind of freezing time
 

4999
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,149
measurement you're kind of freezing time
in quantum mechanics you and and so it

5000
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:06,159
in quantum mechanics you and and so it
 

5001
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,830
in quantum mechanics you and and so it
looks like there's a possibility that

5002
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:07,840
looks like there's a possibility that
 

5003
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,270
looks like there's a possibility that
with sort of the the relationship

5004
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:09,280
with sort of the the relationship
 

5005
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,270
with sort of the the relationship
between the quantum zeno effect and the

5006
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
between the quantum zeno effect and the
 

5007
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,709
between the quantum zeno effect and the
way that many body quantum mechanics

5008
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
way that many body quantum mechanics
 

5009
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,070
way that many body quantum mechanics
works and so on maybe just conceivably

5010
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
works and so on maybe just conceivably
 

5011
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,830
works and so on maybe just conceivably
it may be possible to actually figure

5012
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
it may be possible to actually figure
 

5013
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,070
it may be possible to actually figure
out a way to measure the the uh the

5014
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080
out a way to measure the the uh the
 

5015
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,910
out a way to measure the the uh the
maximum entanglement speed and the

5016
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:21,920
maximum entanglement speed and the
 

5017
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,149
maximum entanglement speed and the
reason we can potentially do that is

5018
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:24,159
reason we can potentially do that is
 

5019
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,470
reason we can potentially do that is
because the systems we deal with in

5020
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,480
because the systems we deal with in
 

5021
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,149
because the systems we deal with in
terms of atoms and things they're pretty

5022
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
terms of atoms and things they're pretty
 

5023
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,629
terms of atoms and things they're pretty
big you know a mole of atoms is you know

5024
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
big you know a mole of atoms is you know
 

5025
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,790
big you know a mole of atoms is you know
it's a lot of atoms and you know but it

5026
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:32,800
it's a lot of atoms and you know but it
 

5027
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,709
it's a lot of atoms and you know but it
isn't a very you know it's something

5028
01:26:34,709 --> 01:26:34,719
isn't a very you know it's something
 

5029
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,629
isn't a very you know it's something
where to get you know when we're dealing

5030
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
where to get you know when we're dealing
 

5031
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,629
where to get you know when we're dealing
with how can you see 10 to the minus 100

5032
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
with how can you see 10 to the minus 100
 

5033
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,350
with how can you see 10 to the minus 100
so to speak well by the time you've got

5034
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
so to speak well by the time you've got
 

5035
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,510
so to speak well by the time you've got
you know 10 to the 30th atoms

5036
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
you know 10 to the 30th atoms
 

5037
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,270
you know 10 to the 30th atoms
you're not you know you're within a

01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
you're not you know you're within a
 

5039
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,270
you're not you know you're within a
little bit closer striking distance of

01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
little bit closer striking distance of
 

5041
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,750
little bit closer striking distance of
that it's not like oh we've just got you

5042
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
that it's not like oh we've just got you
 

5043
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,550
that it's not like oh we've just got you
know

5044
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
know
 

5045
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,790
know
two atoms and we're trying to see down

5046
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:52,800
two atoms and we're trying to see down
 

5047
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,550
two atoms and we're trying to see down
to 10 to the minus 100 meters or

5048
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:54,560
to 10 to the minus 100 meters or
 

5049
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,870
to 10 to the minus 100 meters or
whatever so i don't know how it will

5050
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:56,880
whatever so i don't know how it will
 

5051
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,430
whatever so i don't know how it will
work but this is a this is a a potential

5052
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
work but this is a this is a a potential
 

5053
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,070
work but this is a this is a a potential
direction if you can tell by the way if

5054
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
direction if you can tell by the way if
 

5055
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,270
direction if you can tell by the way if
we could measure the maximum

5056
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
we could measure the maximum
 

5057
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,030
we could measure the maximum
entanglement speed we would know the

5058
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
entanglement speed we would know the
 

5059
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,669
entanglement speed we would know the
elementary length these are all related

5060
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:07,679
elementary length these are all related
 

5061
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,149
elementary length these are all related
so if if we get that one number we just

5062
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
so if if we get that one number we just
 

5063
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,310
so if if we get that one number we just
need one number if we can get that one

5064
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
need one number if we can get that one
 

5065
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,229
need one number if we can get that one
number we can you know the theory has no

5066
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:14,239
number we can you know the theory has no
 

5067
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:17,030
number we can you know the theory has no
parameters anymore um and uh you know

5068
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
parameters anymore um and uh you know
 

5069
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,709
parameters anymore um and uh you know
there are there are other places well

5070
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
there are there are other places well
 

5071
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,550
there are there are other places well
there's another another hope for doing

5072
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
there's another another hope for doing
 

5073
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,669
there's another another hope for doing
that is in cosmology uh in this model

5074
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
that is in cosmology uh in this model
 

5075
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,189
that is in cosmology uh in this model
one of the features is the universe is

5076
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
one of the features is the universe is
 

5077
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,870
one of the features is the universe is
not fixed dimensional i mean we think we

5078
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
not fixed dimensional i mean we think we
 

5079
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,870
not fixed dimensional i mean we think we
live in three-dimensional space but this

5080
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
live in three-dimensional space but this
 

5081
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,390
live in three-dimensional space but this
hyper graph doesn't have any particular

5082
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,400
hyper graph doesn't have any particular
 

5083
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,870
hyper graph doesn't have any particular
dimension it can emerge as something

5084
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
dimension it can emerge as something
 

5085
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,669
dimension it can emerge as something
which on an approximation it's as if you

5086
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:35,679
which on an approximation it's as if you
 

5087
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,189
which on an approximation it's as if you
know you say what's the volume of a

5088
01:27:37,189 --> 01:27:37,199
know you say what's the volume of a
 

5089
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,510
know you say what's the volume of a
sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere

5090
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere
 

5091
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,910
sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere
is defined as how many nodes do you get

5092
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
is defined as how many nodes do you get
 

5093
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,910
is defined as how many nodes do you get
to when you go a distance r away from a

5094
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
to when you go a distance r away from a
 

5095
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,110
to when you go a distance r away from a
given point

5096
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
given point
 

5097
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,910
given point
and you can say well if i get to about r

5098
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:47,920
and you can say well if i get to about r
 

5099
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,950
and you can say well if i get to about r
cube nodes when i go a distance r away

5100
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:50,960
cube nodes when i go a distance r away
 

5101
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,629
cube nodes when i go a distance r away
in the hypergraph then i'm living

5102
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
in the hypergraph then i'm living
 

5103
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,470
in the hypergraph then i'm living
roughly in three dimensional space but

5104
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
roughly in three dimensional space but
 

5105
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,030
roughly in three dimensional space but
you might also get to r to the point you

5106
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,040
you might also get to r to the point you
 

5107
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,950
you might also get to r to the point you
know 2.92

5108
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
know 2.92
 

5109
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,910
know 2.92
you know for for some value for r in you

5110
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
you know for for some value for r in you
 

5111
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,750
you know for for some value for r in you
know as as our increases that might be

5112
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,760
know as as our increases that might be
 

5113
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,390
know as as our increases that might be
the the sort of fit to what happens and

5114
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:06,400
the the sort of fit to what happens and
 

5115
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,070
the the sort of fit to what happens and
so one of the things we suspect is that

5116
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
so one of the things we suspect is that
 

5117
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,070
so one of the things we suspect is that
the very early universe was essentially

5118
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
the very early universe was essentially
 

5119
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,229
the very early universe was essentially
infinite dimensional and that as the

5120
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
infinite dimensional and that as the
 

5121
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,189
infinite dimensional and that as the
universe

5122
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:13,199
universe
 

5123
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,629
universe
expanded it became lower dimensional and

5124
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:16,639
expanded it became lower dimensional and
 

5125
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,629
expanded it became lower dimensional and
so one of the things that is another

5126
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
so one of the things that is another
 

5127
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,550
so one of the things that is another
little sort of point where we we think

5128
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
little sort of point where we we think
 

5129
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,229
little sort of point where we we think
there might be a way to to actually

5130
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:22,239
there might be a way to to actually
 

5131
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,669
there might be a way to to actually
measure some things is dimension

5132
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
measure some things is dimension
 

5133
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,750
measure some things is dimension
fluctuations in the early universe that

01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,360
of the universe is it still the case
 

5145
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,110
of the universe is it still the case
that there are there were pieces of the

01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
that there are there were pieces of the
 

5147
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,510
that there are there were pieces of the

that had dimension 3.01 or something and
 

5151
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,229
that had dimension 3.01 or something and
can we tell that is that possible to

5152
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:44,239
can we tell that is that possible to
 

5153
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,430
can we tell that is that possible to
observe

5154
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
observe
 

5155
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,790

uh

5156
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800

01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,270
uh
the fluctuations in dimensions i don't

5158
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
the fluctuations in dimensions i don't
 

5159
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,229
the fluctuations in dimensions i don't
even know what that entails okay so the

5160
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:52,239
even know what that entails okay so the
 

5161
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,590
even know what that entails okay so the
the question

5162
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
the question
 

5163
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,189
the question
which should be an elementary exercise

5164
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
which should be an elementary exercise
 

5165
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:58,550
which should be an elementary exercise
in electrodynamics except it isn't is um

5166
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,560
in electrodynamics except it isn't is um
 

5167
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,310
in electrodynamics except it isn't is um
understanding what happens to a photon

5168
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,320
understanding what happens to a photon
 

5169
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,149
understanding what happens to a photon
when it propagates through 3.01

5170
01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:02,159
when it propagates through 3.01
 

5171
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,590
when it propagates through 3.01
dimensional space

5172
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
dimensional space
 

5173
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,910
dimensional space
so for example the inverse square law is

5174
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
so for example the inverse square law is
 

5175
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,470
so for example the inverse square law is
a consequence of the you know the the

5176
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:08,480
a consequence of the you know the the
 

5177
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,189
a consequence of the you know the the
surface area of a sphere is proportional

5178
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:11,199
surface area of a sphere is proportional
 

5179
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:12,629
surface area of a sphere is proportional
to r squared

5180
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
to r squared
 

5181
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,790
to r squared
but if you're not in three dimensional

5182
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:14,800
but if you're not in three dimensional
 

5183
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,590
but if you're not in three dimensional
space the surface area of sphere is not

5184
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:17,600
space the surface area of sphere is not
 

5185
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,510
space the surface area of sphere is not
proportional to r squared it's r to the

5186
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
proportional to r squared it's r to the
 

5187
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,629
proportional to r squared it's r to the
whatever 2.01 or something

5188
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:22,639
whatever 2.01 or something
 

5189
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,870
whatever 2.01 or something
and so that means that

5190
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:24,880
and so that means that
 

5191
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,149
and so that means that
i think when you kind try and do optics

5192
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:28,159
i think when you kind try and do optics
 

5193
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,070
i think when you kind try and do optics
you know a common principle in optics is

5194
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
you know a common principle in optics is
 

5195
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,149
you know a common principle in optics is
huygens principle which basically says

5196
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
huygens principle which basically says
 

5197
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,790
huygens principle which basically says
that every piece of a wavefront of a of

5198
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
that every piece of a wavefront of a of
 

5199
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,430
that every piece of a wavefront of a of
a

5200
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
a
 

5201
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,790
a
of light is a source of new spherical

5202
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:38,800
of light is a source of new spherical
 

5203
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,709
of light is a source of new spherical
waves and those spherical waves if

5204
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:40,719
waves and those spherical waves if
 

5205
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,149
waves and those spherical waves if
they're different dimensional spherical

5206
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
they're different dimensional spherical
 

5207
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:45,189
they're different dimensional spherical
waves will have other characteristics

5208
01:29:45,189 --> 01:29:45,199
waves will have other characteristics
 

5209
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:47,350
waves will have other characteristics
and so there will be bizarre optical

5210
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:47,360
and so there will be bizarre optical
 

5211
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,510
and so there will be bizarre optical
phenomena which we haven't figured out

5212
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,520
phenomena which we haven't figured out
 

5213
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,149
phenomena which we haven't figured out
yet um so you're you're you're what

5214
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:52,159
yet um so you're you're you're what
 

5215
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,229
yet um so you're you're you're what
looking for some weird photon

5216
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
looking for some weird photon
 

5217
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,070
looking for some weird photon
trajectories

5218
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
trajectories
 

5219
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,629
trajectories
that designate that it's 3.01

5220
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
that designate that it's 3.01
 

5221
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,550
that designate that it's 3.01
dimensional space yeah

5222
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:00,560
dimensional space yeah
 

5223
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,550
dimensional space yeah
yeah that would be an example of i mean

5224
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,560
yeah that would be an example of i mean
 

5225
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,830
yeah that would be an example of i mean
you know there are there are only a

5226
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
you know there are there are only a
 

5227
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,030
you know there are there are only a
certain number of things we can measure

5228
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:05,040
certain number of things we can measure
 

5229
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,950
certain number of things we can measure
about photons you know we can measure

5230
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
about photons you know we can measure
 

5231
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,470
about photons you know we can measure
their polarization we can measure their

5232
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
their polarization we can measure their
 

5233
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,030
their polarization we can measure their
frequency we can measure their direction

5234
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
frequency we can measure their direction
 

5235
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,510
frequency we can measure their direction
um those kinds of things and you know

5236
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,520
um those kinds of things and you know
 

5237
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,430
um those kinds of things and you know
how that all works out

5238
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:15,440
how that all works out
 

5239
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,910
how that all works out
and you know in the current models of

5240
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
and you know in the current models of
 

5241
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,709
and you know in the current models of
physics uh you know it's been hard to

5242
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:20,719
physics uh you know it's been hard to
 

5243
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,470
physics uh you know it's been hard to
explain how the universe manages to be

5244
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:22,480
explain how the universe manages to be
 

5245
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,550
explain how the universe manages to be
as uniform as it is and that's led to

5246
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
as uniform as it is and that's led to
 

5247
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,750
as uniform as it is and that's led to
this inflation idea that um to the to

5248
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
this inflation idea that um to the to
 

5249
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,870
this inflation idea that um to the to
the great annoyance of my then

5250
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:28,880
the great annoyance of my then
 

5251
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,030
the great annoyance of my then
collaborator i we had we figured out in

5252
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,040
collaborator i we had we figured out in
 

5253
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,510
collaborator i we had we figured out in
like 1979 we had this realization that

5254
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
like 1979 we had this realization that
 

5255
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,189
like 1979 we had this realization that
that you could get something like this

5256
01:30:35,189 --> 01:30:35,199
that you could get something like this
 

5257
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,870
that you could get something like this
but it seemed implausible that that's

5258
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
but it seemed implausible that that's
 

5259
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,229
but it seemed implausible that that's
the way the universe worked so we put in

5260
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:38,239
the way the universe worked so we put in
 

5261
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,590
the way the universe worked so we put in
a footnote and that was uh so that's a

5262
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
a footnote and that was uh so that's a
 

5263
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,350
a footnote and that was uh so that's a
but but any case i i've never really

5264
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:43,360
but but any case i i've never really
 

5265
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,750
but but any case i i've never really
completely believed it but this that's

5266
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:45,760
completely believed it but this that's
 

5267
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,830
completely believed it but this that's
an idea for how to sort of puff out the

5268
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:47,840
an idea for how to sort of puff out the
 

5269
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,830
an idea for how to sort of puff out the
universe faster than the speed of light

5270
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:49,840
universe faster than the speed of light
 

5271
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,669
universe faster than the speed of light
early moments of the universe that

5272
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:51,679
early moments of the universe that
 

5273
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,070
early moments of the universe that
that's the sort of inflation idea and

5274
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
that's the sort of inflation idea and
 

5275
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,629
that's the sort of inflation idea and
that you can somehow explain how the

5276
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
that you can somehow explain how the
 

5277
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,870
that you can somehow explain how the
universe manages to be as uniform as it

5278
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
universe manages to be as uniform as it
 

5279
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,070
universe manages to be as uniform as it
is in in our model this turns out to be

5280
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:02,080
is in in our model this turns out to be
 

5281
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,149
is in in our model this turns out to be
much more natural because the universe

5282
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:04,159
much more natural because the universe
 

5283
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,510
much more natural because the universe
just starts very connected the

5284
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:05,520
just starts very connected the
 

5285
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,030
just starts very connected the
hypergraph is not

5286
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:07,040
hypergraph is not
 

5287
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,189
hypergraph is not
such that the ball that you grow

5288
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:09,199
such that the ball that you grow
 

5289
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,189
such that the ball that you grow
starting from single point has volume r

5290
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:11,199
starting from single point has volume r
 

5291
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,229
starting from single point has volume r
cubed it might have volume r to the 500

5292
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:14,239
cubed it might have volume r to the 500
 

5293
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,510
cubed it might have volume r to the 500
or r to the infinity um and so that

5294
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:17,520
or r to the infinity um and so that
 

5295
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,430
or r to the infinity um and so that
means that you you sort of naturally get

5296
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
means that you you sort of naturally get
 

5297
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,950
means that you you sort of naturally get
this much higher degree of connectivity

5298
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
this much higher degree of connectivity
 

5299
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,950
this much higher degree of connectivity
and uniformity in the universe and then

5300
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
and uniformity in the universe and then
 

5301
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,430
and uniformity in the universe and then
the question is uh this is sort of the

5302
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:25,440
the question is uh this is sort of the
 

5303
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,750
the question is uh this is sort of the
mathematical physics challenge is in the

5304
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
mathematical physics challenge is in the
 

5305
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,430
mathematical physics challenge is in the
standard theory of the universe there's

5306
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
standard theory of the universe there's
 

5307
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,510
standard theory of the universe there's
the friedman robertson walker universe

5308
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:31,520
the friedman robertson walker universe
 

5309
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,110
the friedman robertson walker universe
which is the kind of standard model

5310
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:33,120
which is the kind of standard model
 

5311
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,629
which is the kind of standard model
where the universe is isotropic and

5312
01:31:34,629 --> 01:31:34,639
where the universe is isotropic and
 

5313
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,950
where the universe is isotropic and
homogeneous and you can then work out

5314
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
homogeneous and you can then work out
 

5315
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,709
homogeneous and you can then work out
the equations of general relativity and

5316
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:38,719
the equations of general relativity and
 

5317
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:39,990
the equations of general relativity and
you can figure out how the universe

5318
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
you can figure out how the universe
 

5319
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,110
you can figure out how the universe
expands

5320
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,120
expands
 

5321
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,390
expands
we would like to do the same kind of

5322
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:42,400
we would like to do the same kind of
 

5323
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,550
we would like to do the same kind of
thing including dimension change

5324
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:44,560
thing including dimension change
 

5325
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,070
thing including dimension change
this is just difficult mathematical

5326
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,080
this is just difficult mathematical
 

5327
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,790
this is just difficult mathematical
physics i mean the reason it's difficult

5328
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:48,800
physics i mean the reason it's difficult
 

5329
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,310
physics i mean the reason it's difficult
is there's sort of fundamental reason

5330
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320
is there's sort of fundamental reason
 

5331
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,070
is there's sort of fundamental reason
it's difficult when when people invented

5332
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
it's difficult when when people invented
 

5333
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,629
it's difficult when when people invented

turns out nobody turns out that but what

5350
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
turns out nobody turns out that but what
 

5351
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,310
turns out nobody turns out that but what
we need to have to understand these

5352
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
we need to have to understand these
 

5353
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,790
we need to have to understand these
fractional dimensional spaces uh which

5354
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:18,800
fractional dimensional spaces uh which
 

5355
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,270
fractional dimensional spaces uh which
don't work like well they're

5356
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280
don't work like well they're
 

5357
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,270
don't work like well they're
they're spaces where where the effective

5358
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:23,280
they're spaces where where the effective
 

5359
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,229
they're spaces where where the effective
dimension is not an integer so you can't

5360
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:26,239
dimension is not an integer so you can't
 

5361
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:29,030
dimension is not an integer so you can't
apply the tools of calculus in naturally

5362
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
apply the tools of calculus in naturally
 

5363
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,910
apply the tools of calculus in naturally
and easily to fractional dimensions no

5364
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920
and easily to fractional dimensions no
 

5365
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,510
and easily to fractional dimensions no
so somebody has to figure out how to do

5366
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:33,520
so somebody has to figure out how to do
 

5367
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,430
so somebody has to figure out how to do
that yeah we're trying to figure this

5368
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:35,440
that yeah we're trying to figure this
 

5369
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,590
that yeah we're trying to figure this
out i mean it's it's very interesting

5370
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
out i mean it's it's very interesting
 

5371
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,830
out i mean it's it's very interesting
it's very connected to very frontier

5372
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:39,840
it's very connected to very frontier
 

5373
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,110
it's very connected to very frontier
issues in mathematics it's very

5374
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,120
issues in mathematics it's very
 

5375
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,229
issues in mathematics it's very
beautiful but so is it possible is it

5376
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:44,239
beautiful but so is it possible is it
 

5377
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,310
beautiful but so is it possible is it
possible we're dealing with a scale

5378
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:46,320
possible we're dealing with a scale
 

5379
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,030
possible we're dealing with a scale
that's so so much smaller than our human

5380
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
that's so so much smaller than our human
 

5381
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,390
that's so so much smaller than our human
scale

5382
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:50,400
scale
 

5383
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,229
scale
is it possible to make predictions

5384
01:32:52,229 --> 01:32:52,239
is it possible to make predictions
 

5385
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,270
is it possible to make predictions
versus explanations do you have a hope

5386
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,280
versus explanations do you have a hope
 

5387
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,669
versus explanations do you have a hope
that with this hypograph model you'll be

5388
01:32:57,669 --> 01:32:57,679
that with this hypograph model you'll be
 

5389
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,750
that with this hypograph model you'll be
able to make predictions yeah

5390
01:32:59,750 --> 01:32:59,760
able to make predictions yeah
 

5391
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,550
able to make predictions yeah
that

5392
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:00,560
that
 

5393
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,110
that
that could be validated with a physics

5394
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
that could be validated with a physics
 

5395
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,350
that could be validated with a physics
experiment predictions that couldn't

5396
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
experiment predictions that couldn't
 

5397
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,590
experiment predictions that couldn't
have been done or weren't done otherwise

5398
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:07,600
have been done or weren't done otherwise
 

5399
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,350
have been done or weren't done otherwise
oh yeah yeah i mean you know i think

5400
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
oh yeah yeah i mean you know i think
 

5401
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,189
oh yeah yeah i mean you know i think
which in which domain do you think okay

5402
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
which in which domain do you think okay
 

5403
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,950
which in which domain do you think okay
so they're going to be cosmology ones to

5404
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:12,960
so they're going to be cosmology ones to
 

5405
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,390
so they're going to be cosmology ones to
do with dimension fluctuations in the

5406
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
do with dimension fluctuations in the
 

5407
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,149
do with dimension fluctuations in the
universe that's a very bizarre effect

5408
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
universe that's a very bizarre effect
 

5409
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,750
universe that's a very bizarre effect
nobody you know dimension fluctuation is

5410
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:17,760
nobody you know dimension fluctuation is
 

5411
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,350
nobody you know dimension fluctuation is
just something nobody ever looked for

5412
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:19,360
just something nobody ever looked for
 

5413
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,629
just something nobody ever looked for
that if anybody sees dimension

5414
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:20,639
that if anybody sees dimension
 

5415
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,750
that if anybody sees dimension
fluctuation that's a huge flag that

5416
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:23,760
fluctuation that's a huge flag that
 

5417
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,550
fluctuation that's a huge flag that
something like our model is going on if

5418
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
something like our model is going on if
 

5419
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,790
something like our model is going on if
and and how one detects that you know

5420
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
and and how one detects that you know
 

5421
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,550
and and how one detects that you know
that's a problem of kind of you know

5422
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,560
that's a problem of kind of you know
 

5423
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,229
that's a problem of kind of you know
that's a problem of traditional physics

5424
01:33:32,229 --> 01:33:32,239
that's a problem of traditional physics
 

5425
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,750
that's a problem of traditional physics
in a sense of what's the best way to

5426
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
in a sense of what's the best way to
 

5427
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,629
in a sense of what's the best way to
actually

5428
01:33:34,629 --> 01:33:34,639
actually
 

5429
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,629
actually
figure that out and and for example that

5430
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
figure that out and and for example that
 

5431
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,270
figure that out and and for example that
that's one there are there are all kinds

5432
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
that's one there are there are all kinds
 

5433
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,629
that's one there are there are all kinds
of things one can imagine i mean there

5434
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
of things one can imagine i mean there
 

5435
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,510
of things one can imagine i mean there
are things that um uh in black hole

5436
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,520
are things that um uh in black hole
 

5437
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,709
are things that um uh in black hole
mergers it's possible that there will be

5438
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:46,719
mergers it's possible that there will be
 

5439
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,550
mergers it's possible that there will be
effects of maximum entanglement speed

5440
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:48,560
effects of maximum entanglement speed
 

5441
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,950
effects of maximum entanglement speed
and large black hole mergers um that's

5442
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:50,960
and large black hole mergers um that's
 

5443
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,270
and large black hole mergers um that's
another another possible thing and all

5444
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
another another possible thing and all
 

5445
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,430
another another possible thing and all
of that is detected through like what do

5446
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:55,440
of that is detected through like what do
 

5447
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,030
of that is detected through like what do
you have a hope for ligo type of

5448
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
you have a hope for ligo type of
 

5449
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,669
you have a hope for ligo type of
situation like gravitational waves yeah

5450
01:33:59,669 --> 01:33:59,679
situation like gravitational waves yeah
 

5451
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,709
situation like gravitational waves yeah
or alternatively i mean i think it's you

5452
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:02,719
or alternatively i mean i think it's you
 

5453
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:03,430
or alternatively i mean i think it's you
know

5454
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
know
 

5455
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,550
know
look figuring out experiments is like

5456
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,560
look figuring out experiments is like
 

5457
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,709
look figuring out experiments is like
figuring out technology inventions right

5458
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
figuring out technology inventions right
 

5459
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,629
figuring out technology inventions right
that is you know you've got a set of raw

5460
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
that is you know you've got a set of raw
 

5461
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,629
that is you know you've got a set of raw
materials you've got an underlying model

5462
01:34:12,629 --> 01:34:12,639
materials you've got an underlying model
 

5463
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,550
materials you've got an underlying model
and now you've got to be very clever to

5464
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
and now you've got to be very clever to
 

5465
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,310
and now you've got to be very clever to
figure out you know what is that thing i

5466
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
figure out you know what is that thing i
 

5467
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,790
figure out you know what is that thing i
can measure that just somehow you know

5468
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:18,800
can measure that just somehow you know
 

5469
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,910
can measure that just somehow you know
leverages in to the right place and

5470
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
leverages in to the right place and
 

5471
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,590
leverages in to the right place and
we've spent less effort on that than i

5472
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,600
we've spent less effort on that than i
 

5473
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,830
we've spent less effort on that than i
would have liked because i one of the

5474
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
would have liked because i one of the
 

5475
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,510
would have liked because i one of the
one of the reasons is that that i think

5476
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
one of the reasons is that that i think
 

5477
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,830
one of the reasons is that that i think
that the the this you know the

5478
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
that the the this you know the
 

5479
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,830
that the the this you know the
physicists who've been working on on our

5480
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:31,840
physicists who've been working on on our
 

5481
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,149
physicists who've been working on on our
models we've with now lots of physicists

5482
01:34:34,149 --> 01:34:34,159
models we've with now lots of physicists
 

5483
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,590
models we've with now lots of physicists
actually it's very very nice it's kind

5484
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:35,600
actually it's very very nice it's kind
 

5485
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,470
actually it's very very nice it's kind
of uh

5486
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
of uh
 

5487
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,030
of uh
it's one of these cases where i'm almost

5488
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
it's one of these cases where i'm almost
 

5489
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,350
it's one of these cases where i'm almost
i'm really kind of pleasantly surprised

5490
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:41,360
i'm really kind of pleasantly surprised
 

5491
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,550
i'm really kind of pleasantly surprised
that the sort of absorption of the

5492
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
that the sort of absorption of the
 

5493
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,270
that the sort of absorption of the
things we've done has been uh quite

5494
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
things we've done has been uh quite
 

5495
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,990
things we've done has been uh quite
rapid and quite uh sort of you know very

5496
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
rapid and quite uh sort of you know very
 

5497
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,149
rapid and quite uh sort of you know very
positive so it's a cambrian explosion of

5498
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
positive so it's a cambrian explosion of
 

5499
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,390
positive so it's a cambrian explosion of
physicists too not just ideas

5500
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:52,400
physicists too not just ideas
 

5501
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,470
physicists too not just ideas
yes i mean you know a lot of what's

5502
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
yes i mean you know a lot of what's
 

5503
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,629
yes i mean you know a lot of what's
happened that's really interesting and

5504
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
happened that's really interesting and
 

5505
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,790
happened that's really interesting and
again not what i expected is there are a

5506
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:58,800
again not what i expected is there are a
 

5507
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,590
again not what i expected is there are a
lot of areas of of sort of very uh

for decades in these particular areas
 

5533
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,709
for decades in these particular areas
and the question is but but they've been

5534
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
and the question is but but they've been
 

5535
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:30,629
and the question is but but they've been
building these mathematical structures

5536
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
building these mathematical structures
 

5537
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:31,910
building these mathematical structures
and the mathematical structures are

5538
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
and the mathematical structures are
 

5539
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,430
and the mathematical structures are
interesting but they're not they don't

01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,440
interesting but they're not they don't

01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,350
typically sit on anything they're just
mathematical structures and i think

5544
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:37,360
mathematical structures and i think
 

5545
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,350
mathematical structures and i think
what's happened is our models provide

5546
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
what's happened is our models provide
 

5547
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,830
what's happened is our models provide
kind of a machine code that lives

kind of a machine code that lives
 

5549
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,910
kind of a machine code that lives
underneath those models so a typical

been working on our project um this is

01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:51,840
been working on our project um this is
 

5557
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,550
been working on our project um this is
uh in okay so i'll give you an example

5558
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
uh in okay so i'll give you an example
 

5559
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,830
uh in okay so i'll give you an example
just to give a sense of how these things

5560
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
just to give a sense of how these things
 

5561
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,550
just to give a sense of how these things
connect this is in causal set theory so

5562
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:58,560
connect this is in causal set theory so
 

5563
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,109
connect this is in causal set theory so
the idea of causal set theory is

01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
the idea of causal set theory is
 

5565
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:03,669
the idea of causal set theory is
there are in space-time we imagine that

01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,430
one-dimensional you know set up we
imagine that there are just events that

imagine that there are just events that
happen at different times and places in

and the idea of causal set theory is the
 

5579
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,510

there are a bunch of events that happen
 

5583
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,030
there are a bunch of events that happen
sort of randomly at different places in

sort of randomly at different places in
 

5585
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,430
sort of randomly at different places in
space and time and then the whole sort

5586
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:25,440
space and time and then the whole sort
 

5587
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,189
space and time and then the whole sort
of theory of physics has to be to do

of theory of physics has to be to do

with this this graph of causal

thrown down events
 

5595
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,070
thrown down events
so they've always been confused by the

5596
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
so they've always been confused by the
 

5597
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,070
so they've always been confused by the
fact that to get even lorentz and

5598
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
fact that to get even lorentz and
 

5599
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,910
fact that to get even lorentz and
variance even relativistic and variants

5600
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:39,920
variance even relativistic and variants
 

5601
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,750
variance even relativistic and variants
you need a very special way to throw

5602
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:41,760
you need a very special way to throw
 

5603
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,830
you need a very special way to throw
down those events and they've had no

5604
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
down those events and they've had no
 

5605
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,510
down those events and they've had no
natural way to understand how that would

5606
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:45,520
natural way to understand how that would
 

5607
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,310
natural way to understand how that would
happen

5608
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:46,320
happen
 

5609
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,870

so what jonathan figured out is that in

5610
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:48,880
so what jonathan figured out is that in
 

5611
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,550
so what jonathan figured out is that in
fact from our models

5612
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
fact from our models
 

5613
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,109
fact from our models
they instead of just

5614
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
they instead of just
 

5615
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,070
they instead of just
generating events at random our models

5616
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:56,080
generating events at random our models
 

5617
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,990
generating events at random our models
necessarily generate events in some

5618
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,000
necessarily generate events in some
 

5619
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,189
necessarily generate events in some
pattern in space-time effectively that

5620
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:01,199
pattern in space-time effectively that
 

5621
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,870
pattern in space-time effectively that
then leads to ransom variants and

5622
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:02,880
then leads to ransom variants and
 

5623
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,149
then leads to ransom variants and
relativistic invariants and all those

5624
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:04,159
relativistic invariants and all those
 

5625
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,149
relativistic invariants and all those
kinds of things so it's a place where

5626
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:06,159
kinds of things so it's a place where
 

5627
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,830
kinds of things so it's a place where
all the mathematics that's been done on

5628
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
all the mathematics that's been done on
 

5629
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,510
all the mathematics that's been done on
well we just have a random collection of

5630
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
well we just have a random collection of
 

5631
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,270
well we just have a random collection of
events now what you know what

5632
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
events now what you know what
 

5633
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,590
events now what you know what
consequences does that have in terms of

5634
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:13,600
consequences does that have in terms of
 

5635
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,750
consequences does that have in terms of
causal set theory and so on that can all

5636
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:15,760
causal set theory and so on that can all
 

5637
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,990
causal set theory and so on that can all
be kind of wheeled in now that we have

5638
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
be kind of wheeled in now that we have
 

5639
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,310
be kind of wheeled in now that we have
some different underlying foundational

5640
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:20,320
some different underlying foundational
 

5641
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,629
some different underlying foundational
idea for what what the particular

5642
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:22,639
idea for what what the particular
 

5643
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,310
idea for what what the particular
distribution of events is as opposed to

5644
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
distribution of events is as opposed to
 

5645
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,470
distribution of events is as opposed to
just we throw down random events

5646
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
just we throw down random events
 

5647
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,390
just we throw down random events
and so that's a that's a typical sort of

5648
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:28,400
and so that's a that's a typical sort of
 

5649
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,229
and so that's a that's a typical sort of
example of what we're seeing in all

5650
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
example of what we're seeing in all
 

5651
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,709
example of what we're seeing in all
these different areas of kind of how you

5652
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:32,719
these different areas of kind of how you
 

5653
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,550
these different areas of kind of how you
can take you know really interesting

5654
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
can take you know really interesting
 

5655
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,270
can take you know really interesting
things that have been done in

5656
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:35,280
things that have been done in
 

5657
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,270
things that have been done in
mathematical physics and connect them

5658
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
mathematical physics and connect them
 

5659
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,109
mathematical physics and connect them
and it's really kind of beautiful

5660
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
and it's really kind of beautiful
 

5661
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,750
and it's really kind of beautiful
because the the you know the sort of the

5662
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
because the the you know the sort of the
 

5663
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,070
because the the you know the sort of the
abstract models we have just seem to

5664
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080
abstract models we have just seem to
 

5665
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,149
abstract models we have just seem to

interesting very elegant abstract ideas

5668
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:48,639
interesting very elegant abstract ideas
 

5669
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:51,030
interesting very elegant abstract ideas
but we're now giving sort of a reason

5670
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
but we're now giving sort of a reason
 

5671
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,629
but we're now giving sort of a reason
for that to be the way

5672
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
for that to be the way
 

5673
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,109
for that to be the way
for for a reason for one to care i mean

5674
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
for for a reason for one to care i mean
 

5675
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,470
for for a reason for one to care i mean
it's like saying

5676
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
it's like saying
 

5677
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,470
it's like saying
uh you can you know you can think about

5678
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:58,480
uh you can you know you can think about
 

5679
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,870
uh you can you know you can think about
computation abstractly you know you can

5680
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880
computation abstractly you know you can
 

5681
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,390
computation abstractly you know you can
think about i don't know combinators or

5682
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:02,400
think about i don't know combinators or
 

5683
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,990
think about i don't know combinators or
something as abstract computational

5684
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,000
something as abstract computational
 

5685
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,149
something as abstract computational
things and you can sort of do all kinds

5686
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:06,159
things and you can sort of do all kinds
 

5687
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,310
things and you can sort of do all kinds
of study of them but it's like why do we

5688
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:08,320
of study of them but it's like why do we
 

5689
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,390
of study of them but it's like why do we
care well okay turing machines are a

5690
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
care well okay turing machines are a
 

5691
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,669
care well okay turing machines are a
good start because you can kind of see

5692
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
good start because you can kind of see
 

5693
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,270
good start because you can kind of see
they're sort of mechanically doing

5694
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
they're sort of mechanically doing
 

5695
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,629
they're sort of mechanically doing
things but when we actually start

5696
01:38:14,629 --> 01:38:14,639
things but when we actually start
 

5697
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,629
things but when we actually start
thinking about computers computing

5698
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
thinking about computers computing
 

5699
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,550
thinking about computers computing
things we have a really good reason to

5700
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,560
things we have a really good reason to
 

5701
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,790
things we have a really good reason to
care and this is sort of what we're what

5702
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
care and this is sort of what we're what
 

5703
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,629
care and this is sort of what we're what
we're providing i think is a reason to

5704
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
we're providing i think is a reason to
 

5705
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,310
we're providing i think is a reason to
care about a lot of these areas of

5706
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,320
care about a lot of these areas of
 

5707
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,750
care about a lot of these areas of
mathematical physics so that's been

5708
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
mathematical physics so that's been
 

5709
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,070
mathematical physics so that's been
that's been very nice so i'm not sure

5710
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
that's been very nice so i'm not sure
 

5711
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,709
that's been very nice so i'm not sure
we've ever got to the

5712
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
we've ever got to the
 

5713
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,109
we've ever got to the
the question of why does the university

5714
01:38:33,109 --> 01:38:33,119
the question of why does the university
 

5715
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,350
the question of why does the university
let's let's let's talk about that yes so

5716
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:35,360
let's let's let's talk about that yes so
 

5717
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,590
let's let's let's talk about that yes so
we're it's not the simplest question in

5718
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:37,600
we're it's not the simplest question in
 

5719
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,390
we're it's not the simplest question in
the world so um so it's it takes a few

5720
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,400
the world so um so it's it takes a few
 

5721
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,470
the world so um so it's it takes a few
steps to get to it and it's nevertheless

5722
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:42,480
steps to get to it and it's nevertheless
 

5723
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,870
steps to get to it and it's nevertheless
even surprisingly you can even begin to

5724
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
even surprisingly you can even begin to
 

5725
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,629
even surprisingly you can even begin to
answer this question indeed as you were

5726
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:46,639
answer this question indeed as you were
 

5727
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,590
answer this question indeed as you were
saying i'm very surprised

5728
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
saying i'm very surprised
 

5729
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,030
saying i'm very surprised
so

5730
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
so
 

5731
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,870
so
the next thing to perhaps understand is

5732
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:52,880
the next thing to perhaps understand is
 

5733
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,030
the next thing to perhaps understand is
this idea of rulial space

5734
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
this idea of rulial space
 

5735
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,430
this idea of rulial space
so we've got kind of physical space

5736
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
so we've got kind of physical space
 

5737
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,590
so we've got kind of physical space
we've got branchial space the space of

5738
01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,600
we've got branchial space the space of
 

5739
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,750
we've got branchial space the space of
possible quantum histories and now we've

5740
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:01,760
possible quantum histories and now we've
 

5741
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,470
possible quantum histories and now we've
got another level of kind of abstraction

5742
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,480
got another level of kind of abstraction
 

5743
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,310
got another level of kind of abstraction
which is real space and here's the

5744
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
which is real space and here's the
 

5745
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,149
which is real space and here's the
here's where that comes from

5746
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
here's where that comes from
 

5747
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,350
here's where that comes from
so you say okay you say we've got this

5748
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:11,360
so you say okay you say we've got this
 

5749
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,430
so you say okay you say we've got this
model for the universe we've got

5750
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:13,440
model for the universe we've got
 

5751
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,910
model for the universe we've got
a particular rule and we run this rule

5752
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:15,920
a particular rule and we run this rule
 

5753
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,070
a particular rule and we run this rule
and we get the universe okay so that's

5754
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,080
and we get the universe okay so that's
 

5755
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,870
and we get the universe okay so that's
that's interesting why that rule why not

5756
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
that's interesting why that rule why not
 

5757
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,070
that's interesting why that rule why not
another rule

5758
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
another rule
 

5759
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,390
another rule
and so that confused me for a long time

5760
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,400
and so that confused me for a long time
 

5761
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,550
and so that confused me for a long time
then i realized well actually

5762
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
then i realized well actually
 

5763
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,750
then i realized well actually
what if

5764
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
what if
 

5765
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,590
what if
the thing could be using all possible

5766
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:29,600
the thing could be using all possible
 

5767
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,229
the thing could be using all possible
rules what if at every step in addition

5768
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
rules what if at every step in addition
 

5769
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,109
rules what if at every step in addition
to saying apply a particular rule at all

5770
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:35,119
to saying apply a particular rule at all
 

5771
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,669
to saying apply a particular rule at all
places in this hyper graph one could say

5772
01:39:37,669 --> 01:39:37,679
places in this hyper graph one could say
 

5773
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:39,669
places in this hyper graph one could say
just take all possible rules and apply

5774
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
just take all possible rules and apply
 

5775
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,270
just take all possible rules and apply
all possible rules at all possible

5776
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
all possible rules at all possible
 

5777
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,030
all possible rules at all possible
places in this hypergraph

5778
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,040
places in this hypergraph
 

5779
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,030
places in this hypergraph
okay and then you make this rulial

5780
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
okay and then you make this rulial
 

5781
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,750
okay and then you make this rulial
multi-way graph which both is all

5782
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
multi-way graph which both is all
 

5783
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,750
multi-way graph which both is all
possible histories for a particular rule

5784
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
possible histories for a particular rule
 

5785
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,990
possible histories for a particular rule
and all possible rules so the next thing

5786
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,000
and all possible rules so the next thing
 

5787
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,830
and all possible rules so the next thing
you'd say is how can you get anything

5788
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:53,840
you'd say is how can you get anything
 

5789
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,830
you'd say is how can you get anything
reasonable how can anything you know

5790
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
reasonable how can anything you know
 

5791
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,790
reasonable how can anything you know
real come out of the set of all possible

5792
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
real come out of the set of all possible
 

5793
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,109
real come out of the set of all possible
rules applied in all possible ways okay

5794
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
rules applied in all possible ways okay
 

5795
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:03,189
rules applied in all possible ways okay
there's a subtle thing so which i

5796
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:03,199
there's a subtle thing so which i
 

5797
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,030
there's a subtle thing so which i
haven't fully untangled

5798
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
haven't fully untangled
 

5799
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,830
haven't fully untangled
the there is this object which is the

5800
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:07,840
the there is this object which is the
 

5801
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,229
the there is this object which is the
result of running all possible rules in

5802
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
result of running all possible rules in
 

5803
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,149
result of running all possible rules in
all possible ways and you might say if

5804
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159
all possible ways and you might say if
 

5805
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:13,430
all possible ways and you might say if
you're running all possible rules why

5806
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
you're running all possible rules why
 

5807
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,669
you're running all possible rules why
can't everything possible happen

5808
01:40:15,669 --> 01:40:15,679
can't everything possible happen
 

5809
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,070
can't everything possible happen
well the answer is because

5810
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:18,080
well the answer is because
 

5811
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,149
well the answer is because
when you there's sort of this

5812
01:40:20,149 --> 01:40:20,159
when you there's sort of this
 

5813
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:23,189
when you there's sort of this
entanglement that occurs so let's say

5814
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:23,199
entanglement that occurs so let's say
 

5815
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:25,270
entanglement that occurs so let's say
that you have a lot of different

5816
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
that you have a lot of different
 

5817
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,030
that you have a lot of different
possible initial conditions a lot of

5818
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040
possible initial conditions a lot of
 

5819
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,950
possible initial conditions a lot of
different possible states then you're

5820
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:28,960
different possible states then you're
 

5821
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,709
different possible states then you're
applying these different rules

5822
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:30,719
applying these different rules
 

5823
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,270
applying these different rules
well some of those rules can end up with

5824
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,280
well some of those rules can end up with
 

5825
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,510
well some of those rules can end up with
the same state so it isn't the case that

5826
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:35,520
the same state so it isn't the case that
 

5827
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,629
the same state so it isn't the case that
you can just get from anywhere to

5828
01:40:36,629 --> 01:40:36,639
you can just get from anywhere to
 

5829
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,550
you can just get from anywhere to
anywhere there's this whole entangled

5830
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,560
anywhere there's this whole entangled
 

5831
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,109
anywhere there's this whole entangled
structure of what can lead to what and

5832
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:41,119
structure of what can lead to what and
 

5833
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,310
structure of what can lead to what and
there's a definite structure that's

5834
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
there's a definite structure that's
 

5835
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,430
there's a definite structure that's
produced

5836
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
produced
 

5837
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,709
produced
i think i'm going to call that definite

5838
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:44,719
i think i'm going to call that definite
 

5839
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:48,070
i think i'm going to call that definite
structure the ruliad the limit of um

5840
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,080
structure the ruliad the limit of um
 

5841
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,229
structure the ruliad the limit of um
the limits of kind of uh all possible

5842
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,239
the limits of kind of uh all possible
 

5843
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,070
the limits of kind of uh all possible
rules being applied in all possible ways

5844
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:52,080
rules being applied in all possible ways
 

5845
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,270
rules being applied in all possible ways
and you're saying that structure is

5846
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,280
and you're saying that structure is
 

5847
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,470
and you're saying that structure is
finite

5848
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,480
finite
 

5849
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,550
finite
so that somehow connects to maybe a

5850
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:56,560
so that somehow connects to maybe a
 

5851
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,390
so that somehow connects to maybe a
similar kind of thing as like causal

01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,400
similar kind of thing as like causal
 

5853
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,950
similar kind of thing as like causal
invariance well there happens

5854
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
invariance well there happens
 

5855
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,870

necessarily has causal invariance that's

5856
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:02,880
necessarily has causal invariance that's
 

5857
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,790
necessarily has causal invariance that's
a feature of that's just a mathematical

5858
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:04,800
a feature of that's just a mathematical
 

5859
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,870
a feature of that's just a mathematical
consequence of essentially using all

5860
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:06,880
consequence of essentially using all
 

5861
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,189
consequence of essentially using all
possible rules plus universal

5862
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
possible rules plus universal
 

5863
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,669
possible rules plus universal
computation gives you the fact that from

5864
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
computation gives you the fact that from
 

5865
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,149
computation gives you the fact that from
any diverging paths you can always the

5866
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
any diverging paths you can always the
 

5867
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:15,750
any diverging paths you can always the
the paths will always convert does that

5868
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:15,760
the paths will always convert does that
 

5869
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,910
the paths will always convert does that
say that the rule does that necessarily

5870
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:17,920
say that the rule does that necessarily
 

5871
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,470
say that the rule does that necessarily
infer that the ruliad is

5877
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,470
in the end it's not necessarily finite i
mean it's it's a it's a the the just

5878
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
mean it's it's a it's a the the just
 

5879
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,070
mean it's it's a it's a the the just
like the history of the universe may not

01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:31,920
time may keep going forever you can keep
 

5885
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,990
time may keep going forever you can keep
running the computations of the ruliad

5886
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:34,000
running the computations of the ruliad
 

5887
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,510
running the computations of the ruliad
and you'll keep spewing out more and

5888
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
and you'll keep spewing out more and
 

5889
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,990
and you'll keep spewing out more and
more and more structure it's like time

5890
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,000
more and more structure it's like time
 

5891
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,669
more and more structure it's like time
doesn't have to end

5892
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
doesn't have to end
 

5893
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,109
doesn't have to end
it's it's um

5894
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
it's it's um
 

5895
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,350
it's it's um
that but the the issue is there are

5896
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,360
that but the the issue is there are
 

5897
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,870
that but the the issue is there are
there are three limits that happen in

01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,470
there are three limits that happen in
this ruliad object

5900
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:46,480
this ruliad object
 

5901
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,550
this ruliad object
one is how long you run the computation

5902
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:48,560
one is how long you run the computation
 

5903
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,189
one is how long you run the computation
for another is how many different rules

5904
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:51,199
for another is how many different rules
 

5905
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,350
for another is how many different rules
you're applying and another is how many

5906
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:53,360
you're applying and another is how many
 

5907
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,350
you're applying and another is how many
different states you start from

5908
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
different states you start from
 

5909
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,350
different states you start from
and the mixture of those three limits i

5910
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:57,360
and the mixture of those three limits i
 

5911
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,270
and the mixture of those three limits i
mean this is just mathematically a

5912
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
mean this is just mathematically a
 

5913
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,070
mean this is just mathematically a
horrendous object okay and what's what's

5914
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
horrendous object okay and what's what's
 

5915
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,390
horrendous object okay and what's what's
interesting about this object is the one

01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:04,400
interesting about this object is the one
 

5917
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,669
interesting about this object is the one
thing that does seem to be the case

01:42:05,669 --> 01:42:05,679
thing that does seem to be the case
 

5919
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,510
thing that does seem to be the case
about this object is it connects with

5920
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
about this object is it connects with
 

5921
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,590
about this object is it connects with
ideas in higher category theory and in

ideas in higher category theory and in
 

5923
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,669
ideas in higher category theory and in
particular it connects to some of the

01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:11,679
particular it connects to some of the
 

5925
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,550
particular it connects to some of the
20th century's most abstract mathematics

growth and leak had a thing called the

5930
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:18,080
growth and leak had a thing called the
 

5931
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,310
growth and leak had a thing called the
infinity group void which is closely

5932
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
infinity group void which is closely
 

5933
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,950
infinity group void which is closely
related to this roulette object

5934
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
related to this roulette object
 

5935
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,430
related to this roulette object
although the details of the relationship

5936
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:25,440
although the details of the relationship
 

5937
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,709
although the details of the relationship
uh you know i don't fully understand yet

5938
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:28,719
uh you know i don't fully understand yet
 

5939
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,030
uh you know i don't fully understand yet
um but i think that the what's what's

5940
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
um but i think that the what's what's
 

5941
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,390
um but i think that the what's what's
interesting is this thing that is sort

5942
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
interesting is this thing that is sort
 

5943
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,950
interesting is this thing that is sort
of this very limiting object so so okay

5944
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
of this very limiting object so so okay
 

5945
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,870
of this very limiting object so so okay
so a way to think about this that that

5946
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:36,880
so a way to think about this that that
 

5947
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,510
so a way to think about this that that
again will will take us into another

5948
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:39,520
again will will take us into another
 

5949
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,030
again will will take us into another
direction which is the equivalence

5950
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:41,040
direction which is the equivalence
 

5951
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,350

01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
between physics and mathematics
 

5953
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,430
between physics and mathematics
the way that uh

5954
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:45,440
the way that uh
 

5955
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,470
the way that uh
well let's see uh maybe this is um just

5956
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:48,480
well let's see uh maybe this is um just
 

5957
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,629
well let's see uh maybe this is um just
to give a sense of this kind of um

5958
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639
to give a sense of this kind of um
 

5959
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,229
to give a sense of this kind of um
groupoid and things like that you can

5960
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:52,239
groupoid and things like that you can
 

5961
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,070
groupoid and things like that you can
think about in mathematics you can think

5962
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,080
think about in mathematics you can think
 

5963
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,229
think about in mathematics you can think
you have certain axioms they're kind of

5964
01:42:56,229 --> 01:42:56,239
you have certain axioms they're kind of
 

5965
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:59,750
you have certain axioms they're kind of
like atoms and you well actually let's

5966
01:42:59,750 --> 01:42:59,760
like atoms and you well actually let's
 

5967
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,709
like atoms and you well actually let's
say

5968
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
say
 

5969
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:01,990
say
let's talk about mathematics for a

5970
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
let's talk about mathematics for a
 

5971
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,750
let's talk about mathematics for a
second so what is mathematics what do

5972
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760
second so what is mathematics what do
 

5973
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,229
second so what is mathematics what do
what is what is it made of so to speak

5974
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:06,239
what is what is it made of so to speak
 

5975
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,590
what is what is it made of so to speak
mathematics there's a bunch of

5976
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:07,600
mathematics there's a bunch of
 

5977
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,590
mathematics there's a bunch of
statements like uh

5978
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
statements like uh
 

5979
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,910
statements like uh
for addition x plus y is equal to y plus

5980
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:11,920
for addition x plus y is equal to y plus
 

5981
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,229
for addition x plus y is equal to y plus
x that's a statement of mathematics

5982
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:14,239
x that's a statement of mathematics
 

5983
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:15,910
x that's a statement of mathematics
another statement will be you know x

5984
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
another statement will be you know x
 

5985
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,669
another statement will be you know x
squared minus one is equal to x plus one

5986
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:17,679
squared minus one is equal to x plus one
 

5987
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:20,149
squared minus one is equal to x plus one
x minus one there are infinite number of

5988
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
x minus one there are infinite number of
 

5989
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,910
x minus one there are infinite number of
these possible statements of mathematics

5990
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:21,920
these possible statements of mathematics
 

5991
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,430
these possible statements of mathematics
well it's not i mean it's not just i

5992
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:23,440
well it's not i mean it's not just i
 

5993
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,830
well it's not i mean it's not just i
guess a statement but with x plus y it's

5994
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
guess a statement but with x plus y it's
 

5995
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,470
guess a statement but with x plus y it's
uh it's a rule the you can it's a i mean

5996
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
uh it's a rule the you can it's a i mean
 

5997
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,950
uh it's a rule the you can it's a i mean
you think of it as a rule it's it's a it

5998
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
you think of it as a rule it's it's a it
 

5999
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,149
you think of it as a rule it's it's a it
is a it is a rule it's also just a thing

6000
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
is a it is a rule it's also just a thing
 

6001
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,709
is a it is a rule it's also just a thing
that is true in mathematics right um the

6002
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
that is true in mathematics right um the
 

6003
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,790
that is true in mathematics right um the
statement of truth okay right and and

6004
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
statement of truth okay right and and
 

6005
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,470
statement of truth okay right and and
what you can imagine is you you you

6006
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
what you can imagine is you you you
 

6007
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,030
what you can imagine is you you you
imagine just laying out this giant kind

6008
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:43,040
imagine just laying out this giant kind
 

6009
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,070
imagine just laying out this giant kind
of ocean of all all statements well

6010
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,080
of ocean of all all statements well
 

6011
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,990
of ocean of all all statements well
actually you first start okay this is

6012
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,000
actually you first start okay this is
 

6013
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,870
actually you first start okay this is
where

6014
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
where
 

6015
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,229
where
this was segwaying into a different

6016
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:50,239
this was segwaying into a different
 

6017
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:51,590
this was segwaying into a different
thing let me let me not go in this

6018
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,600
thing let me let me not go in this
 

6019
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,030
thing let me let me not go in this
direction for a second let's not go to

6020
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040
direction for a second let's not go to
 

6021
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,870
direction for a second let's not go to
meta mathematics just yet yeah we'll

6022
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
meta mathematics just yet yeah we'll
 

6023
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,109
meta mathematics just yet yeah we'll
we'll maybe get to meta mathematics but

6024
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
we'll maybe get to meta mathematics but
 

6025
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,750
we'll maybe get to meta mathematics but
it's it's um uh so let me not let me

6026
01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,760
it's it's um uh so let me not let me
 

6027
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,350
it's it's um uh so let me not let me
explain the groupoid and things later

6028
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,360
explain the groupoid and things later
 

6029
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,669
explain the groupoid and things later
yes yeah but but so let's come back to

6030
01:44:03,669 --> 01:44:03,679
yes yeah but but so let's come back to
 

6031
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,629
yes yeah but but so let's come back to
the universe um always a good place to

6032
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:06,639
the universe um always a good place to
 

6033
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:08,950
the universe um always a good place to
be in so yeah so what does the universe

6034
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
be in so yeah so what does the universe
 

6035
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,790
be in so yeah so what does the universe
have to do with the rouley ad the rulio

6036
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800
have to do with the rouley ad the rulio
 

6037
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,910
have to do with the rouley ad the rulio
space and how that's possible

6038
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:13,920
space and how that's possible
 

6039
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,709
space and how that's possible
lee connected to why the thing exists at

6040
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:16,719
lee connected to why the thing exists at
 

6041
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,350
lee connected to why the thing exists at
all and why there's just one of them yes

6042
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:19,360
all and why there's just one of them yes
 

6043
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,669
all and why there's just one of them yes
okay so here's the point so the thing

6044
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:21,679
okay so here's the point so the thing
 

6045
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,229
okay so here's the point so the thing
that had confused me for a long time was

6046
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:24,239
that had confused me for a long time was
 

6047
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:26,229
that had confused me for a long time was
let's say we get the rule for the

6048
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:26,239
let's say we get the rule for the
 

6049
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,830
let's say we get the rule for the
universe we hold it in our hand we say

6050
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
universe we hold it in our hand we say
 

6051
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,990
universe we hold it in our hand we say
this is our universe then the immediate

6052
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,000
this is our universe then the immediate
 

6053
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,310
this is our universe then the immediate
question is well why isn't another one

6054
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
question is well why isn't another one
 

6055
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,550
question is well why isn't another one
and you know that's kind of the you know

6056
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
and you know that's kind of the you know
 

6057
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,790
and you know that's kind of the you know
the the sort of the lesson of copernicus

6058
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
the the sort of the lesson of copernicus
 

6059
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,990
the the sort of the lesson of copernicus
is we're not very special so how come we

6060
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:40,000
is we're not very special so how come we
 

6061
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,830
is we're not very special so how come we
got universe number 312 and not universe

6062
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
got universe number 312 and not universe
 

6063
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,070
got universe number 312 and not universe
quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion and

6064
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:46,080
quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion and
 

6065
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,750
quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion and
i think the resolution of that is the

6066
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:47,760
i think the resolution of that is the
 

6067
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,510
i think the resolution of that is the
realization that

6068
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:49,520
realization that
 

6069
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,310
realization that
there that the universe is running all

6070
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,320
there that the universe is running all
 

6071
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,750
there that the universe is running all
possible rules

6072
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:53,760
possible rules
 

6073
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,430
possible rules
so then you say well how on earth do we

6074
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:57,440
so then you say well how on earth do we
 

6075
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,950
so then you say well how on earth do we
perceive the universe to be running

6076
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:58,960
perceive the universe to be running
 

6077
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,030
perceive the universe to be running
according to a particular rule how do we

6078
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:01,040
according to a particular rule how do we
 

6079
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,629
according to a particular rule how do we
perceive definite things happening in

6080
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
perceive definite things happening in
 

6081
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,910
perceive definite things happening in
the universe well

6082
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
the universe well
 

6083
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,030
the universe well
it's the same story it's the observer

6084
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
it's the same story it's the observer
 

6085
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,870
it's the same story it's the observer
there is a reference frame that we are

6086
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:08,880
there is a reference frame that we are
 

6087
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,189
there is a reference frame that we are
picking in this rule space

6088
01:45:11,189 --> 01:45:11,199
picking in this rule space
 

6089
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:13,510
picking in this rule space
and that that is what determines our

6090
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
and that that is what determines our
 

6091
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,350
and that that is what determines our
perception of the universe with our

6092
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
perception of the universe with our
 

6093
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,990
perception of the universe with our
particular sensory information and so on

6094
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:18,000
particular sensory information and so on
 

6095
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,229
particular sensory information and so on
we are parsing the universe in this

6096
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:20,239
we are parsing the universe in this
 

6097
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,470
we are parsing the universe in this
particular way so here's the way to

6098
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:22,480
particular way so here's the way to
 

6099
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,790
particular way so here's the way to
think about it in in in physical space

6100
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:24,800
think about it in in in physical space
 

6101
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,229
think about it in in in physical space
we live in a particular place in the

6102
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:26,239
we live in a particular place in the
 

6103
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,390
we live in a particular place in the
universe and you know we could live in

6104
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:28,400
universe and you know we could live in
 

6105
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,790
universe and you know we could live in
alpha centauri but we don't we live here

6106
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
alpha centauri but we don't we live here
 

6107
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,310
alpha centauri but we don't we live here
um and

6108
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:32,320
um and
 

6109
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,390
um and
similarly in rural space

6110
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,400
similarly in rural space
 

6111
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,550
similarly in rural space
we could live in many different places

6112
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:36,560
we could live in many different places
 

6113
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,470
we could live in many different places
in rural space but we happen to live

6114
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:38,480
in rural space but we happen to live
 

6115
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,310
in rural space but we happen to live
here and what does it mean to live here

6116
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:40,320
here and what does it mean to live here
 

6117
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,030
here and what does it mean to live here
it means we have certain sensory input

6118
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:43,040
it means we have certain sensory input
 

6119
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,629
it means we have certain sensory input
we have certain ways to parse the

6120
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
we have certain ways to parse the
 

6121
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:45,750
we have certain ways to parse the
universe

6122
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,760
universe
 

6123
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,830
universe
those are our interpretation of the

6124
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
those are our interpretation of the
 

6125
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,070
those are our interpretation of the
universe what would it mean to travel in

6126
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,080
universe what would it mean to travel in
 

6127
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,430
universe what would it mean to travel in
rule space

6128
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
rule space
 

6129
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,030
rule space
what it basically means is that we are

6130
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
what it basically means is that we are
 

6131
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,430
what it basically means is that we are
successively interpreting the universe

6132
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
successively interpreting the universe
 

6133
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,189
successively interpreting the universe
in different ways so in other words to

6134
01:45:57,189 --> 01:45:57,199
in different ways so in other words to
 

6135
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,750
in different ways so in other words to
be at a different point in rule space is

6136
01:45:59,750 --> 01:45:59,760
be at a different point in rule space is
 

6137
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,669
be at a different point in rule space is
to have a different in a sense a

6138
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
to have a different in a sense a
 

6139
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,270
to have a different in a sense a
different interpretation of what's going

6140
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,280
different interpretation of what's going
 

6141
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,990
different interpretation of what's going
on in the universe and we can imagine

6142
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:06,000
on in the universe and we can imagine
 

6143
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,590
on in the universe and we can imagine
even things like an analog of the speed

6144
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:07,600
even things like an analog of the speed
 

6145
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,830
even things like an analog of the speed
of light as the maximum speed of

6146
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:09,840
of light as the maximum speed of
 

6147
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,390
of light as the maximum speed of
translation in real space and so on

6148
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,400
translation in real space and so on
 

6149
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,070
translation in real space and so on
so wait what's the

6150
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,080
so wait what's the
 

6151
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,750
so wait what's the
interpretation

6152
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:15,760
interpretation
 

6153
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,590
interpretation
so real space

6154
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:17,600
so real space
 

6155
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,830
so real space
and we is i'm confused by the we and the

6156
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:19,840
and we is i'm confused by the we and the
 

6157
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,550
and we is i'm confused by the we and the
interpretation and the universe i

6158
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:22,560
interpretation and the universe i
 

6159
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,030
interpretation and the universe i
thought moving about in real space

6160
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,040
thought moving about in real space
 

6161
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,310
thought moving about in real space
changes the way the universe

6162
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:28,320
changes the way the universe
 

6163
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,430
changes the way the universe
is

6164
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:29,440
is
 

6165
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,470
is
is

6166
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:30,480
is
 

6167
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,470
is
the the way we would perceive it the way

6168
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:32,480
the the way we would perceive it the way
 

6169
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,470
the the way we would perceive it the way
that so this ultimately has to do with

6170
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:34,480
that so this ultimately has to do with
 

6171
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,830
that so this ultimately has to do with
the perception so it doesn't real real

6172
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
the perception so it doesn't real real
 

6173
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,750
the perception so it doesn't real real
space is not

6174
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:39,760
space is not
 

6175
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,669
space is not
somehow changing

6176
01:46:41,669 --> 01:46:41,679
somehow changing
 

6177
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:42,390
somehow changing
like

6178
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,400
like
 

6179
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,270
like
uh

6180
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,280
uh
 

6181
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,870
uh
branching into another universe

6182
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:44,880
branching into another universe
 

6183
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,629
branching into another universe
something like that no i mean

6184
01:46:46,629 --> 01:46:46,639
something like that no i mean
 

6185
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,229
something like that no i mean
the point is that the whole point of

6186
01:46:48,229 --> 01:46:48,239
the point is that the whole point of
 

6187
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:50,310
the point is that the whole point of
this is the rouliad is

6188
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:50,320
this is the rouliad is
 

6189
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,350
this is the rouliad is
sort of

6190
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:51,360
sort of
 

6191
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,390
sort of
the encapsulated version of everything

6192
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:54,400
the encapsulated version of everything
 

6193
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,910
the encapsulated version of everything
that is the universe running according

6194
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:55,920
that is the universe running according
 

6195
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,629
that is the universe running according
to all possible yeah we think of uh our

6196
01:46:58,629 --> 01:46:58,639
to all possible yeah we think of uh our
 

6197
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:01,270
to all possible yeah we think of uh our
universe the observable universe

6198
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:01,280
universe the observable universe
 

6199
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,950
universe the observable universe
as its

6200
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
as its
 

6201
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,550
as its
thing so we're a little bit loose with

6202
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:04,560
thing so we're a little bit loose with
 

6203
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,109
thing so we're a little bit loose with
the word universe then because wouldn't

6204
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:07,119
the word universe then because wouldn't
 

6205
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,470
the word universe then because wouldn't
the ruley ad

6206
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:08,480
the ruley ad
 

6207
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,709
the ruley ad
potentially encapsulate

6208
01:47:10,709 --> 01:47:10,719
potentially encapsulate
 

6209
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,669
potentially encapsulate
a very large number like combinatorially

6210
01:47:13,669 --> 01:47:13,679
a very large number like combinatorially
 

6211
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,430
a very large number like combinatorially
large maybe infinite

6212
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
large maybe infinite
 

6213
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,350
large maybe infinite
set of what we

6214
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
set of what we
 

6215
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:20,229
set of what we
human physicists think of as universes

6216
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:20,239
human physicists think of as universes
 

6217
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:21,750
human physicists think of as universes
that's an interesting interesting

6218
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:21,760
that's an interesting interesting
 

6219
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,830
that's an interesting interesting
parsing of the word universe right

6220
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840
parsing of the word universe right
 

6221
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,149
parsing of the word universe right
because what we're saying is just as

6222
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:26,159
because what we're saying is just as
 

6223
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,510
because what we're saying is just as
we're at a particular place in physical

6224
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
we're at a particular place in physical
 

6225
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,870
we're at a particular place in physical
space we're at a particular place in

6226
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:28,880
space we're at a particular place in
 

6227
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,550
space we're at a particular place in
rural space

6228
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:30,560
rural space
 

6229
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,709
rural space
at that particular place in rural space

6230
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
at that particular place in rural space
 

6231
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,550
at that particular place in rural space
our experience of the universe is this

6232
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:34,560
our experience of the universe is this
 

6233
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,229
our experience of the universe is this
yeah just as if we lived at the center

6234
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:36,239
yeah just as if we lived at the center
 

6235
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:37,590
yeah just as if we lived at the center
of the galaxy our universe our

6236
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:37,600
of the galaxy our universe our
 

6237
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,709
of the galaxy our universe our
experience of the universe will be

6238
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719
experience of the universe will be
 

6239
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,470
experience of the universe will be
different from the when it is given

6240
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:40,480
different from the when it is given
 

6241
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:43,189
different from the when it is given
where we actually live and so in us what

6242
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
where we actually live and so in us what
 

6243
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,510
where we actually live and so in us what
we're saying is our

6244
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520
we're saying is our
 

6245
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,910
we're saying is our
when you might say i mean in a sense

6246
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:47,920
when you might say i mean in a sense
 

6247
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,830
when you might say i mean in a sense
this this ruliad is sort of a super

6248
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:49,840
this this ruliad is sort of a super
 

6249
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,470
this this ruliad is sort of a super
universe so to speak um but it's all

6250
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:52,480
universe so to speak um but it's all
 

6251
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,310
universe so to speak um but it's all
entangled together it's not like you can

6252
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:54,320
entangled together it's not like you can
 

6253
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,030
entangled together it's not like you can
separate out you can say let me

6254
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:57,040
separate out you can say let me
 

6255
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,950
separate out you can say let me
it's it's like when we take a reference

6256
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
it's it's like when we take a reference
 

6257
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,550
it's it's like when we take a reference
okay it's like our experience of the

6258
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:00,560
okay it's like our experience of the
 

6259
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,229
okay it's like our experience of the
universe is based on where we are in the

6260
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:02,239
universe is based on where we are in the
 

6261
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,350
universe is based on where we are in the
universe

6262
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:03,360
universe
 

6263
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,950
universe
we could imagine moving to somewhere

6264
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:04,960
we could imagine moving to somewhere
 

6265
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,310
we could imagine moving to somewhere
else in the universe but it's still the

6266
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,320
else in the universe but it's still the
 

6267
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,990
else in the universe but it's still the
same universe so there's not like

6268
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
same universe so there's not like
 

6269
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,390
same universe so there's not like
universes

6270
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:10,400
universes
 

6271
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,229
universes
existing in parallel

6272
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
existing in parallel
 

6273
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:13,590
existing in parallel
no

6274
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
no
 

6275
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,030
no
because because

6276
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:15,040
because because
 

6277
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,109
because because
and the whole point is that if we were

6278
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119
and the whole point is that if we were
 

6279
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,189
and the whole point is that if we were
able to change our interpretation of

6280
01:48:19,189 --> 01:48:19,199
able to change our interpretation of
 

6281
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,629
able to change our interpretation of
what's going on

6282
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
what's going on
 

6283
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,830
what's going on
we could perceive a different reference

6284
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:23,840
we could perceive a different reference
 

6285
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,750
we could perceive a different reference
frame in this roulette yeah but that's

6286
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:25,760
frame in this roulette yeah but that's
 

6287
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,470
frame in this roulette yeah but that's
not

6288
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:26,480
not
 

6289
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,109
not
that's not uh that's just yeah that's

6290
01:48:29,109 --> 01:48:29,119
that's not uh that's just yeah that's
 

6291
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,350
that's not uh that's just yeah that's
the same rule yeah that's the same

6292
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:31,360
the same rule yeah that's the same
 

6293
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,070
the same rule yeah that's the same
universe you're just moving about this

6294
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:34,080
universe you're just moving about this
 

6295
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,390
universe you're just moving about this
is just coordinates right so so the way

6296
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:36,400
is just coordinates right so so the way
 

6297
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,709
is just coordinates right so so the way
that's the reason that's interesting is

6298
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
that's the reason that's interesting is
 

6299
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,229
that's the reason that's interesting is
imagine the extraterrestrial

6300
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
imagine the extraterrestrial
 

6301
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,070
imagine the extraterrestrial
intelligence so the alien intelligence

6302
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
intelligence so the alien intelligence
 

6303
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,430
intelligence so the alien intelligence
we should say

6304
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
we should say
 

6305
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,990
we should say
the alien intelligence might live on

6306
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:46,000
the alien intelligence might live on
 

6307
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,390
the alien intelligence might live on
alpha centauri but it might also live at

6308
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,400
alpha centauri but it might also live at
 

6309
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,550
alpha centauri but it might also live at
a different place in rural space it can

6310
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
a different place in rural space it can
 

6311
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,229
a different place in rural space it can
live right here on earth it just has a

6312
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
live right here on earth it just has a
 

6313
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,070
live right here on earth it just has a
different reference frame that

6314
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
different reference frame that
 

6315
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,550
different reference frame that
includes a very different perception of

6316
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
includes a very different perception of
 

6317
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,189
includes a very different perception of
the universe right and then because that

6318
01:48:59,189 --> 01:48:59,199
the universe right and then because that
 

6319
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:01,990
the universe right and then because that
really all space is very large

6320
01:49:01,990 --> 01:49:02,000
really all space is very large
 

6321
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,750
really all space is very large
i mean

6322
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:03,760
i mean
 

6323
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,830
i mean
do we get to communicate with them right

6324
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,840
do we get to communicate with them right
 

6325
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,950
do we get to communicate with them right
that's yeah but it's also well one uh

6326
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:08,960
that's yeah but it's also well one uh
 

6327
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,870
that's yeah but it's also well one uh
thing is how

6328
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:10,880
thing is how
 

6329
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,270
thing is how
different the perception

6330
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,280
different the perception
 

6331
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,270
different the perception
of the universe could be i think it

6332
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:15,280
of the universe could be i think it
 

6333
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,550
of the universe could be i think it
could be bizarrely

6334
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:17,560
could be bizarrely
 

6335
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,070
could be bizarrely
unimaginably completely different and i

6336
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,080
unimaginably completely different and i
 

6337
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,030
unimaginably completely different and i
mean one thing to realize is even in

6338
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:23,040
mean one thing to realize is even in
 

6339
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,189
mean one thing to realize is even in
kind of things i don't understand well

6340
01:49:25,189 --> 01:49:25,199
kind of things i don't understand well
 

6341
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:27,109
kind of things i don't understand well
you know i'm i i know about the kind of

6342
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
you know i'm i i know about the kind of
 

6343
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,270
you know i'm i i know about the kind of
western tradition of understanding you

6344
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:29,280
western tradition of understanding you
 

6345
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,109
western tradition of understanding you
know science and all that kind of thing

6346
01:49:31,109 --> 01:49:31,119
know science and all that kind of thing
 

6347
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,950
know science and all that kind of thing
and you know you talk to people who say

6348
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
and you know you talk to people who say
 

6349
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,550
and you know you talk to people who say
well i you know i'm really into some you

6350
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:36,560
well i you know i'm really into some you
 

6351
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,709
well i you know i'm really into some you
know eastern tradition of this that and

6352
01:49:38,709 --> 01:49:38,719
know eastern tradition of this that and
 

6353
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,550
know eastern tradition of this that and
the other and it's really obvious to me

6354
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:40,560
the other and it's really obvious to me
 

6355
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,390
the other and it's really obvious to me
what how things work

6356
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:42,400
what how things work
 

6357
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,149
what how things work
i don't understand it at all

6358
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:44,159
i don't understand it at all
 

6359
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,870
i don't understand it at all
but you know it is not obvious i think

6360
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:46,880
but you know it is not obvious i think
 

6361
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,310
but you know it is not obvious i think
with this kind of realization that

6362
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:48,320
with this kind of realization that
 

6363
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,550
with this kind of realization that
there's these very different ways to

6364
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:50,560
there's these very different ways to
 

6365
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,830
there's these very different ways to
interpret what's going on in the

6366
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:51,840
interpret what's going on in the
 

6367
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,990
interpret what's going on in the
universe that kind of gives me at least

6368
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
universe that kind of gives me at least
 

6369
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,589
universe that kind of gives me at least
it doesn't help me to understand that

6370
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:55,599
it doesn't help me to understand that
 

6371
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:57,589
it doesn't help me to understand that
different interpretation but it gives me

6372
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
different interpretation but it gives me
 

6373
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,430
different interpretation but it gives me
at least more respect for the

6374
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,440
at least more respect for the
 

6375
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,709
at least more respect for the
possibility that there will be other

6376
01:50:00,709 --> 01:50:00,719
possibility that there will be other
 

6377
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,950
possibility that there will be other
interpretations yeah it humbles you to

6378
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:02,960
interpretations yeah it humbles you to
 

6379
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,109
interpretations yeah it humbles you to
the possibility that like what is it

6380
01:50:05,109 --> 01:50:05,119
the possibility that like what is it
 

6381
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:08,070
the possibility that like what is it
reincarnation or all all these like uh

6382
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:08,080
reincarnation or all all these like uh
 

6383
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,990
reincarnation or all all these like uh
eternal recurrence with nietzsche like

6384
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:10,000
eternal recurrence with nietzsche like
 

6385
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,750
eternal recurrence with nietzsche like
just these ideas

6386
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:11,760
just these ideas
 

6387
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:12,629
just these ideas
yeah

6388
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
yeah
 

6389
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,070
yeah
well you know the thing that i realized

6390
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:14,080
well you know the thing that i realized
 

6391
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,589
well you know the thing that i realized
about a bunch of those things is that

6392
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:15,599
about a bunch of those things is that
 

6393
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:16,950
about a bunch of those things is that
you know i've been sort of doing my

6394
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:16,960
you know i've been sort of doing my
 

6395
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,390
you know i've been sort of doing my
little survey of the history of

6396
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:18,400
little survey of the history of
 

6397
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,310
little survey of the history of
philosophy just trying to understand you

6398
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:20,320
philosophy just trying to understand you
 

6399
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,070
philosophy just trying to understand you
know what what can i actually say now

6400
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
know what what can i actually say now
 

6401
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,750
know what what can i actually say now
about some of these things and you

6402
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
about some of these things and you
 

6403
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,510
about some of these things and you
realize that some of these concepts like

6404
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:25,520
realize that some of these concepts like
 

6405
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,669
realize that some of these concepts like
the immortal soul concept

6406
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:27,679
the immortal soul concept
 

6407
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,589
the immortal soul concept
which you know i remember when i was a

6408
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:29,599
which you know i remember when i was a
 

6409
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,310
which you know i remember when i was a
kid and you know it was kind of a lots

6410
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
kid and you know it was kind of a lots
 

6411
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,629
kid and you know it was kind of a lots
of religion bashing type stuff of people

6412
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:34,639
of religion bashing type stuff of people
 

6413
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,149
of religion bashing type stuff of people
saying you know what we know about

6414
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:36,159
saying you know what we know about
 

6415
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:38,629
saying you know what we know about
physics tell us how much does a soul

6416
01:50:38,629 --> 01:50:38,639
physics tell us how much does a soul
 

6417
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:39,830
physics tell us how much does a soul
weigh

6418
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:39,840
weigh
 

6419
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,550
weigh
and people are like well how can it be a

6420
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:42,560
and people are like well how can it be a
 

6421
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,709
and people are like well how can it be a
thing if it doesn't weigh anything

6422
01:50:44,709 --> 01:50:44,719
thing if it doesn't weigh anything
 

6423
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:46,870
thing if it doesn't weigh anything
well now we understand you know there is

6424
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:46,880
well now we understand you know there is
 

6425
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,709
well now we understand you know there is
this notion of what's in brains that

6426
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:48,719
this notion of what's in brains that
 

6427
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,470
this notion of what's in brains that
isn't the matter of brains and it's

6428
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,480
isn't the matter of brains and it's
 

6429
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,709
isn't the matter of brains and it's
something computational and there is a

6430
01:50:52,709 --> 01:50:52,719
something computational and there is a
 

6431
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,030
something computational and there is a
sense and in fact it is correct that it

6432
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:55,040
sense and in fact it is correct that it
 

6433
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,790
sense and in fact it is correct that it
is in some sense immortal because this

6434
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:56,800
is in some sense immortal because this
 

6435
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,790
is in some sense immortal because this
pattern of computation is something

6436
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
pattern of computation is something
 

6437
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,950
pattern of computation is something
abstract that is not specific to the

6438
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
abstract that is not specific to the
 

6439
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,830
abstract that is not specific to the
particular material of a brain now we

6440
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:03,840
particular material of a brain now we
 

6441
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,990
particular material of a brain now we
don't know how to extract it you know in

6442
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,000
don't know how to extract it you know in
 

6443
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,790
don't know how to extract it you know in
our traditional scientific approach but

6444
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800
our traditional scientific approach but
 

6445
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,629
our traditional scientific approach but
it's still something where it isn't a

6446
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:10,639
it's still something where it isn't a
 

6447
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:13,030
it's still something where it isn't a
crazy thing to say there is something it

6448
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
crazy thing to say there is something it
 

6449
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,950
crazy thing to say there is something it
doesn't weigh anything that's a kind of

6450
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:14,960
doesn't weigh anything that's a kind of
 

6451
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,510
doesn't weigh anything that's a kind of
a silly question how much does it weigh

6452
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:17,520
a silly question how much does it weigh
 

6453
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,589
a silly question how much does it weigh
um well actually maybe it isn't such a

6454
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:19,599
um well actually maybe it isn't such a
 

6455
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:21,270
um well actually maybe it isn't such a
silly question in our model of physics

6456
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,280
silly question in our model of physics
 

6457
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,189
silly question in our model of physics
because the actual computational

6458
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:23,199
because the actual computational
 

6459
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:25,750
because the actual computational
activity has has a consequence for

6460
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:25,760
activity has has a consequence for
 

6461
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,030
activity has has a consequence for
gravity and things but that's a very

6462
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:27,040
gravity and things but that's a very
 

6463
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,629
gravity and things but that's a very
very subtle because if we start talking

6464
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:28,639
very subtle because if we start talking
 

6465
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:30,629
very subtle because if we start talking
about mass and energy and so on there

6466
01:51:30,629 --> 01:51:30,639
about mass and energy and so on there
 

6467
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,950
about mass and energy and so on there
could be a uh what would you call a

6468
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
could be a uh what would you call a
 

6469
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,109
could be a uh what would you call a
solatron

6470
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
solatron
 

6471
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:37,350
solatron
yes yes yes a particle

6472
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,360
yes yes yes a particle
 

6473
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,830
yes yes yes a particle
that somehow contains soulness yeah

6474
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
that somehow contains soulness yeah
 

6475
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,830
that somehow contains soulness yeah
right well that's what by the way that's

6476
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
right well that's what by the way that's
 

6477
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,149
right well that's what by the way that's
what leibniz said and you know one thing

6478
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:44,159
what leibniz said and you know one thing
 

6479
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,910
what leibniz said and you know one thing
i've i've never understood this you know

6480
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:45,920
i've i've never understood this you know
 

6481
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,589
i've i've never understood this you know
leibniz had the center of monads and

6482
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:47,599
leibniz had the center of monads and
 

6483
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,669
leibniz had the center of monads and
monadolology and he had this idea that

6484
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679
monadolology and he had this idea that
 

6485
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,430
monadolology and he had this idea that
that what exists in the universe is this

6486
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:51,440
that what exists in the universe is this
 

6487
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,830
that what exists in the universe is this
big collection of monads and that they

6488
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:53,840
big collection of monads and that they
 

6489
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,830
big collection of monads and that they
that the only thing that one knows about

6490
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:55,840
that the only thing that one knows about
 

6491
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,589
that the only thing that one knows about
the monads is sort of how they relate to

6492
01:51:57,589 --> 01:51:57,599
the monads is sort of how they relate to
 

6493
01:51:57,599 --> 01:51:59,270
the monads is sort of how they relate to
each other which sounds awfully like

6494
01:51:59,270 --> 01:51:59,280
each other which sounds awfully like
 

6495
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,229
each other which sounds awfully like
hypographs right but leibniz had really

6496
01:52:02,229 --> 01:52:02,239
hypographs right but leibniz had really
 

6497
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:04,629
hypographs right but leibniz had really
lost me at the following thing he said

6498
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
lost me at the following thing he said
 

6499
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,189
lost me at the following thing he said
each of these monads has a soul and each

6500
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
each of these monads has a soul and each
 

6501
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,109
each of these monads has a soul and each
of them has a consciousness

6502
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
of them has a consciousness
 

6503
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,629
of them has a consciousness
and it's like okay i'm out of here i

6504
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
and it's like okay i'm out of here i
 

6505
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,310
and it's like okay i'm out of here i
don't understand this at all i don't

6506
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:12,320
don't understand this at all i don't
 

6507
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,510
don't understand this at all i don't
know what's going on but i realized

6508
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
know what's going on but i realized
 

6509
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,030
know what's going on but i realized
recently that in his day the concept

6510
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:17,040
recently that in his day the concept
 

6511
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,669
recently that in his day the concept
that a thing could do something could

6512
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
that a thing could do something could
 

6513
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,990
that a thing could do something could
spontaneously do something that was his

6514
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:22,000
spontaneously do something that was his
 

6515
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,830
spontaneously do something that was his
only way of describing that

6516
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:23,840
only way of describing that
 

6517
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,910
only way of describing that
and so what i would now say is well as

6518
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:25,920
and so what i would now say is well as
 

6519
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,189
and so what i would now say is well as
this abstract rule that runs to leibniz

6520
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
this abstract rule that runs to leibniz
 

6521
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,750
this abstract rule that runs to leibniz
that would have been you know in 1690 or

6522
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:31,760
that would have been you know in 1690 or
 

6523
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,510
that would have been you know in 1690 or
whatever that would have been kind of

6524
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:33,520
whatever that would have been kind of
 

6525
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,109
whatever that would have been kind of
well it has a soul it has a

6526
01:52:35,109 --> 01:52:35,119
well it has a soul it has a
 

6527
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,669
well it has a soul it has a
consciousness um and so you know in a

6528
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
consciousness um and so you know in a
 

6529
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:38,950
consciousness um and so you know in a
sense it's it's like one of these

6530
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:38,960
sense it's it's like one of these
 

6531
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,790
sense it's it's like one of these
there's no new idea under the sun so to

6532
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:40,800
there's no new idea under the sun so to
 

6533
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,790
there's no new idea under the sun so to
speak that's you know that's a sort of a

6534
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
speak that's you know that's a sort of a
 

6535
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,470
speak that's you know that's a sort of a
version of of the same kinds of ideas

6536
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,480
version of of the same kinds of ideas
 

6537
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,510
version of of the same kinds of ideas
but couched in terms that are sort of

6538
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,520
but couched in terms that are sort of
 

6539
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,950
but couched in terms that are sort of
bizarrely different from the ones that

6540
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:48,960
bizarrely different from the ones that
 

6541
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,189
bizarrely different from the ones that
we would use today would you be able to

6542
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
we would use today would you be able to
 

6543
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,669
we would use today would you be able to
maybe play devil's advocate on the your

6544
01:52:53,669 --> 01:52:53,679
maybe play devil's advocate on the your
 

6545
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,310
maybe play devil's advocate on the your
conception of consciousness that uh like

6546
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,320
conception of consciousness that uh like
 

6547
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,070
conception of consciousness that uh like
the the two characteristics of it that

6548
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:58,080
the the two characteristics of it that
 

6549
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,990
the the two characteristics of it that
is constrained and there's a

6550
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
is constrained and there's a
 

6551
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,550
is constrained and there's a
single thread of time is it possible the

6552
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:02,560
single thread of time is it possible the
 

6553
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:05,830
single thread of time is it possible the
liveness was onto something that

6554
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
liveness was onto something that
 

6555
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,030
liveness was onto something that
the the basic atom the screw atom of

6556
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:09,040
the the basic atom the screw atom of
 

6557
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,189
the the basic atom the screw atom of
space has a consciousness

6558
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:11,199
space has a consciousness
 

6559
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:13,910
space has a consciousness
is is that uh so these are just words

6560
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:13,920
is is that uh so these are just words
 

6561
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,030
is is that uh so these are just words
right but yeah

6562
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:15,040
right but yeah
 

6563
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,430
right but yeah
what is there is there some sense where

6564
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:17,440
what is there is there some sense where
 

6565
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,070
what is there is there some sense where
consciousness is much more fundamental

6566
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:20,080
consciousness is much more fundamental
 

6567
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,310
consciousness is much more fundamental
than you're making it seem i don't know

6568
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:22,320
than you're making it seem i don't know
 

6569
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,310
than you're making it seem i don't know
i mean that you know i think can you

6570
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,320
i mean that you know i think can you
 

6571
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,990
i mean that you know i think can you
construct a world in which it is much

6572
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:26,000
construct a world in which it is much
 

6573
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,350
construct a world in which it is much
more fundamental

6574
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:27,360
more fundamental
 

6575
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,149
more fundamental
i think that okay so the question would

6576
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:30,159
i think that okay so the question would
 

6577
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:30,870
i think that okay so the question would
be

6578
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
be
 

6579
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,510
be
is there a way to think about kind of uh

6580
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:33,520
is there a way to think about kind of uh
 

6581
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,310
is there a way to think about kind of uh
if we sort of parse the universe down at

6582
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
if we sort of parse the universe down at
 

6583
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,629
if we sort of parse the universe down at
the level of atoms of space or something

6584
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:38,639
the level of atoms of space or something
 

6585
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,950
the level of atoms of space or something
could we say well so that's really a

6586
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:40,960
could we say well so that's really a
 

6587
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,229
could we say well so that's really a
question of a different point of view a

6588
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
question of a different point of view a
 

6589
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:43,750
question of a different point of view a
different place in real space we're

6590
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:43,760
different place in real space we're
 

6591
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,669
different place in real space we're
asking you're asking the question could

6592
01:53:45,669 --> 01:53:45,679
asking you're asking the question could
 

6593
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:48,470
asking you're asking the question could
there be a civilization that exists

6594
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:48,480
there be a civilization that exists
 

6595
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:51,510
there be a civilization that exists
could there be sort of uh conscious

6596
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:51,520
could there be sort of uh conscious
 

6597
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:53,669
could there be sort of uh conscious
entities that exist at the level of

6598
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
entities that exist at the level of
 

6599
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:55,589
entities that exist at the level of
atoms of space and what would that be

6600
01:53:55,589 --> 01:53:55,599
atoms of space and what would that be
 

6601
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,430
atoms of space and what would that be
like and i think that comes back to this

6602
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,440
like and i think that comes back to this
 

6603
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:58,790
like and i think that comes back to this
question of can we you know what's it

6604
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
question of can we you know what's it
 

6605
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,390
question of can we you know what's it
like to be a cellular automaton type

6606
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:00,400
like to be a cellular automaton type
 

6607
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,669
like to be a cellular automaton type
thing um i mean it's it's you know i'm

6608
01:54:03,669 --> 01:54:03,679
thing um i mean it's it's you know i'm
 

6609
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,390
thing um i mean it's it's you know i'm
i'm not yet there i don't know i mean i

6610
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:06,400
i'm not yet there i don't know i mean i
 

6611
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,030
i'm not yet there i don't know i mean i
think that the this is a and i don't

6612
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:09,040
think that the this is a and i don't
 

6613
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,390
think that the this is a and i don't
even know

6614
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:10,400
even know
 

6615
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,030
even know
yet quite how to think about this in the

6616
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,040
yet quite how to think about this in the
 

6617
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,109
yet quite how to think about this in the
sense that i was considering you know

6618
01:54:15,109 --> 01:54:15,119
sense that i was considering you know
 

6619
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:17,030
sense that i was considering you know
i'm i never write fiction but i i

6620
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,040
i'm i never write fiction but i i
 

6621
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,310
i'm i never write fiction but i i
haven't written it since i was like 10

6622
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,320
haven't written it since i was like 10
 

6623
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,390
haven't written it since i was like 10
years old my my fiction i made one

6624
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:20,400
years old my my fiction i made one
 

6625
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,229
years old my my fiction i made one
attempt which i sent to some science

6626
01:54:22,229 --> 01:54:22,239
attempt which i sent to some science
 

6627
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:23,350
attempt which i sent to some science
fiction writer friends of mine and they

6628
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:23,360
fiction writer friends of mine and they
 

6629
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,109
fiction writer friends of mine and they
told me it was terrible so

6630
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,119
told me it was terrible so
 

6631
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,189
told me it was terrible so
but um this is a long time ago no it was

6632
01:54:27,189 --> 01:54:27,199
but um this is a long time ago no it was
 

6633
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,950
but um this is a long time ago no it was
recently recently they said it was

6634
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:28,960
recently recently they said it was
 

6635
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,550
recently recently they said it was
terrible that'd be interesting to see

6636
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
terrible that'd be interesting to see
 

6637
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,189
terrible that'd be interesting to see
you write a short story based on what

6638
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:33,199
you write a short story based on what
 

6639
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,950
you write a short story based on what
sounds like it's already inspiring short

6640
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:34,960
sounds like it's already inspiring short
 

6641
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,750
sounds like it's already inspiring short
stories by or stories yeah right science

6642
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:37,760
stories by or stories yeah right science
 

6643
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,750
stories by or stories yeah right science
fiction writers but but i think the the

6644
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:39,760
fiction writers but but i think the the
 

6645
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,229
fiction writers but but i think the the
interesting thing for me is

6646
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239
interesting thing for me is
 

6647
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,910
interesting thing for me is
you know in the what does it what is it

6648
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
you know in the what does it what is it
 

6649
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,149
you know in the what does it what is it
like to be a whatever yeah how do you

6650
01:54:46,149 --> 01:54:46,159
like to be a whatever yeah how do you
 

6651
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:47,669
like to be a whatever yeah how do you
describe that i mean it's like that's

6652
01:54:47,669 --> 01:54:47,679
describe that i mean it's like that's
 

6653
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:48,870
describe that i mean it's like that's
not a thing that you describe in

6654
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:48,880
not a thing that you describe in
 

6655
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,030
not a thing that you describe in
mathematics that what is it like to be

6656
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:51,040
mathematics that what is it like to be
 

6657
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,109
mathematics that what is it like to be
such and such well see to me

6658
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
such and such well see to me
 

6659
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,109
such and such well see to me
when you say what is it like to be

6660
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:55,119
when you say what is it like to be
 

6661
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,310
when you say what is it like to be
something

6662
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:56,320
something
 

6663
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,709
something
presumes that you're talking about

6664
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
presumes that you're talking about
 

6665
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,109
presumes that you're talking about
a singular entity

6666
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:01,119
a singular entity
 

6667
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:01,830
a singular entity
so

6668
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:01,840
so
 

6669
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,709
so
yeah

6670
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
yeah
 

6671
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:06,229
yeah
like there there's a some kind of

6672
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
like there there's a some kind of
 

6673
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:09,109
like there there's a some kind of
feeling of the the entity

6674
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
feeling of the the entity
 

6675
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,870
feeling of the the entity
the the stuff that's inside of it and

6676
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
the the stuff that's inside of it and
 

6677
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,870
the the stuff that's inside of it and
the stuff that's outside of it

6678
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:12,880
the stuff that's outside of it
 

6679
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:13,990
the stuff that's outside of it
and then

6680
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:14,000
and then
 

6681
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,910
and then
that's when consciousness starts making

6682
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
that's when consciousness starts making
 

6683
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,950
that's when consciousness starts making
sense

6684
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:16,960
sense
 

6685
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:19,109
sense
but but then um

6686
01:55:19,109 --> 01:55:19,119
but but then um
 

6687
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,070
but but then um
it seems like that could be

6688
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
it seems like that could be
 

6689
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:23,830
it seems like that could be
generalizable if you take some subset

6690
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
generalizable if you take some subset
 

6691
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,229
generalizable if you take some subset
of uh a cellular automata you could

6692
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:26,239
of uh a cellular automata you could
 

6693
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:28,149
of uh a cellular automata you could
start talking about what does that

6694
01:55:28,149 --> 01:55:28,159
start talking about what does that
 

6695
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:29,669
start talking about what does that
subset

6696
01:55:29,669 --> 01:55:29,679
subset
 

6697
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,070
subset
maybe a few but then you can i think you

6698
01:55:32,070 --> 01:55:32,080
maybe a few but then you can i think you
 

6699
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,990
maybe a few but then you can i think you
could just take arbitrary

6700
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:34,000
could just take arbitrary
 

6701
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,910
could just take arbitrary
numbers of subsets like

6702
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:35,920
numbers of subsets like
 

6703
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,350
numbers of subsets like
to me uh uh like you and i

6704
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,360
to me uh uh like you and i
 

6705
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,070
to me uh uh like you and i
uh individually are consciousnesses but

6706
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:42,080
uh individually are consciousnesses but
 

6707
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,990
uh individually are consciousnesses but
you could also say the two of us

6708
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000
you could also say the two of us
 

6709
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,750
you could also say the two of us
together is a singular consciousness

6710
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
together is a singular consciousness
 

6711
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,229
together is a singular consciousness
maybe maybe i'm not so sure about that i

6712
01:55:48,229 --> 01:55:48,239
maybe maybe i'm not so sure about that i
 

6713
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:49,669
maybe maybe i'm not so sure about that i
think that the single thread of time

6714
01:55:49,669 --> 01:55:49,679
think that the single thread of time
 

6715
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,669
think that the single thread of time
thing may be pretty important and that

6716
01:55:51,669 --> 01:55:51,679
thing may be pretty important and that
 

6717
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:53,750
thing may be pretty important and that
as soon as you start saying there are

6718
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
as soon as you start saying there are
 

6719
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,910
as soon as you start saying there are
two different threads of time there are

6720
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
two different threads of time there are
 

6721
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,990
two different threads of time there are
two different experiences and then we

6722
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:58,000
two different experiences and then we
 

6723
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,510
two different experiences and then we
have to say how do they relate how are

6724
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
have to say how do they relate how are
 

6725
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,589
have to say how do they relate how are
they sort of entangled with each other i

6726
01:56:01,589 --> 01:56:01,599
they sort of entangled with each other i
 

6727
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:03,350
they sort of entangled with each other i
mean that may be a different story of a

6728
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,360
mean that may be a different story of a
 

6729
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,990
mean that may be a different story of a
thing that isn't much like you know the

6730
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,000
thing that isn't much like you know the
 

6731
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,830
thing that isn't much like you know the
the what do the ants you know what's it

6732
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:07,840
the what do the ants you know what's it
 

6733
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,830
the what do the ants you know what's it
like to be an ant you know where there's

6734
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
like to be an ant you know where there's
 

6735
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,510
like to be an ant you know where there's
a sort of more collective view of the

6736
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:11,520
a sort of more collective view of the
 

6737
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,310
a sort of more collective view of the
world so to speak i don't know i think

6738
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,320
world so to speak i don't know i think
 

6739
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:17,990
world so to speak i don't know i think
that um i mean this is uh uh

6740
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:18,000
that um i mean this is uh uh
 

6741
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,030
that um i mean this is uh uh
you know

6742
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:19,040
you know
 

6743
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,950
you know
i don't really have a good i mean you

6744
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
i don't really have a good i mean you
 

6745
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,750
i don't really have a good i mean you
know my best thought is you know can we

6746
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:23,760
know my best thought is you know can we
 

6747
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,669
know my best thought is you know can we
turn it into a human story it's like the

6748
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
turn it into a human story it's like the
 

6749
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,910
turn it into a human story it's like the
question of you know when we try and

6750
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:27,920
question of you know when we try and
 

6751
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,669
question of you know when we try and
understand physics can we turn that into

6752
01:56:29,669 --> 01:56:29,679
understand physics can we turn that into
 

6753
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:30,870
understand physics can we turn that into
something which is sort of a human

6754
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:30,880
something which is sort of a human
 

6755
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,030
something which is sort of a human
understandable narrative and now what's

6756
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
understandable narrative and now what's
 

6757
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,750
understandable narrative and now what's
it like to be a such and such you know

6758
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:35,760
it like to be a such and such you know
 

6759
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,350
it like to be a such and such you know
maybe the only medium in which we can

6760
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
maybe the only medium in which we can
 

6761
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,830
maybe the only medium in which we can
describe that is something like fiction

6762
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:39,840
describe that is something like fiction
 

6763
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,910
describe that is something like fiction
where it's kind of like you're telling

6764
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:41,920
where it's kind of like you're telling
 

6765
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,310
where it's kind of like you're telling
you know the life story in that in that

6766
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:44,320
you know the life story in that in that
 

6767
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,950
you know the life story in that in that
uh in that setting but i i'm this is

6768
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:46,960
uh in that setting but i i'm this is
 

6769
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,709
uh in that setting but i i'm this is
this is beyond what i've what i've yet

6770
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
this is beyond what i've what i've yet
 

6771
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:50,310
this is beyond what i've what i've yet
understood how to do yeah but it does

6772
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
understood how to do yeah but it does
 

6773
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:53,030
understood how to do yeah but it does
seem so like with human consciousness

6774
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:53,040
seem so like with human consciousness
 

6775
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,229
seem so like with human consciousness
you know we're made up of cells and like

6776
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:56,239
you know we're made up of cells and like
 

6777
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,229
you know we're made up of cells and like
there's a bunch of systems that are

6778
01:56:58,229 --> 01:56:58,239
there's a bunch of systems that are
 

6779
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,750
there's a bunch of systems that are
networked

6780
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
networked
 

6781
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,950
networked
that work together that at this at the

6782
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
that work together that at this at the
 

6783
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,550
that work together that at this at the
human level

6784
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:04,560
human level
 

6785
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,229
human level
feel like a singular consciousness when

6786
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
feel like a singular consciousness when
 

6787
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:07,589
feel like a singular consciousness when
you take yes

6788
01:57:07,589 --> 01:57:07,599
you take yes
 

6789
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,910
you take yes
and so maybe like an ant colony is just

6790
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:09,920
and so maybe like an ant colony is just
 

6791
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,430
and so maybe like an ant colony is just
too low level

6792
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:11,440
too low level
 

6793
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,910
too low level
sorry an ant is too low level right

6794
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
sorry an ant is too low level right
 

6795
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,830
sorry an ant is too low level right
maybe you have to look at the ant colony

6796
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:15,840
maybe you have to look at the ant colony
 

6797
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,149
maybe you have to look at the ant colony
yeah i agree like there's some level at

6798
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
yeah i agree like there's some level at
 

6799
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:19,030
yeah i agree like there's some level at
which

6800
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:19,040
which
 

6801
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,629
which
it's a conscious being and then if you

6802
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
it's a conscious being and then if you
 

6803
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,950
it's a conscious being and then if you
go to the planetary scale then maybe

6804
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:22,960
go to the planetary scale then maybe
 

6805
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,709
go to the planetary scale then maybe
that's going too far so there's a nice

6806
01:57:24,709 --> 01:57:24,719
that's going too far so there's a nice
 

6807
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:27,270
that's going too far so there's a nice
sweet spot yeah right consciousness no i

6808
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
sweet spot yeah right consciousness no i
 

6809
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,790
sweet spot yeah right consciousness no i
mean i agree i think i think the

6810
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
mean i agree i think i think the
 

6811
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,189
mean i agree i think i think the
difficulty is that

6812
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
difficulty is that
 

6813
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:31,990
difficulty is that
you know

6814
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,000
you know
 

6815
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,470
you know
okay so in sort of people who talk about

6816
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:34,480
okay so in sort of people who talk about
 

6817
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,470
okay so in sort of people who talk about
consciousness yes one of the one of the

6818
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:36,480
consciousness yes one of the one of the
 

6819
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:37,589
consciousness yes one of the one of the
terrible things i've realized because

6820
01:57:37,589 --> 01:57:37,599
terrible things i've realized because
 

6821
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,109
terrible things i've realized because
i've now interacted with with some of

6822
01:57:39,109 --> 01:57:39,119
i've now interacted with with some of
 

6823
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:41,030
i've now interacted with with some of
this community so to speak some

6824
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,040
this community so to speak some
 

6825
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,430
this community so to speak some
interesting people who do that kind of

6826
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:43,440
interesting people who do that kind of
 

6827
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,589
interesting people who do that kind of
thinking but you know one of the things

6828
01:57:45,589 --> 01:57:45,599
thinking but you know one of the things
 

6829
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:46,950
thinking but you know one of the things
i was saying to one of the leading

6830
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:46,960
i was saying to one of the leading
 

6831
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,870
i was saying to one of the leading
people in that area i was saying you

6832
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:48,880
people in that area i was saying you
 

6833
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,310
people in that area i was saying you
know uh

6834
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
know uh
 

6835
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:53,350
know uh
that um you know it must be kind of

6836
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:53,360
that um you know it must be kind of
 

6837
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,709
that um you know it must be kind of
frustrating because it's kind of like a

6838
01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
frustrating because it's kind of like a
 

6839
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:56,550
frustrating because it's kind of like a
poetry story that is many people are

6840
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,560
poetry story that is many people are
 

6841
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,310
poetry story that is many people are
writing poems but few people are reading

6842
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
writing poems but few people are reading
 

6843
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,149
writing poems but few people are reading
them yes so there are always these

6844
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:00,159
them yes so there are always these
 

6845
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:01,750
them yes so there are always these
different you know everybody has their

6846
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
different you know everybody has their
 

6847
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:04,149
different you know everybody has their
own theory of consciousness and they are

6848
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
own theory of consciousness and they are
 

6849
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:08,149
own theory of consciousness and they are
very non-inter sort of interdiscussible

6850
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:08,159
very non-inter sort of interdiscussible
 

6851
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:10,550
very non-inter sort of interdiscussible
and and by the way i mean you know my

6852
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
and and by the way i mean you know my
 

6853
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,629
and and by the way i mean you know my
own approach to sort of the the question

6854
01:58:12,629 --> 01:58:12,639
own approach to sort of the the question
 

6855
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:14,550
own approach to sort of the the question
of consciousness as far as i'm concerned

6856
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:14,560
of consciousness as far as i'm concerned
 

6857
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,550
of consciousness as far as i'm concerned
i'm an applied consciousness operative

6858
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
i'm an applied consciousness operative
 

6859
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,950
i'm an applied consciousness operative
so to speak because i don't really in a

6860
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
so to speak because i don't really in a
 

6861
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,870
so to speak because i don't really in a
sense the thing i'm trying to get out of

6862
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
sense the thing i'm trying to get out of
 

6863
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,350
sense the thing i'm trying to get out of
it is how does it help me to understand

6864
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,360
it is how does it help me to understand
 

6865
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,589
it is how does it help me to understand
what's a possible theory of physics and

6866
01:58:25,589 --> 01:58:25,599
what's a possible theory of physics and
 

6867
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,470
what's a possible theory of physics and
how does it help me to say how do i go

6868
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:28,480
how does it help me to say how do i go
 

6869
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,870
how does it help me to say how do i go
from this this incoherent collection of

6870
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:30,880
from this this incoherent collection of
 

6871
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,709
from this this incoherent collection of
things happening in the universe

6872
01:58:32,709 --> 01:58:32,719
things happening in the universe
 

6873
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,950
things happening in the universe
to our definite perception and definite

6874
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:34,960
to our definite perception and definite
 

6875
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,189
to our definite perception and definite
laws and so on and sort of an applied

6876
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
laws and so on and sort of an applied
 

6877
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,109
laws and so on and sort of an applied
version of consciousness and and i think

6878
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:39,119
version of consciousness and and i think
 

6879
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:40,950
version of consciousness and and i think
the reason it sort of segues to a

6880
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:40,960
the reason it sort of segues to a
 

6881
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,470
the reason it sort of segues to a
different kind of topic but the reason

6882
01:58:42,470 --> 01:58:42,480
different kind of topic but the reason
 

6883
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,390
different kind of topic but the reason
that um uh one of the things i'm

6884
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,400
that um uh one of the things i'm
 

6885
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,830
that um uh one of the things i'm
particularly interested in is kind of

6886
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
particularly interested in is kind of
 

6887
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,149
particularly interested in is kind of
what's the analog of consciousness and

6888
01:58:48,149 --> 01:58:48,159
what's the analog of consciousness and
 

6889
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:50,470
what's the analog of consciousness and
systems very different from brains

6890
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480
systems very different from brains
 

6891
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,550
systems very different from brains
and so why does that matter

6892
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
and so why does that matter
 

6893
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,790
and so why does that matter
well you know this whole description of

6894
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:54,800
well you know this whole description of
 

6895
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,470
well you know this whole description of
this kind of uh

6896
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:56,480
this kind of uh
 

6897
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,070
this kind of uh
well i should you know what we haven't

6898
01:58:58,070 --> 01:58:58,080
well i should you know what we haven't
 

6899
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,510
well i should you know what we haven't
talked about why the universe exists so

6900
01:58:59,510 --> 01:58:59,520
talked about why the universe exists so
 

6901
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,950
talked about why the universe exists so
let's let's get to why the universe

6902
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
let's let's get to why the universe
 

6903
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,430
let's let's get to why the universe
exists and then we then we can can talk

6904
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,440
exists and then we then we can can talk
 

6905
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,830
exists and then we then we can can talk
about perhaps a little bit about what

6906
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:05,840
about perhaps a little bit about what
 

6907
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,950
about perhaps a little bit about what
these models of physics kind of show you

6908
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
these models of physics kind of show you
 

6909
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,390
these models of physics kind of show you
about other kinds of things like

6910
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:10,400
about other kinds of things like
 

6911
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,390
about other kinds of things like
molecular computing and so on yes but

6912
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:12,400
molecular computing and so on yes but
 

6913
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,589
molecular computing and so on yes but
that's okay that's good why does the

6914
01:59:13,589 --> 01:59:13,599
that's okay that's good why does the
 

6915
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,910
that's okay that's good why does the
universe exist okay so we finally sort

6916
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:15,920
universe exist okay so we finally sort
 

6917
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,430
universe exist okay so we finally sort
of more or less set the stage we've got

6918
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:17,440
of more or less set the stage we've got
 

6919
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,310
of more or less set the stage we've got
this idea of this ruliad of this object

6920
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:20,320
this idea of this ruliad of this object
 

6921
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,070
this idea of this ruliad of this object
that is made from following all possible

6922
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,080
that is made from following all possible
 

6923
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,950
that is made from following all possible
rules the fact that it's sort of not

just this incoherent mess it's got all
 

6927
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,430
just this incoherent mess it's got all
this entangled structure in it and so on

01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:29,440
this entangled structure in it and so on
 

6929
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:34,070
this entangled structure in it and so on
okay so what is this ruliad well it is

6930
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,080
okay so what is this ruliad well it is
 

6931
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,470
okay so what is this ruliad well it is
the working out of all possible formal

the working out of all possible formal
systems so the the sort of the question

6934
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:39,199
systems so the the sort of the question
 

6935
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,589
systems so the the sort of the question
of why does the universe exist its core

01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
of why does the universe exist its core

6947
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,030

imagine such a box you can't necessarily
build one in the physical universe but

7032
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:24,880
build one in the physical universe but
 

7033
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,109
build one in the physical universe but
you can imagine such a box and so we

7034
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
you can imagine such a box and so we

02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,910
you can imagine such a box and so we

7053
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,750
sort of super rouliad that contains
those oracle black boxes but it has a

02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,320
can have an event horizon where there's
 

7073
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,709
can have an event horizon where there's
where the causal graph is disconnected

7074
02:02:14,709 --> 02:02:14,719
where the causal graph is disconnected
 

7075
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:17,270
where the causal graph is disconnected
where the effect here an event happening

7076
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,280
where the effect here an event happening
 

7077
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,189
where the effect here an event happening
here does not affect an event happening

7078
02:02:19,189 --> 02:02:19,199
here does not affect an event happening
 

7079
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:20,870
here does not affect an event happening
here because there's a disconnection in

7080
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:20,880
here because there's a disconnection in
 

7081
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,629
here because there's a disconnection in
the causal graph and that's what happens

7082
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
the causal graph and that's what happens
 

7083
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:25,669
the causal graph and that's what happens
at an event horizon and so the what will

7084
02:02:25,669 --> 02:02:25,679
at an event horizon and so the what will
 

7085
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:27,669
at an event horizon and so the what will
happen between this kind of the ordinary

7086
02:02:27,669 --> 02:02:27,679
happen between this kind of the ordinary
 

7087
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:30,790
happen between this kind of the ordinary
ruliad and the hyper ruliad is there is

7088
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
ruliad and the hyper ruliad is there is
 

7089
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,790
ruliad and the hyper ruliad is there is
an event horizon and you you know we in

7090
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
an event horizon and you you know we in
 

7091
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,750
an event horizon and you you know we in
our rouliad will just never know

7092
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:37,760
our rouliad will just never know
 

7093
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,790
our rouliad will just never know
that there is that they're just separate

7094
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
that there is that they're just separate
 

7095
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,030
that there is that they're just separate
things they're not they're not connected

7096
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,040
things they're not they're not connected
 

7097
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,870
things they're not they're not connected
maybe i'm not understanding but just

7098
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
maybe i'm not understanding but just
 

7099
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,350
maybe i'm not understanding but just
because we can't observe it

7100
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:47,360
because we can't observe it
 

7101
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,310
because we can't observe it
uh why does that mean it doesn't exist

7102
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:50,320
uh why does that mean it doesn't exist
 

7103
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,589
uh why does that mean it doesn't exist
um

7104
02:02:51,589 --> 02:02:51,599
um
 

7105
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,030
um
it might exist but it does it's not

7106
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,040
it might exist but it does it's not
 

7107
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,589
it might exist but it does it's not
clear what it it's so what so to speak

7108
02:02:55,589 --> 02:02:55,599
clear what it it's so what so to speak
 

7109
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:57,189
clear what it it's so what so to speak
whether it exists i mean you know what

7110
02:02:57,189 --> 02:02:57,199
whether it exists i mean you know what
 

7111
02:02:57,199 --> 02:02:58,790
whether it exists i mean you know what
we're trying to understand is why does

7112
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
we're trying to understand is why does
 

7113
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,629
we're trying to understand is why does
our universe exist

7114
02:03:00,629 --> 02:03:00,639
our universe exist
 

7115
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:02,550
our universe exist
we're not trying to ask the question

7116
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,560
we're not trying to ask the question
 

7117
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:05,109
we're not trying to ask the question
what uh you know it's

7118
02:03:05,109 --> 02:03:05,119
what uh you know it's
 

7119
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:07,350
what uh you know it's
let me say another thing let me make a

7120
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:07,360
let me say another thing let me make a
 

7121
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,149
let me say another thing let me make a
meta comment okay which is that that i

7122
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:10,159
meta comment okay which is that that i
 

7123
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:11,669
meta comment okay which is that that i
have not thought through this hyper

7124
02:03:11,669 --> 02:03:11,679
have not thought through this hyper
 

7125
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,990
have not thought through this hyper
really ad business properly so i'm i'm i

7126
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:14,000
really ad business properly so i'm i'm i
 

7127
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,350
really ad business properly so i'm i'm i
can't the the the the the the hyper

7128
02:03:17,350 --> 02:03:17,360
can't the the the the the the hyper
 

7129
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,830
can't the the the the the the hyper
ruliad is referring to

7130
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:19,840
ruliad is referring to
 

7131
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,070
ruliad is referring to
a ruliad in which hyper computation is

7132
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
a ruliad in which hyper computation is
 

7133
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:24,870
a ruliad in which hyper computation is
possible that's correct okay so like

7134
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
possible that's correct okay so like
 

7135
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,030
possible that's correct okay so like
what the that footnote

7136
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:27,040
what the that footnote
 

7137
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:29,189
what the that footnote
the footnote to the footnote

7138
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
the footnote to the footnote
 

7139
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:30,550
the footnote to the footnote
is we're not

7140
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:30,560
is we're not
 

7141
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,070
is we're not
sure why

7142
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:32,080
sure why
 

7143
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,390
sure why
this is important yeah that's right so

7144
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:34,400
this is important yeah that's right so
 

7145
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,790
this is important yeah that's right so
let's let's ignore that okay it's

7146
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:36,800
let's let's ignore that okay it's
 

7147
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,229
let's let's ignore that okay it's
already abstract enough okay so so okay

7148
02:03:40,229 --> 02:03:40,239
already abstract enough okay so so okay
 

7149
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:43,030
already abstract enough okay so so okay
so the the one question is

7150
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,040
so the the one question is
 

7151
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,430
so the the one question is
we have to say if we're saying why does

7152
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,440
we have to say if we're saying why does
 

7153
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,669
we have to say if we're saying why does
the universe exist one question is why

7154
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
the universe exist one question is why
 

7155
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,270
the universe exist one question is why
is it this universe and not another

7156
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
is it this universe and not another
 

7157
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,950
is it this universe and not another
universe yeah okay

7158
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:50,960
universe yeah okay
 

7159
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,870
universe yeah okay
so the the important point about this

7160
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:52,880
so the the important point about this
 

7161
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,189
so the the important point about this
ruliad idea is that

7162
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
ruliad idea is that
 

7163
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:57,669
ruliad idea is that
it's in the rouliad are all possible

7164
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
it's in the rouliad are all possible
 

7165
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,149
it's in the rouliad are all possible
formal systems so there's no choice

7166
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:00,159
formal systems so there's no choice
 

7167
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:02,709
formal systems so there's no choice
being made there's no there's no like oh

7168
02:04:02,709 --> 02:04:02,719
being made there's no there's no like oh
 

7169
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:04,229
being made there's no there's no like oh
we picked this particular universe and

7170
02:04:04,229 --> 02:04:04,239
we picked this particular universe and
 

7171
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,310
we picked this particular universe and
not that one that's the first thing the

7172
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:06,320
not that one that's the first thing the
 

7173
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:09,350
not that one that's the first thing the
second thing is the that we have to ask

7174
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,360
second thing is the that we have to ask
 

7175
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:12,390
second thing is the that we have to ask
the question so so you say why does 2

7176
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,400
the question so so you say why does 2
 

7177
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,030
the question so so you say why does 2
plus 2 equals 4 exist

7178
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
plus 2 equals 4 exist
 

7179
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:17,350
plus 2 equals 4 exist
that's not really a that is a thing that

7180
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:17,360
that's not really a that is a thing that
 

7181
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,750
that's not really a that is a thing that
necessarily is that way

7182
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:19,760
necessarily is that way
 

7183
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,430
necessarily is that way
just on the basis of the meaning of the

7184
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
just on the basis of the meaning of the
 

7185
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:24,310
just on the basis of the meaning of the
terms 2 and plus and equals and so on

7186
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:24,320
terms 2 and plus and equals and so on
 

7187
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,950
terms 2 and plus and equals and so on
right so the thing is that this this

7188
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:26,960
right so the thing is that this this
 

7189
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,990
right so the thing is that this this
ruliad object is in a sense a necessary

7190
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
ruliad object is in a sense a necessary
 

7191
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,470
ruliad object is in a sense a necessary
object it is just the thing that is the

7192
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:32,480
object it is just the thing that is the
 

7193
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,270
object it is just the thing that is the
consequence of working out the

7194
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:35,280
consequence of working out the
 

7195
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,189
consequence of working out the
consequence of the formal definition of

7196
02:04:37,189 --> 02:04:37,199
consequence of the formal definition of
 

7197
02:04:37,199 --> 02:04:39,589
consequence of the formal definition of
things you don't it is not a thing where

7198
02:04:39,589 --> 02:04:39,599
things you don't it is not a thing where
 

7199
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:42,390
things you don't it is not a thing where
you're saying and this is picked as the

7200
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,400
you're saying and this is picked as the
 

7201
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,470
you're saying and this is picked as the
particular thing this is just something

7202
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:44,480
particular thing this is just something
 

7203
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:46,390
particular thing this is just something
which necessarily

7204
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:46,400
which necessarily
 

7205
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:47,109
which necessarily
is

7206
02:04:47,109 --> 02:04:47,119
is
 

7207
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:49,270
is
that thing because of the definition of

7208
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:49,280
that thing because of the definition of
 

7209
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,109
that thing because of the definition of
what it means to have computations is

7210
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
what it means to have computations is
 

7211
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:54,470
what it means to have computations is
there really a it's a formal system

7212
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
there really a it's a formal system
 

7213
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,870
there really a it's a formal system
yes

7214
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880

 

7215
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,709

but does it exist

7216
02:04:58,709 --> 02:04:58,719
but does it exist
 

7217
02:04:58,719 --> 02:04:59,589
but does it exist
ah

7218
02:04:59,589 --> 02:04:59,599
ah
 

7219
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:00,790
ah
well

7220
02:05:00,790 --> 02:05:00,800
well
 

7221
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,589
well
uh where are we in this whole thing

7222
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
uh where are we in this whole thing
 

7223
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:07,669
uh where are we in this whole thing
we are part of this ruliad and so our so

7224
02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:07,679
we are part of this ruliad and so our so
 

7225
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,550
we are part of this ruliad and so our so
there is no sense to say does two plus

7226
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:10,560
there is no sense to say does two plus
 

7227
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:13,189
there is no sense to say does two plus

7228
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
two equals four exist
 

7229
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:16,629
two equals four exist
well that's that's in some sense it

7230
02:05:16,629 --> 02:05:16,639
well that's that's in some sense it
 

7231
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:19,030
well that's that's in some sense it
necessarily exists it's a necessary

7232
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:19,040
necessarily exists it's a necessary

object it's not a thing that where you
 

7235
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:21,990
object it's not a thing that where you
can ask

02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:22,000
can ask
 

7237
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,910
can ask
uh you know it's it's usually in in

02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:23,920
uh you know it's it's usually in in
 

7239
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,669
uh you know it's it's usually in in
philosophy there's a sort of distinction

7240
02:05:25,669 --> 02:05:25,679
philosophy there's a sort of distinction
 

7241
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:28,149
philosophy there's a sort of distinction
made between uh you know necessary

there are a variety of different

7248
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
there are a variety of different
 

7249
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:34,950
there are a variety of different
versions of this they're things which

7250
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
versions of this they're things which
 

7251
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,990
versions of this they're things which
are necessarily true just based on the

7252
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,000
are necessarily true just based on the
 

7253
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,149
are necessarily true just based on the
definition of terms and there are things

7254
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
definition of terms and there are things
 

7255
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:42,870
definition of terms and there are things
which happen to be true in our universe

7256
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:42,880
which happen to be true in our universe
 

7257
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:43,990
which happen to be true in our universe
but

7258
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:44,000
but
 

7259
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,709
but
we're we don't exist in rural space we

7260
02:05:46,709 --> 02:05:46,719
we're we don't exist in rural space we
 

7261
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:48,310
we're we don't exist in rural space we
that's one of the coordinates that

7262
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:48,320
that's one of the coordinates that
 

7263
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,470
that's one of the coordinates that
define our existence

7264
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:50,480
define our existence
 

7265
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,270
define our existence
right

7266
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:51,280
right
 

7267
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:54,950
right
well okay so so yes yes but this ruliad

7268
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:54,960
well okay so so yes yes but this ruliad
 

7269
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,270
well okay so so yes yes but this ruliad
is the set of all possible rule

7270
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,280
is the set of all possible rule
 

7271
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,910
is the set of all possible rule
coordinates so what we're saying is it

7272
02:05:59,910 --> 02:05:59,920
coordinates so what we're saying is it
 

7273
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,790
coordinates so what we're saying is it
contains that so what we're saying is we

7274
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:02,800
contains that so what we're saying is we
 

7275
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:03,830
contains that so what we're saying is we
exist

7276
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
exist
 

7277
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,069
exist
as okay so our perception of what's

7278
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:06,079
as okay so our perception of what's
 

7279
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:08,149
as okay so our perception of what's
going on is we're at a particular place

7280
02:06:08,149 --> 02:06:08,159
going on is we're at a particular place
 

7281
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:10,470
going on is we're at a particular place
in this ruling ad and we are concluding

7282
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,480
in this ruling ad and we are concluding
 

7283
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:11,910
in this ruling ad and we are concluding
certain things about how the universe

7284
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
certain things about how the universe
 

7285
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,589
certain things about how the universe
works based on that

7286
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
works based on that
 

7287
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,950
works based on that
but the question is do we understand you

7288
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:16,960
but the question is do we understand you
 

7289
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,750
but the question is do we understand you
know

7290
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760
know
 

7291
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,550
know
is there something where we say

7292
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:20,560
is there something where we say
 

7293
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,430
is there something where we say
so so why does it work that way

7294
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:23,440
so so why does it work that way
 

7295
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:26,149
so so why does it work that way
well the answer is i think it has to

7296
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:26,159
well the answer is i think it has to
 

7297
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:28,470
well the answer is i think it has to
work that way because

7298
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:28,480
work that way because
 

7299
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:29,270
work that way because
this

7300
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,280
this
 

7301
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,910
this
there isn't this ruliad is a necessary

7302
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:31,920
there isn't this ruliad is a necessary
 

7303
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,229
there isn't this ruliad is a necessary
object in the sense that it is a purely

7304
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:34,239
object in the sense that it is a purely
 

7305
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:36,390
object in the sense that it is a purely
formal object just like two plus two

7306
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:36,400
formal object just like two plus two
 

7307
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:39,750
formal object just like two plus two
equals four it's not an object that was

7308
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
equals four it's not an object that was
 

7309
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,830
equals four it's not an object that was
made of something it's an object that is

7310
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:41,840
made of something it's an object that is
 

7311
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:44,470
made of something it's an object that is
just an expression of the necessary

7312
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:44,480
just an expression of the necessary
 

7313
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,069
just an expression of the necessary
collection of formal relations that

7314
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:46,079
collection of formal relations that
 

7315
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:47,189
collection of formal relations that
exist

7316
02:06:47,189 --> 02:06:47,199
exist
 

7317
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:48,870
exist
and so then the issue is

7318
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:48,880
and so then the issue is
 

7319
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:50,069
and so then the issue is
can we

7320
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:50,079
can we
 

7321
02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:52,390
can we
in our experience of that

7322
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:52,400
in our experience of that
 

7323
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,709
in our experience of that
is it you know can we have tables and

7324
02:06:54,709 --> 02:06:54,719
is it you know can we have tables and
 

7325
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,950
is it you know can we have tables and
chairs so to speak in

7326
02:06:56,950 --> 02:06:56,960
chairs so to speak in
 

7327
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,589
chairs so to speak in
that just by virtue of our experience of

7328
02:06:59,589 --> 02:06:59,599
that just by virtue of our experience of
 

7329
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:01,430
that just by virtue of our experience of
that necessary thing

7330
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:01,440
that necessary thing
 

7331
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,270
that necessary thing
and you know what people have generally

7332
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:03,280
and you know what people have generally
 

7333
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,430
and you know what people have generally
thought and honestly that i don't know

7334
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:05,440
thought and honestly that i don't know
 

7335
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:06,870
thought and honestly that i don't know
of a lot of

7336
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:06,880
of a lot of
 

7337
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,470
of a lot of
discussion of this why does the universe

7338
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:08,480
discussion of this why does the universe
 

7339
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:11,510
discussion of this why does the universe
exist question it's been a very

7340
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:11,520
exist question it's been a very
 

7341
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:13,109
exist question it's been a very
you know i've been surprised actually at

7342
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:13,119
you know i've been surprised actually at
 

7343
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:14,229
you know i've been surprised actually at
how little

7344
02:07:14,229 --> 02:07:14,239
how little
 

7345
02:07:14,239 --> 02:07:15,430
how little
i mean i think it's one of these things

7346
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:15,440
i mean i think it's one of these things
 

7347
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,310
i mean i think it's one of these things
that's really uh kind of far out there

7348
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320
that's really uh kind of far out there
 

7349
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,270
that's really uh kind of far out there
but the thing that that is you know the

7350
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
but the thing that that is you know the
 

7351
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,750
but the thing that that is you know the
surprise here is that

7352
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,760
surprise here is that
 

7353
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,629
surprise here is that
all possible formal rules when you run

7354
02:07:26,629 --> 02:07:26,639
all possible formal rules when you run
 

7355
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:28,470
all possible formal rules when you run
them together and that's the critical

7356
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:28,480
them together and that's the critical
 

7357
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,149
them together and that's the critical
thing when you run them together they

7358
02:07:30,149 --> 02:07:30,159
thing when you run them together they
 

7359
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:32,870
thing when you run them together they
produce this kind of entangled structure

7360
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
produce this kind of entangled structure
 

7361
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,189
produce this kind of entangled structure
that has a definite structure it's not

7362
02:07:35,189 --> 02:07:35,199
that has a definite structure it's not
 

7363
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:35,990
that has a definite structure it's not
just

7364
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,000
just
 

7365
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,149
just
a you know a random arbitrary thing it's

7366
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:38,159
a you know a random arbitrary thing it's
 

7367
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:40,629
a you know a random arbitrary thing it's
a thing with definite structure and that

7368
02:07:40,629 --> 02:07:40,639
a thing with definite structure and that
 

7369
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:43,189
a thing with definite structure and that
structure is the thing when we are

7370
02:07:43,189 --> 02:07:43,199
structure is the thing when we are
 

7371
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:44,950
structure is the thing when we are
embedded in that structure when when

7372
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:44,960
embedded in that structure when when
 

7373
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,510
embedded in that structure when when
anything you know the an entity embedded

7374
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
anything you know the an entity embedded
 

7375
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,149
anything you know the an entity embedded
in that structure perceives something

7376
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
in that structure perceives something
 

7377
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:51,430
in that structure perceives something
which is

7378
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:51,440
which is
 

7379
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,430
which is
then we can interpret as physics and

7380
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:53,440
then we can interpret as physics and
 

7381
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,390
then we can interpret as physics and
things like this

7382
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:54,400
things like this
 

7383
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,910
things like this
so in other words we don't have to ask

7384
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:55,920
so in other words we don't have to ask
 

7385
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,790
so in other words we don't have to ask
the question the the the why does it

7386
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
the question the the the why does it
 

7387
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,669
the question the the the why does it
exist it necessarily exists i'm missing

7388
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
exist it necessarily exists i'm missing
 

7389
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,669
exist it necessarily exists i'm missing
this part why does it necessarily exist

7390
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:03,679
this part why does it necessarily exist
 

7391
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:07,189
this part why does it necessarily exist
okay okay so like you need to have it if

7392
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:07,199
okay okay so like you need to have it if
 

7393
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:10,390
okay okay so like you need to have it if
you want to formalize the relation

7394
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:10,400
you want to formalize the relation
 

7395
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,690
you want to formalize the relation
between entities but why

7396
02:08:12,690 --> 02:08:12,700
between entities but why
 

7397
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,149
between entities but why
[Music]

7398
02:08:14,149 --> 02:08:14,159
[Music]
 

7399
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:16,229
[Music]
why do you need to have relations okay

7400
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:16,239
why do you need to have relations okay
 

7401
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:19,189
why do you need to have relations okay
okay so so let's say

7402
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
okay so so let's say
 

7403
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:22,229
okay so so let's say
you say um

7404
02:08:22,229 --> 02:08:22,239
you say um
 

7405
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:23,189
you say um
well

7406
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:23,199
well
 

7407
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:25,669
well
it's like why does math have to exist

7408
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:25,679
it's like why does math have to exist
 

7409
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,990
it's like why does math have to exist
okay that's the same question yeah okay

7410
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:28,000
okay that's the same question yeah okay
 

7411
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,350
okay that's the same question yeah okay
fair question

7412
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:29,360
fair question
 

7413
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,229
fair question
um

7414
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
um
 

7415
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,229
um
let's see i think the thing to think

7416
02:08:32,229 --> 02:08:32,239
let's see i think the thing to think
 

7417
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:33,589
let's see i think the thing to think
about is

7418
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599
about is
 

7419
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:35,430
about is
the existence of mathematics is

7420
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:35,440
the existence of mathematics is
 

7421
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,870
the existence of mathematics is
something where

7422
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:36,880
something where
 

7423
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:40,069
something where
given a definition of terms

7424
02:08:40,069 --> 02:08:40,079
given a definition of terms
 

7425
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:42,310
given a definition of terms
what follows from that definition

7426
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:42,320
what follows from that definition
 

7427
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,390
what follows from that definition
inevitably follows

7428
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
inevitably follows
 

7429
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,069
inevitably follows
so now you can say

7430
02:08:46,069 --> 02:08:46,079
so now you can say
 

7431
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,390
so now you can say
why define any terms

7432
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
why define any terms
 

7433
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,830
why define any terms
but in a sense the

7434
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:51,840
but in a sense the
 

7435
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:54,069
but in a sense the
well that's okay so the the definition

7436
02:08:54,069 --> 02:08:54,079
well that's okay so the the definition
 

7437
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:55,270
well that's okay so the the definition
of terms

7438
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
of terms
 

7439
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,350
of terms
i mean i think the way to think about

7440
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
i mean i think the way to think about
 

7441
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:00,149
i mean i think the way to think about
this let me see so like

7442
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:00,159
this let me see so like
 

7443
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:04,229
this let me see so like
concrete terms

7444
02:09:04,229 --> 02:09:04,239

 

7445
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:06,550

i mean they're just things like you know

7446
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:06,560
i mean they're just things like you know
 

7447
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:09,030
i mean they're just things like you know
uh

7448
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,040

 

7449
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,390

logical or

7450
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:10,400
logical or
 

7451
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,629
logical or
right that's a thing

7452
02:09:12,629 --> 02:09:12,639
right that's a thing
 

7453
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:14,629
right that's a thing
that's a powerful thing well it's a it's

7454
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:14,639
that's a powerful thing well it's a it's
 

7455
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:16,870
that's a powerful thing well it's a it's
a yes okay but it's it's a

7456
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:16,880
a yes okay but it's it's a
 

7457
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,709
a yes okay but it's it's a
the point is that it is not a thing

7458
02:09:18,709 --> 02:09:18,719
the point is that it is not a thing
 

7459
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:21,109
the point is that it is not a thing
about you know people imagine

7460
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:21,119
about you know people imagine
 

7461
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:22,709
about you know people imagine
there is i don't know

7462
02:09:22,709 --> 02:09:22,719
there is i don't know
 

7463
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:25,189
there is i don't know
the uh uh you know an elephant or

7464
02:09:25,189 --> 02:09:25,199
the uh uh you know an elephant or
 

7465
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:28,390
the uh uh you know an elephant or
something or the you know elephants are

7466
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:28,400
something or the you know elephants are
 

7467
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:31,350
something or the you know elephants are
presumably not necessary objects they

7468
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:31,360
presumably not necessary objects they
 

7469
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:34,149
presumably not necessary objects they
are they happen to exist as a result of

7470
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:34,159
are they happen to exist as a result of
 

7471
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:35,669
are they happen to exist as a result of
kind of biological evolution and

7472
02:09:35,669 --> 02:09:35,679
kind of biological evolution and
 

7473
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:37,030
kind of biological evolution and
whatever else

7474
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:37,040
whatever else
 

7475
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,990
whatever else
but the the thing is that

7476
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:40,000
but the the thing is that
 

7477
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,629
but the the thing is that
in some sense that there is it is a

7478
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:42,639
in some sense that there is it is a
 

7479
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,589
in some sense that there is it is a
different kind of thing to say does plus

7480
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
different kind of thing to say does plus
 

7481
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:46,790
different kind of thing to say does plus
exist

7482
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:46,800
exist
 

7483
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,950
exist
the the it's not it's not not like an

7484
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
the the it's not it's not not like an
 

7485
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,189
the the it's not it's not not like an
elephant so a plus is seems more

7486
02:09:51,189 --> 02:09:51,199
elephant so a plus is seems more
 

7487
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:53,350
elephant so a plus is seems more
fundamental more basic than an elephant

7488
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,360
fundamental more basic than an elephant
 

7489
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,510
fundamental more basic than an elephant
yes but

7490
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:55,520
yes but
 

7491
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,030
yes but
you can imagine

7492
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:57,040
you can imagine
 

7493
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,270
you can imagine
a world without

7494
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
a world without
 

7495
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,750
a world without
plus or anything like it like why do

7496
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:01,760
plus or anything like it like why do
 

7497
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,790
plus or anything like it like why do
formal things that are discreet

7498
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:04,800
formal things that are discreet
 

7499
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,629
formal things that are discreet
that can be used

7500
02:10:06,629 --> 02:10:06,639
that can be used
 

7501
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:09,830
that can be used
to reason have to exist or uh well okay

7502
02:10:09,830 --> 02:10:09,840
to reason have to exist or uh well okay
 

7503
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,790
to reason have to exist or uh well okay
so why okay so that then the question is

7504
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:12,800
so why okay so that then the question is
 

7505
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,589
so why okay so that then the question is
but the whole point is computation we

7506
02:10:15,589 --> 02:10:15,599
but the whole point is computation we
 

7507
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:18,550
but the whole point is computation we
can certainly imagine computation that

7508
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:18,560
can certainly imagine computation that
 

7509
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,709
can certainly imagine computation that
is we can certainly say there is a

7510
02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:20,719
is we can certainly say there is a
 

7511
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,950
is we can certainly say there is a
formal system that we can construct

7512
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:22,960
formal system that we can construct
 

7513
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,270
formal system that we can construct
abstractly in our minds that is

7514
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:25,280
abstractly in our minds that is
 

7515
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:26,709
abstractly in our minds that is
computation

7516
02:10:26,709 --> 02:10:26,719
computation
 

7517
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:27,750
computation
and that

7518
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:27,760
and that
 

7519
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,629
and that
that's the um uh and you know we can we

7520
02:10:30,629 --> 02:10:30,639
that's the um uh and you know we can we
 

7521
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:33,510
that's the um uh and you know we can we
can imagine it right now the question is

7522
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
can imagine it right now the question is
 

7523
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,510
can imagine it right now the question is
um is it is

7524
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:35,520
um is it is
 

7525
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,589
um is it is
that formal system

7526
02:10:37,589 --> 02:10:37,599
that formal system
 

7527
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:40,310
that formal system
once we exist as observers embedded in

7528
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:40,320
once we exist as observers embedded in
 

7529
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,270
once we exist as observers embedded in
that formal system that's enough to have

7530
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:43,280
that formal system that's enough to have
 

7531
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,870
that formal system that's enough to have
something which is like our universe

7532
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:44,880
something which is like our universe
 

7533
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:47,350
something which is like our universe
yeah and so then the then what you're

7534
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,360
yeah and so then the then what you're
 

7535
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,669
yeah and so then the then what you're
kind of asking is perhaps

7536
02:10:49,669 --> 02:10:49,679
kind of asking is perhaps
 

7537
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:50,550
kind of asking is perhaps
is

7538
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:50,560
is
 

7539
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:51,589
is
why

7540
02:10:51,589 --> 02:10:51,599
why
 

7541
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:53,669
why
i mean the point is we definitely can

7542
02:10:53,669 --> 02:10:53,679
i mean the point is we definitely can
 

7543
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,669
i mean the point is we definitely can
imagine it there's nothing that says

7544
02:10:55,669 --> 02:10:55,679
imagine it there's nothing that says
 

7545
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:57,669
imagine it there's nothing that says
that we're not saying

7546
02:10:57,669 --> 02:10:57,679
that we're not saying
 

7547
02:10:57,679 --> 02:10:58,550
that we're not saying
that

7548
02:10:58,550 --> 02:10:58,560
that
 

7549
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:01,589
that
there's it's sort of inevitable that

7550
02:11:01,589 --> 02:11:01,599
there's it's sort of inevitable that
 

7551
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:02,470
there's it's sort of inevitable that
that

7552
02:11:02,470 --> 02:11:02,480
that
 

7553
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:04,390
that
is a thing that we can imagine we don't

7554
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:04,400
is a thing that we can imagine we don't
 

7555
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,470
is a thing that we can imagine we don't
have to ask does it exist

7556
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
have to ask does it exist
 

7557
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,390
have to ask does it exist
we're just it is definitely something we

7558
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:08,400
we're just it is definitely something we
 

7559
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,510
we're just it is definitely something we
can imagine

7560
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:09,520
can imagine
 

7561
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:12,870
can imagine
now that's then we have this thing that

7562
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:12,880
now that's then we have this thing that
 

7563
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:15,830
now that's then we have this thing that
is a formally constructable thing that

7564
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
is a formally constructable thing that
 

7565
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,669
is a formally constructable thing that
we can imagine and now we have to ask

7566
02:11:17,669 --> 02:11:17,679
we can imagine and now we have to ask
 

7567
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:18,870
we can imagine and now we have to ask
the question

7568
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
the question
 

7569
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,109
the question
what you know given that formally

7570
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:21,119
what you know given that formally
 

7571
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:22,870
what you know given that formally
constructable thing

7572
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:22,880
constructable thing
 

7573
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,069
constructable thing
what is uh what consequences does that

7574
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,079
what is uh what consequences does that
 

7575
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:29,030
what is uh what consequences does that
if we were to perceive that formally if

7576
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:29,040
if we were to perceive that formally if
 

7577
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:30,470
if we were to perceive that formally if
we were embedded in that formally

7578
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:30,480
we were embedded in that formally
 

7579
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,390
we were embedded in that formally
constructable thing what would be

7580
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:32,400
constructable thing what would be
 

7581
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,229
constructable thing what would be
perceived about the world and we would

7582
02:11:34,229 --> 02:11:34,239
perceived about the world and we would
 

7583
02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:38,390
perceived about the world and we would
say we perceive that the world exists

7584
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,400
say we perceive that the world exists
 

7585
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,470
say we perceive that the world exists
because we are we are seeing all of this

7586
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:40,480
because we are we are seeing all of this
 

7587
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,470
because we are we are seeing all of this
mechanism of all these things happening

7588
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,480
mechanism of all these things happening
 

7589
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,870
mechanism of all these things happening
and but that's something that is just a

7590
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:44,880
and but that's something that is just a
 

7591
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,270
and but that's something that is just a
feature of it's it's it's something

7592
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:47,280
feature of it's it's it's something
 

7593
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,470
feature of it's it's it's something
where we are

7594
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
where we are
 

7595
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:51,030
where we are
see another way of asking this that i'm

7596
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
see another way of asking this that i'm
 

7597
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,629
see another way of asking this that i'm
trying to get at

7598
02:11:52,629 --> 02:11:52,639
trying to get at
 

7599
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:54,950
trying to get at
i understand why it feels like

7600
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
i understand why it feels like
 

7601
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,310
i understand why it feels like
this uh

7602
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:56,320
this uh
 

7603
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,310
this uh
rooliad is

7604
02:11:58,310 --> 02:11:58,320
rooliad is
 

7605
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:01,030
rooliad is
necessary

7606
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,040
necessary
 

7607
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:03,830
necessary
but maybe it's just me being human but

7608
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
but maybe it's just me being human but
 

7609
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:07,510
but maybe it's just me being human but
it feels like then you should be able to

7610
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:07,520
it feels like then you should be able to
 

7611
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,229
it feels like then you should be able to
not us but somehow step outside of the

7612
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:10,239
not us but somehow step outside of the
 

7613
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:11,510
not us but somehow step outside of the
roulette

7614
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
roulette
 

7615
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,069
roulette
like what's outside the roulette

7616
02:12:14,069 --> 02:12:14,079
like what's outside the roulette
 

7617
02:12:14,079 --> 02:12:15,669
like what's outside the roulette
well the ruling out is all formal

7618
02:12:15,669 --> 02:12:15,679
well the ruling out is all formal
 

7619
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:16,790
well the ruling out is all formal
systems

7620
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
systems
 

7621
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,030
systems
so there's nothing because but that's

7622
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,040
so there's nothing because but that's
 

7623
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,950
so there's nothing because but that's
what a human would say i know that's

7624
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:20,960
what a human would say i know that's
 

7625
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,149
what a human would say i know that's
what a human would say because we're

7626
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:22,159
what a human would say because we're
 

7627
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:24,550
what a human would say because we're
used to the idea that there are there's

7628
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
used to the idea that there are there's
 

7629
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,550
used to the idea that there are there's
but the whole point is that by the time

7630
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:26,560
but the whole point is that by the time
 

7631
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:29,589
but the whole point is that by the time
it's all possible formal systems

7632
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:29,599
it's all possible formal systems
 

7633
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:32,830
it's all possible formal systems
it's it's like it is all things you can

7634
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:32,840
it's it's like it is all things you can
 

7635
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,069
it's it's like it is all things you can
imagine but not all computations you can

7636
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:36,079
imagine but not all computations you can
 

7637
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:37,030
imagine but not all computations you can
imagine

7638
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,040
imagine
 

7639
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,030
imagine
but like we don't

7640
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,040
but like we don't
 

7641
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,709
but like we don't
well so what we don't see that could be

7642
02:12:40,709 --> 02:12:40,719
well so what we don't see that could be
 

7643
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:43,030
well so what we don't see that could be
other code okay so so that's a that's a

7644
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
other code okay so so that's a that's a
 

7645
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,709
other code okay so so that's a that's a
fair question is it possible to encode

7646
02:12:46,709 --> 02:12:46,719
fair question is it possible to encode
 

7647
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:50,310
fair question is it possible to encode
uh all i mean once we is is there

7648
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:50,320
uh all i mean once we is is there
 

7649
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,149
uh all i mean once we is is there
something that isn't what we can

7650
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:52,159
something that isn't what we can
 

7651
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:54,629
something that isn't what we can
represent formally right that is that is

7652
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
represent formally right that is that is
 

7653
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:56,790
represent formally right that is that is
there's something that um and that's i

7654
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:56,800
there's something that um and that's i
 

7655
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,870
there's something that um and that's i
think related to the hyper rouliad

7656
02:12:58,870 --> 02:12:58,880
think related to the hyper rouliad
 

7657
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,990
think related to the hyper rouliad
footnote so to speak

7658
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000

 

7659
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,030

you know one of the things sort of

7660
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,040
you know one of the things sort of
 

7661
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,950
you know one of the things sort of
interesting about this is

7662
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:06,960
interesting about this is
 

7663
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,790
interesting about this is
you know there has been some discussion

7664
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
you know there has been some discussion
 

7665
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,950
you know there has been some discussion
of this in theology and things like that

7666
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:10,960
of this in theology and things like that
 

7667
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,510
of this in theology and things like that
um but uh which i don't necessarily

7668
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:13,520
um but uh which i don't necessarily
 

7669
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:17,750
um but uh which i don't necessarily
understand all of um but the the key

7670
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:17,760
understand all of um but the the key
 

7671
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:21,669
understand all of um but the the key
sort of new input is this idea that all

7672
02:13:21,669 --> 02:13:21,679
sort of new input is this idea that all
 

7673
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:23,830
sort of new input is this idea that all
possible formal systems it's like you

7674
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:23,840
possible formal systems it's like you
 

7675
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,470
possible formal systems it's like you
know if you make a world people say well

7676
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
know if you make a world people say well
 

7677
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:29,270
know if you make a world people say well
you make a world with a particular in a

7678
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:29,280
you make a world with a particular in a
 

7679
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,109
you make a world with a particular in a
particular way with particular rules but

7680
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
particular way with particular rules but
 

7681
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,030
particular way with particular rules but
no you don't do that you can make a

7682
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:33,040
no you don't do that you can make a
 

7683
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,750
no you don't do that you can make a
world that deals with all possible rules

7684
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
world that deals with all possible rules
 

7685
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:39,589
world that deals with all possible rules
and then merely by virtue of living in a

7686
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
and then merely by virtue of living in a
 

7687
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:41,750
and then merely by virtue of living in a
particular place in that world so to

7688
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:41,760
particular place in that world so to
 

7689
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,990
particular place in that world so to
speak we have the perception we have of

7690
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:44,000
speak we have the perception we have of
 

7691
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,510
speak we have the perception we have of
what the world is like

7692
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,520
what the world is like
 

7693
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,629
what the world is like
now i have to say the the um uh it's

7694
02:13:48,629 --> 02:13:48,639
now i have to say the the um uh it's
 

7695
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:50,310
now i have to say the the um uh it's
sort of interesting because i i've you

7696
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
sort of interesting because i i've you
 

7697
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:52,069
sort of interesting because i i've you
know i wrote this piece about this and i

7698
02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079
know i wrote this piece about this and i
 

7699
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:54,870
know i wrote this piece about this and i
i you know this philosophy stuff is not

7700
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:54,880
i you know this philosophy stuff is not
 

7701
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:57,270
i you know this philosophy stuff is not
super easy and i i've

7702
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:57,280
super easy and i i've
 

7703
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:59,510
super easy and i i've
um i as i'm as i'm talking to you about

7704
02:13:59,510 --> 02:13:59,520
um i as i'm as i'm talking to you about
 

7705
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,189
um i as i'm as i'm talking to you about
it and i actually haven't you know

7706
02:14:01,189 --> 02:14:01,199
it and i actually haven't you know
 

7707
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:02,310
it and i actually haven't you know
people have been interested in lots of

7708
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:02,320
people have been interested in lots of
 

7709
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,350
people have been interested in lots of
different things we've been doing but

7710
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:03,360
different things we've been doing but
 

7711
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,430
different things we've been doing but
this why does the universe exist has

7712
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,440
this why does the universe exist has
 

7713
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,669
this why does the universe exist has
been i would say one of the one of the

7714
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679
been i would say one of the one of the
 

7715
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:09,589
been i would say one of the one of the
ones that you would think people will be

7716
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:09,599
ones that you would think people will be
 

7717
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:12,310
ones that you would think people will be
most interested in but actually i think

7718
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,320
most interested in but actually i think
 

7719
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,310
most interested in but actually i think
they're just like oh that's just

7720
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:14,320
they're just like oh that's just
 

7721
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:17,030
they're just like oh that's just
something complicated that that um so so

7722
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
something complicated that that um so so
 

7723
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,510
something complicated that that um so so
i haven't i haven't explained it as as

7724
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:19,520
i haven't i haven't explained it as as
 

7725
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,870
i haven't i haven't explained it as as
much as i've explained a bunch of other

7726
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:20,880
much as i've explained a bunch of other
 

7727
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,550
much as i've explained a bunch of other
things and i have to say i think i i

7728
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,560
things and i have to say i think i i
 

7729
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,069
things and i have to say i think i i
think i may be missing a couple of

7730
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:24,079
think i may be missing a couple of
 

7731
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:27,350
think i may be missing a couple of
pieces of that argument that um uh would

7732
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,360
pieces of that argument that um uh would
 

7733
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:30,310
pieces of that argument that um uh would
be so so it's kind of a like well your

7734
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
be so so it's kind of a like well your
 

7735
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,310
be so so it's kind of a like well your
your uh conscious being is

7736
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:32,320
your uh conscious being is
 

7737
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:34,149
your uh conscious being is
computationally bounded so you're

7738
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:34,159
computationally bounded so you're
 

7739
02:14:34,159 --> 02:14:36,790
computationally bounded so you're
missing having written quite a few

7740
02:14:36,790 --> 02:14:36,800
missing having written quite a few
 

7741
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,270
missing having written quite a few
articles yourself you you're now missing

7742
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,280
articles yourself you you're now missing
 

7743
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,830
articles yourself you you're now missing
some of the pieces yes

7744
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:41,840
some of the pieces yes
 

7745
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:43,430
some of the pieces yes
being human right

7746
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
being human right
 

7747
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,109
being human right
one of the consequences of this why the

7748
02:14:45,109 --> 02:14:45,119
one of the consequences of this why the
 

7749
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:47,270
one of the consequences of this why the
unit why the universe exists thing and

7750
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
unit why the universe exists thing and
 

7751
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,109
unit why the universe exists thing and
this kind of concept of

7752
02:14:49,109 --> 02:14:49,119
this kind of concept of
 

7753
02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:52,229
this kind of concept of
ruling ads and and uh you know places in

7754
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:52,239
ruling ads and and uh you know places in
 

7755
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:54,069
ruling ads and and uh you know places in
there representing our perception of the

7756
02:14:54,069 --> 02:14:54,079
there representing our perception of the
 

7757
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:56,069
there representing our perception of the
universe and so on one of the weird

7758
02:14:56,069 --> 02:14:56,079
universe and so on one of the weird
 

7759
02:14:56,079 --> 02:14:57,669
universe and so on one of the weird
consequences is

7760
02:14:57,669 --> 02:14:57,679
consequences is
 

7761
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:00,229
consequences is
if the universe exists mathematics must

7762
02:15:00,229 --> 02:15:00,239
if the universe exists mathematics must
 

7763
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:02,229
if the universe exists mathematics must
also exist

7764
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:02,239
also exist
 

7765
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:03,910
also exist
and that's a weird thing because

7766
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:03,920
and that's a weird thing because
 

7767
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:05,830
and that's a weird thing because
mathematics people have been very

7768
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:05,840
mathematics people have been very
 

7769
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,830
mathematics people have been very
confused including me have been very

7770
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:07,840
confused including me have been very
 

7771
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:10,310
confused including me have been very
confused about

7772
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
confused about
 

7773
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:13,109
confused about
the the question of of kind of what

7774
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:13,119
the the question of of kind of what
 

7775
02:15:13,119 --> 02:15:15,430
the the question of of kind of what
uh what is the foundation of mathematics

7776
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:15,440
uh what is the foundation of mathematics
 

7777
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:16,950
uh what is the foundation of mathematics
what is what kind of a thing is

7778
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:16,960
what is what kind of a thing is
 

7779
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,870
what is what kind of a thing is
mathematics is mathematics

7780
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
mathematics is mathematics
 

7781
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:20,790
mathematics is mathematics
something where we just write down

7782
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800
something where we just write down
 

7783
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,189
something where we just write down
axioms like euclid did for geometry and

7784
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:23,199
axioms like euclid did for geometry and
 

7785
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:25,189
axioms like euclid did for geometry and
we just build the structure and we could

7786
02:15:25,189 --> 02:15:25,199
we just build the structure and we could
 

7787
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:26,470
we just build the structure and we could
have written down different axioms and

7788
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
have written down different axioms and
 

7789
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,550
have written down different axioms and
we'd have a different structure or is it

7790
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:28,560
we'd have a different structure or is it
 

7791
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:30,550
we'd have a different structure or is it
something that has a more fundamental

7792
02:15:30,550 --> 02:15:30,560
something that has a more fundamental
 

7793
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,470
something that has a more fundamental
sort of truth to it and i have to say

7794
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:32,480
sort of truth to it and i have to say
 

7795
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,950
sort of truth to it and i have to say
it's one of these cases where i've i've

7796
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:34,960
it's one of these cases where i've i've
 

7797
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,550
it's one of these cases where i've i've
long believed that mathematics has a

7798
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:36,560
long believed that mathematics has a
 

7799
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,069
long believed that mathematics has a
great deal of arbitrariness to it that

7800
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:38,079
great deal of arbitrariness to it that
 

7801
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:40,149
great deal of arbitrariness to it that
there are particular axioms that kind of

7802
02:15:40,149 --> 02:15:40,159
there are particular axioms that kind of
 

7803
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,629
there are particular axioms that kind of
got written down by the babylonians and

7804
02:15:42,629 --> 02:15:42,639
got written down by the babylonians and
 

7805
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:44,149
got written down by the babylonians and
uh you know that's what we've ended up

7806
02:15:44,149 --> 02:15:44,159
uh you know that's what we've ended up
 

7807
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:46,069
uh you know that's what we've ended up
with the mathematics that we have and i

7808
02:15:46,069 --> 02:15:46,079
with the mathematics that we have and i
 

7809
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:47,990
with the mathematics that we have and i
have to say actually my my wife has been

7810
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:48,000
have to say actually my my wife has been
 

7811
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,430
have to say actually my my wife has been
telling me for 25 years she's a

7812
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,440
telling me for 25 years she's a
 

7813
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,189
telling me for 25 years she's a
mathematician she's been telling me

7814
02:15:51,189 --> 02:15:51,199
mathematician she's been telling me
 

7815
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:52,709
mathematician she's been telling me
you're wrong about the foundations of

7816
02:15:52,709 --> 02:15:52,719
you're wrong about the foundations of
 

7817
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:55,750
you're wrong about the foundations of
mathematics and and you know i'm like no

7818
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:55,760
mathematics and and you know i'm like no
 

7819
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:58,069
mathematics and and you know i'm like no
no no i know what i'm talking about and

7820
02:15:58,069 --> 02:15:58,079
no no i know what i'm talking about and
 

7821
02:15:58,079 --> 02:15:59,109
no no i know what i'm talking about and
finally

7822
02:15:59,109 --> 02:15:59,119
finally
 

7823
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:01,510
finally
she's she's much more right than i've

7824
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:01,520
she's she's much more right than i've
 

7825
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:04,390
she's she's much more right than i've
been so it's um it's wonderful so i mean

7826
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
been so it's um it's wonderful so i mean
 

7827
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,310
been so it's um it's wonderful so i mean
uh her sense

7828
02:16:06,310 --> 02:16:06,320
uh her sense
 

7829
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:09,030
uh her sense
in your sense are we just uh so this is

7830
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,040
in your sense are we just uh so this is
 

7831
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,109
in your sense are we just uh so this is
to the question of uh meta mathematics

7832
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:11,119
to the question of uh meta mathematics
 

7833
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:12,229
to the question of uh meta mathematics
so we're just

7834
02:16:12,229 --> 02:16:12,239
so we're just
 

7835
02:16:12,239 --> 02:16:14,950
so we're just
kind of on the trajectory through

7836
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:14,960
kind of on the trajectory through
 

7837
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:17,109
kind of on the trajectory through
rule space except in mathematics through

7838
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:17,119
rule space except in mathematics through
 

7839
02:16:17,119 --> 02:16:19,669
rule space except in mathematics through
a trajectory a certain kind of

7840
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
a trajectory a certain kind of
 

7841
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:21,430
a trajectory a certain kind of
thing that's partly the idea so so i

7842
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:21,440
thing that's partly the idea so so i
 

7843
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,669
thing that's partly the idea so so i
think that the notion is this so 100

7844
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679
think that the notion is this so 100
 

7845
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:25,270
think that the notion is this so 100
years ago a little bit more than 100

7846
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
years ago a little bit more than 100
 

7847
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,950
years ago a little bit more than 100
years ago but people have been doing

7848
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:26,960
years ago but people have been doing
 

7849
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,950
years ago but people have been doing
mathematics for ages but then in the in

7850
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:28,960
mathematics for ages but then in the in
 

7851
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:31,189
mathematics for ages but then in the in
the late 1800s people decided to try and

7852
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
the late 1800s people decided to try and
 

7853
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:34,389
the late 1800s people decided to try and
formalize mathematics and say you know

7854
02:16:34,389 --> 02:16:34,399
formalize mathematics and say you know
 

7855
02:16:34,399 --> 02:16:36,389
formalize mathematics and say you know
it is mathematics is you know we're

7856
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:36,399
it is mathematics is you know we're
 

7857
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:37,509
it is mathematics is you know we're
going to break it down we're going to

7858
02:16:37,509 --> 02:16:37,519
going to break it down we're going to
 

7859
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:38,950
going to break it down we're going to
make it like logic we're going to make

7860
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:38,960
make it like logic we're going to make
 

7861
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,030
make it like logic we're going to make
it out of out of sort of fundamental

7862
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
it out of out of sort of fundamental
 

7863
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,709
it out of out of sort of fundamental
primitives and that was people like

7864
02:16:42,709 --> 02:16:42,719
primitives and that was people like
 

7865
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:44,870
primitives and that was people like
fraga and piano and hilbert and so on

7866
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:44,880
fraga and piano and hilbert and so on
 

7867
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:48,070
fraga and piano and hilbert and so on
and they kind of got this idea of let's

7868
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:48,080
and they kind of got this idea of let's
 

7869
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,389
and they kind of got this idea of let's
do kind of euclid but even better let's

7870
02:16:50,389 --> 02:16:50,399
do kind of euclid but even better let's
 

7871
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:52,070
do kind of euclid but even better let's
just make everything just in terms of

7872
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,080
just make everything just in terms of
 

7873
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:54,230
just make everything just in terms of
this sort of symbolic axioms and then

7874
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:54,240
this sort of symbolic axioms and then
 

7875
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,230
this sort of symbolic axioms and then
build up mathematics from that

7876
02:16:56,230 --> 02:16:56,240
build up mathematics from that
 

7877
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:58,549
build up mathematics from that
and that you know they thought at the

7878
02:16:58,549 --> 02:16:58,559
and that you know they thought at the
 

7879
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:00,950
and that you know they thought at the
time as soon as they get

7880
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:00,960
time as soon as they get
 

7881
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,950
time as soon as they get
these symbolic axioms that they made the

7882
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:02,960
these symbolic axioms that they made the
 

7883
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:04,549
these symbolic axioms that they made the
same mistake the kind of computational

7884
02:17:04,549 --> 02:17:04,559
same mistake the kind of computational
 

7885
02:17:04,559 --> 02:17:07,190
same mistake the kind of computational
irreducibility mistake they thought as

7886
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:07,200
irreducibility mistake they thought as
 

7887
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,349
irreducibility mistake they thought as
soon as we've written down the axioms

7888
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:09,359
soon as we've written down the axioms
 

7889
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:10,549
soon as we've written down the axioms
then it'll just we'll just have a

7890
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
then it'll just we'll just have a
 

7891
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:11,589
then it'll just we'll just have a
machine

7892
02:17:11,589 --> 02:17:11,599
machine
 

7893
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:13,910
machine
kind of a super mathematica so to speak

7894
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:13,920
kind of a super mathematica so to speak
 

7895
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:15,910
kind of a super mathematica so to speak
that can just grind out all true

7896
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:15,920
that can just grind out all true
 

7897
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,669
that can just grind out all true
theorems of mathematics

7898
02:17:17,669 --> 02:17:17,679
theorems of mathematics
 

7899
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:19,910
theorems of mathematics
that got exploited by godel's theorem

7900
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
that got exploited by godel's theorem
 

7901
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:21,270
that got exploited by godel's theorem
which is basically the story of

7902
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:21,280
which is basically the story of
 

7903
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:23,429
which is basically the story of
computational irreducibility it's that

7904
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:23,439
computational irreducibility it's that
 

7905
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:25,110
computational irreducibility it's that
even though you know those underlying

7906
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,120
even though you know those underlying
 

7907
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,950
even though you know those underlying
rules you can't deduce all the

7908
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:26,960
rules you can't deduce all the
 

7909
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,669
rules you can't deduce all the
consequences in any finite way

7910
02:17:29,669 --> 02:17:29,679
consequences in any finite way
 

7911
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:31,669
consequences in any finite way
and so so that was but now the question

7912
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
and so so that was but now the question
 

7913
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:34,070
and so so that was but now the question
is okay so they broke mathematics down

7914
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:34,080
is okay so they broke mathematics down
 

7915
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:36,309
is okay so they broke mathematics down
into these axioms and they say now you

7916
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
into these axioms and they say now you
 

7917
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:37,669
into these axioms and they say now you
build up from that

7918
02:17:37,669 --> 02:17:37,679
build up from that
 

7919
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:40,230
build up from that
so what i'm increasingly uh coming to

7920
02:17:40,230 --> 02:17:40,240
so what i'm increasingly uh coming to
 

7921
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:42,790
so what i'm increasingly uh coming to
realize is that's similar to saying

7922
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:42,800
realize is that's similar to saying
 

7923
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,950
realize is that's similar to saying
let's take a gas and break it down into

7924
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:44,960
let's take a gas and break it down into
 

7925
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,230
let's take a gas and break it down into
molecules

7926
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,240
molecules
 

7927
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,070
molecules
there's gas laws that are the

7928
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:48,080
there's gas laws that are the
 

7929
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:50,549
there's gas laws that are the
large-scale structure and so on that we

7930
02:17:50,549 --> 02:17:50,559
large-scale structure and so on that we
 

7931
02:17:50,559 --> 02:17:52,309
large-scale structure and so on that we
humans are familiar with and then

7932
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
humans are familiar with and then
 

7933
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:53,589
humans are familiar with and then
there's the underlying molecular

7934
02:17:53,589 --> 02:17:53,599
there's the underlying molecular
 

7935
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:56,150
there's the underlying molecular
dynamics and i think that the axiomatic

7936
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:56,160
dynamics and i think that the axiomatic
 

7937
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:58,709

that's the molecular dynamics of
 

7945

this they just happily go along doing
 

7971
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,389
this they just happily go along doing

actually happening is that what they're

them to deduce that the laws of

7997
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:59,110

7999
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,750

than this underlying molecular dynamics
and so what gets really bizarre is

8002
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,160
and so what gets really bizarre is
 

8003
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,389
and so what gets really bizarre is

02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:29,920
statements you can use those to prove
 

8025
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,669
statements you can use those to prove
some other statement and you've got this

8026
02:19:31,669 --> 02:19:31,679
some other statement and you've got this
 

8027
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:34,070
some other statement and you've got this
whole network of proofs that's the kind

8028
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,080
whole network of proofs that's the kind
 

8029
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,150
whole network of proofs that's the kind
of causal network of mathematics so what

8030
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:36,160
of causal network of mathematics so what
 

8031
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:39,190
of causal network of mathematics so what
can prove what and so on and you can say

8032
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,200
can prove what and so on and you can say
 

8033
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,750
can prove what and so on and you can say
at any moment in the history of a

8034
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
at any moment in the history of a
 

8035
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,070
at any moment in the history of a
mathematician of a single mathematical

8036
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:44,080
mathematician of a single mathematical
 

8037
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,870
mathematician of a single mathematical
consciousness you are in a single kind

8038
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,880
consciousness you are in a single kind
 

8039
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,389
consciousness you are in a single kind
of slice

8040
02:19:48,389 --> 02:19:48,399
of slice
 

8041
02:19:48,399 --> 02:19:51,190
of slice
of this kind of meta-mathematical space

8042
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:51,200
of this kind of meta-mathematical space
 

8043
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,550
of this kind of meta-mathematical space
you you know a certain set of

8044
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:52,560
you you know a certain set of
 

8045
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,790
you you know a certain set of
mathematical statements you can then

8046
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:54,800
mathematical statements you can then
 

8047
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,710
mathematical statements you can then
deduce with proofs you can deduce other

8048
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
deduce with proofs you can deduce other
 

8049
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,710
deduce with proofs you can deduce other
ones and so on you're kind of gradually

8050
02:19:58,710 --> 02:19:58,720
ones and so on you're kind of gradually
 

8051
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:01,110
ones and so on you're kind of gradually
moving through meta-mathematical space

8052
02:20:01,110 --> 02:20:01,120
moving through meta-mathematical space
 

8053
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:03,910
moving through meta-mathematical space
and so it's kind of the view is that the

8054
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:03,920
and so it's kind of the view is that the
 

8055
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:06,230
and so it's kind of the view is that the
reason that mathematicians perceive

8056
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:06,240
reason that mathematicians perceive
 

8057
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:07,590
reason that mathematicians perceive
mathematics to have the sort of

8058
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:07,600
mathematics to have the sort of
 

8059
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,429
mathematics to have the sort of
integrity and lack of kind of

8060
02:20:09,429 --> 02:20:09,439
integrity and lack of kind of
 

8061
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:11,670
integrity and lack of kind of
undecidability and so on that they do is

8062
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:11,680
undecidability and so on that they do is
 

8063
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:14,150
undecidability and so on that they do is
because they like we as as observers of

8064
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
because they like we as as observers of
 

8065
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,990
because they like we as as observers of
the physical universe we have these

8066
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:16,000
the physical universe we have these
 

8067
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,590
the physical universe we have these
limitations associated with

8068
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:17,600
limitations associated with
 

8069
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:19,190
limitations associated with
computational boundedness single thread

8070
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:19,200
computational boundedness single thread
 

8071
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,270
computational boundedness single thread
of time consciousness limitations

8072
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:21,280
of time consciousness limitations
 

8073
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,510
of time consciousness limitations
basically that the same thing is true of

8074
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:23,520
basically that the same thing is true of
 

8075
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:25,270
basically that the same thing is true of
mathematicians perceiving sort of

8076
02:20:25,270 --> 02:20:25,280
mathematicians perceiving sort of
 

8077
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:26,870
mathematicians perceiving sort of
meta-mathematical space and so what's

8078
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:26,880
meta-mathematical space and so what's
 

8079
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:29,429
meta-mathematical space and so what's
happening is that when you look at if

8080
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:29,439
happening is that when you look at if
 

8081
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:30,630
happening is that when you look at if
you look at one of these formalized

8082
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:30,640
you look at one of these formalized
 

8083
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,710
you look at one of these formalized
mathematics systems something like you

8084
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:32,720
mathematics systems something like you
 

8085
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,670
mathematics systems something like you

8093
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:45,030
little steps to prove pythagoras's
theorem and one of the bizarre things

8094
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:45,040
theorem and one of the bizarre things
 

8095
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:46,870
theorem and one of the bizarre things
that's a sort of an empirical fact that

8096
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:46,880
that's a sort of an empirical fact that
 

8097

that's a sort of an empirical fact that
i'm trying to understand a little bit

02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,030
better if you look at different proof

formalized mathematics systems they

8104
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:52,880
formalized mathematics systems they
 

8105
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,230
formalized mathematics systems they
actually have different axioms

8106
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,240
actually have different axioms
 

8107
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:55,750
actually have different axioms
underneath but they can all prove

8108
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:55,760
underneath but they can all prove
 

8109
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:58,630
underneath but they can all prove
pythagoras theorem and so in other words

8110
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
pythagoras theorem and so in other words
 

8111
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:00,070
pythagoras theorem and so in other words
it's a little bit like what happens with

8112
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:00,080
it's a little bit like what happens with
 

8113
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,389
it's a little bit like what happens with
gases we can have air molecules we can

8114
02:21:02,389 --> 02:21:02,399
gases we can have air molecules we can
 

8115
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:04,230
gases we can have air molecules we can
have water molecules but they still have

8116
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:04,240
have water molecules but they still have
 

8117
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:06,230
have water molecules but they still have

02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,469
that mathematics that mathematicians
care about mathematics it's way above

care about mathematics it's way above
 

8125
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:14,550
care about mathematics it's way above
the macular dynamics so to speak

the macular dynamics so to speak
 

8127
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:16,150
the macular dynamics so to speak
and there are all kinds of weird things

8128
02:21:16,150 --> 02:21:16,160
and there are all kinds of weird things
 

8129
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,349
and there are all kinds of weird things
like for example one thing i was

theory of mathematics that's a very
 

8135
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,750
theory of mathematics that's a very
bizarre idea but um basically when you

8136
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
bizarre idea but um basically when you
 

8137
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:24,790
bizarre idea but um basically when you
prove

8138
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:24,800
prove
 

8139
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:26,790

what is you know a proof

8140
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:26,800
what is you know a proof
 

8141
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,389
what is you know a proof
is you've got one statement in

8142
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:28,399
is you've got one statement in
 

8143
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:29,670
is you've got one statement in
mathematics you go through other

mathematics you go through other
 

8145

02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:34,640
example that's a path path in

02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,469
example that's a path path in

meta-mathematical space
 

8153
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,389
meta-mathematical space
and that's a single path a single proof

8154
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:38,399
and that's a single path a single proof
 

8155
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:39,750
and that's a single path a single proof
is a single path

8156
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:39,760
is a single path
 

8157
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:41,349
is a single path
but you can imagine there are other

but you can imagine there are other
 

8159
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:43,349
but you can imagine there are other

proofs of the same result
 

8161
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:45,270
proofs of the same result
there are a bundle of proofs there's

8162
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:45,280
there are a bundle of proofs there's
 

8163
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,429
there are a bundle of proofs there's
this whole set of possible proofs you

8164
02:21:47,429 --> 02:21:47,439
this whole set of possible proofs you
 

8165
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:49,110
this whole set of possible proofs you
could think of as branching similar to

8166
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,120
could think of as branching similar to
 

8167
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,469
could think of as branching similar to
the quantum mechanics model that you

8168
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,479
the quantum mechanics model that you
 

8169
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:52,070
the quantum mechanics model that you
were talking about exactly and so and

8170
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,080
were talking about exactly and so and
 

8171
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,429
were talking about exactly and so and
then there's some invariants that you

8172
02:21:53,429 --> 02:21:53,439
then there's some invariants that you
 

8173
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:55,429
then there's some invariants that you
can formalize in the same way that you

8174
02:21:55,429 --> 02:21:55,439
can formalize in the same way that you
 

8175
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:57,190
can formalize in the same way that you
can for the quantum mechanical right so

8176
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:57,200
can for the quantum mechanical right so
 

8177
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,190
can for the quantum mechanical right so
the question is in in proof space you

8178
02:21:59,190 --> 02:21:59,200
the question is in in proof space you
 

8179
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,389
the question is in in proof space you
know as you start thinking about

8180
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
know as you start thinking about
 

8181
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:02,630
know as you start thinking about
multiple proofs are there analogs of for

undecidable theories that's a that's an
example and i think we're sort of the

8340
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:46,640
example and i think we're sort of the
 

8341
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:48,710
example and i think we're sort of the
the attempt to understand so so another

8342
02:24:48,710 --> 02:24:48,720
the attempt to understand so so another
 

8343
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:50,630
the attempt to understand so so another
question is kind of what is the what is

8344
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
question is kind of what is the what is
 

8345
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,349
question is kind of what is the what is
the general relativity of uh of

8346
02:24:53,349 --> 02:24:53,359
the general relativity of uh of
 

8347
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:55,670
the general relativity of uh of
metamathematics what is the bulk theory

8348
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:55,680
metamathematics what is the bulk theory
 

8349
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:57,349
metamathematics what is the bulk theory
of metamathematics

8350
02:24:57,349 --> 02:24:57,359
of metamathematics
 

8351
02:24:57,359 --> 02:24:59,110
of metamathematics
so in the literature of mathematics

8352
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,120
so in the literature of mathematics
 

8353
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:00,389
so in the literature of mathematics
there are about three million theorems

8354
02:25:00,389 --> 02:25:00,399
there are about three million theorems
 

8355
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:02,550
there are about three million theorems
that people have have published and

8356
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:02,560
that people have have published and
 

8357
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,870
that people have have published and
those represent it's kind of on this

8358
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
those represent it's kind of on this
 

8359
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:07,030
those represent it's kind of on this
it's like like on the earth

8360
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:07,040
it's like like on the earth
 

8361
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,429
it's like like on the earth
we would be you know uh you know we've

8362
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,439
we would be you know uh you know we've
 

8363
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:11,110
we would be you know uh you know we've
put cities in particular places on the

8364
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:11,120
put cities in particular places on the
 

8365
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:13,270
put cities in particular places on the
earth but yet there is ultimately you

8366
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:13,280
earth but yet there is ultimately you
 

8367
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,630
earth but yet there is ultimately you
know we know the earth is roughly

8368
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
know we know the earth is roughly
 

8369
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,550
know we know the earth is roughly
spherical and there's an underlying

8370
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
spherical and there's an underlying
 

8371
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,870
spherical and there's an underlying
space and we could just talk about you

8372
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:18,880
space and we could just talk about you
 

8373
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:21,110
space and we could just talk about you
know the world of space in terms of

8374
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
know the world of space in terms of
 

8375
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,469
know the world of space in terms of
where our cities happen to be but

8376
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:22,479
where our cities happen to be but
 

8377
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:24,469
where our cities happen to be but
there's actually an underlying space and

8378
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
there's actually an underlying space and
 

8379
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:25,910
there's actually an underlying space and
so the question is what's that for meta

8380
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:25,920
so the question is what's that for meta
 

8381
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,150
so the question is what's that for meta
mathematics and as we kind of explore

8382
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:28,160
mathematics and as we kind of explore
 

8383
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:30,070
mathematics and as we kind of explore
what is for example for mathematics

8384
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
what is for example for mathematics
 

8385
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,230
what is for example for mathematics
which is always likes taking sort of

8386
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:32,240
which is always likes taking sort of
 

8387
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:34,630
which is always likes taking sort of
abstract limits so an obvious abstract

8388
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:34,640
abstract limits so an obvious abstract
 

8389
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:36,550
abstract limits so an obvious abstract
limit for mathematics to take is the

8390
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:36,560
limit for mathematics to take is the
 

8391
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,870
limit for mathematics to take is the
limit of the future of mathematics

8392
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:38,880
limit of the future of mathematics
 

8393
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:41,030
limit of the future of mathematics
that is what will be you know the

8394
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:41,040
that is what will be you know the
 

8395
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,190
that is what will be you know the
ultimate structure of mathematics yeah

8396
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,200
ultimate structure of mathematics yeah
 

8397
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:44,230
ultimate structure of mathematics yeah
and one of the things that's an

8398
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,240
and one of the things that's an
 

8399
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:46,309
and one of the things that's an
empirical observation about mathematics

8400
02:25:46,309 --> 02:25:46,319
empirical observation about mathematics
 

8401
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:48,469
empirical observation about mathematics
that's quite interesting is that a lot

8402
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:48,479
that's quite interesting is that a lot
 

8403
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:50,469
that's quite interesting is that a lot
of theories in one area of mathematics

8404
02:25:50,469 --> 02:25:50,479
of theories in one area of mathematics
 

8405
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:52,550
of theories in one area of mathematics
algebraic geometry or something might

8406
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:52,560
algebraic geometry or something might
 

8407
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,710
algebraic geometry or something might
have they play into another area of

8408
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
have they play into another area of
 

8409
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,670
have they play into another area of
mathematics that that same the same kind

8410
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:57,680
mathematics that that same the same kind
 

8411
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,510
mathematics that that same the same kind
of a fundamental construct seemed to

8412
02:25:59,510 --> 02:25:59,520
of a fundamental construct seemed to
 

8413
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,190
of a fundamental construct seemed to
occur in very different areas of

8414
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,200
occur in very different areas of
 

8415
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,190
occur in very different areas of
mathematics and that's structurally

8416
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:03,200
mathematics and that's structurally
 

8417
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,710
mathematics and that's structurally
captured a bit with category theory and

8418
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:04,720
captured a bit with category theory and
 

8419
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,710
captured a bit with category theory and
things like that but i think that

8420
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:06,720
things like that but i think that
 

8421
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,230
things like that but i think that
there's probably an understanding of

8422
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:08,240
there's probably an understanding of
 

8423
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:09,990
there's probably an understanding of
this meta-mathematical space that will

8424
02:26:09,990 --> 02:26:10,000
this meta-mathematical space that will
 

8425
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,990
this meta-mathematical space that will
explain why different areas of

8426
02:26:11,990 --> 02:26:12,000
explain why different areas of
 

8427
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,230
explain why different areas of
mathematics ultimately sort of map into

8428
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:14,240
mathematics ultimately sort of map into
 

8429
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:16,389
mathematics ultimately sort of map into
the same thing and i mean you know my

8430
02:26:16,389 --> 02:26:16,399
the same thing and i mean you know my
 

8431
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:18,230
the same thing and i mean you know my
little challenge to myself is what's

8432
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,240
little challenge to myself is what's
 

8433
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,790
little challenge to myself is what's
time dilation in um uh in mata

8434
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:20,800
time dilation in um uh in mata
 

8435
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:23,750
time dilation in um uh in mata
mathematics in other words as you as you

8436
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:23,760
mathematics in other words as you as you
 

8437
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,510
mathematics in other words as you as you
basically as you move around in this

8438
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:25,520
basically as you move around in this
 

8439
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:27,510
basically as you move around in this
mathematical space of possible

8440
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:27,520
mathematical space of possible
 

8441
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:30,469
mathematical space of possible
statements um you know what's how does

8442
02:26:30,469 --> 02:26:30,479
statements um you know what's how does
 

8443
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:32,230
statements um you know what's how does
that moving around it's basically what's

8444
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:32,240
that moving around it's basically what's
 

8445
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:34,950
that moving around it's basically what's
happening is that as you move around in

8446
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:34,960
happening is that as you move around in
 

8447
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,309
happening is that as you move around in
the space of mathematical statements

8448
02:26:36,309 --> 02:26:36,319
the space of mathematical statements
 

8449
02:26:36,319 --> 02:26:37,670
the space of mathematical statements
it's like you're changing from algebra

8450
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:37,680
it's like you're changing from algebra
 

8451
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:40,230
it's like you're changing from algebra
to geometry to whatever else and you're

8452
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:40,240
to geometry to whatever else and you're
 

8453
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:42,550
to geometry to whatever else and you're
trying to prove the same theorem but as

8454
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:42,560
trying to prove the same theorem but as
 

8455
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,790
trying to prove the same theorem but as
you try if you keep on moving to these

8456
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:44,800
you try if you keep on moving to these
 

8457
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,870
you try if you keep on moving to these
different places it's slower to prove

8458
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
different places it's slower to prove
 

8459
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:48,070
different places it's slower to prove
that theorem because you keep on having

8460
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,080
that theorem because you keep on having
 

8461
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,830
that theorem because you keep on having
to translate what you're doing back to

8462
02:26:49,830 --> 02:26:49,840
to translate what you're doing back to
 

8463
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:50,950
to translate what you're doing back to
where you started from and that's kind

8464
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:50,960
where you started from and that's kind
 

8465
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:52,790
where you started from and that's kind
of the beginnings of the analog of time

8466
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:52,800
of the beginnings of the analog of time
 

8467
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:54,950
of the beginnings of the analog of time
dilation and metamathematics plus

02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:54,960
dilation and metamathematics plus
 

8469
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:56,550

there's probably fractional dimensions

8470
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:56,560
there's probably fractional dimensions
 

8471
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:57,990
there's probably fractional dimensions
in this space as well

8472
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:58,000
in this space as well
 

8473
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,790
in this space as well
oh this space is a very messy space this

02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:00,800
oh this space is a very messy space this
 

8475

physical space is is very tame compared
 

8483
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,870
physical space is is very tame compared
to branchial space and real space um i

mean the mathematical structure you know

8486
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:12,880
mean the mathematical structure you know
 

8487
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,150
mean the mathematical structure you know
bronchial space probably more like

8488
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:14,160
bronchial space probably more like
 

8489
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:15,429
bronchial space probably more like
hilbert space but it's a rather

8490
02:27:15,429 --> 02:27:15,439
hilbert space but it's a rather
 

8491
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:17,270
hilbert space but it's a rather
complicated hilbert space

and rulial space
 

8495
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:22,309
and rulial space
is more like this weird infinity

groupoid story of growth and deacon and

8498
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:24,319
groupoid story of growth and deacon and
 

8499
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:25,510
groupoid story of growth and deacon and
you know i can explain that a little bit

8500
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:25,520
you know i can explain that a little bit
 

8501
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,150
you know i can explain that a little bit
because in you know in in meta

8502
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:28,160
because in you know in in meta
 

8503
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:29,670
because in you know in in meta
mathematical space

8504
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:29,680
mathematical space
 

8505
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:33,429
mathematical space
a a path in mathematical space is a is a

8506
02:27:33,429 --> 02:27:33,439
a a path in mathematical space is a is a
 

8507
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:35,590
a a path in mathematical space is a is a
a path between two statements is a way

8508
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600
a path between two statements is a way
 

8509
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,349
a path between two statements is a way
to get by proofs

8510
02:27:37,349 --> 02:27:37,359
to get by proofs
 

8511
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:39,270
to get by proofs
is to way to find a proof that goes from

8512
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:39,280
is to way to find a proof that goes from
 

8513
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:40,950
is to way to find a proof that goes from
one statement to another

8514
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:40,960
one statement to another
 

8515
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:42,790
one statement to another
and so one of the things you can do you

8516
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:42,800
and so one of the things you can do you
 

8517
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,550
and so one of the things you can do you
can think about is you've got between

8518
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,560
can think about is you've got between
 

8519
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:46,630
can think about is you've got between
statements you've got proofs and they

8520
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:46,640
statements you've got proofs and they
 

8521
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,790
statements you've got proofs and they
are paths between statements okay so now

8522
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:48,800
are paths between statements okay so now
 

8523
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:50,790
are paths between statements okay so now
you can go to the next level and you can

8524
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:50,800
you can go to the next level and you can
 

8525
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:53,110
you can go to the next level and you can
ask what about a mapping from one proof

8526
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:53,120
ask what about a mapping from one proof
 

8527
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:54,309
ask what about a mapping from one proof
to another

8528
02:27:54,309 --> 02:27:54,319
to another
 

8529
02:27:54,319 --> 02:27:56,469
to another
and so that's in in category theory

8530
02:27:56,469 --> 02:27:56,479
and so that's in in category theory
 

8531
02:27:56,479 --> 02:27:58,630
and so that's in in category theory
that's kind of a higher category the

8532
02:27:58,630 --> 02:27:58,640
that's kind of a higher category the
 

8533
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:00,550
that's kind of a higher category the
notion of higher categories where you're

8534
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:00,560
notion of higher categories where you're
 

8535
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,550
notion of higher categories where you're
where you're mapping not just between

8536
02:28:02,550 --> 02:28:02,560
where you're mapping not just between
 

8537
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,389
where you're mapping not just between
not just between objects but you're

8538
02:28:04,389 --> 02:28:04,399
not just between objects but you're
 

8539
02:28:04,399 --> 02:28:05,990
not just between objects but you're
mapping between the mappings between

8540
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:06,000
mapping between the mappings between
 

8541
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,630
mapping between the mappings between
objects and so on and so you can keep

8542
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:08,640
objects and so on and so you can keep
 

8543
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:10,309
objects and so on and so you can keep
doing that you can keep saying higher

8544
02:28:10,309 --> 02:28:10,319
doing that you can keep saying higher
 

8545
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:12,150
doing that you can keep saying higher
order proofs i want mappings between

02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,160
order proofs i want mappings between
 

8547
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,469
order proofs i want mappings between
proofs between proofs and so on and that

8548
02:28:14,469 --> 02:28:14,479
proofs between proofs and so on and that
 

8549
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:16,389

in proof space you've got these two

8554
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:20,319
in proof space you've got these two
 

8555
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:21,190
in proof space you've got these two
proofs

8556
02:28:21,190 --> 02:28:21,200
proofs
 

8557
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:23,270
proofs
and the question is what is the topology

8558
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,280
and the question is what is the topology
 

8559
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,110
and the question is what is the topology
of proof space in other words if you

8560
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:25,120
of proof space in other words if you
 

8561
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:26,870
of proof space in other words if you
take these two parts can you

8562
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:26,880
take these two parts can you
 

8563
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:29,030
take these two parts can you
continuously deform them into each other

8564
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,040
continuously deform them into each other
 

8565
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:30,870
continuously deform them into each other
or is there some big hole in the middle

8566
02:28:30,870 --> 02:28:30,880
or is there some big hole in the middle
 

8567
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:32,630
or is there some big hole in the middle
that prevents you from continuously

8568
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
that prevents you from continuously
 

8569
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,230
that prevents you from continuously
deforming them one into the other it's

8570
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:34,240
deforming them one into the other it's
 

8571
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:35,830
deforming them one into the other it's
kind of like you know when you when you

8572
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:35,840
kind of like you know when you when you
 

8573
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,270
kind of like you know when you when you
think about some i don't know some

8574
02:28:37,270 --> 02:28:37,280
think about some i don't know some
 

8575
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,190
think about some i don't know some
puzzle for example you're moving pieces

8576
02:28:39,190 --> 02:28:39,200
puzzle for example you're moving pieces
 

8577
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,429
puzzle for example you're moving pieces
around on some puzzle and you can think

8578
02:28:41,429 --> 02:28:41,439
around on some puzzle and you can think
 

8579
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:43,270
around on some puzzle and you can think
about the space of possible states of

8580
02:28:43,270 --> 02:28:43,280
about the space of possible states of
 

8581
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:45,270
about the space of possible states of
the puzzle and you can make this graph

8582
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:45,280
the puzzle and you can make this graph
 

8583
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,030
the puzzle and you can make this graph
that shows from one state to the puzzle

8584
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,040
that shows from one state to the puzzle
 

8585
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:48,950
that shows from one state to the puzzle
to another state of the puzzle and so on

8586
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
to another state of the puzzle and so on
 

8587
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,270
to another state of the puzzle and so on
and sometimes you can easily get from

8588
02:28:51,270 --> 02:28:51,280
and sometimes you can easily get from
 

8589
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:52,550
and sometimes you can easily get from
one state to any other state but

8590
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:52,560
one state to any other state but
 

8591
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,550
one state to any other state but
sometimes there'll be a hole in that

8592
02:28:54,550 --> 02:28:54,560
sometimes there'll be a hole in that
 

8593
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:56,550
sometimes there'll be a hole in that
space and they'll be you know you always

8594
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:56,560
space and they'll be you know you always
 

8595
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:58,790
space and they'll be you know you always
have to go around the circuitous route

8596
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:58,800
have to go around the circuitous route
 

8597
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,389
have to go around the circuitous route
to get from here to there there won't be

8598
02:29:00,389 --> 02:29:00,399
to get from here to there there won't be
 

8599
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:03,270
to get from here to there there won't be
any direct way that's kind of a question

8600
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:03,280
any direct way that's kind of a question
 

8601
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,190
any direct way that's kind of a question
of of whether there's sort of an

8602
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,200
of of whether there's sort of an
 

8603
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,110
of of whether there's sort of an
obstruction in the space and so the

8604
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:07,120
obstruction in the space and so the
 

8605
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,110
obstruction in the space and so the
question is in proof space

8606
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120
question is in proof space
 

8607
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:12,070
question is in proof space
what is the what are you know what does

8608
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:12,080
what is the what are you know what does
 

8609
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,830
what is the what are you know what does
it mean if there's an obstruction in

8610
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:13,840
it mean if there's an obstruction in
 

8611
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,510
it mean if there's an obstruction in
proof space yeah i don't even know what

8612
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:15,520
proof space yeah i don't even know what
 

8613
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,070
proof space yeah i don't even know what
an uh obstruction means improve space

8614
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:18,080
an uh obstruction means improve space
 

8615
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,110
an uh obstruction means improve space
because

8616
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:19,120
because
 

8617
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:20,469
because
for it to be an obstruction it should be

8618
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:20,479
for it to be an obstruction it should be
 

8619
02:29:20,479 --> 02:29:22,950
for it to be an obstruction it should be
reachable some other way from some other

8620
02:29:22,950 --> 02:29:22,960
reachable some other way from some other
 

8621
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,910
reachable some other way from some other
place

8622
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:23,920
place
 

8623
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:26,309
place
right so this is like an unreachable

8624
02:29:26,309 --> 02:29:26,319
right so this is like an unreachable
 

8625
02:29:26,319 --> 02:29:27,830
right so this is like an unreachable
part of the graph

8626
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:27,840
part of the graph
 

8627
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:29,270
part of the graph
no it's not just an unreachable part

8628
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:29,280
no it's not just an unreachable part
 

8629
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,349
no it's not just an unreachable part
it's a part where there are paths that

8630
02:29:31,349 --> 02:29:31,359
it's a part where there are paths that
 

8631
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:32,950
it's a part where there are paths that
go one way there are parts that go the

8632
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:32,960
go one way there are parts that go the
 

8633
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:34,790
go one way there are parts that go the
other way and this question of homotopy

8634
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:34,800
other way and this question of homotopy
 

8635
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,389
other way and this question of homotopy
and mathematics is this question can you

8636
02:29:36,389 --> 02:29:36,399
and mathematics is this question can you
 

8637
02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:38,790
and mathematics is this question can you
continuously deform you know from one

8638
02:29:38,790 --> 02:29:38,800
continuously deform you know from one
 

8639
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:40,950
continuously deform you know from one
path to another path or do you have to

8640
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:40,960
path to another path or do you have to
 

8641
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:43,429
path to another path or do you have to
go in a jump so to speak so okay so like

8642
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:43,439
go in a jump so to speak so okay so like
 

8643
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:44,710
go in a jump so to speak so okay so like
if you're going around a sphere for

8644
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:44,720
if you're going around a sphere for
 

8645
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:46,309
if you're going around a sphere for
example if you're going around

8646
02:29:46,309 --> 02:29:46,319
example if you're going around
 

8647
02:29:46,319 --> 02:29:47,349
example if you're going around
i don't know

8648
02:29:47,349 --> 02:29:47,359
i don't know
 

8649
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:48,790
i don't know
a cylinder or something you can wind

8650
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:48,800
a cylinder or something you can wind
 

8651
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,990
a cylinder or something you can wind
around one way and you can there's no

8652
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,000
around one way and you can there's no
 

8653
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,070
around one way and you can there's no
paths where you can where you can easily

8654
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,080
paths where you can where you can easily
 

8655
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,670
paths where you can where you can easily
deform one path into another because

8656
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:55,680
deform one path into another because
 

8657
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,870
deform one path into another because
it's just sort of sitting on the same

8658
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
it's just sort of sitting on the same
 

8659
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,710
it's just sort of sitting on the same
side of the cylinder but when you've got

8660
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
side of the cylinder but when you've got
 

8661
02:29:58,720 --> 02:29:59,990
side of the cylinder but when you've got
something that winds all the way around

8662
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:00,000
something that winds all the way around
 

8663
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,990
something that winds all the way around
a cylinder you can't continuously deform

8664
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:02,000
a cylinder you can't continuously deform
 

8665
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,230
a cylinder you can't continuously deform
that down to a point because it's it's

8666
02:30:04,230 --> 02:30:04,240
that down to a point because it's it's
 

8667
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:06,230
that down to a point because it's it's
stuck wrapped around my intuition about

8668
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:06,240
stuck wrapped around my intuition about
 

8669
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:07,670
stuck wrapped around my intuition about
proof space is you should be able to

8670
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
proof space is you should be able to
 

8671
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,349
proof space is you should be able to
deform it i mean that because then

8672
02:30:09,349 --> 02:30:09,359
deform it i mean that because then
 

8673
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:10,710
deform it i mean that because then
otherwise it doesn't even make sense

8674
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:10,720
otherwise it doesn't even make sense
 

8675
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,590
otherwise it doesn't even make sense
because

8676
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:11,600
because
 

8677
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:14,389
because
if the topology matters of the way you

8678
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
if the topology matters of the way you
 

8679
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:16,389
if the topology matters of the way you
move about the space that i don't even

8680
02:30:16,389 --> 02:30:16,399
move about the space that i don't even
 

8681
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:17,830
move about the space that i don't even
know what that means well what it would

8682
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:17,840
know what that means well what it would
 

8683
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,309
know what that means well what it would
mean is that you would have one way of

8684
02:30:20,309 --> 02:30:20,319
mean is that you would have one way of
 

8685
02:30:20,319 --> 02:30:22,469
mean is that you would have one way of
doing a proof of something over here in

8686
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:22,479
doing a proof of something over here in
 

8687
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,389
doing a proof of something over here in
algebra yeah and another way of doing a

8688
02:30:24,389 --> 02:30:24,399
algebra yeah and another way of doing a
 

8689
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:26,550
algebra yeah and another way of doing a
proof of something over here in geometry

8690
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
proof of something over here in geometry
 

8691
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,630
proof of something over here in geometry
and there would not be an intermediate

8692
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:28,640
and there would not be an intermediate
 

8693
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,110
and there would not be an intermediate
way to map between those proofs how

8694
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
way to map between those proofs how
 

8695
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,870
way to map between those proofs how
would that be possible if they start at

8696
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:32,880
would that be possible if they start at
 

8697
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:35,190
would that be possible if they start at
the same place and end the same place

8698
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:35,200
the same place and end the same place
 

8699
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,950
the same place and end the same place
well it's the same thing as

8700
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
well it's the same thing as
 

8701
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,950
well it's the same thing as
you know we've got points on a you know

8702
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:38,960
you know we've got points on a you know
 

8703
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,110
you know we've got points on a you know
if we've got paths on a cylinder now i

8704
02:30:41,110 --> 02:30:41,120
if we've got paths on a cylinder now i
 

8705
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:42,790
if we've got paths on a cylinder now i
understand how it works in physical

8706
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:42,800
understand how it works in physical
 

8707
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:44,950
understand how it works in physical
space but it just doesn't it feels like

8708
02:30:44,950 --> 02:30:44,960
space but it just doesn't it feels like
 

8709
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:47,590
space but it just doesn't it feels like
proof space shouldn't have that i okay i

8710
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:47,600
proof space shouldn't have that i okay i
 

8711
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:49,670
proof space shouldn't have that i okay i
mean i'm not sure i don't know we will

8712
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,680
mean i'm not sure i don't know we will
 

8713
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,429
mean i'm not sure i don't know we will
know very soon because we get to do some

8714
02:30:51,429 --> 02:30:51,439
know very soon because we get to do some
 

8715
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:52,710
know very soon because we get to do some
experiments this is the great thing

8716
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:52,720
experiments this is the great thing
 

8717
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:55,270
experiments this is the great thing
about this stuff is that in fact you

8718
02:30:55,270 --> 02:30:55,280
about this stuff is that in fact you
 

8719
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,270
about this stuff is that in fact you
know i i'm in the next few days i hope

8720
02:30:57,270 --> 02:30:57,280
know i i'm in the next few days i hope
 

8721
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,030
know i i'm in the next few days i hope
to do a bunch of experiments on this so

8722
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
to do a bunch of experiments on this so
 

8723
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,950
to do a bunch of experiments on this so
you're playing with like proofs in in

8724
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:00,960
you're playing with like proofs in in
 

8725
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:03,830
you're playing with like proofs in in
this kind of space yes yes i mean so so

8726
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
this kind of space yes yes i mean so so
 

8727
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,550
this kind of space yes yes i mean so so
you know this is toy you know theories

8728
02:31:06,550 --> 02:31:06,560
you know this is toy you know theories
 

8729
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:09,110
you know this is toy you know theories
and you know we've got good so this kind

8730
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,120
and you know we've got good so this kind
 

8731
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,630
and you know we've got good so this kind
of segues to perhaps another thing which

8732
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:10,640
of segues to perhaps another thing which
 

8733
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:13,270
of segues to perhaps another thing which
is this whole idea of multi-computation

8734
02:31:13,270 --> 02:31:13,280
is this whole idea of multi-computation
 

8735
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,670
is this whole idea of multi-computation
so this this um

8736
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:15,680
so this this um
 

8737
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:19,110
so this this um
is another kind of bigger idea that so

8738
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,120
is another kind of bigger idea that so
 

8739
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,270
is another kind of bigger idea that so
okay this has to do with how do you make

8740
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:21,280
okay this has to do with how do you make
 

8741
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:22,790
okay this has to do with how do you make
models of things

8742
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:22,800
models of things
 

8743
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:25,030
models of things
and it's going to it's some

8744
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:25,040
and it's going to it's some
 

8745
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,750
and it's going to it's some
so

8746
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:25,760
so
 

8747
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:27,190
so
i've sort of claimed that they've been

8748
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:27,200
i've sort of claimed that they've been
 

8749
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:29,670
i've sort of claimed that they've been
sort of four epochs in the history of

8750
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:29,680
sort of four epochs in the history of
 

8751
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,670
sort of four epochs in the history of
making models of things

8752
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:31,680
making models of things
 

8753
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,870
making models of things
and um

8754
02:31:32,870 --> 02:31:32,880
and um
 

8755
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:34,950
and um
and this multi-computation thing is is

8756
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:34,960
and this multi-computation thing is is
 

8757
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,630
and this multi-computation thing is is
the fourth there's a new epoch what are

8758
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:36,640
the fourth there's a new epoch what are
 

8759
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,910
the fourth there's a new epoch what are
the first three

8760
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:37,920
the first three
 

8761
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:40,550
the first three
the first one is is back in antiquity

8762
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:40,560
the first one is is back in antiquity
 

8763
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:43,190
the first one is is back in antiquity
ancient greek times people were like

8764
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,200
ancient greek times people were like
 

8765
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,190
ancient greek times people were like
what's the universe made of oh it's made

8766
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,200
what's the universe made of oh it's made
 

8767
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,670
what's the universe made of oh it's made
of you know everything is water thales

8768
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:47,680
of you know everything is water thales
 

8769
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:50,710
of you know everything is water thales
you know or everything is made of atoms

8770
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:50,720
you know or everything is made of atoms
 

8771
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:53,429
you know or everything is made of atoms
it's sort of what are things made of or

8772
02:31:53,429 --> 02:31:53,439
it's sort of what are things made of or
 

8773
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:55,190
it's sort of what are things made of or
you know there are these crystal spheres

8774
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
you know there are these crystal spheres
 

8775
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,429
you know there are these crystal spheres
that represent where the planets are and

8776
02:31:57,429 --> 02:31:57,439
that represent where the planets are and
 

8777
02:31:57,439 --> 02:31:59,750
that represent where the planets are and
so on it's like a structural idea of how

8778
02:31:59,750 --> 02:31:59,760
so on it's like a structural idea of how
 

8779
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:01,830
so on it's like a structural idea of how
the universe is constructed there's no

8780
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
the universe is constructed there's no
 

8781
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,070
the universe is constructed there's no
real notion of dynamics it's just what

8782
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
real notion of dynamics it's just what
 

8783
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,469
real notion of dynamics it's just what
is the universe how is the universe made

8784
02:32:06,469 --> 02:32:06,479
is the universe how is the universe made
 

8785
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:09,110
is the universe how is the universe made
then we get to the 1600s and we get to

8786
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,120
then we get to the 1600s and we get to
 

8787
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:10,950
then we get to the 1600s and we get to
the sort of revolution of mathematics

8788
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
the sort of revolution of mathematics
 

8789
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,230
the sort of revolution of mathematics
being introduced into physics and then

8790
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:14,240
being introduced into physics and then
 

8791
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,469
being introduced into physics and then
we have this kind of idea of you write

8792
02:32:16,469 --> 02:32:16,479
we have this kind of idea of you write
 

8793
02:32:16,479 --> 02:32:18,710
we have this kind of idea of you write
down some equation

8794
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:18,720
down some equation
 

8795
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,710
down some equation
the what happens in the universe is the

8796
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:20,720
the what happens in the universe is the
 

8797
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,389
the what happens in the universe is the
solving of that equation

8798
02:32:22,389 --> 02:32:22,399
solving of that equation
 

8799
02:32:22,399 --> 02:32:24,550
solving of that equation
time enters but it's usually just a

8800
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:24,560
time enters but it's usually just a
 

8801
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,389
time enters but it's usually just a
parameter we just can you know sort of

8802
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
parameter we just can you know sort of
 

8803
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:28,950
parameter we just can you know sort of
slide it back and forth and say here's

8804
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:28,960
slide it back and forth and say here's
 

8805
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,230
slide it back and forth and say here's
here's where it is

8806
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
here's where it is
 

8807
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,750
here's where it is
okay then we come to this kind of

8808
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
okay then we come to this kind of
 

8809
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,950
okay then we come to this kind of
computational idea that i kind of

8810
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:34,960
computational idea that i kind of
 

8811
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:36,630
computational idea that i kind of
started really pushing in the in the 90

8812
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:36,640
started really pushing in the in the 90
 

8813
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:39,349
started really pushing in the in the 90
early 1980s as a result you know the

8814
02:32:39,349 --> 02:32:39,359
early 1980s as a result you know the
 

8815
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:40,389
early 1980s as a result you know the
things we were talking about before

8816
02:32:40,389 --> 02:32:40,399
things we were talking about before
 

8817
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:43,190
things we were talking about before
about complexity that was my motivation

8818
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:43,200
about complexity that was my motivation
 

8819
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,190
about complexity that was my motivation
but the bigger story was the story of

8820
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:45,200
but the bigger story was the story of
 

8821
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:47,670
but the bigger story was the story of
kind of computational models of things

8822
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:47,680
kind of computational models of things
 

8823
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:49,349
kind of computational models of things
and the big difference there from the

8824
02:32:49,349 --> 02:32:49,359
and the big difference there from the
 

8825
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:51,349
and the big difference there from the
mathematical models is in mathematical

8826
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
mathematical models is in mathematical
 

8827
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:53,670
mathematical models is in mathematical
models there's an equation you solve it

8828
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:53,680
models there's an equation you solve it
 

8829
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,429
models there's an equation you solve it
you've got kind of slide time to the

8830
02:32:55,429 --> 02:32:55,439
you've got kind of slide time to the
 

8831
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:56,870
you've got kind of slide time to the
place where you want it

8832
02:32:56,870 --> 02:32:56,880
place where you want it
 

8833
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:58,710
place where you want it
in computational models

8834
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:58,720
in computational models
 

8835
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:01,349
in computational models
you give the rule and then you just say

8836
02:33:01,349 --> 02:33:01,359
you give the rule and then you just say
 

8837
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:03,990
you give the rule and then you just say
go run the rule and time is not

8838
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:04,000
go run the rule and time is not
 

8839
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,990
go run the rule and time is not
something you get to slide time is

8840
02:33:05,990 --> 02:33:06,000
something you get to slide time is
 

8841
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,910
something you get to slide time is
something where it just you run the rule

8842
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:07,920
something where it just you run the rule
 

8843
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:11,429
something where it just you run the rule
time goes in steps and that's how you

8844
02:33:11,429 --> 02:33:11,439
time goes in steps and that's how you
 

8845
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:13,349
time goes in steps and that's how you
work out what how the system behaves you

8846
02:33:13,349 --> 02:33:13,359
work out what how the system behaves you
 

8847
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:15,830
work out what how the system behaves you
don't time is not just a parameter time

8848
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
don't time is not just a parameter time
 

8849
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,510
don't time is not just a parameter time
is something that is about the running

8850
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:17,520
is something that is about the running
 

8851
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:19,670
is something that is about the running
of these of these rules and so there's

8852
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:19,680
of these of these rules and so there's
 

8853
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:21,349
of these of these rules and so there's
this computational irreducibility you

8854
02:33:21,349 --> 02:33:21,359
this computational irreducibility you
 

8855
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:23,429
this computational irreducibility you
can't jump ahead in time but there's

8856
02:33:23,429 --> 02:33:23,439
can't jump ahead in time but there's
 

8857
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:25,590
can't jump ahead in time but there's
still important thing is there's still

8858
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:25,600
still important thing is there's still
 

8859
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:27,830
still important thing is there's still
one thread of time it's still the case

8860
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:27,840
one thread of time it's still the case
 

8861
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:29,750
one thread of time it's still the case
you know the seller automaton state then

8862
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
you know the seller automaton state then
 

8863
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,270
you know the seller automaton state then
it has the next state and the next state

8864
02:33:31,270 --> 02:33:31,280
it has the next state and the next state
 

8865
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:34,070
it has the next state and the next state
and so on the thing that is kind of was

8866
02:33:34,070 --> 02:33:34,080
and so on the thing that is kind of was
 

8867
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:35,910
and so on the thing that is kind of was
sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics

8868
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:35,920
sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics
 

8869
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:37,990
sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics
in a sense although it it actually feeds

8870
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:38,000
in a sense although it it actually feeds
 

8871
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,910
in a sense although it it actually feeds
back even into relativity and things

8872
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:39,920
back even into relativity and things
 

8873
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,950
back even into relativity and things
like that

8874
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:40,960
like that
 

8875
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:42,950
like that
that there's these multiple threads of

8876
02:33:42,950 --> 02:33:42,960
that there's these multiple threads of
 

8877
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:45,750
that there's these multiple threads of
time and so in this multi-computation

8878
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:45,760
time and so in this multi-computation
 

8879
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:48,230
time and so in this multi-computation
paradigm the kind of idea is instead of

8880
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:48,240
paradigm the kind of idea is instead of
 

8881
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:50,150
paradigm the kind of idea is instead of
there being this single threat of time

8882
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
there being this single threat of time
 

8883
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,590
there being this single threat of time
there are these kind of distributed

8884
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:51,600
there are these kind of distributed
 

8885
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,750
there are these kind of distributed
asynchronous threads of time that are

8886
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:53,760
asynchronous threads of time that are
 

8887
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,590
asynchronous threads of time that are
happening and the thing that's sort of

8888
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:55,600
happening and the thing that's sort of
 

8889
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:56,870
happening and the thing that's sort of
different there

8890
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:56,880
different there
 

8891
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,790
different there
is if you want to know what happened if

8892
02:33:58,790 --> 02:33:58,800
is if you want to know what happened if
 

8893
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,270
is if you want to know what happened if
you say what happened in the system in

8894
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:01,280
you say what happened in the system in
 

8895
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,270
you say what happened in the system in
the case of the computational paradigm

8896
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:03,280
the case of the computational paradigm
 

8897
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,469
the case of the computational paradigm
you just say well after a thousand steps

8898
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:06,479
you just say well after a thousand steps
 

8899
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:07,910
you just say well after a thousand steps
we got this result

8900
02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:07,920
we got this result
 

8901
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:09,830
we got this result
right but in the multi-computational

8902
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:09,840
right but in the multi-computational
 

8903
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:11,990
right but in the multi-computational
paradigm after a thousand steps not even

8904
02:34:11,990 --> 02:34:12,000
paradigm after a thousand steps not even
 

8905
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,190
paradigm after a thousand steps not even
clear what a thousand steps means

8906
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
clear what a thousand steps means
 

8907
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,070
clear what a thousand steps means
because you've got all these different

8908
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:14,080
because you've got all these different
 

8909
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,950
because you've got all these different
threads of time but there is no state

8910
02:34:16,950 --> 02:34:16,960
threads of time but there is no state
 

8911
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,030
threads of time but there is no state
there's all these different possible you

8912
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:19,040
there's all these different possible you
 

8913
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:20,790
there's all these different possible you
know there's all these different paths

8914
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:20,800
know there's all these different paths
 

8915
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,469
know there's all these different paths
and so the only way you can know what

8916
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:22,479
and so the only way you can know what
 

8917
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:23,670
and so the only way you can know what
happened is to have some kind of

8918
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:23,680
happened is to have some kind of
 

8919
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,830
happened is to have some kind of
observer who is saying here's how to

8920
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:25,840
observer who is saying here's how to
 

8921
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:26,790
observer who is saying here's how to
parse

8922
02:34:26,790 --> 02:34:26,800
parse
 

8923
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,870
parse
the results of what was going on right

8924
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:28,880
the results of what was going on right
 

8925
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:30,389
the results of what was going on right
but that observer is embedded and they

8926
02:34:30,389 --> 02:34:30,399
but that observer is embedded and they
 

8927
02:34:30,399 --> 02:34:32,469
but that observer is embedded and they
don't have a complete picture so in the

8928
02:34:32,469 --> 02:34:32,479
don't have a complete picture so in the
 

8929
02:34:32,479 --> 02:34:34,230
don't have a complete picture so in the
case of physics that's right yes and

8930
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,240
case of physics that's right yes and
 

8931
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:36,630
case of physics that's right yes and
then in the but that's but so the idea

8932
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:36,640
then in the but that's but so the idea
 

8933
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:39,349
then in the but that's but so the idea
is that in this multi-computation setup

8934
02:34:39,349 --> 02:34:39,359
is that in this multi-computation setup
 

8935
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:41,030
is that in this multi-computation setup
that it's this idea of these multiple

8936
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:41,040
that it's this idea of these multiple
 

8937
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:43,270
that it's this idea of these multiple
threads of time and models that are

8938
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:43,280
threads of time and models that are
 

8939
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:46,710
threads of time and models that are
based on that and this is similar to

8940
02:34:46,710 --> 02:34:46,720
based on that and this is similar to
 

8941
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:47,830
based on that and this is similar to
what people think about in

8942
02:34:47,830 --> 02:34:47,840
what people think about in
 

8943
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:49,910
what people think about in
non-deterministic computation so you

8944
02:34:49,910 --> 02:34:49,920
non-deterministic computation so you
 

8945
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:51,590
non-deterministic computation so you
have a turing machine usually it has a

8946
02:34:51,590 --> 02:34:51,600
have a turing machine usually it has a
 

8947
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,190
have a turing machine usually it has a
definite state it follows another state

8948
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:53,200
definite state it follows another state
 

8949
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:55,190
definite state it follows another state
follows another state but typically what

8950
02:34:55,190 --> 02:34:55,200
follows another state but typically what
 

8951
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,550
follows another state but typically what
people have done when they thought about

8952
02:34:56,550 --> 02:34:56,560
people have done when they thought about
 

8953
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:58,389
people have done when they thought about
these kinds of things is they've said

8954
02:34:58,389 --> 02:34:58,399
these kinds of things is they've said
 

8955
02:34:58,399 --> 02:34:59,830
these kinds of things is they've said
well there are all these possible paths

8956
02:34:59,830 --> 02:34:59,840
well there are all these possible paths
 

8957
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:01,670
well there are all these possible paths
a non-deterministic turing machine can

8958
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:01,680
a non-deterministic turing machine can
 

8959
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:03,590
a non-deterministic turing machine can
follow all these possible paths but we

8960
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:03,600
follow all these possible paths but we
 

8961
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,030
follow all these possible paths but we
just want one of them we just want the

8962
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:05,040
just want one of them we just want the
 

8963
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:06,950
just want one of them we just want the
one that's the winner that factors the

and similarly you know it's the same
 

8969
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,910
and similarly you know it's the same

we say we've got this goal find us a
 

8973
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,230
we say we've got this goal find us a
path to that goal i just want one path

02:35:23,349 --> 02:35:23,359
what's happening in multi-computation in
 

8983
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:24,389
what's happening in multi-computation in

physics
 

8985
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:26,950

is we actually care about many parts
 

8987
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:28,950
is we actually care about many parts
and well there is a case for example

02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:28,960
and well there is a case for example
 

8989
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:30,870

probabilistic programming is a version
 

8991
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:32,309
probabilistic programming is a version
of multi-computation in which you're

8992
02:35:32,309 --> 02:35:32,319
of multi-computation in which you're
 

8993
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:33,990
of multi-computation in which you're
looking at all the paths you're just

looking at all the paths you're just
 

8995
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,469
looking at all the paths you're just
asking for probabilities of things um

8996
02:35:36,469 --> 02:35:36,479
asking for probabilities of things um
 

8997
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:38,550
asking for probabilities of things um
but in a sense in physics we're taking

8998
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:38,560
but in a sense in physics we're taking
 

8999
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:40,790
but in a sense in physics we're taking
different kinds of samplings for example

9000
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:40,800
different kinds of samplings for example
 

9001
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:42,070
different kinds of samplings for example
in quantum mechanics we're taking a

9002
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,080
in quantum mechanics we're taking a
 

9003
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:44,230
in quantum mechanics we're taking a
different kind of sampling of all these

9004
02:35:44,230 --> 02:35:44,240
different kind of sampling of all these
 

9005
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:45,750

02:35:48,630 --> 02:35:48,640
and but the thing that is notable is
 

9009
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:50,630
and but the thing that is notable is
that when you are when you're an

02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:42,640
which means that observer observes
 

9123
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:45,349
which means that observer observes
comparatively simple laws and i think it

9124
02:37:45,349 --> 02:37:45,359
comparatively simple laws and i think it
 

9125
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:47,349
comparatively simple laws and i think it
is inevitable that that observer

9126
02:37:47,349 --> 02:37:47,359
is inevitable that that observer
 

9127
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:49,670
is inevitable that that observer
observes laws which are mathematically

9128
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:49,680
observes laws which are mathematically
 

9129
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:51,429
observes laws which are mathematically
structured like general relativity and

9130
02:37:51,429 --> 02:37:51,439
structured like general relativity and
 

9131
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:53,349
structured like general relativity and
quantum mechanics which by the way are

9132
02:37:53,349 --> 02:37:53,359
quantum mechanics which by the way are
 

9133
02:37:53,359 --> 02:37:55,429
quantum mechanics which by the way are
the same law in our in our model of

9134
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
the same law in our in our model of
 

9135
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:57,349
the same law in our in our model of
physics so that's an explanation why

9136
02:37:57,349 --> 02:37:57,359
physics so that's an explanation why
 

9137
02:37:57,359 --> 02:38:00,230
physics so that's an explanation why
there are simple laws that explain a lot

9138
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:00,240
there are simple laws that explain a lot
 

9139
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:02,870
there are simple laws that explain a lot
for this observer potentially yes but

9140
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:02,880
for this observer potentially yes but
 

9141
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:04,950
for this observer potentially yes but
the the place where this gets really

9142
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960
the the place where this gets really
 

9143
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,950
the the place where this gets really
interesting is

9144
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:06,960
interesting is
 

9145
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:09,030
interesting is
there are all these fields of science

9146
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:09,040
there are all these fields of science
 

9147
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:10,710
there are all these fields of science
where people have kind of gotten stuck

9148
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:10,720
where people have kind of gotten stuck
 

9149
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:12,389
where people have kind of gotten stuck
where they say we'd really love to have

9150
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:12,399
where they say we'd really love to have
 

9151
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:14,790
where they say we'd really love to have
a physics-like theory of economics we'd

9152
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:14,800
a physics-like theory of economics we'd
 

9153
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,469
a physics-like theory of economics we'd
really love to have a physics like lore

9154
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:16,479
really love to have a physics like lore
 

9155
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:17,910
really love to have a physics like lore
in linguistics

9156
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:17,920
in linguistics
 

9157
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:19,990
in linguistics
we gotta talk about molecular biology

9158
02:38:19,990 --> 02:38:20,000
we gotta talk about molecular biology
 

9159
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,230
we gotta talk about molecular biology
here okay so what where where does

9160
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:22,240
here okay so what where where does
 

9161
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:24,389
here okay so what where where does
multi-computation come in for biology

9162
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:24,399
multi-computation come in for biology
 

9163
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:26,070
multi-computation come in for biology
economics is super interesting too but

9164
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:26,080
economics is super interesting too but
 

9165
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,670
economics is super interesting too but
biology okay let's talk about that so

9166
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:27,680
biology okay let's talk about that so
 

9167
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:29,429
biology okay let's talk about that so
let's talk about chemistry for a second

9168
02:38:29,429 --> 02:38:29,439
let's talk about chemistry for a second
 

9169
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:30,230
let's talk about chemistry for a second
okay

9170
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:30,240
okay
 

9171
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:32,630
okay
so i mean i have to say you know this is

9172
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:32,640
so i mean i have to say you know this is
 

9173
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:33,910
so i mean i have to say you know this is
it's such a weird business for me

9174
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:33,920
it's such a weird business for me
 

9175
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:35,030
it's such a weird business for me
because you know

9176
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:35,040
because you know
 

9177
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:36,950
because you know
they're these kind of paradigmatic ideas

9178
02:38:36,950 --> 02:38:36,960
they're these kind of paradigmatic ideas
 

9179
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:38,950
they're these kind of paradigmatic ideas
and then the actual applications and

9180
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:38,960
and then the actual applications and
 

9181
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:40,309
and then the actual applications and
it's like i've always said i i know

9182
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
it's like i've always said i i know
 

9183
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:41,590
it's like i've always said i i know
nothing about chemistry i learned all

9184
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600
nothing about chemistry i learned all
 

9185
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,110
nothing about chemistry i learned all
the chemistry i know you know the night

9186
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:43,120
the chemistry i know you know the night
 

9187
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:44,950
the chemistry i know you know the night
before some exam when i was 14 years old

9188
02:38:44,950 --> 02:38:44,960
before some exam when i was 14 years old
 

9189
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:46,469
before some exam when i was 14 years old
but yeah but i've actually learned a

9190
02:38:46,469 --> 02:38:46,479
but yeah but i've actually learned a
 

9191
02:38:46,479 --> 02:38:48,230
but yeah but i've actually learned a
bunch more chemistry and in in more from

9192
02:38:48,230 --> 02:38:48,240
bunch more chemistry and in in more from
 

9193
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:49,590
bunch more chemistry and in in more from
language these days we have really

9194
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:49,600
language these days we have really
 

9195
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,270
language these days we have really
pretty nice symbolic representation of

9196
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:51,280
pretty nice symbolic representation of
 

9197
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:53,349
pretty nice symbolic representation of
chemistry and in understanding the

9198
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
chemistry and in understanding the
 

9199
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:55,030
chemistry and in understanding the
design of that i've actually i think

9200
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:55,040
design of that i've actually i think
 

9201
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:56,469
design of that i've actually i think
learned a certain amount of chemistry

9202
02:38:56,469 --> 02:38:56,479
learned a certain amount of chemistry
 

9203
02:38:56,479 --> 02:38:57,830
learned a certain amount of chemistry
though if you quizzed me on sort of

9204
02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:57,840
though if you quizzed me on sort of
 

9205
02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:59,590
though if you quizzed me on sort of
basic high school chemistry i would

9206
02:38:59,590 --> 02:38:59,600
basic high school chemistry i would
 

9207
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,630
basic high school chemistry i would
probably totally fail but um uh but but

9208
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:02,640
probably totally fail but um uh but but
 

9209
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,710
probably totally fail but um uh but but
okay so what is chemistry i mean

9210
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:04,720
okay so what is chemistry i mean
 

9211
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:07,270
okay so what is chemistry i mean
chemistry is sort of a story of you know

9212
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:07,280
chemistry is sort of a story of you know
 

9213
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:09,750
chemistry is sort of a story of you know
chemical reactions are like you've got

9214
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:09,760
chemical reactions are like you've got
 

9215
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:11,030
chemical reactions are like you've got
this particular chemical it's

9216
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,040
this particular chemical it's
 

9217
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,270
this particular chemical it's
represented as some graph of you know

9218
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:13,280
represented as some graph of you know
 

9219
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,110
represented as some graph of you know
these are these are this configuration

9220
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,120
these are these are this configuration
 

9221
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:17,349
these are these are this configuration
of molecules with these bonds and so on

9222
02:39:17,349 --> 02:39:17,359
of molecules with these bonds and so on
 

9223
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:19,670
of molecules with these bonds and so on
and a chemical reaction happens you've

9224
02:39:19,670 --> 02:39:19,680
and a chemical reaction happens you've
 

9225
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:21,670
and a chemical reaction happens you've
got these sort of two graphs they

9226
02:39:21,670 --> 02:39:21,680
got these sort of two graphs they
 

9227
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,030
got these sort of two graphs they
interact in some way you get another

9228
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:23,040
interact in some way you get another
 

9229
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:24,870
interact in some way you get another
graph or multiple other graphs out so

9230
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:24,880
graph or multiple other graphs out so
 

9231
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:27,110
graph or multiple other graphs out so
that's kind of the the the the sort of

9232
02:39:27,110 --> 02:39:27,120
that's kind of the the the the sort of
 

9233
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:29,030
that's kind of the the the the sort of
the the abstract view of what's

9234
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:29,040
the the abstract view of what's
 

9235
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:31,429
the the abstract view of what's
happening in chemistry and so when you

9236
02:39:31,429 --> 02:39:31,439
happening in chemistry and so when you
 

9237
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:33,830
happening in chemistry and so when you
do a chemical synthesis for example you

9238
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:33,840
do a chemical synthesis for example you
 

9239
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,910
do a chemical synthesis for example you
are given certain sort of these are

9240
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:35,920
are given certain sort of these are
 

9241
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:38,150
are given certain sort of these are
possible reactions that can happen and

9242
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,160
possible reactions that can happen and
 

9243
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,389
possible reactions that can happen and
you're asked can you piece together this

9244
02:39:40,389 --> 02:39:40,399
you're asked can you piece together this
 

9245
02:39:40,399 --> 02:39:42,389
you're asked can you piece together this
a sequence of such reactions a sequence

9246
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:42,399
a sequence of such reactions a sequence
 

9247
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:44,469
a sequence of such reactions a sequence
of such sort of axiomatic reactions

9248
02:39:44,469 --> 02:39:44,479
of such sort of axiomatic reactions
 

9249
02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:45,670
of such sort of axiomatic reactions
usually called name reactions in

9250
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:45,680
usually called name reactions in
 

9251
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:47,510
usually called name reactions in
chemistry can you piece together a

9252
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:47,520
chemistry can you piece together a
 

9253
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:50,070
chemistry can you piece together a
sequence of these reactions so that you

9254
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,080
sequence of these reactions so that you
 

9255
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:52,389
sequence of these reactions so that you
get out at the end this great molecule

9256
02:39:52,389 --> 02:39:52,399
get out at the end this great molecule
 

9257
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:54,070
get out at the end this great molecule
you were trying to synthesize and so

9258
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:54,080
you were trying to synthesize and so
 

9259
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:55,510
you were trying to synthesize and so
that's a story very much like theorem

9260
02:39:55,510 --> 02:39:55,520
that's a story very much like theorem
 

9261
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,990
that's a story very much like theorem
proving and people have done

9262
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,000
proving and people have done
 

9263
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,670
proving and people have done
actually they started in the 1960s

9264
02:39:59,670 --> 02:39:59,680
actually they started in the 1960s
 

9265
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,590
actually they started in the 1960s
looking at at kind of the theorem

9266
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:01,600
looking at at kind of the theorem
 

9267
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:02,870
looking at at kind of the theorem
proving approach to that although it

9268
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:02,880
proving approach to that although it
 

9269
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:05,110
proving approach to that although it
didn't really it didn't it didn't uh was

9270
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:05,120
didn't really it didn't it didn't uh was
 

9271
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:07,590
didn't really it didn't it didn't uh was
sort of done too early i think um but

9272
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:07,600
sort of done too early i think um but
 

9273
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:09,030
sort of done too early i think um but
anyway so that's kind of the view is

9274
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:09,040
anyway so that's kind of the view is
 

9275
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,870
anyway so that's kind of the view is
that that chemistry chemical reactions

9276
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:10,880
that that chemistry chemical reactions
 

9277
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:12,950
that that chemistry chemical reactions
are the story of of all these different

9278
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:12,960
are the story of of all these different
 

9279
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,750
are the story of of all these different
sort of paths of possible things that go

9280
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:15,760
sort of paths of possible things that go
 

9281
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:17,670
sort of paths of possible things that go
on okay let's let's go to an even lower

9282
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:17,680
on okay let's let's go to an even lower
 

9283
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:21,030
on okay let's let's go to an even lower
level let's say instead of asking about

9284
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:21,040
level let's say instead of asking about
 

9285
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:23,590
level let's say instead of asking about
uh which species of molecules we're

9286
02:40:23,590 --> 02:40:23,600
uh which species of molecules we're
 

9287
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,030
uh which species of molecules we're
talking about let's look at individual

9288
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:25,040
talking about let's look at individual
 

9289
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,030
talking about let's look at individual
molecules and let's say we're looking at

9290
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:27,040
molecules and let's say we're looking at
 

9291
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,030
molecules and let's say we're looking at
individual molecules and they are having

9292
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:29,040
individual molecules and they are having
 

9293
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,030
individual molecules and they are having
chemical reactions and we're building up

9294
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:31,040
chemical reactions and we're building up
 

9295
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:32,790
chemical reactions and we're building up
this big graph of all these reactions

9296
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:32,800
this big graph of all these reactions
 

9297
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:35,429
this big graph of all these reactions
that are happening okay so so then we've

9298
02:40:35,429 --> 02:40:35,439
that are happening okay so so then we've
 

9299
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:37,190
that are happening okay so so then we've
got this big graph and by the way that

9300
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,200
got this big graph and by the way that
 

9301
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:40,389
got this big graph and by the way that
big graph is incredibly similar to these

9302
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
big graph is incredibly similar to these
 

9303
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:43,349
big graph is incredibly similar to these
hypergraph rewriting things um in fact

9304
02:40:43,349 --> 02:40:43,359
hypergraph rewriting things um in fact
 

9305
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:44,790
hypergraph rewriting things um in fact
in the underlying theory of

9306
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:44,800
in the underlying theory of
 

9307
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,309
in the underlying theory of
multi-computation there are these things

9308
02:40:46,309 --> 02:40:46,319
multi-computation there are these things
 

9309
02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:48,469
multi-computation there are these things
we call token event graphs which are

9310
02:40:48,469 --> 02:40:48,479
we call token event graphs which are
 

9311
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:51,190
we call token event graphs which are
basically you've broken your state into

9312
02:40:51,190 --> 02:40:51,200
basically you've broken your state into
 

9313
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:53,190
basically you've broken your state into
tokens like in the case of a hypergraph

9314
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:53,200
tokens like in the case of a hypergraph
 

9315
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:55,190
tokens like in the case of a hypergraph
you've broken it into hyperedges and

9316
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
you've broken it into hyperedges and
 

9317
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:57,349
you've broken it into hyperedges and
each event is just consuming some number

9318
02:40:57,349 --> 02:40:57,359
each event is just consuming some number
 

9319
02:40:57,359 --> 02:40:59,429
each event is just consuming some number
of tokens and producing some number of

9320
02:40:59,429 --> 02:40:59,439
of tokens and producing some number of
 

9321
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:01,349
of tokens and producing some number of
tokens yeah but then you have to there's

9322
02:41:01,349 --> 02:41:01,359
tokens yeah but then you have to there's
 

9323
02:41:01,359 --> 02:41:04,469
tokens yeah but then you have to there's
a lot of work to be done on update rules

9324
02:41:04,469 --> 02:41:04,479
a lot of work to be done on update rules
 

9325
02:41:04,479 --> 02:41:05,990
a lot of work to be done on update rules
in terms of what they actually are for

9326
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:06,000
in terms of what they actually are for
 

9327
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,469
in terms of what they actually are for
chemistry yeah what they are for our

9328
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:08,479
chemistry yeah what they are for our
 

9329
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:11,110
chemistry yeah what they are for our
observed chemistry yes indeed yes indeed

9330
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:11,120
observed chemistry yes indeed yes indeed
 

9331
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:12,550
observed chemistry yes indeed yes indeed
we've been working on that actually

9332
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:12,560
we've been working on that actually
 

9333
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:14,469
we've been working on that actually
because we have this beautiful system in

9334
02:41:14,469 --> 02:41:14,479
because we have this beautiful system in
 

9335
02:41:14,479 --> 02:41:16,150
because we have this beautiful system in
wolfram language for representing

9336
02:41:16,150 --> 02:41:16,160
wolfram language for representing
 

9337
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:17,670
wolfram language for representing
chemistry symbolically so we actually

9338
02:41:17,670 --> 02:41:17,680
chemistry symbolically so we actually
 

9339
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:19,510
chemistry symbolically so we actually
have you know this is a this is an

9340
02:41:19,510 --> 02:41:19,520
have you know this is a this is an
 

9341
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:20,790
have you know this is a this is an
ongoing thing to actually figure out

9342
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:20,800
ongoing thing to actually figure out
 

9343
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:22,630
ongoing thing to actually figure out
what they are for some practical cases

9344
02:41:22,630 --> 02:41:22,640
what they are for some practical cases
 

9345
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:24,950
what they are for some practical cases
does that require human injection or can

9346
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:24,960
does that require human injection or can
 

9347
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:27,030
does that require human injection or can
it be automatically discovered

9348
02:41:27,030 --> 02:41:27,040
it be automatically discovered
 

9349
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,510
it be automatically discovered
these update rules well if we implement

9350
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:29,520
these update rules well if we implement
 

9351
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:30,630
these update rules well if we implement
chemistry better we could probably

9352
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:30,640
chemistry better we could probably
 

9353
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:31,910
chemistry better we could probably
discover them automatically but i think

9354
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:31,920
discover them automatically but i think
 

9355
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:34,950
discover them automatically but i think
in in reality right now it's like there

9356
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:34,960
in in reality right now it's like there
 

9357
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:36,630
in in reality right now it's like there
are these particular reactions and

9358
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,640
are these particular reactions and
 

9359
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,389
are these particular reactions and
really to understand what's going on

9360
02:41:38,389 --> 02:41:38,399
really to understand what's going on
 

9361
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:39,349
really to understand what's going on
we're probably going to pick a

9362
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,359
we're probably going to pick a
 

9363
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:42,230
we're probably going to pick a
particular subtype of chemistry and just

9364
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:42,240
particular subtype of chemistry and just
 

9365
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,510
particular subtype of chemistry and just
because because let me explain where

9366
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:43,520
because because let me explain where
 

9367
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:44,550
because because let me explain where
this is going

9368
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:44,560
this is going
 

9369
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:46,630
this is going
the place that here's here's where this

9370
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:46,640
the place that here's here's where this
 

9371
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:48,550
the place that here's here's where this
is going so

9372
02:41:48,550 --> 02:41:48,560
is going so
 

9373
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:50,150
is going so
we got this whole network of all these

9374
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,160
we got this whole network of all these
 

9375
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,070
we got this whole network of all these
molecules having all these reactions and

9376
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:52,080
molecules having all these reactions and
 

9377
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:53,030
molecules having all these reactions and
so on

9378
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
so on
 

9379
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,389
so on
and this is some whole

9380
02:41:54,389 --> 02:41:54,399
and this is some whole
 

9381
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:57,269
and this is some whole
multi-computational story because each

9382
02:41:57,269 --> 02:41:57,279
multi-computational story because each
 

9383
02:41:57,279 --> 02:41:58,710
multi-computational story because each
each uh

9384
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:58,720
each uh
 

9385
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:01,110
each uh
sort of chemical reaction event is its

9386
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:01,120
sort of chemical reaction event is its
 

9387
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:02,550
sort of chemical reaction event is its
own separate event where we're saying

9388
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:02,560
own separate event where we're saying
 

9389
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:04,150
own separate event where we're saying
they all happen asynchronously we're not

9390
02:42:04,150 --> 02:42:04,160
they all happen asynchronously we're not
 

9391
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,550
they all happen asynchronously we're not
describing in what order they happen you

9392
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:06,560
describing in what order they happen you
 

9393
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:08,070
describing in what order they happen you
know maybe that order is governed by

9394
02:42:08,070 --> 02:42:08,080
know maybe that order is governed by
 

9395
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:09,750
know maybe that order is governed by
some quantum mechanics thing doesn't

9396
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:09,760
some quantum mechanics thing doesn't
 

9397
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,349
some quantum mechanics thing doesn't
really matter we're just saying they

9398
02:42:11,349 --> 02:42:11,359
really matter we're just saying they
 

9399
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:13,910
really matter we're just saying they
happen in some order and then we ask

9400
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:13,920
happen in some order and then we ask
 

9401
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:16,150
happen in some order and then we ask
what is the what what's the you know how

9402
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:16,160
what is the what what's the you know how
 

9403
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:18,309
what is the what what's the you know how
do we think about the system well

9404
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:18,319
do we think about the system well
 

9405
02:42:18,319 --> 02:42:20,150
do we think about the system well
this thing is some kind of big

9406
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:20,160
this thing is some kind of big
 

9407
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:21,910
this thing is some kind of big
multi-computational system the question

9408
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:21,920
multi-computational system the question
 

9409
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,990
multi-computational system the question
is what is the chemical observer

9410
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
is what is the chemical observer
 

9411
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,309
is what is the chemical observer
and one possible chemical observer is

9412
02:42:26,309 --> 02:42:26,319
and one possible chemical observer is
 

9413
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:27,910
and one possible chemical observer is
all you care about is did you make that

9414
02:42:27,910 --> 02:42:27,920
all you care about is did you make that
 

9415
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:29,830
all you care about is did you make that
particular drug molecule you're just

9416
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:29,840
particular drug molecule you're just
 

9417
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,670
particular drug molecule you're just
asking you know the for the one path

9418
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:31,680
asking you know the for the one path
 

9419
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,510
asking you know the for the one path
another thing you might care about is i

9420
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:33,520
another thing you might care about is i
 

9421
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,190
another thing you might care about is i
want to know the concentration of each

9422
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:35,200
want to know the concentration of each
 

9423
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,469
want to know the concentration of each
species

9424
02:42:36,469 --> 02:42:36,479
species
 

9425
02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:38,950
species
right i want to know you know at every

9426
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:38,960
right i want to know you know at every
 

9427
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:39,990
right i want to know you know at every
stage i'm going to solve the

9428
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,000
stage i'm going to solve the
 

9429
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,429
stage i'm going to solve the
differential equations that represent

9430
02:42:41,429 --> 02:42:41,439
differential equations that represent
 

9431
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:42,950
differential equations that represent
the concentrations and i want to know

9432
02:42:42,950 --> 02:42:42,960
the concentrations and i want to know
 

9433
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:45,190
the concentrations and i want to know
what those all are but there's more

9434
02:42:45,190 --> 02:42:45,200
what those all are but there's more
 

9435
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:47,429
what those all are but there's more
because when and it's kind of like

9436
02:42:47,429 --> 02:42:47,439
because when and it's kind of like
 

9437
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:49,269
because when and it's kind of like
you're going below in statistical

9438
02:42:49,269 --> 02:42:49,279
you're going below in statistical
 

9439
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:51,110
you're going below in statistical
mechanics there's kind of all these

9440
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:51,120
mechanics there's kind of all these
 

9441
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,990
mechanics there's kind of all these
molecules bouncing around and you might

9442
02:42:53,990 --> 02:42:54,000
molecules bouncing around and you might
 

9443
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:54,950
molecules bouncing around and you might
say

9444
02:42:54,950 --> 02:42:54,960
say
 

9445
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,309
say
we're just going to ignore we're just

9446
02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:56,319
we're just going to ignore we're just
 

9447
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:58,309
we're just going to ignore we're just
going to look at the aggregate

9448
02:42:58,309 --> 02:42:58,319
going to look at the aggregate
 

9449
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:00,070
going to look at the aggregate
densities of certain kinds of molecules

9450
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:00,080
densities of certain kinds of molecules
 

9451
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:01,590
densities of certain kinds of molecules
but you can look at a lower level you

9452
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:01,600
but you can look at a lower level you
 

9453
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:03,750
but you can look at a lower level you
can look at this whole graph of possible

9454
02:43:03,750 --> 02:43:03,760
can look at this whole graph of possible
 

9455
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,469
can look at this whole graph of possible
interactions and so the kind of the idea

9456
02:43:06,469 --> 02:43:06,479
interactions and so the kind of the idea
 

9457
02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:07,429
interactions and so the kind of the idea
would be

9458
02:43:07,429 --> 02:43:07,439
would be
 

9459
02:43:07,439 --> 02:43:09,510
would be
what you know is the only chemical

9460
02:43:09,510 --> 02:43:09,520
what you know is the only chemical
 

9461
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:10,630
what you know is the only chemical
observer

9462
02:43:10,630 --> 02:43:10,640
observer
 

9463
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:12,070
observer
one who just cares about overall

9464
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:12,080
one who just cares about overall
 

9465
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:14,070
one who just cares about overall
concentrations or can there be a

9466
02:43:14,070 --> 02:43:14,080
concentrations or can there be a
 

9467
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,150
concentrations or can there be a
chemical observer who cares about this

9468
02:43:16,150 --> 02:43:16,160
chemical observer who cares about this
 

9469
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:19,429
chemical observer who cares about this
network of what happened and so that

9470
02:43:19,429 --> 02:43:19,439
network of what happened and so that
 

9471
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:21,269
network of what happened and so that
the question then is so let me give an

9472
02:43:21,269 --> 02:43:21,279
the question then is so let me give an
 

9473
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:23,349
the question then is so let me give an
analogy so this is where i think this is

9474
02:43:23,349 --> 02:43:23,359
analogy so this is where i think this is
 

9475
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:25,110
analogy so this is where i think this is
potentially very relevant to molecular

9476
02:43:25,110 --> 02:43:25,120
potentially very relevant to molecular
 

9477
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,630
potentially very relevant to molecular

02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
uh when we think about a computation
 

9483
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:32,870
uh when we think about a computation
usually we say it's input it's output we

02:43:32,870 --> 02:43:32,880
usually we say it's input it's output we
 

9485
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:34,710
usually we say it's input it's output we

02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:37,910
this input we're going to make this
molecule as the output

there's some dynamics of the network
that we care about now imagine you're a

that we care about now imagine you're a
 

9509
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,190
that we care about now imagine you're a
chemical observer what is a chemical

9510
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:55,200
chemical observer what is a chemical
 

9511
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:58,150
chemical observer what is a chemical
observer well in molecular biology there

observer well in molecular biology there
 

9513
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,150
observer well in molecular biology there
are all kinds of weird sorts of

are all kinds of weird sorts of
 

9515
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,630
are all kinds of weird sorts of

02:44:04,150 --> 02:44:04,160
that have you know different kinds of

02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:06,150
that have you know different kinds of
molecules that can bind to them things

molecules that can bind to them things
 

9521
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:09,030
molecules that can bind to them things
like this it's not obvious that the from

9522
02:44:09,030 --> 02:44:09,040
like this it's not obvious that the from
 

9523
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:10,870
like this it's not obvious that the from
a human scale we just measure the

9524
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:10,880
a human scale we just measure the
 

9525
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,710
a human scale we just measure the
concentration of something is the

9526
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:12,720
concentration of something is the
 

9527
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:15,349
concentration of something is the
relevant story we can imagine that for

9528
02:44:15,349 --> 02:44:15,359
relevant story we can imagine that for
 

9529
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:16,710
relevant story we can imagine that for
example when we look at this whole

9530
02:44:16,710 --> 02:44:16,720
example when we look at this whole
 

9531
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:18,469
example when we look at this whole
network of possible reactions

9532
02:44:18,469 --> 02:44:18,479
network of possible reactions
 

9533
02:44:18,479 --> 02:44:20,150
network of possible reactions
we can imagine you know at a physical

9534
02:44:20,150 --> 02:44:20,160
we can imagine you know at a physical
 

9535
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:21,830
we can imagine you know at a physical
level we can imagine well what was the

9536
02:44:21,830 --> 02:44:21,840
level we can imagine well what was the
 

9537
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,590
level we can imagine well what was the
actual momentum direction of that of

9538
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:23,600
actual momentum direction of that of
 

9539
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,670
actual momentum direction of that of
that molecule what was it which we don't

9540
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:25,680
that molecule what was it which we don't
 

9541
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:27,030
that molecule what was it which we don't
pay any attention to when we were just

9542
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:27,040
pay any attention to when we were just
 

9543
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,870
pay any attention to when we were just
talking about chemical concentrations

9544
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:28,880
talking about chemical concentrations
 

9545
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:30,230
talking about chemical concentrations
what was the orientation of that

9546
02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:30,240
what was the orientation of that
 

9547
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:32,469
what was the orientation of that
molecule these kinds of things

9548
02:44:32,469 --> 02:44:32,479
molecule these kinds of things
 

9549
02:44:32,479 --> 02:44:34,630
molecule these kinds of things
and so here's here's the place where i'm

9550
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:34,640
and so here's here's the place where i'm
 

9551
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,110
and so here's here's the place where i'm
i have a little suspicion okay so one of

9552
02:44:37,110 --> 02:44:37,120
i have a little suspicion okay so one of
 

9553
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:39,349
i have a little suspicion okay so one of
the questions in biology is what matters

9554
02:44:39,349 --> 02:44:39,359
the questions in biology is what matters
 

9555
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:40,550
the questions in biology is what matters
in biology

9556
02:44:40,550 --> 02:44:40,560
in biology
 

9557
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:41,830
in biology
and that is you know we have all these

9558
02:44:41,830 --> 02:44:41,840
and that is you know we have all these
 

9559
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:43,830
and that is you know we have all these
chemical reactions we have all these all

9560
02:44:43,830 --> 02:44:43,840
chemical reactions we have all these all
 

9561
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:46,389
chemical reactions we have all these all
these molecular processes going on in

9562
02:44:46,389 --> 02:44:46,399
these molecular processes going on in
 

9563
02:44:46,399 --> 02:44:48,389
these molecular processes going on in
you know in biological systems what

9564
02:44:48,389 --> 02:44:48,399
you know in biological systems what
 

9565
02:44:48,399 --> 02:44:49,590
you know in biological systems what
matters

9566
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:49,600
matters
 

9567
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,230
matters
and you know one of the things is to be

9568
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:52,240
and you know one of the things is to be
 

9569
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:54,870
and you know one of the things is to be
able to tell what matters well so a big

9570
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:54,880
able to tell what matters well so a big
 

9571
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,469
able to tell what matters well so a big
story of the what mata's question was

9572
02:44:56,469 --> 02:44:56,479
story of the what mata's question was
 

9573
02:44:56,479 --> 02:44:58,790
story of the what mata's question was
what happened in genetics in 1953 when

9574
02:44:58,790 --> 02:44:58,800
what happened in genetics in 1953 when
 

9575
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:01,670
what happened in genetics in 1953 when
dna was figured out how dna worked

9576
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:01,680
dna was figured out how dna worked
 

9577
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:03,110
dna was figured out how dna worked
because before that time you know

9578
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
because before that time you know
 

9579
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:04,469
because before that time you know
genetics have been all these different

9580
02:45:04,469 --> 02:45:04,479
genetics have been all these different
 

9581
02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:06,469
genetics have been all these different
effects and complicated things and then

9582
02:45:06,469 --> 02:45:06,479
effects and complicated things and then
 

9583
02:45:06,479 --> 02:45:09,030
effects and complicated things and then
it was realized ah there's something new

9584
02:45:09,030 --> 02:45:09,040
it was realized ah there's something new
 

9585
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:11,269
it was realized ah there's something new
a molecule can store information which

9586
02:45:11,269 --> 02:45:11,279
a molecule can store information which
 

9587
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:13,429
a molecule can store information which
wasn't obvious before that time a single

9588
02:45:13,429 --> 02:45:13,439
wasn't obvious before that time a single
 

9589
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:14,950
wasn't obvious before that time a single
molecule can store information so

9590
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:14,960
molecule can store information so
 

9591
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:16,710
molecule can store information so
there's a place where there can be

9592
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:16,720
there's a place where there can be
 

9593
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:18,550
there's a place where there can be
something important that's happening in

9594
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:18,560
something important that's happening in
 

9595
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:20,870
something important that's happening in
molecular biology and it's just in the

9596
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
molecular biology and it's just in the
 

9597
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:22,389
molecular biology and it's just in the
sequence that's storing information in a

9598
02:45:22,389 --> 02:45:22,399
sequence that's storing information in a
 

9599
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:23,349
sequence that's storing information in a
molecule

9600
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:23,359
molecule
 

9601
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:26,309
molecule
so the possibility now is imagine this

9602
02:45:26,309 --> 02:45:26,319
so the possibility now is imagine this
 

9603
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:29,190
so the possibility now is imagine this
dynamic network this uh you know causal

9604
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,200
dynamic network this uh you know causal
 

9605
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,190
dynamic network this uh you know causal
graphs and multi-way causal graphs and

9606
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:31,200
graphs and multi-way causal graphs and
 

9607
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:33,269
graphs and multi-way causal graphs and
so on that represent all of these

9608
02:45:33,269 --> 02:45:33,279
so on that represent all of these
 

9609
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:35,110
so on that represent all of these
different reactions between molecules

9610
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:35,120
different reactions between molecules
 

9611
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:37,269
different reactions between molecules
what if there is some aspect of that

9612
02:45:37,269 --> 02:45:37,279
what if there is some aspect of that
 

9613
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:39,030
what if there is some aspect of that
that is storing information that's

9614
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
that is storing information that's
 

9615
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,030
that is storing information that's
relevant for molecular biology

9616
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,040
relevant for molecular biology
 

9617
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,269
relevant for molecular biology
in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's

9618
02:45:43,269 --> 02:45:43,279
in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's
 

9619
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:45,510
in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's
right so that it's similar to how the

9620
02:45:45,510 --> 02:45:45,520
right so that it's similar to how the
 

9621
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:48,230
right so that it's similar to how the
structure of a dna molecule

9622
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:48,240
structure of a dna molecule
 

9623
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:49,750
structure of a dna molecule
stores information it could be the

9624
02:45:49,750 --> 02:45:49,760
stores information it could be the
 

9625
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:51,830
stores information it could be the
dynamics of the system somehow stores

9626
02:45:51,830 --> 02:45:51,840
dynamics of the system somehow stores
 

9627
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:53,590
dynamics of the system somehow stores
information and this

9628
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:53,600
information and this
 

9629
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:56,309
information and this
kind of process might allow you to give

9630
02:45:56,309 --> 02:45:56,319
kind of process might allow you to give
 

9631
02:45:56,319 --> 02:45:58,790
kind of process might allow you to give
predictions of what that would be well

9632
02:45:58,790 --> 02:45:58,800
predictions of what that would be well
 

9633
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:00,950
predictions of what that would be well
yes but also imagine that you're trying

9634
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:00,960
yes but also imagine that you're trying
 

9635
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,070
yes but also imagine that you're trying
to do

9636
02:46:02,070 --> 02:46:02,080
to do
 

9637
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:03,990
to do
for example imagine you're trying to do

9638
02:46:03,990 --> 02:46:04,000
for example imagine you're trying to do
 

9639
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,790
for example imagine you're trying to do
molecular computation okay you might

9640
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:06,800
molecular computation okay you might
 

9641
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:07,830
molecular computation okay you might
think the way we're going to do

9642
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:07,840
think the way we're going to do
 

9643
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:09,670
think the way we're going to do
molecular computation is we're just

9644
02:46:09,670 --> 02:46:09,680
molecular computation is we're just
 

9645
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:10,630
molecular computation is we're just
going to run the thing we're going to

9646
02:46:10,630 --> 02:46:10,640
going to run the thing we're going to
 

9647
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,750
going to run the thing we're going to
see what came out we're going to see

9648
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:11,760
see what came out we're going to see
 

9649
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,429
see what came out we're going to see
what molecule came out

9650
02:46:13,429 --> 02:46:13,439
what molecule came out
 

9651
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:15,190
what molecule came out
this is saying that's not the only thing

9652
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:15,200
this is saying that's not the only thing
 

9653
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:17,349
this is saying that's not the only thing
you can do there is a different kind of

9654
02:46:17,349 --> 02:46:17,359
you can do there is a different kind of
 

9655
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:18,950
you can do there is a different kind of
chemical observer that you can imagine

9656
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
chemical observer that you can imagine
 

9657
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,910
chemical observer that you can imagine
constructing which is somehow sensitive

9658
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:21,920
constructing which is somehow sensitive
 

9659
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:24,309
constructing which is somehow sensitive
to this dynamic network exactly how that

9660
02:46:24,309 --> 02:46:24,319
to this dynamic network exactly how that
 

9661
02:46:24,319 --> 02:46:25,670
to this dynamic network exactly how that
works how we make that measurement i

9662
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:25,680
works how we make that measurement i
 

9663
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:28,070
works how we make that measurement i
don't know but i have a few ideas but

9664
02:46:28,070 --> 02:46:28,080
don't know but i have a few ideas but
 

9665
02:46:28,080 --> 02:46:30,710
don't know but i have a few ideas but
but um that that's what's important so

9666
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:30,720
but um that that's what's important so
 

9667
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:32,630
but um that that's what's important so
to speak and that that means and by the

9668
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:32,640
to speak and that that means and by the
 

9669
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,990
to speak and that that means and by the
way you can do the same thing even for

9670
02:46:33,990 --> 02:46:34,000
way you can do the same thing even for
 

9671
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,309
way you can do the same thing even for
touring machines you can say if you have

9672
02:46:36,309 --> 02:46:36,319
touring machines you can say if you have
 

9673
02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:39,030
touring machines you can say if you have
a multi-way turing machine you can say

9674
02:46:39,030 --> 02:46:39,040
a multi-way turing machine you can say
 

9675
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:40,550
a multi-way turing machine you can say
how do you compute with a multi-way

9676
02:46:40,550 --> 02:46:40,560
how do you compute with a multi-way
 

9677
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,389
how do you compute with a multi-way
turing machine you cut you can't say

9678
02:46:42,389 --> 02:46:42,399
turing machine you cut you can't say
 

9679
02:46:42,399 --> 02:46:43,670
turing machine you cut you can't say
well we've got this input and this

9680
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:43,680
well we've got this input and this
 

9681
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:45,670
well we've got this input and this
output because the thing has all these

9682
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:45,680
output because the thing has all these
 

9683
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:47,269
output because the thing has all these
threads of time and it's got lots of

9684
02:46:47,269 --> 02:46:47,279
threads of time and it's got lots of
 

9685
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:49,190
threads of time and it's got lots of
outputs and so then you say well what

9686
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:49,200
outputs and so then you say well what
 

9687
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:50,950
outputs and so then you say well what
does it even mean to be a universal

9688
02:46:50,950 --> 02:46:50,960
does it even mean to be a universal
 

9689
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,870
does it even mean to be a universal
multi-way touring machine i don't fully

9690
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880
multi-way touring machine i don't fully
 

9691
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,710
multi-way touring machine i don't fully
know the answer to that but it has an

9692
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:54,720
know the answer to that but it has an
 

9693
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:57,190
know the answer to that but it has an
interesting idea freak touring out for

9694
02:46:57,190 --> 02:46:57,200
interesting idea freak touring out for
 

9695
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:58,070
interesting idea freak touring out for
sure

9696
02:46:58,070 --> 02:46:58,080
sure
 

9697
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:00,630
sure
because then uh the dynamics of the the

9698
02:47:00,630 --> 02:47:00,640
because then uh the dynamics of the the
 

9699
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:02,870
because then uh the dynamics of the the
trajectory of the computation matters

9700
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:02,880
trajectory of the computation matters
 

9701
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:06,070
trajectory of the computation matters
yes yes i mean but but the thing is that

9702
02:47:06,070 --> 02:47:06,080
yes yes i mean but but the thing is that
 

9703
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:08,230
yes yes i mean but but the thing is that
that so this is again a story of what's

9704
02:47:08,230 --> 02:47:08,240
that so this is again a story of what's
 

9705
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:09,990
that so this is again a story of what's
the observer so to speak in chemistry

9706
02:47:09,990 --> 02:47:10,000
the observer so to speak in chemistry
 

9707
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,910
the observer so to speak in chemistry
what's what's the observer there now to

9708
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:11,920
what's what's the observer there now to
 

9709
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:13,830
what's what's the observer there now to
give an example of of where that might

9710
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:13,840
give an example of of where that might
 

9711
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:16,950
give an example of of where that might
matter a very uh sort of uh present day

9712
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:16,960
matter a very uh sort of uh present day
 

9713
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:20,389
matter a very uh sort of uh present day
example is in immunology um

9714
02:47:20,389 --> 02:47:20,399
example is in immunology um
 

9715
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:22,469
example is in immunology um
where you know we have whatever it is

9716
02:47:22,469 --> 02:47:22,479
where you know we have whatever it is
 

9717
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:23,830
where you know we have whatever it is
you know 10 billion different kinds of

9718
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:23,840
you know 10 billion different kinds of
 

9719
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:26,389
you know 10 billion different kinds of
antibodies that are you know all these

9720
02:47:26,389 --> 02:47:26,399
antibodies that are you know all these
 

9721
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:28,630
antibodies that are you know all these
different shapes and so on we have i'm a

9722
02:47:28,630 --> 02:47:28,640
different shapes and so on we have i'm a
 

9723
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:29,910
different shapes and so on we have i'm a
trillion different kinds of t cell

9724
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:29,920
trillion different kinds of t cell
 

9725
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:33,110
trillion different kinds of t cell
receptors that we can that we produce

9726
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
receptors that we can that we produce
 

9727
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,950
receptors that we can that we produce
and you know the the traditional theory

9728
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:34,960
and you know the the traditional theory
 

9729
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:37,670
and you know the the traditional theory
of immunology is this clonal selection

9730
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:37,680
of immunology is this clonal selection
 

9731
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:39,910
of immunology is this clonal selection
theory where we're constantly producing

9732
02:47:39,910 --> 02:47:39,920
theory where we're constantly producing
 

9733
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:41,510
theory where we're constantly producing
randomly producing all these different

9734
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:41,520
randomly producing all these different
 

9735
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:43,429
randomly producing all these different
antibodies and as soon as one of those

9736
02:47:43,429 --> 02:47:43,439
antibodies and as soon as one of those
 

9737
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:45,750
antibodies and as soon as one of those
binds to an antigen then that one gets

9738
02:47:45,750 --> 02:47:45,760
binds to an antigen then that one gets
 

9739
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:47,190
binds to an antigen then that one gets
amplified and we produce more of that

9740
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:47,200
amplified and we produce more of that
 

9741
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:48,790
amplified and we produce more of that
antibody and so on

9742
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:48,800
antibody and so on
 

9743
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:52,070
antibody and so on
um back in the 1960s um

9744
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:52,080
um back in the 1960s um
 

9745
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:53,830
um back in the 1960s um
immunologist called nilsiona who was the

9746
02:47:53,830 --> 02:47:53,840
immunologist called nilsiona who was the
 

9747
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,990
immunologist called nilsiona who was the
guy who invented monoclonal antibodies

9748
02:47:55,990 --> 02:47:56,000
guy who invented monoclonal antibodies
 

9749
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,550
guy who invented monoclonal antibodies
various other things um kind of had this

9750
02:47:58,550 --> 02:47:58,560
various other things um kind of had this
 

9751
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:00,150
various other things um kind of had this
network theory of the immune system

9752
02:48:00,150 --> 02:48:00,160
network theory of the immune system
 

9753
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:01,429
network theory of the immune system
where it would be like well we produce

9754
02:48:01,429 --> 02:48:01,439
where it would be like well we produce
 

9755
02:48:01,439 --> 02:48:02,389
where it would be like well we produce
antibodies

9756
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
antibodies
 

9757
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:04,469
antibodies
but then we produce antibodies to the

9758
02:48:04,469 --> 02:48:04,479
but then we produce antibodies to the
 

9759
02:48:04,479 --> 02:48:06,070
but then we produce antibodies to the
antibodies anti-antibodies and we

9760
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:06,080
antibodies anti-antibodies and we
 

9761
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:08,230
antibodies anti-antibodies and we
produce anti-anti-antibodies and we get

9762
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,240
produce anti-anti-antibodies and we get
 

9763
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:10,070
produce anti-anti-antibodies and we get
this whole dynamic network of

9764
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,080
this whole dynamic network of
 

9765
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:11,670
this whole dynamic network of
interactions between different immune

9766
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:11,680
interactions between different immune
 

9767
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:13,110
interactions between different immune
system cells

9768
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:13,120
system cells
 

9769
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:15,830
system cells
and that was that that was kind of a

9770
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
and that was that that was kind of a
 

9771
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,950
and that was that that was kind of a
qualitative theory at that time and it's

9772
02:48:18,950 --> 02:48:18,960
qualitative theory at that time and it's
 

9773
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:20,230
qualitative theory at that time and it's
i've been a little disappointed because

9774
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:20,240
i've been a little disappointed because
 

9775
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:21,590
i've been a little disappointed because
i've been studying immunology a bit

9776
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:21,600
i've been studying immunology a bit
 

9777
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:23,750
i've been studying immunology a bit
recently and i i knew something about

9778
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:23,760
recently and i i knew something about
 

9779
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,429
recently and i i knew something about
this like 35 years ago or something and

9780
02:48:25,429 --> 02:48:25,439
this like 35 years ago or something and
 

9781
02:48:25,439 --> 02:48:27,030
this like 35 years ago or something and
i knew you know i'd read a bunch of the

9782
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:27,040
i knew you know i'd read a bunch of the
 

9783
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:28,230
i knew you know i'd read a bunch of the
books and i talked to a bunch of the

9784
02:48:28,230 --> 02:48:28,240
books and i talked to a bunch of the
 

9785
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:30,710
books and i talked to a bunch of the
people and so on and it was like

9786
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:30,720
people and so on and it was like
 

9787
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:33,510
people and so on and it was like
an emerging theoretical immunology world

9788
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
an emerging theoretical immunology world
 

9789
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,429
an emerging theoretical immunology world
and then i look at the books now and

9790
02:48:35,429 --> 02:48:35,439
and then i look at the books now and
 

9791
02:48:35,439 --> 02:48:37,190
and then i look at the books now and
they're very thick because they've got

9792
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:37,200
they're very thick because they've got
 

9793
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:38,710
they're very thick because they've got
you know there's just a ton known about

9794
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:38,720
you know there's just a ton known about
 

9795
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:40,630
you know there's just a ton known about
immunology and you know all these

9796
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
immunology and you know all these
 

9797
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:42,150
immunology and you know all these
different pathways all these different

9798
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:42,160
different pathways all these different
 

9799
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:44,630
different pathways all these different
details and so on but the theoretical

9800
02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:44,640
details and so on but the theoretical
 

9801
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,630
details and so on but the theoretical
sections seem to have shrunk

9802
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:46,640
sections seem to have shrunk
 

9803
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:47,349
sections seem to have shrunk
um

9804
02:48:47,349 --> 02:48:47,359
um
 

9805
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:50,710
um
and so it's um so the question is

9806
02:48:50,710 --> 02:48:50,720
and so it's um so the question is
 

9807
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:53,110
and so it's um so the question is
what you know for example immune memory

9808
02:48:53,110 --> 02:48:53,120
what you know for example immune memory
 

9809
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,230
what you know for example immune memory
where is the where does the immune

9810
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:54,240
where is the where does the immune
 

9811
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:56,230
where is the where does the immune
memory reside is it actually some cell

9812
02:48:56,230 --> 02:48:56,240
memory reside is it actually some cell
 

9813
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:58,230
memory reside is it actually some cell
sitting in our bone marrow that is you

9814
02:48:58,230 --> 02:48:58,240
sitting in our bone marrow that is you
 

9815
02:48:58,240 --> 02:48:59,750
sitting in our bone marrow that is you
know living for the whole of our lives

9816
02:48:59,750 --> 02:48:59,760
know living for the whole of our lives
 

9817
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:01,590
know living for the whole of our lives
that's going to spring into action as

9818
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:01,600
that's going to spring into action as
 

9819
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:04,070
that's going to spring into action as
soon as we're shown the same antigen or

9820
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:04,080
soon as we're shown the same antigen or
 

9821
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:05,590
soon as we're shown the same antigen or
is it something different from that is

9822
02:49:05,590 --> 02:49:05,600
is it something different from that is
 

9823
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:07,429
is it something different from that is
it something more dynamic is it

9824
02:49:07,429 --> 02:49:07,439
it something more dynamic is it
 

9825
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:08,950
it something more dynamic is it
something more like some network of

9826
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:08,960
something more like some network of
 

9827
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:10,389
something more like some network of
interactions between these different

9828
02:49:10,389 --> 02:49:10,399
interactions between these different
 

9829
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:12,710
interactions between these different
kinds of immune system cells and so on

9830
02:49:12,710 --> 02:49:12,720
kinds of immune system cells and so on
 

9831
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:14,469
kinds of immune system cells and so on
and it's known that there are plenty of

9832
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:14,479
and it's known that there are plenty of
 

9833
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:16,070
and it's known that there are plenty of
interactions between t cells and you

9834
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:16,080
interactions between t cells and you
 

9835
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:18,870
interactions between t cells and you
know there's plenty of dynamics but what

9836
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:18,880
know there's plenty of dynamics but what
 

9837
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:20,710
know there's plenty of dynamics but what
the consequence of that dynamics is is

9838
02:49:20,710 --> 02:49:20,720
the consequence of that dynamics is is
 

9839
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,110
the consequence of that dynamics is is
not clear and to have a qualitative

9840
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:23,120
not clear and to have a qualitative
 

9841
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:25,990
not clear and to have a qualitative
theory for that doesn't it doesn't seem

9842
02:49:25,990 --> 02:49:26,000
theory for that doesn't it doesn't seem
 

9843
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,750
theory for that doesn't it doesn't seem
to exist in fact i was just just been

9844
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:27,760
to exist in fact i was just just been
 

9845
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:29,190
to exist in fact i was just just been
trying to study this so i'm quite

9846
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:29,200
trying to study this so i'm quite
 

9847
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:30,710
trying to study this so i'm quite
incomplete in my study of these things

9848
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
incomplete in my study of these things
 

9849
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,389
incomplete in my study of these things
but i was a little bit taken aback

9850
02:49:32,389 --> 02:49:32,399
but i was a little bit taken aback
 

9851
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:34,070
but i was a little bit taken aback
because i i've been looking at these

9852
02:49:34,070 --> 02:49:34,080
because i i've been looking at these
 

9853
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:35,429
because i i've been looking at these
things and it's like and then they get

9854
02:49:35,429 --> 02:49:35,439
things and it's like and then they get
 

9855
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:36,630
things and it's like and then they get
to the end where they have the most

9856
02:49:36,630 --> 02:49:36,640
to the end where they have the most
 

9857
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:38,469
to the end where they have the most
advanced theory that they've got and it

9858
02:49:38,469 --> 02:49:38,479
advanced theory that they've got and it
 

9859
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:39,910
advanced theory that they've got and it
turns out it's a cellular automaton

9860
02:49:39,910 --> 02:49:39,920
turns out it's a cellular automaton
 

9861
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:41,429
turns out it's a cellular automaton
theory um

9862
02:49:41,429 --> 02:49:41,439
theory um
 

9863
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:43,429
theory um
it's like uh okay well at least i

9864
02:49:43,429 --> 02:49:43,439
it's like uh okay well at least i
 

9865
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:46,070
it's like uh okay well at least i
understand that theory yeah um but but

9866
02:49:46,070 --> 02:49:46,080
understand that theory yeah um but but
 

9867
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:48,150
understand that theory yeah um but but
uh you know i think that the possibility

9868
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:48,160
uh you know i think that the possibility
 

9869
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:50,950
uh you know i think that the possibility
is that in um

9870
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:50,960
is that in um
 

9871
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:52,710
is that in um
uh this is a place where if you want to

9872
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:52,720
uh this is a place where if you want to
 

9873
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,630
uh this is a place where if you want to
know you know explain roughly how the

9874
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:54,640
know you know explain roughly how the
 

9875
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:56,790
know you know explain roughly how the
immune system works it ends up being

9876
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:56,800
immune system works it ends up being
 

9877
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:59,670
immune system works it ends up being
this dynamic network and then the the

9878
02:49:59,670 --> 02:49:59,680
this dynamic network and then the the
 

9879
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:01,990
this dynamic network and then the the
you know the immune consciousness so to

9880
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:02,000
you know the immune consciousness so to
 

9881
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,150
you know the immune consciousness so to
speak the observer ends up being

9882
02:50:04,150 --> 02:50:04,160
speak the observer ends up being
 

9883
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:06,230
speak the observer ends up being
something that you know in the end it's

9884
02:50:06,230 --> 02:50:06,240
something that you know in the end it's
 

9885
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:07,830
something that you know in the end it's
kind of like does the human get sick or

9886
02:50:07,830 --> 02:50:07,840
kind of like does the human get sick or
 

9887
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:10,389
kind of like does the human get sick or
whatever but it's a it's something which

9888
02:50:10,389 --> 02:50:10,399
whatever but it's a it's something which
 

9889
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:12,790
whatever but it's a it's something which
is a complicated story that relates to

9890
02:50:12,790 --> 02:50:12,800
is a complicated story that relates to
 

9891
02:50:12,800 --> 02:50:14,630
is a complicated story that relates to
this whole sort of dynamic network and

9892
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:14,640
this whole sort of dynamic network and
 

9893
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:16,469
this whole sort of dynamic network and
so on and i think that's another place

9894
02:50:16,469 --> 02:50:16,479
so on and i think that's another place
 

9895
02:50:16,479 --> 02:50:18,550
so on and i think that's another place
where this kind of notion of

9896
02:50:18,550 --> 02:50:18,560
where this kind of notion of
 

9897
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:20,230
where this kind of notion of
where i think multi-computation has the

9898
02:50:20,230 --> 02:50:20,240
where i think multi-computation has the
 

9899
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:21,590
where i think multi-computation has the
possibility

9900
02:50:21,590 --> 02:50:21,600
possibility
 

9901
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,590
possibility
see one of the things okay you can end

9902
02:50:23,590 --> 02:50:23,600
see one of the things okay you can end
 

9903
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:25,110
see one of the things okay you can end
up with something where yes there is a

9904
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:25,120
up with something where yes there is a
 

9905
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:27,110
up with something where yes there is a
general relativity in there there but it

9906
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:27,120

observer who

9910
02:50:30,710 --> 02:50:30,720
observer who
 

9911
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:32,309
observer who
sees general relativity in the immune

9912
02:50:32,309 --> 02:50:32,319
sees general relativity in the immune
 

9913
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:34,469
sees general relativity in the immune
system is an observer that's irrelevant

9914
02:50:34,469 --> 02:50:34,479
system is an observer that's irrelevant
 

9915
02:50:34,479 --> 02:50:36,070
system is an observer that's irrelevant
to what we care about about the immune

9916
02:50:36,070 --> 02:50:36,080
to what we care about about the immune
 

9917
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,910
to what we care about about the immune
system i mean it could be yes there is

9918
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:37,920
system i mean it could be yes there is
 

9919
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,309
system i mean it could be yes there is
some effect where you know there's some

9920
02:50:40,309 --> 02:50:40,319
some effect where you know there's some
 

9921
02:50:40,319 --> 02:50:42,790
some effect where you know there's some
you know time dilation of t cells

9922
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:42,800
you know time dilation of t cells
 

9923
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:44,630
you know time dilation of t cells
interacting with whatever but it's like

9924
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,640
interacting with whatever but it's like
 

9925
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,630
interacting with whatever but it's like
that's an effect that's just irrelevant

9926
02:50:46,630 --> 02:50:46,640
that's an effect that's just irrelevant
 

9927
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,389
that's an effect that's just irrelevant
and the thing we actually care about is

9928
02:50:48,389 --> 02:50:48,399
and the thing we actually care about is
 

9929
02:50:48,399 --> 02:50:49,830
and the thing we actually care about is
things about you know

9930
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:49,840
things about you know
 

9931
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:51,750
things about you know
what happens when you have a vaccine

9932
02:50:51,750 --> 02:50:51,760
what happens when you have a vaccine
 

9933
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:53,750
what happens when you have a vaccine
that goes into some place in shape space

9934
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:53,760
that goes into some place in shape space
 

9935
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,349
that goes into some place in shape space
and you know how does that affect other

9936
02:50:55,349 --> 02:50:55,359
and you know how does that affect other
 

9937
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:57,110
and you know how does that affect other
places in shape space and how does that

9938
02:50:57,110 --> 02:50:57,120
places in shape space and how does that
 

9939
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:59,030
places in shape space and how does that
spread you know what's the what's the

9940
02:50:59,030 --> 02:50:59,040
spread you know what's the what's the
 

9941
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:00,630
spread you know what's the what's the
analog of the speed of light in shape

9942
02:51:00,630 --> 02:51:00,640
analog of the speed of light in shape
 

9943
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:02,230
analog of the speed of light in shape
space for example that's and that's an

9944
02:51:02,230 --> 02:51:02,240
space for example that's and that's an
 

9945
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:03,910
space for example that's and that's an
important issue if you have one of these

9946
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:03,920
important issue if you have one of these
 

9947
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:05,910
important issue if you have one of these
dynamic theories it's like you you know

9948
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:05,920
dynamic theories it's like you you know
 

9949
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:08,150
dynamic theories it's like you you know
you you poke into shape space by having

9950
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:08,160
you you poke into shape space by having
 

9951
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:09,750
you you poke into shape space by having
you know let's say a vaccine or

9952
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:09,760
you know let's say a vaccine or
 

9953
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:11,349
you know let's say a vaccine or
something that has a particular

9954
02:51:11,349 --> 02:51:11,359
something that has a particular
 

9955
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:13,910
something that has a particular
configuration in shape space how how

9956
02:51:13,910 --> 02:51:13,920
configuration in shape space how how
 

9957
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:16,230
configuration in shape space how how
quickly as this dynamic network spreads

9958
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:16,240
quickly as this dynamic network spreads
 

9959
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:18,950
quickly as this dynamic network spreads
out how quickly do you get sort of other

9960
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:18,960
out how quickly do you get sort of other
 

9961
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:20,309
out how quickly do you get sort of other
antibodies

9962
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:20,319
antibodies
 

9963
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:21,590
antibodies
in different places in shape space

9964
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
in different places in shape space
 

9965
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,870
in different places in shape space
things like that when you say shape

9966
02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:22,880
things like that when you say shape
 

9967
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:23,910
things like that when you say shape
space you mean the shape of the

9968
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:23,920
space you mean the shape of the
 

9969
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:26,389
space you mean the shape of the
molecules or those and then so this is

9970
02:51:26,389 --> 02:51:26,399
molecules or those and then so this is
 

9971
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:27,510
molecules or those and then so this is
like uh

9972
02:51:27,510 --> 02:51:27,520
like uh
 

9973
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:28,870
like uh
it could be deeply connected to the

9974
02:51:28,870 --> 02:51:28,880
it could be deeply connected to the
 

9975
02:51:28,880 --> 02:51:30,870
it could be deeply connected to the
protein and multi-protein folding all of

9976
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:30,880
protein and multi-protein folding all of
 

9977
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:33,110
protein and multi-protein folding all of
that kind of stuff to be able to say

9978
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:33,120
that kind of stuff to be able to say
 

9979
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:34,710
that kind of stuff to be able to say
something interesting about the the

9980
02:51:34,710 --> 02:51:34,720
something interesting about the the
 

9981
02:51:34,720 --> 02:51:37,030
something interesting about the the
dance of proteins that right exactly

9982
02:51:37,030 --> 02:51:37,040
dance of proteins that right exactly
 

9983
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:40,070
dance of proteins that right exactly
that actually has an impact on

9984
02:51:40,070 --> 02:51:40,080
that actually has an impact on
 

9985
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:41,030
that actually has an impact on
um

9986
02:51:41,030 --> 02:51:41,040

an impact on
virology immunology helping too i think

9992
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:47,760
virology immunology helping too i think
 

9993
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:50,469
virology immunology helping too i think
the big thing is you know when we think

9994
02:51:50,469 --> 02:51:50,479
the big thing is you know when we think
 

9995
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:52,309
the big thing is you know when we think
about molecular biology

9996
02:51:52,309 --> 02:51:52,319
about molecular biology
 

9997
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:55,110
about molecular biology
the um uh you know what what is the

9998
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:55,120
the um uh you know what what is the
 

9999
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:57,030
the um uh you know what what is the
qualitative way to think about it you

10000
02:51:57,030 --> 02:51:57,040
qualitative way to think about it you
 

10001
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,630
qualitative way to think about it you
know in other words is it chemical

10002
02:51:58,630 --> 02:51:58,640
know in other words is it chemical
 

10003
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:01,429
know in other words is it chemical
reaction networks right is it you know

10004
02:52:01,429 --> 02:52:01,439
reaction networks right is it you know
 

10005
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:03,830
reaction networks right is it you know
genetics you know dna

10006
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
genetics you know dna
 

10007
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,910
genetics you know dna
big you know big news it's kind of

10008
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:05,920
big you know big news it's kind of
 

10009
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,750
big you know big news it's kind of
there's a digital aspect to the whole

10010
02:52:07,750 --> 02:52:07,760
there's a digital aspect to the whole
 

10011
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:09,670
there's a digital aspect to the whole
thing you know what is the qualitative

10012
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:09,680
thing you know what is the qualitative
 

10013
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:11,750
thing you know what is the qualitative
way to think about how things work in

10014
02:52:11,750 --> 02:52:11,760
way to think about how things work in
 

10015
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:14,070
way to think about how things work in
biology um you know when we think about

10016
02:52:14,070 --> 02:52:14,080
biology um you know when we think about
 

10017
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:15,590
biology um you know when we think about
i don't know some phenomenon like aging

10018
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:15,600
i don't know some phenomenon like aging
 

10019
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:17,349
i don't know some phenomenon like aging
or something which is a big complicated

10020
02:52:17,349 --> 02:52:17,359
or something which is a big complicated
 

10021
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:18,710
or something which is a big complicated
phenomenon which just seems to have all

10022
02:52:18,710 --> 02:52:18,720
phenomenon which just seems to have all
 

10023
02:52:18,720 --> 02:52:20,870
phenomenon which just seems to have all
these different tentacles is it really

10024
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:20,880
these different tentacles is it really
 

10025
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:22,870
these different tentacles is it really
the case that that can be thought about

10026
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:22,880
the case that that can be thought about
 

10027
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:25,670
the case that that can be thought about
in some you know without dna when people

10028
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:25,680
in some you know without dna when people
 

10029
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:27,510
in some you know without dna when people
were describing you know genetic

10030
02:52:27,510 --> 02:52:27,520
were describing you know genetic
 

10031
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:28,389
were describing you know genetic
phenomena

10032
02:52:28,389 --> 02:52:28,399
phenomena
 

10033
02:52:28,399 --> 02:52:30,230
phenomena
there were you know dominant recessive

10034
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:30,240
there were you know dominant recessive
 

10035
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:31,670
there were you know dominant recessive
this that and the other got very very

10036
02:52:31,670 --> 02:52:31,680
this that and the other got very very
 

10037
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:33,910
this that and the other got very very
complicated and then people realized oh

10038
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:33,920
complicated and then people realized oh
 

10039
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:35,990
complicated and then people realized oh
it's just you know and and what is a

10040
02:52:35,990 --> 02:52:36,000
it's just you know and and what is a
 

10041
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,910
it's just you know and and what is a
gene and so on and so on and so on then

10042
02:52:37,910 --> 02:52:37,920
gene and so on and so on and so on then
 

10043
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:39,750
gene and so on and so on and so on then
people realize it's just base pairs and

10044
02:52:39,750 --> 02:52:39,760
people realize it's just base pairs and
 

10045
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:41,429
people realize it's just base pairs and
there's this digital representation and

10046
02:52:41,429 --> 02:52:41,439
there's this digital representation and
 

10047
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:42,710
there's this digital representation and
so the question is what is the

10048
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:42,720
so the question is what is the
 

10049
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:45,030
so the question is what is the
overarching representation that we can

10050
02:52:45,030 --> 02:52:45,040
overarching representation that we can
 

10051
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:46,389
overarching representation that we can
now start to think about using a

10052
02:52:46,389 --> 02:52:46,399
now start to think about using a
 

10053
02:52:46,399 --> 02:52:48,070
now start to think about using a
microbiology i don't know how this will

10054
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:48,080
microbiology i don't know how this will
 

10055
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,990
microbiology i don't know how this will
work out and this is again one of these

10056
02:52:49,990 --> 02:52:50,000
work out and this is again one of these
 

10057
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,150
work out and this is again one of these
things where and and the place where

10058
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:52,160
things where and and the place where
 

10059
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,550
things where and and the place where
that gets important is you know maybe

10060
02:52:54,550 --> 02:52:54,560
that gets important is you know maybe
 

10061
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:56,950
that gets important is you know maybe
molecular biology is doing molecular

10062
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:56,960
molecular biology is doing molecular
 

10063
02:52:56,960 --> 02:53:00,389
molecular biology is doing molecular
computing by using some dynamic process

10064
02:53:00,389 --> 02:53:00,399
computing by using some dynamic process
 

10065
02:53:00,399 --> 02:53:02,550
computing by using some dynamic process
that is something where it is very

10066
02:53:02,550 --> 02:53:02,560
that is something where it is very
 

10067
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,550
that is something where it is very
happily saying oh i just got a result

10068
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:04,560
happily saying oh i just got a result
 

10069
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:05,990
happily saying oh i just got a result
it's in the dynamic structure of this

10070
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:06,000
it's in the dynamic structure of this
 

10071
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,429
it's in the dynamic structure of this
network now i'm going to go and do some

10072
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
network now i'm going to go and do some
 

10073
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:09,510
network now i'm going to go and do some
other thing based on that result for

10074
02:53:09,510 --> 02:53:09,520
other thing based on that result for
 

10075
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,429
other thing based on that result for
example but we're like oh i don't know

10076
02:53:11,429 --> 02:53:11,439
example but we're like oh i don't know
 

10077
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:13,110
example but we're like oh i don't know
what's going on you know it's just we

10078
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:13,120
what's going on you know it's just we
 

10079
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:15,030
what's going on you know it's just we
just measured them levels of these

10080
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:15,040
just measured them levels of these
 

10081
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:16,630
just measured them levels of these
chemicals and we couldn't conclude

10082
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:16,640
chemicals and we couldn't conclude
 

10083
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,469
chemicals and we couldn't conclude
anything but it just we're looking at

10084
02:53:18,469 --> 02:53:18,479
anything but it just we're looking at
 

10085
02:53:18,479 --> 02:53:20,870
anything but it just we're looking at
the wrong thing and and so that's the

10086
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:20,880
the wrong thing and and so that's the
 

10087
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:22,870
the wrong thing and and so that's the
that's kind of the the the potential

10088
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:22,880
that's kind of the the the potential
 

10089
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:24,950
that's kind of the the the potential
there and it's it's um i mean these

10090
02:53:24,950 --> 02:53:24,960
there and it's it's um i mean these
 

10091
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:27,670
there and it's it's um i mean these
things are i don't know it's it's for me

10092
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:27,680
things are i don't know it's it's for me
 

10093
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:30,469
things are i don't know it's it's for me
it's it's like i've not really that was

10094
02:53:30,469 --> 02:53:30,479
it's it's like i've not really that was
 

10095
02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:32,150
it's it's like i've not really that was
not a view i mean i've thought about

10096
02:53:32,150 --> 02:53:32,160
not a view i mean i've thought about
 

10097
02:53:32,160 --> 02:53:34,070
not a view i mean i've thought about
molecular computing for ages and ages

10098
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:34,080
molecular computing for ages and ages
 

10099
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:36,070
molecular computing for ages and ages
and ages and i've always imagined that

10100
02:53:36,070 --> 02:53:36,080
and ages and i've always imagined that
 

10101
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:38,309
and ages and i've always imagined that
the big story is kind of the the

10102
02:53:38,309 --> 02:53:38,319
the big story is kind of the the
 

10103
02:53:38,319 --> 02:53:40,550
the big story is kind of the the
original promise of nanotechnology of

10104
02:53:40,550 --> 02:53:40,560
original promise of nanotechnology of
 

10105
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:42,309
original promise of nanotechnology of
like can we make a molecular scale

10106
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:42,319
like can we make a molecular scale
 

10107
02:53:42,319 --> 02:53:44,469
like can we make a molecular scale
constructor that will just build build a

10108
02:53:44,469 --> 02:53:44,479
constructor that will just build build a
 

10109
02:53:44,479 --> 02:53:46,630
constructor that will just build build a
molecule in any shape but i don't think

10110
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:46,640
molecule in any shape but i don't think
 

10111
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:48,950
molecule in any shape but i don't think
i i'm now increasingly concluding that's

10112
02:53:48,950 --> 02:53:48,960
i i'm now increasingly concluding that's
 

10113
02:53:48,960 --> 02:53:50,870
i i'm now increasingly concluding that's
not the big point the big point is

10114
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:50,880
not the big point the big point is
 

10115
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:52,790
not the big point the big point is
something more dynamic that will be an

10116
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:52,800
something more dynamic that will be an
 

10117
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:54,790
something more dynamic that will be an
interesting end point for any of these

10118
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:54,800
interesting end point for any of these
 

10119
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:57,590
interesting end point for any of these
things but that's perhaps not the thing

10120
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:57,600
things but that's perhaps not the thing
 

10121
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:59,030
things but that's perhaps not the thing
you know because the one example we have

10122
02:53:59,030 --> 02:53:59,040
you know because the one example we have
 

10123
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:00,710
you know because the one example we have
molecular computing that's really

10124
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:00,720
molecular computing that's really
 

10125
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:03,349
molecular computing that's really
working is us biological organisms

10126
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:03,359
working is us biological organisms
 

10127
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:05,349
working is us biological organisms
and you know maybe the thing that's

10128
02:54:05,349 --> 02:54:05,359
and you know maybe the thing that's
 

10129
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:08,070
and you know maybe the thing that's
important there is not uh this you know

10130
02:54:08,070 --> 02:54:08,080
important there is not uh this you know
 

10131
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:09,910
important there is not uh this you know
what chemicals do you make so to speak

10132
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:09,920
what chemicals do you make so to speak
 

10133
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:11,830
what chemicals do you make so to speak
but more this kind of dynamic process

10134
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:11,840
but more this kind of dynamic process
 

10135
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:13,269
but more this kind of dynamic process
it's a dynamic process and then you can

10136
02:54:13,269 --> 02:54:13,279
it's a dynamic process and then you can
 

10137
02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:15,110
it's a dynamic process and then you can
have a good model like the hypergraph to

10138
02:54:15,110 --> 02:54:15,120
have a good model like the hypergraph to
 

10139
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:16,790
have a good model like the hypergraph to
to then explore

10149
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:25,190
they i think just have a way to reason
about biology i mean it's it's hard you

10150
02:54:25,190 --> 02:54:25,200
about biology i mean it's it's hard you
 

10151
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:27,429
about biology i mean it's it's hard you
know but first of all biology doesn't

10152
02:54:27,429 --> 02:54:27,439
know but first of all biology doesn't
 

10153
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:29,349
know but first of all biology doesn't
have theories like physics you know

10154
02:54:29,349 --> 02:54:29,359
have theories like physics you know
 

10155
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:31,590
have theories like physics you know
physics is a much more successful sort

10156
02:54:31,590 --> 02:54:31,600
physics is a much more successful sort
 

10157
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:34,150
physics is a much more successful sort
of global theory kind of kind of area

10158
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:34,160
of global theory kind of kind of area
 

10159
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,150
of global theory kind of kind of area
you know biology what are the global

10160
02:54:36,150 --> 02:54:36,160
you know biology what are the global
 

10161
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:37,670
you know biology what are the global
theories of biology pretty much

10162
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:37,680
theories of biology pretty much
 

10163
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:39,510
theories of biology pretty much
darwinian evolution that's the only

10164
02:54:39,510 --> 02:54:39,520
darwinian evolution that's the only
 

10165
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,670
darwinian evolution that's the only
global theory of biology you know other

10166
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:41,680
global theory of biology you know other
 

10167
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:43,590
global theory of biology you know other
any other theory is just a well the

10168
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:43,600
any other theory is just a well the
 

10169
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:45,510
any other theory is just a well the
kidneys work this way this thing works

10170
02:54:45,510 --> 02:54:45,520
kidneys work this way this thing works
 

10171
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,910
kidneys work this way this thing works
this way and so on there isn't i suppose

10172
02:54:47,910 --> 02:54:47,920
this way and so on there isn't i suppose
 

10173
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:49,190
this way and so on there isn't i suppose
another global theory is digital

10174
02:54:49,190 --> 02:54:49,200
another global theory is digital
 

10175
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:51,590
another global theory is digital
information in dna that's another sort

10176
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:51,600
information in dna that's another sort
 

10177
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,830
information in dna that's another sort
of global fact about biology but the the

10178
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:53,840
of global fact about biology but the the
 

10179
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,429
of global fact about biology but the the
difficult thing to do is to match

10180
02:54:57,429 --> 02:54:57,439
difficult thing to do is to match
 

10181
02:54:57,439 --> 02:54:59,750
difficult thing to do is to match
something you uh have a model of in the

10182
02:54:59,750 --> 02:54:59,760
something you uh have a model of in the
 

10183
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,670
something you uh have a model of in the
hyper graph to the actual like how do

10184
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:01,680
hyper graph to the actual like how do
 

10185
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:03,349
hyper graph to the actual like how do
you discover the theory

10186
02:55:03,349 --> 02:55:03,359
you discover the theory
 

10187
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:04,550
you discover the theory
how do you how do you discover the

10188
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:04,560
how do you how do you discover the
 

10189
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:05,910
how do you how do you discover the
theory okay you have something that

10190
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:05,920
theory okay you have something that
 

10191
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:08,150
theory okay you have something that
looks nice and makes sense but like you

10192
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:08,160
looks nice and makes sense but like you
 

10193
02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:10,950
looks nice and makes sense but like you
have to match it to validation oh sure

10194
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:10,960
have to match it to validation oh sure
 

10195
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:13,190
have to match it to validation oh sure
right and that's tricky because you're

10196
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:13,200
right and that's tricky because you're
 

10197
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:15,269
right and that's tricky because you're
walking around in the dark

10198
02:55:15,269 --> 02:55:15,279
walking around in the dark
 

10199
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:17,670
walking around in the dark
not entirely i mean so so you know for

10200
02:55:17,670 --> 02:55:17,680
not entirely i mean so so you know for
 

10201
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,349
not entirely i mean so so you know for
example in what we've been trying to

10202
02:55:19,349 --> 02:55:19,359
example in what we've been trying to
 

10203
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:21,429
example in what we've been trying to
think about is take actual chemical

10204
02:55:21,429 --> 02:55:21,439
think about is take actual chemical
 

10205
02:55:21,439 --> 02:55:24,389
think about is take actual chemical
reactions okay so you know one of my one

10206
02:55:24,389 --> 02:55:24,399
reactions okay so you know one of my one
 

10207
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:27,030
reactions okay so you know one of my one
of my goals is can i compute the primes

10208
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:27,040
of my goals is can i compute the primes
 

10209
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,269
of my goals is can i compute the primes
with molecules okay that's if i can do

10210
02:55:29,269 --> 02:55:29,279
with molecules okay that's if i can do
 

10211
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:31,830
with molecules okay that's if i can do
that then i kind of maybe i can compute

10212
02:55:31,830 --> 02:55:31,840
that then i kind of maybe i can compute
 

10213
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:32,710
that then i kind of maybe i can compute
things

10214
02:55:32,710 --> 02:55:32,720
things
 

10215
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:34,550
things
and you know there's this nice automated

10216
02:55:34,550 --> 02:55:34,560
and you know there's this nice automated
 

10217
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:36,790
and you know there's this nice automated
lab these guys this emerald cloud lab

10218
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:36,800
lab these guys this emerald cloud lab
 

10219
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:38,230
lab these guys this emerald cloud lab
people are built with wolfram language

10220
02:55:38,230 --> 02:55:38,240
people are built with wolfram language
 

10221
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:40,710
people are built with wolfram language
and so on that's an actual physical lab

10222
02:55:40,710 --> 02:55:40,720
and so on that's an actual physical lab
 

10223
02:55:40,720 --> 02:55:41,990
and so on that's an actual physical lab
and you send it a piece of wolf and

10224
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:42,000
and you send it a piece of wolf and
 

10225
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,070
and you send it a piece of wolf and
language code and it goes and you know

10226
02:55:44,070 --> 02:55:44,080
language code and it goes and you know
 

10227
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:45,990
language code and it goes and you know
actually does physical experiments and

10228
02:55:45,990 --> 02:55:46,000
actually does physical experiments and
 

10229
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,230
actually does physical experiments and
so one of my one of my goals because i'm

10230
02:55:48,230 --> 02:55:48,240
so one of my one of my goals because i'm
 

10231
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:50,469
so one of my one of my goals because i'm
not a test tube kind of guy i'm more of

10232
02:55:50,469 --> 02:55:50,479
not a test tube kind of guy i'm more of
 

10233
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:52,950
not a test tube kind of guy i'm more of
a software kind of person is can i make

10234
02:55:52,950 --> 02:55:52,960
a software kind of person is can i make
 

10235
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:54,630
a software kind of person is can i make
something where you know in this

10236
02:55:54,630 --> 02:55:54,640
something where you know in this
 

10237
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:56,950
something where you know in this
automated lab we can actually get it so

10238
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:56,960
automated lab we can actually get it so
 

10239
02:55:56,960 --> 02:55:58,870
automated lab we can actually get it so
that there's some gel that we made and

10240
02:55:58,870 --> 02:55:58,880
that there's some gel that we made and
 

10241
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:02,790
that there's some gel that we made and
you know the positions of the stripes

10242
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:02,800

 

10243
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:03,990

i mean that would be that would be an

10244
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:04,000
i mean that would be that would be an
 

10245
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,550
i mean that would be that would be an
example of of where and that would be

10246
02:56:06,550 --> 02:56:06,560
example of of where and that would be
 

10247
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:08,070
example of of where and that would be
with a particular

10248
02:56:08,070 --> 02:56:08,080
with a particular
 

10249
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:10,550
with a particular
uh you know framework for actually doing

10250
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:10,560
uh you know framework for actually doing
 

10251
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:12,469
uh you know framework for actually doing
the molecular computing you know with

10252
02:56:12,469 --> 02:56:12,479
the molecular computing you know with
 

10253
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:14,230
the molecular computing you know with
particular kinds of molecules and and

10254
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:14,240
particular kinds of molecules and and
 

10255
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:16,389
particular kinds of molecules and and
there's a lot of kind of ambient

10256
02:56:16,389 --> 02:56:16,399
there's a lot of kind of ambient
 

10257
02:56:16,399 --> 02:56:17,990
there's a lot of kind of ambient
technological mess so to speak

10258
02:56:17,990 --> 02:56:18,000
technological mess so to speak
 

10259
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,910
technological mess so to speak
associated with oh is it carbon is it

10260
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:19,920
associated with oh is it carbon is it
 

10261
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:21,990
associated with oh is it carbon is it
this is that you know is it important

10262
02:56:21,990 --> 02:56:22,000
this is that you know is it important
 

10263
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,990
this is that you know is it important
that there's a bromine atom here et

10264
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:24,000
that there's a bromine atom here et
 

10265

chemistry that i don't know much about

10268
02:56:27,269 --> 02:56:27,279
chemistry that i don't know much about
 

10269
02:56:27,279 --> 02:56:29,750
chemistry that i don't know much about
um and you know that's that's a sort of

10270
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
um and you know that's that's a sort of
 

10271
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:31,590
um and you know that's that's a sort of
you know unfortunately that's down at

10272
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:31,600
you know unfortunately that's down at
 

10273
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,429
you know unfortunately that's down at
the level you know i i would like to be

10274
02:56:33,429 --> 02:56:33,439
the level you know i i would like to be
 

10275
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:35,349
the level you know i i would like to be
at the software level not at the level

10276
02:56:35,349 --> 02:56:35,359
at the software level not at the level
 

10277
02:56:35,359 --> 02:56:37,510
at the software level not at the level
of the transistors so to speak but in

10278
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:37,520
of the transistors so to speak but in
 

10279
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:39,269
of the transistors so to speak but in
chemistry you know there's a certain

10280
02:56:39,269 --> 02:56:39,279
chemistry you know there's a certain
 

10281
02:56:39,279 --> 02:56:40,550
chemistry you know there's a certain
amount we have to do i think at the

10282
02:56:40,550 --> 02:56:40,560
amount we have to do i think at the
 

10283
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:43,110
amount we have to do i think at the
level of transistors before we get up to

10284
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:43,120
level of transistors before we get up to
 

10285
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:44,870
level of transistors before we get up to
being able to do it although you know

10286
02:56:44,870 --> 02:56:44,880
being able to do it although you know
 

10287
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:46,870
being able to do it although you know
automated labs certainly help in in

10288
02:56:46,870 --> 02:56:46,880
automated labs certainly help in in
 

10289
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:48,550
automated labs certainly help in in
setting that up

10290
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:48,560
setting that up
 

10291
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,990
setting that up

well read on that area as well so what's

10306
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:04,720
well read on that area as well so what's
 

10307
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:06,469
well read on that area as well so what's

from blockchain all that kind of stuff
 

10321
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:20,150
from blockchain all that kind of stuff
well okay we're segueing to a

10322
02:57:20,150 --> 02:57:20,160
well okay we're segueing to a
 

10323
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:23,190
well okay we're segueing to a
slightly different world but but um so

10324
02:57:23,190 --> 02:57:23,200
slightly different world but but um so
 

10325
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:25,190
slightly different world but but um so
although not completely unconnected

10326
02:57:25,190 --> 02:57:25,200
although not completely unconnected
 

10327
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:27,030
although not completely unconnected
right the whole thing is somehow

10328
02:57:27,030 --> 02:57:27,040
right the whole thing is somehow
 

10329
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:29,590
right the whole thing is somehow
connected i know i mean the the you know

10330
02:57:29,590 --> 02:57:29,600
connected i know i mean the the you know
 

10331
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:31,269
connected i know i mean the the you know
the strange thing in my life is i've

10332
02:57:31,269 --> 02:57:31,279
the strange thing in my life is i've
 

10333
02:57:31,279 --> 02:57:33,030
the strange thing in my life is i've
sort of alternated between doing basic

10334
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:33,040
sort of alternated between doing basic
 

10335
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,349
sort of alternated between doing basic
science and doing technology about five

10336
02:57:35,349 --> 02:57:35,359
science and doing technology about five
 

10337
02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:37,750
science and doing technology about five
times in my life so far and the thing

10338
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:37,760
times in my life so far and the thing
 

10339
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:40,070
times in my life so far and the thing
that's just crazy about it is you know

10340
02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:40,080
that's just crazy about it is you know
 

10341
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:41,590
that's just crazy about it is you know
every time i do one of these

10342
02:57:41,590 --> 02:57:41,600
every time i do one of these
 

10343
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:43,510
every time i do one of these
alternations i think there's not going

10344
02:57:43,510 --> 02:57:43,520
alternations i think there's not going
 

10345
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:45,429
alternations i think there's not going
to be a way back to the other thing and

10346
02:57:45,429 --> 02:57:45,439
to be a way back to the other thing and
 

10347
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:46,950
to be a way back to the other thing and
like i thought for this physics project

10348
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:46,960
like i thought for this physics project
 

10349
02:57:46,960 --> 02:57:48,469
like i thought for this physics project
i thought you know we're doing

10350
02:57:48,469 --> 02:57:48,479
i thought you know we're doing
 

10351
02:57:48,479 --> 02:57:50,389
i thought you know we're doing
fundamental theory of physics maybe

10352
02:57:50,389 --> 02:57:50,399
fundamental theory of physics maybe
 

10353
02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:52,630
fundamental theory of physics maybe
it'll have an application in 200 years

10354
02:57:52,630 --> 02:57:52,640
it'll have an application in 200 years
 

10355
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:55,030
it'll have an application in 200 years
um but now i've realized

10356
02:57:55,030 --> 02:57:55,040
um but now i've realized
 

10357
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,429
um but now i've realized
um actually this multi-computation idea

10358
02:57:57,429 --> 02:57:57,439
um actually this multi-computation idea
 

10359
02:57:57,439 --> 02:57:59,990
um actually this multi-computation idea
is is applicable here and now it's and

10360
02:57:59,990 --> 02:58:00,000
is is applicable here and now it's and
 

10361
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,469
is is applicable here and now it's and
in fact it's also giving us this way

10362
02:58:02,469 --> 02:58:02,479
in fact it's also giving us this way
 

10363
02:58:02,479 --> 02:58:03,750
in fact it's also giving us this way
i'll just mention one other thing and

10364
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:03,760
i'll just mention one other thing and
 

10365
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:07,910
i'll just mention one other thing and
then to talk about blockchain um the um

10366
02:58:07,910 --> 02:58:07,920
then to talk about blockchain um the um
 

10367
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:10,389
then to talk about blockchain um the um
the question of um uh actually that

10368
02:58:10,389 --> 02:58:10,399
the question of um uh actually that
 

10369
02:58:10,399 --> 02:58:12,230
the question of um uh actually that
relates to several different things but

10370
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:12,240
relates to several different things but
 

10371
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:14,710
relates to several different things but
but um one of the things about about

10372
02:58:14,710 --> 02:58:14,720
but um one of the things about about
 

10373
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:16,070
but um one of the things about about
okay so

10374
02:58:16,070 --> 02:58:16,080
okay so
 

10375
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:19,030
okay so
our wolfram language which is our

10376
02:58:19,030 --> 02:58:19,040
our wolfram language which is our
 

10377
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:20,710
our wolfram language which is our
attempt to kind of represent everything

10378
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:20,720
attempt to kind of represent everything
 

10379
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:22,710
attempt to kind of represent everything
in the world computationally and it's

10380
02:58:22,710 --> 02:58:22,720
in the world computationally and it's
 

10381
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:24,309
in the world computationally and it's
the thing i kind of started building 40

10382
02:58:24,309 --> 02:58:24,319
the thing i kind of started building 40
 

10383
02:58:24,319 --> 02:58:25,269
the thing i kind of started building 40
years ago

10384
02:58:25,269 --> 02:58:25,279
years ago
 

10385
02:58:25,279 --> 02:58:27,110
years ago
in the form of actual wolfram language

10386
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
in the form of actual wolfram language
 

10387
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:30,230
in the form of actual wolfram language
uh 35 years ago um it's kind of this

10388
02:58:30,230 --> 02:58:30,240
uh 35 years ago um it's kind of this
 

10389
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:33,830
uh 35 years ago um it's kind of this
idea of can we can we express things

10390
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:33,840
idea of can we can we express things
 

10391
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:36,790
idea of can we can we express things
about the world in computational terms

10392
02:58:36,790 --> 02:58:36,800
about the world in computational terms
 

10393
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:38,550
about the world in computational terms
and you know we've come a long way in

10394
02:58:38,550 --> 02:58:38,560
and you know we've come a long way in
 

10395
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:40,550
and you know we've come a long way in
being able to do that well from alpha is

10396
02:58:40,550 --> 02:58:40,560
being able to do that well from alpha is
 

10397
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:42,150
being able to do that well from alpha is
kind of the consumer version of that

10398
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:42,160
kind of the consumer version of that
 

10399
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:43,510
kind of the consumer version of that
where you're just using natural language

10400
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:43,520
where you're just using natural language
 

10401
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:46,309
where you're just using natural language
as input the um and it turns it into our

10402
02:58:46,309 --> 02:58:46,319
as input the um and it turns it into our
 

10403
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:48,710
as input the um and it turns it into our
symbolic language and that's you know

10404
02:58:48,710 --> 02:58:48,720
symbolic language and that's you know
 

10405
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:50,389
symbolic language and that's you know
the symbolic language wolf and language

10406
02:58:50,389 --> 02:58:50,399
the symbolic language wolf and language
 

10407
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:52,150
the symbolic language wolf and language
is what people use and have been using

10408
02:58:52,150 --> 02:58:52,160
is what people use and have been using
 

10409
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:54,469
is what people use and have been using
for the last 33 years actually

10410
02:58:54,469 --> 02:58:54,479
for the last 33 years actually
 

10411
02:58:54,479 --> 02:58:56,230
for the last 33 years actually
mathematica which is its first

10412
02:58:56,230 --> 02:58:56,240
mathematica which is its first
 

10413
02:58:56,240 --> 02:58:58,309
mathematica which is its first
instantiation will be one third of a

10414
02:58:58,309 --> 02:58:58,319
instantiation will be one third of a
 

10415
02:58:58,319 --> 02:59:02,630
instantiation will be one third of a
century old in uh in october um and um

10416
02:59:02,630 --> 02:59:02,640
century old in uh in october um and um
 

10417
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,469
century old in uh in october um and um
that

10418
02:59:04,469 --> 02:59:04,479
that
 

10419
02:59:04,479 --> 02:59:06,230
that
it's it's kind of interesting what do

10420
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:06,240
it's it's kind of interesting what do
 

10421
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:07,750
it's it's kind of interesting what do
you mean one third of a centuries i mean

10422
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:07,760
you mean one third of a centuries i mean
 

10423
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:09,750
you mean one third of a centuries i mean
33 or 30 what are we

10424
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:09,760
33 or 30 what are we
 

10425
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:10,790
33 or 30 what are we
in the third

10426
02:59:10,790 --> 02:59:10,800
in the third
 

10427
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:14,309
in the third
33 in the third um so

10428
02:59:14,309 --> 02:59:14,319
33 in the third um so
 

10429
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:15,750
33 in the third um so
but i've never heard of anyone

10430
02:59:15,750 --> 02:59:15,760
but i've never heard of anyone
 

10431
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:17,429
but i've never heard of anyone
celebrating that anniversary but i like

10432
02:59:17,429 --> 02:59:17,439
celebrating that anniversary but i like
 

10433
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:19,190
celebrating that anniversary but i like
it i know a third of a century though

10434
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:19,200
it i know a third of a century though
 

10435
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:21,110
it i know a third of a century though
it's it's like cannot get many many

10436
02:59:21,110 --> 02:59:21,120
it's it's like cannot get many many
 

10437
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:22,950
it's it's like cannot get many many
slices of a century that are interesting

10438
02:59:22,950 --> 02:59:22,960
slices of a century that are interesting
 

10439
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,790
slices of a century that are interesting
yeah but but you know i think that the

10440
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:24,800
yeah but but you know i think that the
 

10441
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:26,309
yeah but but you know i think that the
the thing that's really striking about

10442
02:59:26,309 --> 02:59:26,319
the thing that's really striking about
 

10443
02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:28,630
the thing that's really striking about
that is that means you know including

10444
02:59:28,630 --> 02:59:28,640
that is that means you know including
 

10445
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,990
that is that means you know including
the whole sort of technology stack i

10446
02:59:29,990 --> 02:59:30,000
the whole sort of technology stack i
 

10447
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,910
the whole sort of technology stack i
built around that's about 40 years old

10448
02:59:31,910 --> 02:59:31,920
built around that's about 40 years old
 

10449
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:33,349
built around that's about 40 years old
and that means it's a significant

10450
02:59:33,349 --> 02:59:33,359
and that means it's a significant
 

10451
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:34,550
and that means it's a significant
fraction of the total age of the

10452
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:34,560
fraction of the total age of the
 

10453
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:35,910
fraction of the total age of the
computer industry

10454
02:59:35,910 --> 02:59:35,920
computer industry
 

10455
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:38,070
computer industry
um and it's i mean i think it's cool

10456
02:59:38,070 --> 02:59:38,080
um and it's i mean i think it's cool
 

10457
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:39,429
um and it's i mean i think it's cool
that we can still run you know

10458
02:59:39,429 --> 02:59:39,439
that we can still run you know
 

10459
02:59:39,439 --> 02:59:42,230
that we can still run you know
mathematica version 1 programs today and

10460
02:59:42,230 --> 02:59:42,240
mathematica version 1 programs today and
 

10461
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:43,910
mathematica version 1 programs today and
so on and and we've sort of maintained

10462
02:59:43,910 --> 02:59:43,920
so on and and we've sort of maintained
 

10463
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:45,670
so on and and we've sort of maintained
compatibility and we've been just

10464
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:45,680
compatibility and we've been just
 

10465
02:59:45,680 --> 02:59:48,389
compatibility and we've been just
building this big tower all those years

10466
02:59:48,389 --> 02:59:48,399
building this big tower all those years
 

10467
02:59:48,399 --> 02:59:49,830
building this big tower all those years
of just more and more and more

10468
02:59:49,830 --> 02:59:49,840
of just more and more and more
 

10469
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:51,349
of just more and more and more
computational capabilities it's sort of

10470
02:59:51,349 --> 02:59:51,359
computational capabilities it's sort of
 

10471
02:59:51,359 --> 02:59:52,710
computational capabilities it's sort of
interesting we just made this this

10472
02:59:52,710 --> 02:59:52,720
interesting we just made this this
 

10473
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:55,429
interesting we just made this this
picture um of kind of the different kind

10474
02:59:55,429 --> 02:59:55,439
picture um of kind of the different kind
 

10475
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:58,150
picture um of kind of the different kind
of threads of of of computational

10476
02:59:58,150 --> 02:59:58,160
of threads of of of computational
 

10477
02:59:58,160 --> 03:00:00,630
of threads of of of computational
content of you know mathematical content

10478
03:00:00,630 --> 03:00:00,640
content of you know mathematical content
 

10479
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:01,349
content of you know mathematical content
and

10480
03:00:01,349 --> 03:00:01,359
and
 

10481
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:03,910
and
and you know uh all sorts of things with

10482
03:00:03,910 --> 03:00:03,920
and you know uh all sorts of things with
 

10483
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:05,910
and you know uh all sorts of things with
you know data and graphs and whatever

10484
03:00:05,910 --> 03:00:05,920
you know data and graphs and whatever
 

10485
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:07,830
you know data and graphs and whatever
else and what you see in this picture is

10486
03:00:07,830 --> 03:00:07,840
else and what you see in this picture is
 

10487
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:09,990
else and what you see in this picture is
about the first 10 years it's kind of

10488
03:00:09,990 --> 03:00:10,000
about the first 10 years it's kind of
 

10489
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,910
about the first 10 years it's kind of
like it's just a few threads

10490
03:00:11,910 --> 03:00:11,920
like it's just a few threads
 

10491
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:13,910
like it's just a few threads
and then then about

10492
03:00:13,910 --> 03:00:13,920
and then then about
 

10493
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:15,510
and then then about
maybe 15 20 years ago it kind of

10494
03:00:15,510 --> 03:00:15,520
maybe 15 20 years ago it kind of
 

10495
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:17,110
maybe 15 20 years ago it kind of
explodes in this whole collection

10496
03:00:17,110 --> 03:00:17,120
explodes in this whole collection
 

10497
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:19,269
explodes in this whole collection
different threads of all these different

10498
03:00:19,269 --> 03:00:19,279
different threads of all these different
 

10499
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:21,030
different threads of all these different
capabilities that are now part of

10500
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:21,040
capabilities that are now part of
 

10501
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:22,309
capabilities that are now part of
language and representing different

10502
03:00:22,309 --> 03:00:22,319
language and representing different
 

10503
03:00:22,319 --> 03:00:24,550
language and representing different
things in the world but the thing that

10504
03:00:24,550 --> 03:00:24,560
things in the world but the thing that
 

10505
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:27,670
things in the world but the thing that
was super lucky in some sense is it's

10506
03:00:27,670 --> 03:00:27,680
was super lucky in some sense is it's
 

10507
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:29,910
was super lucky in some sense is it's
all based on one idea it's all based on

10508
03:00:29,910 --> 03:00:29,920
all based on one idea it's all based on
 

10509
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:32,070
all based on one idea it's all based on
the idea of symbolic expressions and

10510
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:32,080
the idea of symbolic expressions and
 

10511
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:33,510
the idea of symbolic expressions and
transformation rules for symbolic

10512
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:33,520
transformation rules for symbolic
 

10513
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:35,429
transformation rules for symbolic
expressions which was kind of what i

10514
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
expressions which was kind of what i
 

10515
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:38,550
expressions which was kind of what i
originally put into this smp system back

10516
03:00:38,550 --> 03:00:38,560
originally put into this smp system back
 

10517
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:41,190
originally put into this smp system back
in 1979 that was a predecessor of the

10518
03:00:41,190 --> 03:00:41,200
in 1979 that was a predecessor of the
 

10519
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:42,950
in 1979 that was a predecessor of the
whole world from language stack

10520
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:42,960
whole world from language stack
 

10521
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:44,389
whole world from language stack
so that idea

10522
03:00:44,389 --> 03:00:44,399
so that idea
 

10523
03:00:44,399 --> 03:00:46,630
so that idea
was an idea that i got from sort of

10524
03:00:46,630 --> 03:00:46,640
was an idea that i got from sort of
 

10525
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:48,469
was an idea that i got from sort of
trying to understand mathematical logic

10526
03:00:48,469 --> 03:00:48,479
trying to understand mathematical logic
 

10527
03:00:48,479 --> 03:00:50,790
trying to understand mathematical logic
and so on it was my attempt to kind of

10528
03:00:50,790 --> 03:00:50,800
and so on it was my attempt to kind of
 

10529
03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:53,349
and so on it was my attempt to kind of
make a general human comprehensible

10530
03:00:53,349 --> 03:00:53,359
make a general human comprehensible
 

10531
03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:55,750
make a general human comprehensible
model of computation of just everything

10532
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:55,760
model of computation of just everything
 

10533
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:57,750
model of computation of just everything
is a symbolic expression and all you do

10534
03:00:57,750 --> 03:00:57,760
is a symbolic expression and all you do
 

10535
03:00:57,760 --> 03:00:59,990
is a symbolic expression and all you do
is transform symbolic expressions

10536
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:00,000
is transform symbolic expressions
 

10537
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,990
is transform symbolic expressions
and you know in in retrospect i was very

10538
03:01:03,990 --> 03:01:04,000
and you know in in retrospect i was very
 

10539
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,830
and you know in in retrospect i was very
lucky that i understood as little as i

10540
03:01:05,830 --> 03:01:05,840
lucky that i understood as little as i
 

10541
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:08,070
lucky that i understood as little as i
understood then because had i understood

10542
03:01:08,070 --> 03:01:08,080
understood then because had i understood
 

10543
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:09,590
understood then because had i understood
more i would have been completely

10544
03:01:09,590 --> 03:01:09,600
more i would have been completely
 

10545
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:11,830
more i would have been completely
freaked out about all the different ways

10546
03:01:11,830 --> 03:01:11,840
freaked out about all the different ways
 

10547
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:14,550
freaked out about all the different ways
that that kind of model can can fail

10548
03:01:14,550 --> 03:01:14,560
that that kind of model can can fail
 

10549
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:16,870
that that kind of model can can fail
because what do you do when you have a a

10550
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:16,880
because what do you do when you have a a
 

10551
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:18,389
because what do you do when you have a a
a symbolic expression you make

10552
03:01:18,389 --> 03:01:18,399
a symbolic expression you make
 

10553
03:01:18,399 --> 03:01:20,630
a symbolic expression you make
transformations for symbolic expressions

10554
03:01:20,630 --> 03:01:20,640
transformations for symbolic expressions
 

10555
03:01:20,640 --> 03:01:22,469
transformations for symbolic expressions
well for example one question is there

10556
03:01:22,469 --> 03:01:22,479
well for example one question is there
 

10557
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:23,910
well for example one question is there
may be many transformations that could

10558
03:01:23,910 --> 03:01:23,920
may be many transformations that could
 

10559
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:25,910
may be many transformations that could
be made in a very multi-computational

10560
03:01:25,910 --> 03:01:25,920
be made in a very multi-computational
 

10561
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:27,990
be made in a very multi-computational
kind of way but what we're doing is

10562
03:01:27,990 --> 03:01:28,000
kind of way but what we're doing is
 

10563
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,510
kind of way but what we're doing is
picking we're using the first

10564
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:29,520
picking we're using the first
 

10565
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:32,230
picking we're using the first
transformation that applies and we keep

10566
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:32,240
transformation that applies and we keep
 

10567
03:01:32,240 --> 03:01:34,389
transformation that applies and we keep
doing that until we reach a fixed point

10568
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:34,399
doing that until we reach a fixed point
 

10569
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:36,389
doing that until we reach a fixed point
and that's the result and that's kind of

10570
03:01:36,389 --> 03:01:36,399
and that's the result and that's kind of
 

10571
03:01:36,399 --> 03:01:37,349
and that's the result and that's kind of
a very

10572
03:01:37,349 --> 03:01:37,359
a very
 

10573
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:39,990
a very
it's kind of a way of of sort of sliding

10574
03:01:39,990 --> 03:01:40,000
it's kind of a way of of sort of sliding
 

10575
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,230
it's kind of a way of of sort of sliding
around the edge of multi-computation and

10576
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:42,240
around the edge of multi-computation and
 

10577
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:43,910
around the edge of multi-computation and
back when i was working on smp and

10578
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:43,920
back when i was working on smp and
 

10579
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:45,830
back when i was working on smp and
things i actually thought about these

10580
03:01:45,830 --> 03:01:45,840
things i actually thought about these
 

10581
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:48,790
things i actually thought about these
questions about about how you know how

10582
03:01:48,790 --> 03:01:48,800
questions about about how you know how
 

10583
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,550
questions about about how you know how
what determines the this kind of

10584
03:01:50,550 --> 03:01:50,560
what determines the this kind of
 

10585
03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:52,790
what determines the this kind of
evaluation path so for example you know

10586
03:01:52,790 --> 03:01:52,800
evaluation path so for example you know
 

10587
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:54,469
evaluation path so for example you know
you work out fibonacci you know

10588
03:01:54,469 --> 03:01:54,479
you work out fibonacci you know
 

10589
03:01:54,479 --> 03:01:56,710
you work out fibonacci you know
fibonacci is a recursive thing f of n is

10590
03:01:56,710 --> 03:01:56,720
fibonacci is a recursive thing f of n is
 

10591
03:01:56,720 --> 03:01:58,950
fibonacci is a recursive thing f of n is
f of n minus one plus f of n minus two

10592
03:01:58,950 --> 03:01:58,960
f of n minus one plus f of n minus two
 

10593
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:01,030
f of n minus one plus f of n minus two
and you get this whole tree of recursion

10594
03:02:01,030 --> 03:02:01,040
and you get this whole tree of recursion
 

10595
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:02,870
and you get this whole tree of recursion
right and there's the question of how do

10596
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:02,880
right and there's the question of how do
 

10597
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:04,550
right and there's the question of how do
you evaluate that tree of recursion do

10598
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:04,560
you evaluate that tree of recursion do
 

10599
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:06,630
you evaluate that tree of recursion do
you do it sort of depth first where you

10600
03:02:06,630 --> 03:02:06,640
you do it sort of depth first where you
 

10601
03:02:06,640 --> 03:02:08,230
you do it sort of depth first where you
go all the way down one side do you do

10602
03:02:08,230 --> 03:02:08,240
go all the way down one side do you do
 

10603
03:02:08,240 --> 03:02:10,150
go all the way down one side do you do
it breadth first where you're kind of

10604
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:10,160
it breadth first where you're kind of
 

10605
03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:12,389
it breadth first where you're kind of
collecting the terms together where you

10606
03:02:12,389 --> 03:02:12,399
collecting the terms together where you
 

10607
03:02:12,399 --> 03:02:13,910
collecting the terms together where you
know that you know f of a plus f of

10608
03:02:13,910 --> 03:02:13,920
know that you know f of a plus f of
 

10609
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:15,990
know that you know f of a plus f of
seven f of seven plus f of six you can

10610
03:02:15,990 --> 03:02:16,000
seven f of seven plus f of six you can
 

10611
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,389
seven f of seven plus f of six you can
collect the f of sevens and so on these

10612
03:02:18,389 --> 03:02:18,399
collect the f of sevens and so on these
 

10613
03:02:18,399 --> 03:02:20,469
collect the f of sevens and so on these
are um you know i didn't realize that at

10614
03:02:20,469 --> 03:02:20,479
are um you know i didn't realize that at
 

10615
03:02:20,479 --> 03:02:21,590
are um you know i didn't realize that at
the time it's kind of funny i was

10616
03:02:21,590 --> 03:02:21,600
the time it's kind of funny i was
 

10617
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:23,830
the time it's kind of funny i was
working on on gauge field theories back

10618
03:02:23,830 --> 03:02:23,840
working on on gauge field theories back
 

10619
03:02:23,840 --> 03:02:26,150
working on on gauge field theories back
in 1979 and i was also working on the

10620
03:02:26,150 --> 03:02:26,160
in 1979 and i was also working on the
 

10621
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:28,150
in 1979 and i was also working on the
evaluation model

10622
03:02:28,150 --> 03:02:28,160
evaluation model
 

10623
03:02:28,160 --> 03:02:30,870
evaluation model
in smp and they're the same problem but

10624
03:02:30,870 --> 03:02:30,880
in smp and they're the same problem but
 

10625
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:33,349
in smp and they're the same problem but
it took me 40 more years to realize that

10626
03:02:33,349 --> 03:02:33,359
it took me 40 more years to realize that
 

10627
03:02:33,359 --> 03:02:35,590
it took me 40 more years to realize that
and this question about how you do this

10628
03:02:35,590 --> 03:02:35,600
and this question about how you do this
 

10629
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:37,510
and this question about how you do this
sort of evaluation front that's a

10630
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:37,520
sort of evaluation front that's a
 

10631
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,429
sort of evaluation front that's a
question of reference frames it's a

10632
03:02:39,429 --> 03:02:39,439
question of reference frames it's a
 

10633
03:02:39,439 --> 03:02:41,990
question of reference frames it's a
question of of kind of the um the story

10634
03:02:41,990 --> 03:02:42,000
question of of kind of the um the story
 

10635
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,309
question of of kind of the um the story
of i mean that that's that is basically

10636
03:02:44,309 --> 03:02:44,319
of i mean that that's that is basically
 

10637
03:02:44,319 --> 03:02:46,550
of i mean that that's that is basically
this question of in what order is the

10638
03:02:46,550 --> 03:02:46,560
this question of in what order is the
 

10639
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,230
this question of in what order is the
universe evaluated

10640
03:02:48,230 --> 03:02:48,240
universe evaluated
 

10641
03:02:48,240 --> 03:02:50,550
universe evaluated
and that and so what you realize is

10642
03:02:50,550 --> 03:02:50,560
and that and so what you realize is
 

10643
03:02:50,560 --> 03:02:52,309
and that and so what you realize is
there's this whole sort of world of

10644
03:02:52,309 --> 03:02:52,319
there's this whole sort of world of
 

10645
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:53,830
there's this whole sort of world of
different kinds of computation that you

10646
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:53,840
different kinds of computation that you
 

10647
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:56,309
different kinds of computation that you
can do sort of multi-computationally and

10648
03:02:56,309 --> 03:02:56,319
can do sort of multi-computationally and
 

10649
03:02:56,319 --> 03:02:58,150
can do sort of multi-computationally and
that's a that's an interesting thing it

10650
03:02:58,150 --> 03:02:58,160
that's a that's an interesting thing it
 

10651
03:02:58,160 --> 03:02:59,190
that's a that's an interesting thing it
has a lot of implications for

10652
03:02:59,190 --> 03:02:59,200
has a lot of implications for
 

10653
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:01,190
has a lot of implications for
distributed computing and so on

10654
03:03:01,190 --> 03:03:01,200
distributed computing and so on
 

10655
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:02,710
distributed computing and so on
it also has a potential implication for

10656
03:03:02,710 --> 03:03:02,720
it also has a potential implication for
 

10657
03:03:02,720 --> 03:03:04,630
it also has a potential implication for
blockchain which we haven't fully worked

10658
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:04,640
blockchain which we haven't fully worked
 

10659
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:06,950
blockchain which we haven't fully worked
out which is some and this is not what

10660
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:06,960
out which is some and this is not what
 

10661
03:03:06,960 --> 03:03:08,550
out which is some and this is not what
we're doing with cardano but but this is

10662
03:03:08,550 --> 03:03:08,560
we're doing with cardano but but this is
 

10663
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:12,309
we're doing with cardano but but this is
a different thing um the um this is

10664
03:03:12,309 --> 03:03:12,319
a different thing um the um this is
 

10665
03:03:12,319 --> 03:03:14,710
a different thing um the um this is
something where uh one of the questions

10666
03:03:14,710 --> 03:03:14,720
something where uh one of the questions
 

10667
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:15,429
something where uh one of the questions
is

10668
03:03:15,429 --> 03:03:15,439
is
 

10669
03:03:15,439 --> 03:03:17,190
is
um when you have

10670
03:03:17,190 --> 03:03:17,200
um when you have
 

10671
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:19,030
um when you have
in a sense blockchain is a deeply

10672
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:19,040
in a sense blockchain is a deeply
 

10673
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,750
in a sense blockchain is a deeply
sequentialized story of time because in

10674
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:21,760
sequentialized story of time because in
 

10675
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:24,070
sequentialized story of time because in
blockchain there's just one copy of the

10676
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:24,080
blockchain there's just one copy of the
 

10677
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:26,469
blockchain there's just one copy of the
of the ledger and you're saying this is

10678
03:03:26,469 --> 03:03:26,479
of the ledger and you're saying this is
 

10679
03:03:26,479 --> 03:03:28,389
of the ledger and you're saying this is
what happened you know time has

10680
03:03:28,389 --> 03:03:28,399
what happened you know time has
 

10681
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:29,670
what happened you know time has
progressed in this way and the other

10682
03:03:29,670 --> 03:03:29,680
progressed in this way and the other
 

10683
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:31,429
progressed in this way and the other
little things around the edge as as you

10684
03:03:31,429 --> 03:03:31,439
little things around the edge as as you
 

10685
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:33,510
little things around the edge as as you
try and reach consensus and so on and

10686
03:03:33,510 --> 03:03:33,520
try and reach consensus and so on and
 

10687
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:35,510
try and reach consensus and so on and
and uh you know actually we just

10688
03:03:35,510 --> 03:03:35,520
and uh you know actually we just
 

10689
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:37,429
and uh you know actually we just
recently we've had this little

10690
03:03:37,429 --> 03:03:37,439
recently we've had this little
 

10691
03:03:37,439 --> 03:03:39,110
recently we've had this little
conference we organized about the the

10692
03:03:39,110 --> 03:03:39,120
conference we organized about the the
 

10693
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:40,630
conference we organized about the the
theory of distributed consensus because

10694
03:03:40,630 --> 03:03:40,640
theory of distributed consensus because
 

10695
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:42,469
theory of distributed consensus because
i realized that a bunch of interesting

10696
03:03:42,469 --> 03:03:42,479
i realized that a bunch of interesting
 

10697
03:03:42,479 --> 03:03:44,389
i realized that a bunch of interesting
things that some of our science can tell

10698
03:03:44,389 --> 03:03:44,399
things that some of our science can tell
 

10699
03:03:44,399 --> 03:03:45,990
things that some of our science can tell
one about that but that's a different

10700
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:46,000
one about that but that's a different
 

10701
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,830
one about that but that's a different
let's let's not go down that that part

10702
03:03:47,830 --> 03:03:47,840
let's let's not go down that that part
 

10703
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:49,349
let's let's not go down that that part
yeah but distributed consensus is that

10704
03:03:49,349 --> 03:03:49,359
yeah but distributed consensus is that
 

10705
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:51,110
yeah but distributed consensus is that
still has a sequential there's like

10706
03:03:51,110 --> 03:03:51,120
still has a sequential there's like
 

10707
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:53,110
still has a sequential there's like
there's still sequentiality so just

10708
03:03:53,110 --> 03:03:53,120
there's still sequentiality so just
 

10709
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:55,110
there's still sequentiality so just
don't tell me you're thinking through

10710
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:55,120
don't tell me you're thinking through
 

10711
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:57,510
don't tell me you're thinking through
like how to apply multi-computation to

10712
03:03:57,510 --> 03:03:57,520
like how to apply multi-computation to
 

10713
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:01,110
like how to apply multi-computation to
uh blockchain yes and so so that becomes

10714
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,120
uh blockchain yes and so so that becomes
 

10715
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:03,750
uh blockchain yes and so so that becomes
a story of you know instead of

10716
03:04:03,750 --> 03:04:03,760
a story of you know instead of
 

10717
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:05,830
a story of you know instead of
transactions all having to settle in one

10718
03:04:05,830 --> 03:04:05,840
transactions all having to settle in one
 

10719
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:08,309
transactions all having to settle in one
ledger it's like a story of all these

10720
03:04:08,309 --> 03:04:08,319
ledger it's like a story of all these
 

10721
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:10,230
ledger it's like a story of all these
different ledgers and they all have to

10722
03:04:10,230 --> 03:04:10,240
different ledgers and they all have to
 

10723
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:12,469
different ledgers and they all have to
have some ultimate consistency which is

10724
03:04:12,469 --> 03:04:12,479
have some ultimate consistency which is
 

10725
03:04:12,479 --> 03:04:14,389
have some ultimate consistency which is
what causal and variance would give one

10726
03:04:14,389 --> 03:04:14,399
what causal and variance would give one
 

10727
03:04:14,399 --> 03:04:16,710
what causal and variance would give one
but it can take a while and the it can

10728
03:04:16,710 --> 03:04:16,720
but it can take a while and the it can
 

10729
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:18,150
but it can take a while and the it can
take a while as kind of like quantum

10730
03:04:18,150 --> 03:04:18,160
take a while as kind of like quantum
 

10731
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:19,990
take a while as kind of like quantum
mechanics so it's kind of what's

10732
03:04:19,990 --> 03:04:20,000
mechanics so it's kind of what's
 

10733
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,070
mechanics so it's kind of what's
happening is that these different paths

10734
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,080
happening is that these different paths
 

10735
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:24,630
happening is that these different paths
of history that correspond to you know

10736
03:04:24,630 --> 03:04:24,640
of history that correspond to you know
 

10737
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:26,710
of history that correspond to you know
in one part of history you got paid this

10738
03:04:26,710 --> 03:04:26,720
in one part of history you got paid this
 

10739
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:28,150
in one part of history you got paid this
amount in another path of history you

10740
03:04:28,150 --> 03:04:28,160
amount in another path of history you
 

10741
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:30,710
amount in another path of history you
got paid this amount in the end the

10742
03:04:30,710 --> 03:04:30,720
got paid this amount in the end the
 

10743
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:32,469
got paid this amount in the end the
universe will always become consistent

10744
03:04:32,469 --> 03:04:32,479
universe will always become consistent
 

10745
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:36,150
universe will always become consistent
now now the way it will it works is okay

10746
03:04:36,150 --> 03:04:36,160
now now the way it will it works is okay
 

10747
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:37,349
now now the way it will it works is okay
it's a little bit more complicated than

10748
03:04:37,349 --> 03:04:37,359
it's a little bit more complicated than
 

10749
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:39,750
it's a little bit more complicated than
that what happens is the way space is

10750
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:39,760
that what happens is the way space is
 

10751
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:41,110
that what happens is the way space is
knitted together in our theory of

10752
03:04:41,110 --> 03:04:41,120
knitted together in our theory of
 

10753
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:43,670
knitted together in our theory of
physics is through all these events

10754
03:04:43,670 --> 03:04:43,680
physics is through all these events
 

10755
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:46,710
physics is through all these events
and the the the idea is that the way

10756
03:04:46,710 --> 03:04:46,720
and the the the idea is that the way
 

10757
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:49,510
and the the the idea is that the way
that economic space is knitted together

10758
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:49,520
that economic space is knitted together
 

10759
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,910
that economic space is knitted together
is between is there these autonomous

10760
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:51,920
is between is there these autonomous
 

10761
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:53,510
is between is there these autonomous
events that essentially knit together

10762
03:04:53,510 --> 03:04:53,520
events that essentially knit together
 

10763
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:55,429
events that essentially knit together
economic space so there are all these

10764
03:04:55,429 --> 03:04:55,439
economic space so there are all these
 

10765
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:56,790
economic space so there are all these
threads of transactions that are

10766
03:04:56,790 --> 03:04:56,800
threads of transactions that are
 

10767
03:04:56,800 --> 03:04:58,630
threads of transactions that are
happening and the question is can they

10768
03:04:58,630 --> 03:04:58,640
happening and the question is can they
 

10769
03:04:58,640 --> 03:04:59,990
happening and the question is can they
be made consistent are there is there

10770
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,000
be made consistent are there is there
 

10771
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,150
be made consistent are there is there
something forcing them to be sort of a

10772
03:05:02,150 --> 03:05:02,160
something forcing them to be sort of a
 

10773
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:05,429
something forcing them to be sort of a
consistent fabric of economic reality

10774
03:05:05,429 --> 03:05:05,439
consistent fabric of economic reality
 

10775
03:05:05,439 --> 03:05:07,910
consistent fabric of economic reality
and sort of what this has led me to is

10776
03:05:07,910 --> 03:05:07,920
and sort of what this has led me to is
 

10777
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:09,830
and sort of what this has led me to is
trying to realize how does economics

10778
03:05:09,830 --> 03:05:09,840
trying to realize how does economics
 

10779
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:11,349
trying to realize how does economics
fundamentally work

10780
03:05:11,349 --> 03:05:11,359
fundamentally work
 

10781
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:14,309
fundamentally work
and you know what is economics and uh

10782
03:05:14,309 --> 03:05:14,319
and you know what is economics and uh
 

10783
03:05:14,319 --> 03:05:15,830
and you know what is economics and uh
you know what what are the atoms of

10784
03:05:15,830 --> 03:05:15,840
you know what what are the atoms of
 

10785
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:18,550
you know what what are the atoms of
economics right so to speak and so what

10786
03:05:18,550 --> 03:05:18,560
economics right so to speak and so what
 

10787
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:20,870
economics right so to speak and so what
i've kind of realized is that that sort

10788
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:20,880
i've kind of realized is that that sort
 

10789
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:21,990
i've kind of realized is that that sort
of the

10790
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
of the
 

10791
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,510
of the
perhaps i don't even know if this is

10792
03:05:23,510 --> 03:05:23,520
perhaps i don't even know if this is
 

10793
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:25,429
perhaps i don't even know if this is
right yet there's sort of events in

10794
03:05:25,429 --> 03:05:25,439
right yet there's sort of events in
 

10795
03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:27,750
right yet there's sort of events in
economics of transactions there are

10796
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:27,760
economics of transactions there are
 

10797
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,830
economics of transactions there are
states of agents that are kind of the

10798
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:29,840
states of agents that are kind of the
 

10799
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:31,590
states of agents that are kind of the
atoms of economics

10800
03:05:31,590 --> 03:05:31,600
atoms of economics
 

10801
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:34,710
atoms of economics
and then transactions are kind of agents

10802
03:05:34,710 --> 03:05:34,720
and then transactions are kind of agents
 

10803
03:05:34,720 --> 03:05:36,469
and then transactions are kind of agents
transact and some

10804
03:05:36,469 --> 03:05:36,479
transact and some
 

10805
03:05:36,479 --> 03:05:38,630
transact and some
transact in some way and that's an event

10806
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:38,640
transact in some way and that's an event
 

10807
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:40,710
transact in some way and that's an event
and then the question is how do you knit

10808
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:40,720
and then the question is how do you knit
 

10809
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:42,710
and then the question is how do you knit
together sort of economic space from

10810
03:05:42,710 --> 03:05:42,720
together sort of economic space from
 

10811
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:44,790
together sort of economic space from
that what is there an economic space

10812
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:44,800
that what is there an economic space
 

10813
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:46,630
that what is there an economic space
well all these transactions there's a

10814
03:05:46,630 --> 03:05:46,640
well all these transactions there's a
 

10815
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:48,230
well all these transactions there's a
whole complicated collection of possible

10816
03:05:48,230 --> 03:05:48,240
whole complicated collection of possible
 

10817
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:50,070
whole complicated collection of possible
transactions but one thing that's true

10818
03:05:50,070 --> 03:05:50,080
transactions but one thing that's true
 

10819
03:05:50,080 --> 03:05:52,309
transactions but one thing that's true
about economics is we tend to have the

10820
03:05:52,309 --> 03:05:52,319
about economics is we tend to have the
 

10821
03:05:52,319 --> 03:05:54,710
about economics is we tend to have the
notion of a definite value for things

10822
03:05:54,710 --> 03:05:54,720
notion of a definite value for things
 

10823
03:05:54,720 --> 03:05:56,150
notion of a definite value for things
we could imagine

10824
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:56,160
we could imagine
 

10825
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:58,950
we could imagine
that you know you buy

10826
03:05:58,950 --> 03:05:58,960
that you know you buy

from somebody and
they want to get a movie ticket

they want to get a movie ticket

they want to get a movie ticket

and there is some way that ai bots could
 

10835
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:09,750
and there is some way that ai bots could
make some path

03:06:13,910 --> 03:06:13,920
all these different trans intermediate

03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:15,269
all these different trans intermediate
transactions

transactions
 

10843
03:06:15,279 --> 03:06:16,630
transactions
but in fact

10844
03:06:16,630 --> 03:06:16,640
but in fact
 

10845
03:06:16,640 --> 03:06:18,950
but in fact
we have an approximation to that which

10846
03:06:18,950 --> 03:06:18,960
we have an approximation to that which
 

10847
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:21,510
we have an approximation to that which
is we say they each have a dollar value

10848
03:06:21,510 --> 03:06:21,520
is we say they each have a dollar value
 

10849
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:24,150
is we say they each have a dollar value
and we have this kind of numeric concept

10850
03:06:24,150 --> 03:06:24,160
and we have this kind of numeric concept
 

10851
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:27,030
and we have this kind of numeric concept
of there's just a way of kind of of of

10852
03:06:27,030 --> 03:06:27,040
of there's just a way of kind of of of
 

10853
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:28,710
of there's just a way of kind of of of
taking this whole complicated space of

10854
03:06:28,710 --> 03:06:28,720
taking this whole complicated space of
 

10855
03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:31,830
taking this whole complicated space of
transactions and parsing it in something

10856
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:31,840
transactions and parsing it in something
 

10857
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:34,150
transactions and parsing it in something
which is a kind of a simplified thing

10858
03:06:34,150 --> 03:06:34,160
which is a kind of a simplified thing
 

10859
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:36,230
which is a kind of a simplified thing
that is kind of like our parsing of

10860
03:06:36,230 --> 03:06:36,240
that is kind of like our parsing of
 

10861
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:37,590
that is kind of like our parsing of
physical space

10862
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:37,600
physical space
 

10863
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:40,870
physical space
and so my my guess is that the uh yet

10864
03:06:40,870 --> 03:06:40,880
and so my my guess is that the uh yet
 

10865
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:42,630
and so my my guess is that the uh yet
again i mean it's crazy that all these

10866
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:42,640
again i mean it's crazy that all these
 

10867
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:44,790
again i mean it's crazy that all these
things are so connected this is another

10868
03:06:44,790 --> 03:06:44,800
things are so connected this is another
 

10869
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:47,910
things are so connected this is another
multi-computation story another story of

10870
03:06:47,910 --> 03:06:47,920
multi-computation story another story of
 

10871
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:49,269
multi-computation story another story of
where what's happening is that the

10872
03:06:49,269 --> 03:06:49,279
where what's happening is that the
 

10873
03:06:49,279 --> 03:06:51,830
where what's happening is that the
economic consciousness the economic

10874
03:06:51,830 --> 03:06:51,840
economic consciousness the economic
 

10875
03:06:51,840 --> 03:06:54,550
economic consciousness the economic
observer is not going to deal with all

10876
03:06:54,550 --> 03:06:54,560

10877
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,750
observer is not going to deal with all
of those a different microscopic

03:06:55,750 --> 03:06:55,760
of those a different microscopic
 

10879
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:57,590
of those a different microscopic
transactions they're just going to parse

10880
03:06:57,590 --> 03:06:57,600
transactions they're just going to parse
 

10881
03:06:57,600 --> 03:06:59,349
transactions they're just going to parse
the whole thing by saying there's this

10882
03:06:59,349 --> 03:06:59,359
the whole thing by saying there's this
 

10883
03:06:59,359 --> 03:07:01,670
the whole thing by saying there's this
value it's a number and that's that's

10884
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:01,680
value it's a number and that's that's
 

10885
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:03,910
value it's a number and that's that's
their understanding of their summary of

10886
03:07:03,910 --> 03:07:03,920
their understanding of their summary of
 

10887
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:05,910
their understanding of their summary of
this economic network and there will be

10888
03:07:05,910 --> 03:07:05,920
this economic network and there will be
 

10889
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:07,349
this economic network and there will be
all kinds of things like there are all

10890
03:07:07,349 --> 03:07:07,359
all kinds of things like there are all
 

10891
03:07:07,359 --> 03:07:09,110
all kinds of things like there are all
kinds of arbitrage opportunities which

10892
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:09,120
kinds of arbitrage opportunities which
 

10893
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:11,030
kinds of arbitrage opportunities which
are kind of like the quantum effects in

10894
03:07:11,030 --> 03:07:11,040
are kind of like the quantum effects in
 

10895
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:13,670
are kind of like the quantum effects in
this whole thing and um that's uh you

10896
03:07:13,670 --> 03:07:13,680
this whole thing and um that's uh you
 

10897
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:15,510
this whole thing and um that's uh you
know and places where there's where

10898
03:07:15,510 --> 03:07:15,520
know and places where there's where
 

10899
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:16,950
know and places where there's where
there's sort of different paths that can

10900
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:16,960
there's sort of different paths that can
 

10901
03:07:16,960 --> 03:07:20,950
there's sort of different paths that can
be followed and and so on and there's so

10902
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:20,960
be followed and and so on and there's so
 

10903
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:23,030
be followed and and so on and there's so
the question is can one make a sort of

10904
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:23,040
the question is can one make a sort of
 

10905
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,349
the question is can one make a sort of
global theory of economics and then my

10906
03:07:25,349 --> 03:07:25,359
global theory of economics and then my
 

10907
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:28,070
global theory of economics and then my
test case is again what is time dilation

10908
03:07:28,070 --> 03:07:28,080
test case is again what is time dilation
 

10909
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,510
test case is again what is time dilation
and economics

10910
03:07:29,510 --> 03:07:29,520
and economics
 

10911
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:31,590
and economics
and and i know for you know if you

10912
03:07:31,590 --> 03:07:31,600
and and i know for you know if you
 

10913
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:33,429
and and i know for you know if you
imagine a very agricultural economics

10914
03:07:33,429 --> 03:07:33,439
imagine a very agricultural economics
 

10915
03:07:33,439 --> 03:07:35,110
imagine a very agricultural economics
where people are growing lettuces and

10916
03:07:35,110 --> 03:07:35,120
where people are growing lettuces and
 

10917
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:37,110
where people are growing lettuces and
fields and things like this and you ask

10918
03:07:37,110 --> 03:07:37,120
fields and things like this and you ask
 

10919
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:38,389
fields and things like this and you ask
questions about well if you're

10920
03:07:38,389 --> 03:07:38,399
questions about well if you're
 

10921
03:07:38,399 --> 03:07:39,990
questions about well if you're
transporting lettuces to different

10922
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:40,000
transporting lettuces to different
 

10923
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,150
transporting lettuces to different
places you know what is the value of the

10924
03:07:42,150 --> 03:07:42,160
places you know what is the value of the
 

10925
03:07:42,160 --> 03:07:44,309
places you know what is the value of the
lettuces after you have to transport

10926
03:07:44,309 --> 03:07:44,319
lettuces after you have to transport
 

10927
03:07:44,319 --> 03:07:46,070
lettuces after you have to transport
them versus if you're just sitting in

10928
03:07:46,070 --> 03:07:46,080
them versus if you're just sitting in
 

10929
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:47,910
them versus if you're just sitting in
one place and selling them you can kind

10930
03:07:47,910 --> 03:07:47,920
one place and selling them you can kind
 

10931
03:07:47,920 --> 03:07:49,349
one place and selling them you can kind
of get a little bit of an analogy there

10932
03:07:49,349 --> 03:07:49,359
of get a little bit of an analogy there
 

10933
03:07:49,359 --> 03:07:50,870
of get a little bit of an analogy there
but i think there's a there's a better

10934
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:50,880
but i think there's a there's a better
 

10935
03:07:50,880 --> 03:07:52,389
but i think there's a there's a better
and more complete analogy

10936
03:07:52,389 --> 03:07:52,399
and more complete analogy
 

10937
03:07:52,399 --> 03:07:54,070
and more complete analogy
and that's the question of is there a

10938
03:07:54,070 --> 03:07:54,080
and that's the question of is there a
 

10939
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:56,070
and that's the question of is there a
theory like general relativity that is a

10940
03:07:56,070 --> 03:07:56,080
theory like general relativity that is a
 

10941
03:07:56,080 --> 03:07:58,309
theory like general relativity that is a
global theory of economics and is it

10942
03:07:58,309 --> 03:07:58,319
global theory of economics and is it
 

10943
03:07:58,319 --> 03:08:00,230
global theory of economics and is it
about something we care about it could

10944
03:08:00,230 --> 03:08:00,240
about something we care about it could
 

10945
03:08:00,240 --> 03:08:01,590
about something we care about it could
be that there is a global theory but

10946
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:01,600
be that there is a global theory but
 

10947
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:03,990
be that there is a global theory but
it's about a feature of economic reality

10948
03:08:03,990 --> 03:08:04,000
it's about a feature of economic reality
 

10949
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,230
it's about a feature of economic reality
that isn't important to us now another

10950
03:08:06,230 --> 03:08:06,240
that isn't important to us now another
 

10951
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:08,790
that isn't important to us now another
part of the story is can one use those

10952
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:08,800
part of the story is can one use those
 

10953
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:11,110
part of the story is can one use those
ideas to make essentially a distributed

10954
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:11,120
ideas to make essentially a distributed
 

10955
03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:13,590
ideas to make essentially a distributed
blockchain a distributed generalization

10956
03:08:13,590 --> 03:08:13,600
blockchain a distributed generalization
 

10957
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:15,910
blockchain a distributed generalization
of blockchain kind of the quantum analog

10958
03:08:15,910 --> 03:08:15,920
of blockchain kind of the quantum analog
 

10959
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:17,910
of blockchain kind of the quantum analog
of money so to speak where where you

10960
03:08:17,910 --> 03:08:17,920
of money so to speak where where you
 

10961
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:19,830
of money so to speak where where you
have for example you can have

10962
03:08:19,830 --> 03:08:19,840
have for example you can have
 

10963
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:21,349
have for example you can have
uncertainty relations where you're

10964
03:08:21,349 --> 03:08:21,359
uncertainty relations where you're
 

10965
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:23,990
uncertainty relations where you're
saying you know well if i if i insist on

10966
03:08:23,990 --> 03:08:24,000
saying you know well if i if i insist on
 

10967
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,070
saying you know well if i if i insist on
knowing my bank account right now

10968
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,080
knowing my bank account right now
 

10969
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:27,990
knowing my bank account right now
there'll be some uncertainty if i'm

10970
03:08:27,990 --> 03:08:28,000
there'll be some uncertainty if i'm
 

10971
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,230
there'll be some uncertainty if i'm
prepared to wait a while then it'll be

10972
03:08:30,230 --> 03:08:30,240
prepared to wait a while then it'll be
 

10973
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:32,790
prepared to wait a while then it'll be
much more certain um and so there's you

10974
03:08:32,790 --> 03:08:32,800
much more certain um and so there's you
 

10975
03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:34,630
much more certain um and so there's you
know is there a way of using and so

10976
03:08:34,630 --> 03:08:34,640
know is there a way of using and so
 

10977
03:08:34,640 --> 03:08:37,269
know is there a way of using and so
we've made a bunch of prototypes of this

10978
03:08:37,269 --> 03:08:37,279
we've made a bunch of prototypes of this
 

10979
03:08:37,279 --> 03:08:39,670
we've made a bunch of prototypes of this
um which i'm not yet happy with because

10980
03:08:39,670 --> 03:08:39,680
um which i'm not yet happy with because
 

10981
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:41,910
um which i'm not yet happy with because
what i realized is to really understand

10982
03:08:41,910 --> 03:08:41,920
what i realized is to really understand
 

10983
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:43,269
what i realized is to really understand
these prototypes actually have to have a

10984
03:08:43,269 --> 03:08:43,279
these prototypes actually have to have a
 

10985
03:08:43,279 --> 03:08:45,429
these prototypes actually have to have a
foundational theory of economics and so

10986
03:08:45,429 --> 03:08:45,439
foundational theory of economics and so
 

10987
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:47,750
foundational theory of economics and so
that's kind of a uh you know it may be

10988
03:08:47,750 --> 03:08:47,760
that's kind of a uh you know it may be
 

10989
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:49,110
that's kind of a uh you know it may be
that we could deploy one of these

10990
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:49,120
that we could deploy one of these
 

10991
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:51,269
that we could deploy one of these
prototypes as a practical system but i

10992
03:08:51,269 --> 03:08:51,279
prototypes as a practical system but i
 

10993
03:08:51,279 --> 03:08:52,230
prototypes as a practical system but i
think it's really going to be much

10994
03:08:52,230 --> 03:08:52,240
think it's really going to be much
 

10995
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:53,830
think it's really going to be much
better if we actually have an

10996
03:08:53,830 --> 03:08:53,840
better if we actually have an
 

10997
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:55,429
better if we actually have an
understanding of how this plugs into

10998
03:08:55,429 --> 03:08:55,439
understanding of how this plugs into
 

10999
03:08:55,439 --> 03:08:57,429
understanding of how this plugs into
kind of the economics that means like a

11000
03:08:57,429 --> 03:08:57,439
kind of the economics that means like a
 

11001
03:08:57,439 --> 03:08:59,349
kind of the economics that means like a
fundamental theory of transactions

11002
03:08:59,349 --> 03:08:59,359
fundamental theory of transactions
 

11003
03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:00,389
fundamental theory of transactions
between

11004
03:09:00,389 --> 03:09:00,399
between
 

11005
03:09:00,399 --> 03:09:02,469
between
entities well that's that's what you

11006
03:09:02,469 --> 03:09:02,479
entities well that's that's what you
 

11007
03:09:02,479 --> 03:09:04,870
entities well that's that's what you
mean by economics yes i think so but i

11008
03:09:04,870 --> 03:09:04,880
mean by economics yes i think so but i
 

11009
03:09:04,880 --> 03:09:07,590
mean by economics yes i think so but i
mean you know how how there emerge sort

11010
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:07,600
mean you know how how there emerge sort
 

11011
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:09,190
mean you know how how there emerge sort
of laws of economics i don't even know

11012
03:09:09,190 --> 03:09:09,200
of laws of economics i don't even know
 

11013
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:10,710
of laws of economics i don't even know
and i've been asking friends of mine who

11014
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:10,720
and i've been asking friends of mine who
 

11015
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:12,870
and i've been asking friends of mine who
are who are economists and things what

11016
03:09:12,870 --> 03:09:12,880
are who are economists and things what
 

11017
03:09:12,880 --> 03:09:15,590
are who are economists and things what
is economics you know is it an axiomatic

11018
03:09:15,590 --> 03:09:15,600
is economics you know is it an axiomatic
 

11019
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:18,070
is economics you know is it an axiomatic
theory is it a theory that is a kind of

11020
03:09:18,070 --> 03:09:18,080
theory is it a theory that is a kind of
 

11021
03:09:18,080 --> 03:09:20,710
theory is it a theory that is a kind of
a qualitative description theory is it

11022
03:09:20,710 --> 03:09:20,720
a qualitative description theory is it
 

11023
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:22,550
a qualitative description theory is it
you know what kind of a theory is it is

11024
03:09:22,550 --> 03:09:22,560
you know what kind of a theory is it is
 

11025
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:24,150
you know what kind of a theory is it is
it a theory you know what kind of

11026
03:09:24,150 --> 03:09:24,160
it a theory you know what kind of
 

11027
03:09:24,160 --> 03:09:26,469
it a theory you know what kind of
thinking it's like like in in biology

11028
03:09:26,469 --> 03:09:26,479
thinking it's like like in in biology
 

11029
03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:27,990
thinking it's like like in in biology
and evolutionary biology for example

11030
03:09:27,990 --> 03:09:28,000
and evolutionary biology for example
 

11031
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,429
and evolutionary biology for example
there's a certain there's a certain

11032
03:09:29,429 --> 03:09:29,439
there's a certain there's a certain
 

11033
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:30,790
there's a certain there's a certain
pattern of thinking that goes on in

11034
03:09:30,790 --> 03:09:30,800
pattern of thinking that goes on in
 

11035
03:09:30,800 --> 03:09:33,030
pattern of thinking that goes on in
evolutionary biology where if you're a

11036
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:33,040
evolutionary biology where if you're a
 

11037
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:34,950
evolutionary biology where if you're a
you know a good evolutionary biologist

11038
03:09:34,950 --> 03:09:34,960
you know a good evolutionary biologist
 

11039
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:37,110
you know a good evolutionary biologist
somebody says that creature has a weird

11040
03:09:37,110 --> 03:09:37,120
somebody says that creature has a weird
 

11041
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:39,510
somebody says that creature has a weird
horn and they'll say well that's because

11042
03:09:39,510 --> 03:09:39,520
horn and they'll say well that's because
 

11043
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:41,190
horn and they'll say well that's because
this and this and this and the selection

11044
03:09:41,190 --> 03:09:41,200
this and this and this and the selection
 

11045
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:43,429
this and this and this and the selection
of this kind and that kind and that's

11046
03:09:43,429 --> 03:09:43,439
of this kind and that kind and that's
 

11047
03:09:43,439 --> 03:09:44,550
of this kind and that kind and that's
the story

11048
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:44,560
the story
 

11049
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:46,550
the story
and it's not a mathematical story it's a

11050
03:09:46,550 --> 03:09:46,560
and it's not a mathematical story it's a
 

11051
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:48,469
and it's not a mathematical story it's a
story of a different type of thinking

11052
03:09:48,469 --> 03:09:48,479
story of a different type of thinking
 

11053
03:09:48,479 --> 03:09:50,469
story of a different type of thinking
about these things by the way

11054
03:09:50,469 --> 03:09:50,479
about these things by the way
 

11055
03:09:50,479 --> 03:09:52,150
about these things by the way
evolutionary biology is yet another

11056
03:09:52,150 --> 03:09:52,160
evolutionary biology is yet another
 

11057
03:09:52,160 --> 03:09:53,670
evolutionary biology is yet another
place where it looks like this

11058
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:53,680
place where it looks like this
 

11059
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:56,309
place where it looks like this
multi-computational idea can be applied

11060
03:09:56,309 --> 03:09:56,319
multi-computational idea can be applied
 

11061
03:09:56,319 --> 03:09:58,950
multi-computational idea can be applied
and that's where where maybe speciation

11062
03:09:58,950 --> 03:09:58,960
and that's where where maybe speciation
 

11063
03:09:58,960 --> 03:10:01,349
and that's where where maybe speciation
is related to things like event horizons

11064
03:10:01,349 --> 03:10:01,359
is related to things like event horizons
 

11065
03:10:01,359 --> 03:10:03,429
is related to things like event horizons
and there's a whole whole other kind of

11066
03:10:03,429 --> 03:10:03,439
and there's a whole whole other kind of
 

11067
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:05,269
and there's a whole whole other kind of
world of that but because it seems like

11068
03:10:05,269 --> 03:10:05,279
world of that but because it seems like
 

11069
03:10:05,279 --> 03:10:07,190
world of that but because it seems like
this kind of model can be applicable in

11070
03:10:07,190 --> 03:10:07,200
this kind of model can be applicable in
 

11071
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:10,630
this kind of model can be applicable in
so many aspects like at the different

11072
03:10:10,630 --> 03:10:10,640
so many aspects like at the different
 

11073
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:13,910
so many aspects like at the different
levels of understanding of

11074
03:10:13,910 --> 03:10:13,920
levels of understanding of
 

11075
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:15,910
levels of understanding of
our reality so it could be the biology

11076
03:10:15,910 --> 03:10:15,920
our reality so it could be the biology
 

11077
03:10:15,920 --> 03:10:18,150
our reality so it could be the biology
of the chemistry at the physics level

11078
03:10:18,150 --> 03:10:18,160
of the chemistry at the physics level
 

11079
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:20,389
of the chemistry at the physics level
right the economics and you could

11080
03:10:20,389 --> 03:10:20,399
right the economics and you could
 

11081
03:10:20,399 --> 03:10:21,429
right the economics and you could
potentially

11082
03:10:21,429 --> 03:10:21,439
potentially
 

11083
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:22,870
potentially
the thing is

11084
03:10:22,870 --> 03:10:22,880
the thing is
 

11085
03:10:22,880 --> 03:10:24,229
the thing is
it's like

11086
03:10:24,229 --> 03:10:24,239
it's like
 

11087
03:10:24,239 --> 03:10:26,070
it's like
okay sure at all these levels it might

11088
03:10:26,070 --> 03:10:26,080
okay sure at all these levels it might
 

11089
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:28,309
okay sure at all these levels it might
rhyme it might make sense as a model the

11090
03:10:28,309 --> 03:10:28,319
rhyme it might make sense as a model the
 

11091
03:10:28,319 --> 03:10:29,990
rhyme it might make sense as a model the
question is can you make useful

11092
03:10:29,990 --> 03:10:30,000
question is can you make useful
 

11093
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:31,590
question is can you make useful
predictions that's one of these levels

11094
03:10:31,590 --> 03:10:31,600
predictions that's one of these levels
 

11095
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:33,190
predictions that's one of these levels
that's that's right and that's that's

11096
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:33,200
that's that's right and that's that's
 

11097
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:35,750
that's that's right and that's that's
really a question of you know it's a

11098
03:10:35,750 --> 03:10:35,760
really a question of you know it's a
 

11099
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:37,510
really a question of you know it's a
weird situation because it's a situation

11100
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:37,520
weird situation because it's a situation
 

11101
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:39,030
weird situation because it's a situation
where the model

11102
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:39,040
where the model
 

11103
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:41,830
where the model
probably has definite consequences the

11104
03:10:41,830 --> 03:10:41,840
probably has definite consequences the
 

11105
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:43,269
probably has definite consequences the
question is are there consequences we

11106
03:10:43,269 --> 03:10:43,279
question is are there consequences we
 

11107
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:45,990
question is are there consequences we
care about yeah and and that's some uh

11108
03:10:45,990 --> 03:10:46,000
care about yeah and and that's some uh
 

11109
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:47,349
care about yeah and and that's some uh
you know and so

11110
03:10:47,349 --> 03:10:47,359
you know and so
 

11111
03:10:47,359 --> 03:10:48,070
you know and so
so

11112
03:10:48,070 --> 03:10:48,080
so
 

11113
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:50,469
so
in the case of in the economic case

11114
03:10:50,469 --> 03:10:50,479
in the case of in the economic case
 

11115
03:10:50,479 --> 03:10:52,309
in the case of in the economic case
the um

11116
03:10:52,309 --> 03:10:52,319
the um
 

11117
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:53,190
the um
uh

11118
03:10:53,190 --> 03:10:53,200
uh
 

11119
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:56,150
uh
we're um so you know the one one thing

11120
03:10:56,150 --> 03:10:56,160
we're um so you know the one one thing
 

11121
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:57,990
we're um so you know the one one thing
is this this idea of using kind of

11122
03:10:57,990 --> 03:10:58,000
is this this idea of using kind of
 

11123
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,910
is this this idea of using kind of
physics-like notions

11124
03:10:59,910 --> 03:10:59,920
physics-like notions
 

11125
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:02,070
physics-like notions
to construct a kind of distributed

11126
03:11:02,070 --> 03:11:02,080
to construct a kind of distributed
 

11127
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:04,150
to construct a kind of distributed
analog blockchain okay the much more

11128
03:11:04,150 --> 03:11:04,160
analog blockchain okay the much more
 

11129
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:06,229
analog blockchain okay the much more
pragmatic thing is that it's a different

11130
03:11:06,229 --> 03:11:06,239
pragmatic thing is that it's a different
 

11131
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:08,309
pragmatic thing is that it's a different
direction and it has to do with this

11132
03:11:08,309 --> 03:11:08,319
direction and it has to do with this
 

11133
03:11:08,319 --> 03:11:09,910
direction and it has to do with this
computational language that we built to

11134
03:11:09,910 --> 03:11:09,920
computational language that we built to
 

11135
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:12,229
computational language that we built to
describe the world that knows about you

11136
03:11:12,229 --> 03:11:12,239
describe the world that knows about you
 

11137
03:11:12,239 --> 03:11:14,150
describe the world that knows about you
know different kinds of cookies and

11138
03:11:14,150 --> 03:11:14,160
know different kinds of cookies and
 

11139
03:11:14,160 --> 03:11:16,070
know different kinds of cookies and
knows about different cities and knows

11140
03:11:16,070 --> 03:11:16,080
knows about different cities and knows
 

11141
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:17,990
knows about different cities and knows
about how to compute all these kinds of

11142
03:11:17,990 --> 03:11:18,000
about how to compute all these kinds of
 

11143
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,309
about how to compute all these kinds of
things one of the things that is of

11144
03:11:20,309 --> 03:11:20,319
things one of the things that is of
 

11145
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:23,110
things one of the things that is of
interest is if you want to run the world

11146
03:11:23,110 --> 03:11:23,120
interest is if you want to run the world
 

11147
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:25,110
interest is if you want to run the world
you need you know with with with

11148
03:11:25,110 --> 03:11:25,120
you need you know with with with
 

11149
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:27,590
you need you know with with with
contracts and laws and rules and so on

11150
03:11:27,590 --> 03:11:27,600
contracts and laws and rules and so on
 

11151
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:29,510
contracts and laws and rules and so on
there are rules at a human level and

11152
03:11:29,510 --> 03:11:29,520
there are rules at a human level and
 

11153
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:31,990
there are rules at a human level and
there are kind of um things like

11154
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:32,000
there are kind of um things like
 

11155
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:33,910
there are kind of um things like
and so this this gets one into the idea

11156
03:11:33,910 --> 03:11:33,920
and so this this gets one into the idea
 

11157
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:35,990
and so this this gets one into the idea
of computational contracts you know

11158
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:36,000
of computational contracts you know
 

11159
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,070
of computational contracts you know
right now when we write a contract it's

11160
03:11:38,070 --> 03:11:38,080
right now when we write a contract it's
 

11161
03:11:38,080 --> 03:11:40,469
right now when we write a contract it's
a piece of legalese it's you know it's

11162
03:11:40,469 --> 03:11:40,479
a piece of legalese it's you know it's
 

11163
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:42,389
a piece of legalese it's you know it's
just written in english and it's not

11164
03:11:42,389 --> 03:11:42,399
just written in english and it's not
 

11165
03:11:42,399 --> 03:11:43,750
just written in english and it's not
something that's automatically

11166
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:43,760
something that's automatically
 

11167
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:45,910
something that's automatically
analyzable executable whatever else it's

11168
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:45,920
analyzable executable whatever else it's
 

11169
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:46,790
analyzable executable whatever else it's
just

11170
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:46,800
just
 

11171
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:49,030
just
english you know back in

11172
03:11:49,030 --> 03:11:49,040
english you know back in
 

11173
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:52,309
english you know back in
gottfried leibniz back in you know 1680

11174
03:11:52,309 --> 03:11:52,319
gottfried leibniz back in you know 1680
 

11175
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:55,190
gottfried leibniz back in you know 1680
or whatever was like um i'm gonna you

11176
03:11:55,190 --> 03:11:55,200
or whatever was like um i'm gonna you
 

11177
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:57,830
or whatever was like um i'm gonna you
know figure out how to use logic to

11178
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:57,840
know figure out how to use logic to
 

11179
03:11:57,840 --> 03:11:59,910
know figure out how to use logic to
decide legal cases and so on and he had

11180
03:11:59,910 --> 03:11:59,920
decide legal cases and so on and he had
 

11181
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:01,750
decide legal cases and so on and he had
kind of this idea of let's make a

11182
03:12:01,750 --> 03:12:01,760
kind of this idea of let's make a
 

11183
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:03,750
kind of this idea of let's make a
computational language for the huma the

11184
03:12:03,750 --> 03:12:03,760
computational language for the huma the
 

11185
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:04,950
computational language for the huma the
human law

11186
03:12:04,950 --> 03:12:04,960
human law
 

11187
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:07,590
human law
um forget about modeling nature forgot

11188
03:12:07,590 --> 03:12:07,600
um forget about modeling nature forgot
 

11189
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:09,910
um forget about modeling nature forgot
about natural laws what about human law

11190
03:12:09,910 --> 03:12:09,920
about natural laws what about human law
 

11191
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:11,429
about natural laws what about human law
can we make kind of a computational

11192
03:12:11,429 --> 03:12:11,439
can we make kind of a computational
 

11193
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:13,590
can we make kind of a computational
representation of that well i think

11194
03:12:13,590 --> 03:12:13,600
representation of that well i think
 

11195
03:12:13,600 --> 03:12:15,590
representation of that well i think
finally we're close to being able to do

11196
03:12:15,590 --> 03:12:15,600
finally we're close to being able to do
 

11197
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:17,670
finally we're close to being able to do
that and one of the projects that i hope

11198
03:12:17,670 --> 03:12:17,680
that and one of the projects that i hope
 

11199
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:19,830
that and one of the projects that i hope
to get to as soon as the there's a

11200
03:12:19,830 --> 03:12:19,840
to get to as soon as the there's a
 

11201
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:21,590
to get to as soon as the there's a
little bit of slowing down of some of

11202
03:12:21,590 --> 03:12:21,600
little bit of slowing down of some of
 

11203
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:23,670
little bit of slowing down of some of
this cambrian explosion that's happening

11204
03:12:23,670 --> 03:12:23,680
this cambrian explosion that's happening
 

11205
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:25,349
this cambrian explosion that's happening
as a project i've been meaning to really

11206
03:12:25,349 --> 03:12:25,359
as a project i've been meaning to really
 

11207
03:12:25,359 --> 03:12:27,269
as a project i've been meaning to really
do for a long time which is what i'm

11208
03:12:27,269 --> 03:12:27,279
do for a long time which is what i'm
 

11209
03:12:27,279 --> 03:12:29,110
do for a long time which is what i'm
calling a symbolic discourse language

11210
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:29,120
calling a symbolic discourse language
 

11211
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:31,590
calling a symbolic discourse language
it's is just finishing the job of being

11212
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:31,600
it's is just finishing the job of being
 

11213
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:33,590
it's is just finishing the job of being
able to represent everything like the

11214
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:33,600
able to represent everything like the
 

11215
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:35,510
able to represent everything like the
conversation we're having in

11216
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:35,520
conversation we're having in
 

11217
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:37,910
conversation we're having in
computational terms and one of the use

11218
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:37,920
computational terms and one of the use
 

11219
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:39,349
computational terms and one of the use
cases for that is computational

11220
03:12:39,349 --> 03:12:39,359
cases for that is computational
 

11221
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:41,670
cases for that is computational
contracts another use case is something

11222
03:12:41,670 --> 03:12:41,680
contracts another use case is something
 

11223
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:43,830
contracts another use case is something
like the the constitution that says what

11224
03:12:43,830 --> 03:12:43,840
like the the constitution that says what
 

11225
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:46,070
like the the constitution that says what
the ai's what we want the ais to do so

11226
03:12:46,070 --> 03:12:46,080
the ai's what we want the ais to do so
 

11227
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:48,309
the ai's what we want the ais to do so
but this is useful so you're saying uh

11228
03:12:48,309 --> 03:12:48,319
but this is useful so you're saying uh
 

11229
03:12:48,319 --> 03:12:49,910
but this is useful so you're saying uh
so these are like you're saying

11230
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:49,920
so these are like you're saying
 

11231
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:51,750
so these are like you're saying
computational contracts but smart

11232
03:12:51,750 --> 03:12:51,760
computational contracts but smart
 

11233
03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:53,750
computational contracts but smart
contracts this is what's in the domain

11234
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:53,760
contracts this is what's in the domain
 

11235
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,190
contracts this is what's in the domain
of cryptocurrencies known as smart

11236
03:12:55,190 --> 03:12:55,200
of cryptocurrencies known as smart
 

11237
03:12:55,200 --> 03:12:57,429
of cryptocurrencies known as smart
contracts and so the the language you've

11238
03:12:57,429 --> 03:12:57,439
contracts and so the the language you've
 

11239
03:12:57,439 --> 03:12:59,510
contracts and so the the language you've
developed this symbolic

11240
03:12:59,510 --> 03:12:59,520
developed this symbolic
 

11241
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:01,750
developed this symbolic
or seek to further develop symbolic

11242
03:13:01,750 --> 03:13:01,760
or seek to further develop symbolic
 

11243
03:13:01,760 --> 03:13:05,510
or seek to further develop symbolic
discourse language enables you to uh

11244
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:05,520
discourse language enables you to uh
 

11245
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:07,670
discourse language enables you to uh
write a contract and right so write a

11246
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:07,680
write a contract and right so write a
 

11247
03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:10,710
write a contract and right so write a
contract that richly represents

11248
03:13:10,710 --> 03:13:10,720
contract that richly represents
 

11249
03:13:10,720 --> 03:13:13,030
contract that richly represents
some aspect of the world yeah but so so

11250
03:13:13,030 --> 03:13:13,040
some aspect of the world yeah but so so
 

11251
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,110
some aspect of the world yeah but so so
i mean smart contracts tend to be right

11252
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:15,120
i mean smart contracts tend to be right
 

11253
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:17,190
i mean smart contracts tend to be right
now mostly about things happening on the

11254
03:13:17,190 --> 03:13:17,200
now mostly about things happening on the
 

11255
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:19,030
now mostly about things happening on the
blockchain yes and sometimes they have

11256
03:13:19,030 --> 03:13:19,040
blockchain yes and sometimes they have
 

11257
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:21,670
blockchain yes and sometimes they have
oracles in fact our wolfram alpha api is

11258
03:13:21,670 --> 03:13:21,680
oracles in fact our wolfram alpha api is
 

11259
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:23,750
oracles in fact our wolfram alpha api is
is the main thing people use to get

11260
03:13:23,750 --> 03:13:23,760
is the main thing people use to get
 

11261
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:25,590
is the main thing people use to get
information about the real world so to

11262
03:13:25,590 --> 03:13:25,600
information about the real world so to
 

11263
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:27,670
information about the real world so to
speak yeah within smart contracts so

11264
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:27,680
speak yeah within smart contracts so
 

11265
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:29,990
speak yeah within smart contracts so
well from alpha as it stands is a really

11266
03:13:29,990 --> 03:13:30,000
well from alpha as it stands is a really
 

11267
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,309
well from alpha as it stands is a really
good oracle yes whoever wants to use it

11268
03:13:32,309 --> 03:13:32,319
good oracle yes whoever wants to use it
 

11269
03:13:32,319 --> 03:13:33,910
good oracle yes whoever wants to use it
that's perhaps where the relationship

11270
03:13:33,910 --> 03:13:33,920
that's perhaps where the relationship
 

11271
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:35,750
that's perhaps where the relationship
with cardano is yeah that's how we

11272
03:13:35,750 --> 03:13:35,760
with cardano is yeah that's how we
 

11273
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:36,630
with cardano is yeah that's how we
started getting involved with

11274
03:13:36,630 --> 03:13:36,640
started getting involved with
 

11275
03:13:36,640 --> 03:13:38,070
started getting involved with
blockchains is we realized people were

11276
03:13:38,070 --> 03:13:38,080
blockchains is we realized people were
 

11277
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:40,630
blockchains is we realized people were
using you know wolfman alpha as the

11278
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:40,640
using you know wolfman alpha as the
 

11279
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:42,630
using you know wolfman alpha as the
oracle for smart contract so to speak

11280
03:13:42,630 --> 03:13:42,640
oracle for smart contract so to speak
 

11281
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:44,229
oracle for smart contract so to speak
and so that got us interested in

11282
03:13:44,229 --> 03:13:44,239
and so that got us interested in
 

11283
03:13:44,239 --> 03:13:46,790
and so that got us interested in
blockchains in general and what was

11284
03:13:46,790 --> 03:13:46,800
blockchains in general and what was
 

11285
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:49,349
blockchains in general and what was
ended up happening is orphan language is

11286
03:13:49,349 --> 03:13:49,359
ended up happening is orphan language is
 

11287
03:13:49,359 --> 03:13:50,870
ended up happening is orphan language is

11288
03:13:50,870 --> 03:13:50,880
with its symbolic representation of
 

11289
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:51,990
with its symbolic representation of
things is really very good at

11290
03:13:51,990 --> 03:13:52,000
things is really very good at
 

11291
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,349
things is really very good at
representing

11292
03:13:53,349 --> 03:13:53,359
representing
 

11293
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:56,070
representing
things like blockchains and so i think

11294
03:13:56,070 --> 03:13:56,080
things like blockchains and so i think
 

11295
03:13:56,080 --> 03:13:57,429
things like blockchains and so i think
we now have them we don't really know

11296
03:13:57,429 --> 03:13:57,439
we now have them we don't really know
 

11297
03:13:57,439 --> 03:13:58,950
we now have them we don't really know
all the comparisons but we now have a

11298
03:13:58,950 --> 03:13:58,960
all the comparisons but we now have a
 

11299
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:00,630
all the comparisons but we now have a
really nice environment within wolverine

11300
03:14:00,630 --> 03:14:00,640
really nice environment within wolverine
 

11301
03:14:00,640 --> 03:14:03,750
really nice environment within wolverine

you know for representing what happens
 

11305
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:06,870
you know for representing what happens
in blockchains for analyzing what

03:14:06,870 --> 03:14:06,880
in blockchains for analyzing what
 

11307
03:14:06,880 --> 03:14:08,950
in blockchains for analyzing what
happens with blockchains we have a whole

11311
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:13,910
effort in blockchain analytics
um and uh you know we've sort of

11312
03:14:13,910 --> 03:14:13,920
um and uh you know we've sort of
 

11313
03:14:13,920 --> 03:14:15,750
um and uh you know we've sort of
published some samples of how that works

11314
03:14:15,750 --> 03:14:15,760
published some samples of how that works
 

11315
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:18,070
published some samples of how that works
but but it's you know because our

quant finance world there's a there's a

11322
03:14:24,309 --> 03:14:24,319
quant finance world there's a there's a
 

11323
03:14:24,319 --> 03:14:27,510

03:14:31,190 --> 03:14:31,200
quant finance kind of thing and
 

11329
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:34,070
quant finance kind of thing and
blockchain analytics and that's um so so

11330
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:34,080
blockchain analytics and that's um so so
 

11331
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:35,349
blockchain analytics and that's um so so
it's kind of the representation of

11332
03:14:35,349 --> 03:14:35,359
it's kind of the representation of
 

11333
03:14:35,359 --> 03:14:37,510
it's kind of the representation of
blockchain in computational language

11334
03:14:37,510 --> 03:14:37,520
blockchain in computational language
 

11335
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:39,990
blockchain in computational language
then ultimately it's kind of like how do

11336
03:14:39,990 --> 03:14:40,000
then ultimately it's kind of like how do
 

11337
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,229
then ultimately it's kind of like how do
you run the world with code that is how

11338
03:14:42,229 --> 03:14:42,239
you run the world with code that is how
 

11339
03:14:42,239 --> 03:14:44,309
you run the world with code that is how
do you write sort of all these things

11340
03:14:44,309 --> 03:14:44,319
do you write sort of all these things
 

11341
03:14:44,319 --> 03:14:46,469
do you write sort of all these things
which are right now regulations and laws

11342
03:14:46,469 --> 03:14:46,479
which are right now regulations and laws
 

11343
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:47,830
which are right now regulations and laws
and contracts and things in

11344
03:14:47,830 --> 03:14:47,840
and contracts and things in
 

11345
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:50,070
and contracts and things in
computational language and kind of the

11346
03:14:50,070 --> 03:14:50,080
computational language and kind of the
 

11347
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:52,550
computational language and kind of the
the ultimate vision is that sort of

11348
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:52,560
the ultimate vision is that sort of
 

11349
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,070
the ultimate vision is that sort of
something happens in the world and then

11350
03:14:54,070 --> 03:14:54,080
something happens in the world and then
 

11351
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:55,990
something happens in the world and then
there's this giant domino effect of all

11352
03:14:55,990 --> 03:14:56,000
there's this giant domino effect of all
 

11353
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:57,670
there's this giant domino effect of all
these computational contracts that

11354
03:14:57,670 --> 03:14:57,680
these computational contracts that
 

11355
03:14:57,680 --> 03:14:59,510
these computational contracts that
trigger based on the thing that happened

11356
03:14:59,510 --> 03:14:59,520
trigger based on the thing that happened
 

11357
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:01,349
trigger based on the thing that happened
and there's a there's a whole story to

11358
03:15:01,349 --> 03:15:01,359
and there's a there's a whole story to
 

11359
03:15:01,359 --> 03:15:04,070
and there's a there's a whole story to
that and of course you know i i like to

11360
03:15:04,070 --> 03:15:04,080
that and of course you know i i like to
 

11361
03:15:04,080 --> 03:15:06,150
that and of course you know i i like to
always pay attention to the latest

11362
03:15:06,150 --> 03:15:06,160
always pay attention to the latest
 

11363
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:07,750
always pay attention to the latest
things that are going on and i i really

11364
03:15:07,750 --> 03:15:07,760
things that are going on and i i really
 

11365
03:15:07,760 --> 03:15:09,750
things that are going on and i i really
i kind of like blockchain because it's a

11366
03:15:09,750 --> 03:15:09,760
i kind of like blockchain because it's a
 

11367
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:12,070
i kind of like blockchain because it's a
it's a it's another rethinking of kind

11368
03:15:12,070 --> 03:15:12,080
it's a it's another rethinking of kind
 

11369
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:13,910
it's a it's another rethinking of kind
of computation it's kind of like you

11370
03:15:13,910 --> 03:15:13,920
of computation it's kind of like you
 

11371
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:15,590
of computation it's kind of like you
know cloud computing was a little bit of

11372
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:15,600
know cloud computing was a little bit of
 

11373
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:18,950
know cloud computing was a little bit of
that of sort of persistent um kind of uh

11374
03:15:18,950 --> 03:15:18,960
that of sort of persistent um kind of uh
 

11375
03:15:18,960 --> 03:15:21,830
that of sort of persistent um kind of uh
computational resources and so on and uh

11376
03:15:21,830 --> 03:15:21,840
computational resources and so on and uh
 

11377
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:23,590
computational resources and so on and uh
you know this multi-computation is a big

11378
03:15:23,590 --> 03:15:23,600
you know this multi-computation is a big
 

11379
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:25,590
you know this multi-computation is a big
rethinking of kind of what it means to

11380
03:15:25,590 --> 03:15:25,600
rethinking of kind of what it means to
 

11381
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:27,670
rethinking of kind of what it means to
compute blockchain is another bit of

11382
03:15:27,670 --> 03:15:27,680
compute blockchain is another bit of
 

11383
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:29,830
compute blockchain is another bit of
rethinking of what it means to compute

11384
03:15:29,830 --> 03:15:29,840
rethinking of what it means to compute
 

11385
03:15:29,840 --> 03:15:31,510
rethinking of what it means to compute
the idea that you lodge kind of these

11386
03:15:31,510 --> 03:15:31,520
the idea that you lodge kind of these
 

11387
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:33,670
the idea that you lodge kind of these
autonomous lumps of computation out

11388
03:15:33,670 --> 03:15:33,680
autonomous lumps of computation out
 

11389
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:35,830
autonomous lumps of computation out
there in the blockchain world and and

11390
03:15:35,830 --> 03:15:35,840
there in the blockchain world and and
 

11391
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:38,229
there in the blockchain world and and
one of the things that um just sort of

11392
03:15:38,229 --> 03:15:38,239
one of the things that um just sort of
 

11393
03:15:38,239 --> 03:15:40,309
one of the things that um just sort of
uh for fun so to speak is we've been

11394
03:15:40,309 --> 03:15:40,319
uh for fun so to speak is we've been
 

11395
03:15:40,319 --> 03:15:42,070
uh for fun so to speak is we've been
doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we

11396
03:15:42,070 --> 03:15:42,080
doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we
 

11397
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:44,469
doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we
just did some nfts on gardano and we'll

11398
03:15:44,469 --> 03:15:44,479
just did some nfts on gardano and we'll
 

11399
03:15:44,479 --> 03:15:46,790
just did some nfts on gardano and we'll
be doing some more and uh you know we

11400
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:46,800
be doing some more and uh you know we
 

11401
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:48,469
be doing some more and uh you know we
did some cellular automaton nfts on

11402
03:15:48,469 --> 03:15:48,479
did some cellular automaton nfts on
 

11403
03:15:48,479 --> 03:15:50,309
did some cellular automaton nfts on
cadance people

11404
03:15:50,309 --> 03:15:50,319
cadance people
 

11405
03:15:50,319 --> 03:15:52,550
cadance people
like quite a bit um and you know one of

11406
03:15:52,550 --> 03:15:52,560
like quite a bit um and you know one of
 

11407
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:54,150
like quite a bit um and you know one of
the things i've realized about about

11408
03:15:54,150 --> 03:15:54,160
the things i've realized about about
 

11409
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:57,349
the things i've realized about about
nfts is that there's kind of this notion

11410
03:15:57,349 --> 03:15:57,359
nfts is that there's kind of this notion
 

11411
03:15:57,359 --> 03:15:59,349
nfts is that there's kind of this notion
and we're really working on this you

11412
03:15:59,349 --> 03:15:59,359
and we're really working on this you
 

11413
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:00,710
and we're really working on this you
know i like

11414
03:16:00,710 --> 03:16:00,720
know i like
 

11415
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:02,710
know i like
recording stuff you know one of the

11416
03:16:02,710 --> 03:16:02,720
recording stuff you know one of the
 

11417
03:16:02,720 --> 03:16:04,710
recording stuff you know one of the
things that's come out of of kind of my

11418
03:16:04,710 --> 03:16:04,720
things that's come out of of kind of my
 

11419
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:06,710
things that's come out of of kind of my
science i suppose is this this history

11420
03:16:06,710 --> 03:16:06,720
science i suppose is this this history
 

11421
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:09,590
science i suppose is this this history
matters type type story of you know it's

11422
03:16:09,590 --> 03:16:09,600
matters type type story of you know it's
 

11423
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:10,790
matters type type story of you know it's
not just the current state it's the

11424
03:16:10,790 --> 03:16:10,800
not just the current state it's the
 

11425
03:16:10,800 --> 03:16:13,030
not just the current state it's the
history that matters and i've kind of i

11426
03:16:13,030 --> 03:16:13,040
history that matters and i've kind of i
 

11427
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:15,030
history that matters and i've kind of i
don't think this is actually realizing

11428
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,040
don't think this is actually realizing
 

11429
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:17,190
don't think this is actually realizing
maybe it's not coincidental that i'm

11430
03:16:17,190 --> 03:16:17,200
maybe it's not coincidental that i'm
 

11431
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:18,710
maybe it's not coincidental that i'm
sort of the human who's recorded more

11432
03:16:18,710 --> 03:16:18,720
sort of the human who's recorded more
 

11433
03:16:18,720 --> 03:16:20,469
sort of the human who's recorded more
about themselves than anybody else and

11434
03:16:20,469 --> 03:16:20,479
about themselves than anybody else and
 

11435
03:16:20,479 --> 03:16:22,550
about themselves than anybody else and
then i end up with these science results

11436
03:16:22,550 --> 03:16:22,560
then i end up with these science results
 

11437
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:24,870
then i end up with these science results
that say history matters which was not

11438
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:24,880
that say history matters which was not
 

11439
03:16:24,880 --> 03:16:26,550
that say history matters which was not
those those things i didn't think those

11440
03:16:26,550 --> 03:16:26,560
those those things i didn't think those
 

11441
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:28,389
those those things i didn't think those
were connected but they're at least

11442
03:16:28,389 --> 03:16:28,399
were connected but they're at least
 

11443
03:16:28,399 --> 03:16:30,710
were connected but they're at least
correlated yes yeah right so

11444
03:16:30,710 --> 03:16:30,720
correlated yes yeah right so
 

11445
03:16:30,720 --> 03:16:32,150
correlated yes yeah right so
you know this question about sort of

11446
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:32,160
you know this question about sort of
 

11447
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:33,990
you know this question about sort of
recording what has happened

11448
03:16:33,990 --> 03:16:34,000
recording what has happened
 

11449
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:35,670
recording what has happened
and and having sort of a permanent

11450
03:16:35,670 --> 03:16:35,680
and and having sort of a permanent
 

11451
03:16:35,680 --> 03:16:37,349
and and having sort of a permanent
record of things one of the things

11452
03:16:37,349 --> 03:16:37,359
record of things one of the things
 

11453
03:16:37,359 --> 03:16:39,190
record of things one of the things
that's kind of interesting there is you

11454
03:16:39,190 --> 03:16:39,200
that's kind of interesting there is you
 

11455
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:40,630
that's kind of interesting there is you
know you put up a website and it's got a

11456
03:16:40,630 --> 03:16:40,640
know you put up a website and it's got a
 

11457
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:42,309
know you put up a website and it's got a
bunch of stuff on it but you know you

11458
03:16:42,309 --> 03:16:42,319
bunch of stuff on it but you know you
 

11459
03:16:42,319 --> 03:16:43,750
bunch of stuff on it but you know you
have to keep paying the hosting fees or

11460
03:16:43,750 --> 03:16:43,760
have to keep paying the hosting fees or
 

11461
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:45,429
have to keep paying the hosting fees or
the things going to go away

11462
03:16:45,429 --> 03:16:45,439
the things going to go away
 

11463
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:47,110
the things going to go away
but one of the things about blockchain

11464
03:16:47,110 --> 03:16:47,120
but one of the things about blockchain
 

11465
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:49,429
but one of the things about blockchain
is kind of interesting is if you put

11466
03:16:49,429 --> 03:16:49,439
is kind of interesting is if you put
 

11467
03:16:49,439 --> 03:16:51,030
is kind of interesting is if you put
something on a blockchain and you pay

11468
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:51,040
something on a blockchain and you pay
 

11469
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:52,550
something on a blockchain and you pay
you know your commission to get that

11470
03:16:52,550 --> 03:16:52,560
you know your commission to get that
 

11471
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:55,030
you know your commission to get that
thing you know put on you know mind put

11472
03:16:55,030 --> 03:16:55,040
thing you know put on you know mind put
 

11473
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:57,830
thing you know put on you know mind put
on the block blockchain then then in a

11474
03:16:57,830 --> 03:16:57,840
on the block blockchain then then in a
 

11475
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:00,389
on the block blockchain then then in a
sense everybody who comes after you

11476
03:17:00,389 --> 03:17:00,399
sense everybody who comes after you
 

11477
03:17:00,399 --> 03:17:02,550
sense everybody who comes after you
is you know they are motivated to keep

11478
03:17:02,550 --> 03:17:02,560
is you know they are motivated to keep
 

11479
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:04,309
is you know they are motivated to keep
your thing alive because that's what

11480
03:17:04,309 --> 03:17:04,319
your thing alive because that's what
 

11481
03:17:04,319 --> 03:17:06,229
your thing alive because that's what
keeps the consistency of the blockchain

11482
03:17:06,229 --> 03:17:06,239
keeps the consistency of the blockchain
 

11483
03:17:06,239 --> 03:17:08,550
keeps the consistency of the blockchain
so in a sense with sort of the nft world

11484
03:17:08,550 --> 03:17:08,560
so in a sense with sort of the nft world
 

11485
03:17:08,560 --> 03:17:09,830
so in a sense with sort of the nft world
it's kind of like if you want to have

11486
03:17:09,830 --> 03:17:09,840
it's kind of like if you want to have
 

11487
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:12,309
it's kind of like if you want to have
something permanent well at least for

11488
03:17:12,309 --> 03:17:12,319
something permanent well at least for
 

11489
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:14,309
something permanent well at least for
the life of the blockchain but but even

11490
03:17:14,309 --> 03:17:14,319
the life of the blockchain but but even
 

11491
03:17:14,319 --> 03:17:15,830
the life of the blockchain but but even
if the blockchain goes out of

11492
03:17:15,830 --> 03:17:15,840
if the blockchain goes out of
 

11493
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:17,670
if the blockchain goes out of
circulation so to speak there's going to

11494
03:17:17,670 --> 03:17:17,680
circulation so to speak there's going to
 

11495
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:19,590
circulation so to speak there's going to
be enough value in that whole collection

11496
03:17:19,590 --> 03:17:19,600
be enough value in that whole collection
 

11497
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:21,349
be enough value in that whole collection
of transactions that people are going to

11498
03:17:21,349 --> 03:17:21,359
of transactions that people are going to
 

11499
03:17:21,359 --> 03:17:23,269
of transactions that people are going to
archive the thing but that means that

11500
03:17:23,269 --> 03:17:23,279
archive the thing but that means that
 

11501
03:17:23,279 --> 03:17:24,870
archive the thing but that means that
you know pay once

11502
03:17:24,870 --> 03:17:24,880
you know pay once
 

11503
03:17:24,880 --> 03:17:26,790
you know pay once
and you're kind of you're lodged in the

11504
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:26,800
and you're kind of you're lodged in the
 

11505
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:28,630
and you're kind of you're lodged in the
blockchain forever and so we've been

11506
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:28,640
blockchain forever and so we've been
 

11507
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:30,630
blockchain forever and so we've been
kind of playing around with um a sort of

11508
03:17:30,630 --> 03:17:30,640
kind of playing around with um a sort of
 

11509
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:33,349
kind of playing around with um a sort of
a hobby thing of of mine of of thinking

11510
03:17:33,349 --> 03:17:33,359
a hobby thing of of mine of of thinking
 

11511
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:35,349
a hobby thing of of mine of of thinking
about sort of the nfts

11512
03:17:35,349 --> 03:17:35,359
about sort of the nfts
 

11513
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:38,229
about sort of the nfts
and how you um and sort of the consumer

11514
03:17:38,229 --> 03:17:38,239
and how you um and sort of the consumer
 

11515
03:17:38,239 --> 03:17:40,790
and how you um and sort of the consumer
idea of kind of the it's the it's the

11516
03:17:40,790 --> 03:17:40,800
idea of kind of the it's the it's the
 

11517
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:42,710
idea of kind of the it's the it's the
anti you know it's the opposite of the

11518
03:17:42,710 --> 03:17:42,720
anti you know it's the opposite of the
 

11519
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:45,030
anti you know it's the opposite of the
snapchat view of the world so there's a

11520
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:45,040
snapchat view of the world so there's a
 

11521
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:46,790
snapchat view of the world so there's a
permanence to it this heavily

11522
03:17:46,790 --> 03:17:46,800
permanence to it this heavily
 

11523
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:49,429
permanence to it this heavily
incentivized and uh

11524
03:17:49,429 --> 03:17:49,439
incentivized and uh
 

11525
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:51,349
incentivized and uh
thereby you can have a

11526
03:17:51,349 --> 03:17:51,359
thereby you can have a
 

11527
03:17:51,359 --> 03:17:53,349
thereby you can have a
permanence of history right and that's

11528
03:17:53,349 --> 03:17:53,359
permanence of history right and that's
 

11529
03:17:53,359 --> 03:17:56,070
permanence of history right and that's
that's that's kind of the um now you

11530
03:17:56,070 --> 03:17:56,080
that's that's kind of the um now you
 

11531
03:17:56,080 --> 03:17:57,269
that's that's kind of the um now you
know so that's so that's one of the

11532
03:17:57,269 --> 03:17:57,279
know so that's so that's one of the
 

11533
03:17:57,279 --> 03:17:58,950
know so that's so that's one of the
things we've been doing with cardano and

11534
03:17:58,950 --> 03:17:58,960
things we've been doing with cardano and
 

11535
03:17:58,960 --> 03:18:01,110
things we've been doing with cardano and
it's kind of fun i think that that um i

11536
03:18:01,110 --> 03:18:01,120
it's kind of fun i think that that um i
 

11537
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:02,550
it's kind of fun i think that that um i
mean this whole question about you know

11538
03:18:02,550 --> 03:18:02,560
mean this whole question about you know
 

11539
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:04,229
mean this whole question about you know
you mentioned automated theorem proving

11540
03:18:04,229 --> 03:18:04,239
you mentioned automated theorem proving
 

11541
03:18:04,239 --> 03:18:06,469
you mentioned automated theorem proving
and blockchains and so on and as i've

11542
03:18:06,469 --> 03:18:06,479
and blockchains and so on and as i've
 

11543
03:18:06,479 --> 03:18:07,830
and blockchains and so on and as i've
thought about this kind of physics

11544
03:18:07,830 --> 03:18:07,840
thought about this kind of physics
 

11545
03:18:07,840 --> 03:18:09,830
thought about this kind of physics
inspired distributed blockchain

11546
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:09,840
inspired distributed blockchain
 

11547
03:18:09,840 --> 03:18:12,950
inspired distributed blockchain
obviously they're the sort of the proof

11548
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:12,960
obviously they're the sort of the proof
 

11549
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:14,870
obviously they're the sort of the proof
that it works that they're no double

11550
03:18:14,870 --> 03:18:14,880
that it works that they're no double
 

11551
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:16,870
that it works that they're no double
spends there's no whatever else

11552
03:18:16,870 --> 03:18:16,880
spends there's no whatever else
 

11553
03:18:16,880 --> 03:18:19,990
spends there's no whatever else
that proof becomes a very formal kind of

11554
03:18:19,990 --> 03:18:20,000
that proof becomes a very formal kind of
 

11555
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:22,229
that proof becomes a very formal kind of
almost a matter of physics so to speak

11556
03:18:22,229 --> 03:18:22,239
almost a matter of physics so to speak
 

11557
03:18:22,239 --> 03:18:24,150
almost a matter of physics so to speak
um and uh you know it's been it's been

11558
03:18:24,150 --> 03:18:24,160
um and uh you know it's been it's been
 

11559
03:18:24,160 --> 03:18:25,750
um and uh you know it's been it's been
an interesting thing for the for the

11560
03:18:25,750 --> 03:18:25,760
an interesting thing for the for the
 

11561
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:28,389
an interesting thing for the for the
practical blockchains to do kind of

11562
03:18:28,389 --> 03:18:28,399
practical blockchains to do kind of
 

11563
03:18:28,399 --> 03:18:30,070
practical blockchains to do kind of
actual automated film proving and i

11564
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,080
actual automated film proving and i
 

11565
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:31,510
actual automated film proving and i
don't think anybody's really managed it

11566
03:18:31,510 --> 03:18:31,520
don't think anybody's really managed it
 

11567
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:33,590
don't think anybody's really managed it
in an interesting case yet it's a thing

11568
03:18:33,590 --> 03:18:33,600
in an interesting case yet it's a thing
 

11569
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:35,910
in an interesting case yet it's a thing
that people you know aspire to but i

11570
03:18:35,910 --> 03:18:35,920
that people you know aspire to but i
 

11571
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:37,910
that people you know aspire to but i
think it's a challenging thing because

11572
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:37,920
think it's a challenging thing because
 

11573
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:39,750
think it's a challenging thing because
basically the point is one of the one of

11574
03:18:39,750 --> 03:18:39,760
basically the point is one of the one of
 

11575
03:18:39,760 --> 03:18:42,070
basically the point is one of the one of
the things about proving correctness of

11576
03:18:42,070 --> 03:18:42,080
the things about proving correctness of
 

11577
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:43,990
the things about proving correctness of
something is well you know people say

11578
03:18:43,990 --> 03:18:44,000
something is well you know people say
 

11579
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:45,269
something is well you know people say
i've got this program and i'm going to

11580
03:18:45,269 --> 03:18:45,279
i've got this program and i'm going to
 

11581
03:18:45,279 --> 03:18:47,269
i've got this program and i'm going to
prove it's correct it's like what does

11582
03:18:47,269 --> 03:18:47,279
prove it's correct it's like what does
 

11583
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:49,030
prove it's correct it's like what does
that mean you have to say what correct

11584
03:18:49,030 --> 03:18:49,040
that mean you have to say what correct
 

11585
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:51,030
that mean you have to say what correct
means i mean it's it's kind of like then

11586
03:18:51,030 --> 03:18:51,040
means i mean it's it's kind of like then
 

11587
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:52,550
means i mean it's it's kind of like then
you have to have another language and

11588
03:18:52,550 --> 03:18:52,560
you have to have another language and
 

11589
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:54,229
you have to have another language and
people were very confused back in past

11590
03:18:54,229 --> 03:18:54,239
people were very confused back in past
 

11591
03:18:54,239 --> 03:18:56,309
people were very confused back in past
decades of you know oh we're going to

11592
03:18:56,309 --> 03:18:56,319
decades of you know oh we're going to
 

11593
03:18:56,319 --> 03:18:58,389
decades of you know oh we're going to
prove the correctness by representing

11594
03:18:58,389 --> 03:18:58,399
prove the correctness by representing
 

11595
03:18:58,399 --> 03:19:00,469
prove the correctness by representing
the program in another language which we

11596
03:19:00,469 --> 03:19:00,479
the program in another language which we
 

11597
03:19:00,479 --> 03:19:02,550
the program in another language which we
also don't know whether it's correct and

11598
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:02,560
also don't know whether it's correct and
 

11599
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:04,309
also don't know whether it's correct and
you know often by correctness we just

11600
03:19:04,309 --> 03:19:04,319
you know often by correctness we just
 

11601
03:19:04,319 --> 03:19:07,030
you know often by correctness we just
mean it can't crash or it can't scribble

11602
03:19:07,030 --> 03:19:07,040
mean it can't crash or it can't scribble
 

11603
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:08,790
mean it can't crash or it can't scribble
on memory but but the thing is that

11604
03:19:08,790 --> 03:19:08,800
on memory but but the thing is that
 

11605
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:10,630
on memory but but the thing is that
there's this complicated trade-off

11606
03:19:10,630 --> 03:19:10,640
there's this complicated trade-off
 

11607
03:19:10,640 --> 03:19:12,630
there's this complicated trade-off
because as soon as there's as soon as

03:19:12,630 --> 03:19:12,640
because as soon as there's as soon as
 

11609
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:14,630
because as soon as there's as soon as
you're really using computation you have

03:19:14,630 --> 03:19:14,640
you're really using computation you have
 

11611
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:16,830
you're really using computation you have
computational irreducibility you have

11612
03:19:16,830 --> 03:19:16,840
computational irreducibility you have
 

11613
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:18,870
computational irreducibility you have
undecidability if you want to use

11614
03:19:18,870 --> 03:19:18,880
undecidability if you want to use
 

11615
03:19:18,880 --> 03:19:21,269
undecidability if you want to use
computation seriously you have to kind

11616
03:19:21,269 --> 03:19:21,279
computation seriously you have to kind
 

11617
03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:23,910
computation seriously you have to kind
of let go of the idea that you're going

11618
03:19:23,910 --> 03:19:23,920
of let go of the idea that you're going
 

11619
03:19:23,920 --> 03:19:26,389
of let go of the idea that you're going
to be able to box it in and say we're

11620
03:19:26,389 --> 03:19:26,399
to be able to box it in and say we're
 

11621
03:19:26,399 --> 03:19:28,070
to be able to box it in and say we're
going to have just this happen and not

11629
03:19:34,239 --> 03:19:36,710
tries to say you know piano arithmetic
the axioms of arithmetic can you box in

11630
03:19:36,710 --> 03:19:36,720
the axioms of arithmetic can you box in
 

11631
03:19:36,720 --> 03:19:39,030
the axioms of arithmetic can you box in
the integers and say these axioms give

the integers and say these axioms give
 

11633
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:40,389

can have all these wild weird things
 

11641
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:48,229
can have all these wild weird things
that are obey the piano axioms but

03:19:48,229 --> 03:19:48,239
that are obey the piano axioms but
 

11643
03:19:48,239 --> 03:19:50,070
that are obey the piano axioms but
aren't integers and there's this kind of

infinite hierarchy of additional axioms
 

11647
03:19:52,399 --> 03:19:54,070
infinite hierarchy of additional axioms
you would have to add and it's kind of

11648
03:19:54,070 --> 03:19:54,080
you would have to add and it's kind of
 

11649
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:56,229
you would have to add and it's kind of
the same thing you you don't get to you

11650
03:19:56,229 --> 03:19:56,239
the same thing you you don't get to you
 

11651

know if you want to say i want to know
 

11653
03:19:58,160 --> 03:20:00,309
know if you want to say i want to know
what happens you're boxing yourself in

11654
03:20:00,309 --> 03:20:00,319
what happens you're boxing yourself in
 

11655
03:20:00,319 --> 03:20:01,750
what happens you're boxing yourself in
and there's a limit to what can happen

so to speak so it's a it's a complicated
trade-off and it's a it's a it's a big

03:20:05,439 --> 03:20:07,190
trade-off and it's a it's a it's a big
trade-off for ai so to speak it's kind

11662
03:20:07,190 --> 03:20:07,200
trade-off for ai so to speak it's kind
 

11663
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:09,190
trade-off for ai so to speak it's kind
of like do you want to let computation

11664
03:20:09,190 --> 03:20:09,200
of like do you want to let computation
 

11665
03:20:09,200 --> 03:20:11,269
of like do you want to let computation
actually do what it can do or do you

11666
03:20:11,269 --> 03:20:11,279
actually do what it can do or do you
 

11667
03:20:11,279 --> 03:20:13,510
actually do what it can do or do you
want to say no it's very very boxed in

11668
03:20:13,510 --> 03:20:13,520
want to say no it's very very boxed in
 

11669
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:15,030
want to say no it's very very boxed in
to the point where we can understand

to the point where we can understand
 

11671
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:17,429
to the point where we can understand
every step and that's a that's kind of a

11672
03:20:17,429 --> 03:20:17,439
every step and that's a that's kind of a
 

11673
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:19,110
every step and that's a that's kind of a
thing that that um that becomes

11674
03:20:19,110 --> 03:20:19,120
thing that that um that becomes
 

11675
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:21,190
thing that that um that becomes
difficult to do but that that's some i

11676
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:21,200
difficult to do but that that's some i
 

11677
03:20:21,200 --> 03:20:23,429
difficult to do but that that's some i
mean in in general

11678
03:20:23,429 --> 03:20:23,439
mean in in general
 

11679
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:24,710
mean in in general
i would say one of the things that's

11680
03:20:24,710 --> 03:20:24,720
i would say one of the things that's
 

11681
03:20:24,720 --> 03:20:26,550
i would say one of the things that's
kind of complicated in my

11682
03:20:26,550 --> 03:20:26,560
kind of complicated in my
 

11683
03:20:26,560 --> 03:20:28,630
kind of complicated in my
uh sort of life in the whole sort of

11684

uh sort of life in the whole sort of
 

11685
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:30,790
uh sort of life in the whole sort of
story of computational language and all

03:20:30,790 --> 03:20:30,800
story of computational language and all
 

11687
03:20:30,800 --> 03:20:33,110
story of computational language and all
this technology and science and so on i

03:20:33,110 --> 03:20:33,120
this technology and science and so on i
 

11689
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:35,670
this technology and science and so on i
mean i i kind of in in the flow of one's

11690
03:20:35,670 --> 03:20:35,680
mean i i kind of in in the flow of one's
 

11691
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:37,750
mean i i kind of in in the flow of one's
life it's sort of interesting to see how

11692
03:20:37,750 --> 03:20:37,760
life it's sort of interesting to see how
 

11693
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:39,830
life it's sort of interesting to see how
these things play out because i you know

11694
03:20:39,830 --> 03:20:39,840
these things play out because i you know
 

11695
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:41,910
these things play out because i you know
i've kind of concluded that i'm in the

would have gotten to it for 50 years you

11708
03:20:52,229 --> 03:20:52,239
would have gotten to it for 50 years you
 

11709
03:20:52,239 --> 03:20:53,750
would have gotten to it for 50 years you
know the fact that mathematica is a

11710
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:53,760
know the fact that mathematica is a
 

11711
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:56,389
know the fact that mathematica is a
third of a century old and i know that a

11712
03:20:56,389 --> 03:20:56,399
third of a century old and i know that a
 

11713
03:20:56,399 --> 03:20:58,469
third of a century old and i know that a
bunch of the core ideas are not well

03:20:58,469 --> 03:20:58,479
bunch of the core ideas are not well
 

11715
03:20:58,479 --> 03:21:00,790
bunch of the core ideas are not well
absorbed i mean that is people finally

11716
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:00,800
absorbed i mean that is people finally
 

11717
03:21:00,800 --> 03:21:01,990
absorbed i mean that is people finally
got this idea that i thought was a

11718
03:21:01,990 --> 03:21:02,000
got this idea that i thought was a
 

11719
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:04,550
got this idea that i thought was a
triviality of notebooks that was 25

11720

years
 

11723
03:21:05,359 --> 03:21:07,429
years
and um you know some of these core ideas

11724
03:21:07,429 --> 03:21:07,439
and um you know some of these core ideas
 

11725
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:09,830
and um you know some of these core ideas
about symbolic computation and so on are

11726
03:21:09,830 --> 03:21:09,840
about symbolic computation and so on are
 

11727
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:12,469
about symbolic computation and so on are
not not absorbed i mean people people

11728
03:21:12,469 --> 03:21:12,479
not not absorbed i mean people people
 

11729
03:21:12,479 --> 03:21:15,190
not not absorbed i mean people people
use them every day in wolfram language

11730
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:15,200
use them every day in wolfram language
 

11731
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:16,710
use them every day in wolfram language
and you know do all kinds of cool things

11732
03:21:16,710 --> 03:21:16,720
and you know do all kinds of cool things
 

11733
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:18,469
and you know do all kinds of cool things
with them but if you say what is the

11734
03:21:18,469 --> 03:21:18,479
with them but if you say what is the
 

11735
03:21:18,479 --> 03:21:21,110
with them but if you say what is the
fundamental intellectual point here it's

11736
03:21:21,110 --> 03:21:21,120
fundamental intellectual point here it's
 

11737
03:21:21,120 --> 03:21:22,950
fundamental intellectual point here it's
it's not well absorbed and it's it's

11738
03:21:22,950 --> 03:21:22,960
it's not well absorbed and it's it's
 

11739
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:24,710
it's not well absorbed and it's it's
something where you kind of realize that

11740
03:21:24,710 --> 03:21:24,720
something where you kind of realize that
 

11741
03:21:24,720 --> 03:21:26,309
something where you kind of realize that
you're you're sort of building things

11742
03:21:26,309 --> 03:21:26,319
you're you're sort of building things
 

11743
03:21:26,319 --> 03:21:28,389
you're you're sort of building things
and i i kind of made this this thing

11744
03:21:28,389 --> 03:21:28,399
and i i kind of made this this thing
 

11745
03:21:28,399 --> 03:21:30,070
and i i kind of made this this thing
about you know we're building artifacts

11746
03:21:30,070 --> 03:21:30,080
about you know we're building artifacts
 

11747
03:21:30,080 --> 03:21:31,190
about you know we're building artifacts
from the future so to speak and i

11748
03:21:31,190 --> 03:21:31,200
from the future so to speak and i
 

11749
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:33,910
from the future so to speak and i
mentioned that it's our uh we have a a

11750
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:33,920
mentioned that it's our uh we have a a
 

11751
03:21:33,920 --> 03:21:35,349
mentioned that it's our uh we have a a
conference ever it's coming up actually

11752
03:21:35,349 --> 03:21:35,359
conference ever it's coming up actually
 

11753
03:21:35,359 --> 03:21:36,710
conference ever it's coming up actually
in a couple of weeks our annual

11754
03:21:36,710 --> 03:21:36,720
in a couple of weeks our annual
 

11755
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:39,269
in a couple of weeks our annual
technology conference uh where we talk

11756
03:21:39,269 --> 03:21:39,279
technology conference uh where we talk
 

11757
03:21:39,279 --> 03:21:41,190
technology conference uh where we talk
about all the all the things we're doing

11758
03:21:41,190 --> 03:21:41,200
about all the all the things we're doing
 

11759
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:43,349
about all the all the things we're doing
um and uh you know so i was talking

11760
03:21:43,349 --> 03:21:43,359
um and uh you know so i was talking
 

11761
03:21:43,359 --> 03:21:45,429
um and uh you know so i was talking
about it last year about you know we're

11762
03:21:45,429 --> 03:21:45,439
about it last year about you know we're
 

11763
03:21:45,439 --> 03:21:46,710
about it last year about you know we're
making artifacts from the future and i

11764
03:21:46,710 --> 03:21:46,720
making artifacts from the future and i
 

11765
03:21:46,720 --> 03:21:47,910
making artifacts from the future and i
was kind of like

11766
03:21:47,910 --> 03:21:47,920
was kind of like
 

11767
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:50,150
was kind of like
i had some some version of that that was

11768
03:21:50,150 --> 03:21:50,160
i had some some version of that that was
 

11769
03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:52,070
i had some some version of that that was
kind of a dark and frustrated thing of

11770
03:21:52,070 --> 03:21:52,080
kind of a dark and frustrated thing of
 

11771
03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:53,910
kind of a dark and frustrated thing of
like you know i'm building things which

11772
03:21:53,910 --> 03:21:53,920
like you know i'm building things which
 

11773
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:55,349
like you know i'm building things which
nobody's going to care about until long

11774
03:21:55,349 --> 03:21:55,359
nobody's going to care about until long
 

11775
03:21:55,359 --> 03:21:57,910
nobody's going to care about until long
after i'm dead so to speak but um but

11776
03:21:57,910 --> 03:21:57,920
after i'm dead so to speak but um but
 

11777
03:21:57,920 --> 03:22:00,790
after i'm dead so to speak but um but
but then i i realized you know people

11778
03:22:00,790 --> 03:22:00,800
but then i i realized you know people
 

11779
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:02,630
but then i i realized you know people
were sort of telling me afterwards you

11780
03:22:02,630 --> 03:22:02,640
were sort of telling me afterwards you
 

11781
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:05,269
were sort of telling me afterwards you
know that's exactly how you know we're

11782
03:22:05,269 --> 03:22:05,279
know that's exactly how you know we're
 

11783
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:06,630
know that's exactly how you know we're
using wolfman language in some

11784
03:22:06,630 --> 03:22:06,640
using wolfman language in some
 

11785
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,389
using wolfman language in some
particular setting in you know some

11786
03:22:08,389 --> 03:22:08,399
particular setting in you know some
 

11787
03:22:08,399 --> 03:22:09,990
particular setting in you know some
computational acts field or some

11788
03:22:09,990 --> 03:22:10,000
computational acts field or some
 

11789
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:11,750
computational acts field or some
organization or whatever and it's like

11790
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:11,760
organization or whatever and it's like
 

11791
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:14,070
organization or whatever and it's like
people are saying oh you know what did

11792
03:22:14,070 --> 03:22:14,080
people are saying oh you know what did
 

11793
03:22:14,080 --> 03:22:15,990
people are saying oh you know what did
you manage to do you know well we know

11794
03:22:15,990 --> 03:22:16,000
you manage to do you know well we know
 

11795
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:17,590
you manage to do you know well we know
that in principle it will be possible to

11796
03:22:17,590 --> 03:22:17,600
that in principle it will be possible to
 

11797
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:18,710
that in principle it will be possible to
do that but we didn't know that was

11798
03:22:18,710 --> 03:22:18,720
do that but we didn't know that was
 

11799
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:20,870
do that but we didn't know that was
possible now and it's kind of like

11800
03:22:20,870 --> 03:22:20,880
possible now and it's kind of like
 

11801
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:22,309
possible now and it's kind of like
that's the that's sort of the business

11802
03:22:22,309 --> 03:22:22,319
that's the that's sort of the business
 

11803
03:22:22,319 --> 03:22:23,670
that's the that's sort of the business
we're in and in a sense with some of

11804
03:22:23,670 --> 03:22:23,680
we're in and in a sense with some of
 

11805
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:25,990
we're in and in a sense with some of
these ideas in science um you know i

11806
03:22:25,990 --> 03:22:26,000
these ideas in science um you know i
 

11807
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:27,510
these ideas in science um you know i
feel a little bit the same way that

11808
03:22:27,510 --> 03:22:27,520
feel a little bit the same way that
 

11809
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:29,269
feel a little bit the same way that
there are some of these things where you

11810
03:22:29,269 --> 03:22:29,279
there are some of these things where you
 

11811
03:22:29,279 --> 03:22:31,510
there are some of these things where you
know some some things like for example

11812
03:22:31,510 --> 03:22:31,520
know some some things like for example
 

11813
03:22:31,520 --> 03:22:35,349
know some some things like for example
this whole idea well so so to to relate

11814
03:22:35,349 --> 03:22:35,359
this whole idea well so so to to relate
 

11815
03:22:35,359 --> 03:22:36,790
this whole idea well so so to to relate
to another sort of piece of history in

11816
03:22:36,790 --> 03:22:36,800
to another sort of piece of history in
 

11817
03:22:36,800 --> 03:22:38,790
to another sort of piece of history in
the future one of you know i mentioned

11818
03:22:38,790 --> 03:22:38,800
the future one of you know i mentioned
 

11819
03:22:38,800 --> 03:22:40,229
the future one of you know i mentioned
we mentioned at the beginning kind of

11820
03:22:40,229 --> 03:22:40,239
we mentioned at the beginning kind of
 

11821
03:22:40,239 --> 03:22:42,229
we mentioned at the beginning kind of
complexity as this thing that i was

11822
03:22:42,229 --> 03:22:42,239
complexity as this thing that i was
 

11823
03:22:42,239 --> 03:22:44,229
complexity as this thing that i was
interested in back 40 years ago and so

11824
03:22:44,229 --> 03:22:44,239
interested in back 40 years ago and so
 

11825
03:22:44,239 --> 03:22:46,950
interested in back 40 years ago and so
on where does complexity come from well

11826
03:22:46,950 --> 03:22:46,960
on where does complexity come from well
 

11827
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:48,870
on where does complexity come from well
i think we kind of nailed that the

11828
03:22:48,870 --> 03:22:48,880
i think we kind of nailed that the
 

11829
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:51,190
i think we kind of nailed that the
answer is in the computational universe

11830
03:22:51,190 --> 03:22:51,200
answer is in the computational universe
 

11831
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:53,429
answer is in the computational universe
even simple programs make it and that's

11832
03:22:53,429 --> 03:22:53,439
even simple programs make it and that's
 

11833
03:22:53,439 --> 03:22:55,110
even simple programs make it and that's
kind of the secret that nature has that

11834
03:22:55,110 --> 03:22:55,120
kind of the secret that nature has that
 

11835
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:57,349
kind of the secret that nature has that
allows you to make it so so that's kind

11836
03:22:57,349 --> 03:22:57,359
allows you to make it so so that's kind
 

11837
03:22:57,359 --> 03:22:59,830
allows you to make it so so that's kind
of the um uh that that's that part but

11838
03:22:59,830 --> 03:22:59,840
of the um uh that that's that part but
 

11839
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:02,070
of the um uh that that's that part but
the bigger picture there was this idea

11840
03:23:02,070 --> 03:23:02,080
the bigger picture there was this idea
 

11841
03:23:02,080 --> 03:23:04,070
the bigger picture there was this idea
of this kind of computational paradigm

11842
03:23:04,070 --> 03:23:04,080
of this kind of computational paradigm
 

11843
03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:05,590
of this kind of computational paradigm
the idea that you could go beyond

11844
03:23:05,590 --> 03:23:05,600
the idea that you could go beyond
 

11845
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:07,190
the idea that you could go beyond
mathematical equations which have been

11846
03:23:07,190 --> 03:23:07,200
mathematical equations which have been
 

11847
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:09,990
mathematical equations which have been
sort of the primary modeling medium for

11848
03:23:09,990 --> 03:23:10,000
sort of the primary modeling medium for
 

11849
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:11,269
sort of the primary modeling medium for
300 years

11850
03:23:11,269 --> 03:23:11,279
300 years
 

11851
03:23:11,279 --> 03:23:14,150
300 years
and so it was like look it is inexorably

11852
03:23:14,150 --> 03:23:14,160
and so it was like look it is inexorably
 

11853
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:16,309
and so it was like look it is inexorably
the case that people will use programs

11854
03:23:16,309 --> 03:23:16,319
the case that people will use programs
 

11855
03:23:16,319 --> 03:23:18,309
the case that people will use programs
rather than just equations and you know

11856
03:23:18,309 --> 03:23:18,319
rather than just equations and you know
 

11857
03:23:18,319 --> 03:23:20,389
rather than just equations and you know
i was saying that in the 1980s and

11858
03:23:20,389 --> 03:23:20,399
i was saying that in the 1980s and
 

11859
03:23:20,399 --> 03:23:22,150
i was saying that in the 1980s and
people were you know i published my big

11860
03:23:22,150 --> 03:23:22,160
people were you know i published my big
 

11861
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:23,990
people were you know i published my big
book new kind of science that'll be 20

11862
03:23:23,990 --> 03:23:24,000
book new kind of science that'll be 20
 

11863
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:27,670
book new kind of science that'll be 20
years ago uh next year so in 2002 and

11864
03:23:27,670 --> 03:23:27,680
years ago uh next year so in 2002 and
 

11865
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:29,349
years ago uh next year so in 2002 and
people are saying oh no this can't

11866
03:23:29,349 --> 03:23:29,359
people are saying oh no this can't
 

11867
03:23:29,359 --> 03:23:31,190
people are saying oh no this can't
possibly be true you know we know for

11868
03:23:31,190 --> 03:23:31,200
possibly be true you know we know for
 

11869
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:32,550
possibly be true you know we know for
300 years we've been doing all this

11870
03:23:32,550 --> 03:23:32,560
300 years we've been doing all this
 

11871
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:33,750
300 years we've been doing all this
stuff right

11872
03:23:33,750 --> 03:23:33,760
stuff right
 

11873
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:35,030
stuff right
to be fair

11874
03:23:35,030 --> 03:23:35,040
to be fair
 

11875
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:36,550
to be fair
i now realize on a little bit more

11876
03:23:36,550 --> 03:23:36,560
i now realize on a little bit more
 

11877
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:39,349
i now realize on a little bit more
analysis of what people actually said

11878
03:23:39,349 --> 03:23:39,359
analysis of what people actually said
 

11879
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:40,950
analysis of what people actually said
in pretty much every field other than

11880
03:23:40,950 --> 03:23:40,960
in pretty much every field other than
 

11881
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:41,910
in pretty much every field other than
physics

11882
03:23:41,910 --> 03:23:41,920
physics
 

11883
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:43,990
physics
people said oh these are new models

11884
03:23:43,990 --> 03:23:44,000
people said oh these are new models
 

11885
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,630
people said oh these are new models
that's pretty interesting in physics

11886
03:23:46,630 --> 03:23:46,640
that's pretty interesting in physics
 

11887
03:23:46,640 --> 03:23:48,150
that's pretty interesting in physics
people were like we've got our physics

11888
03:23:48,150 --> 03:23:48,160
people were like we've got our physics
 

11889
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:50,150
people were like we've got our physics
models we're very happy with them yeah

11890
03:23:50,150 --> 03:23:50,160
models we're very happy with them yeah
 

11891
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:51,670
models we're very happy with them yeah
in physics there's more resistance

11892
03:23:51,670 --> 03:23:51,680
in physics there's more resistance
 

11893
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:53,510
in physics there's more resistance
because of the attachment and the power

11894
03:23:53,510 --> 03:23:53,520
because of the attachment and the power
 

11895
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:55,510
because of the attachment and the power
of the equations right the idea that

11896
03:23:55,510 --> 03:23:55,520
of the equations right the idea that
 

11897
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:57,590
of the equations right the idea that
programs might be the right way to

11898
03:23:57,590 --> 03:23:57,600
programs might be the right way to
 

11899
03:23:57,600 --> 03:23:58,550
programs might be the right way to
approach

11900
03:23:58,550 --> 03:23:58,560
approach
 

11901
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:00,870
approach
right uh this field was uh there's some

11902
03:24:00,870 --> 03:24:00,880
right uh this field was uh there's some
 

11903
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:02,950
right uh this field was uh there's some
resistance and like you're saying

11904
03:24:02,950 --> 03:24:02,960
resistance and like you're saying
 

11905
03:24:02,960 --> 03:24:05,510
resistance and like you're saying
it takes time for somebody who likes the

11906
03:24:05,510 --> 03:24:05,520
it takes time for somebody who likes the
 

11907
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:07,349
it takes time for somebody who likes the
idea of time dilation and all these

11908
03:24:07,349 --> 03:24:07,359
idea of time dilation and all these
 

11909
03:24:07,359 --> 03:24:08,630
idea of time dilation and all these
applications i thought you would

11910
03:24:08,630 --> 03:24:08,640
applications i thought you would
 

11911
03:24:08,640 --> 03:24:10,630
applications i thought you would
understand this yeah right but but you

11912
03:24:10,630 --> 03:24:10,640
understand this yeah right but but you
 

11913
03:24:10,640 --> 03:24:12,630
understand this yeah right but but you
know and computational introduceability

11914
03:24:12,630 --> 03:24:12,640
know and computational introduceability
 

11915
03:24:12,640 --> 03:24:15,190
know and computational introduceability
yes exactly but but i mean it is really

11916
03:24:15,190 --> 03:24:15,200
yes exactly but but i mean it is really
 

11917
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:17,429
yes exactly but but i mean it is really
interesting that just 20 years

11918
03:24:17,429 --> 03:24:17,439
interesting that just 20 years
 

11919
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:19,990
interesting that just 20 years
a span of 20 years it's gone from you

11920
03:24:19,990 --> 03:24:20,000
a span of 20 years it's gone from you
 

11921
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:22,309
a span of 20 years it's gone from you
know pitchforks and horror

11922
03:24:22,309 --> 03:24:22,319
know pitchforks and horror
 

11923
03:24:22,319 --> 03:24:23,110
know pitchforks and horror
to

11924
03:24:23,110 --> 03:24:23,120
to
 

11925
03:24:23,120 --> 03:24:25,590
to
yeah we get it and um you know it's

11926
03:24:25,590 --> 03:24:25,600
yeah we get it and um you know it's
 

11927
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:26,389
yeah we get it and um you know it's
helped

11928
03:24:26,389 --> 03:24:26,399
helped
 

11929
03:24:26,399 --> 03:24:29,190
helped
that we've you know in our current

11930
03:24:29,190 --> 03:24:29,200
that we've you know in our current
 

11931
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:30,950
that we've you know in our current
effort in fundamental physics we've

11932
03:24:30,950 --> 03:24:30,960
effort in fundamental physics we've
 

11933
03:24:30,960 --> 03:24:32,469
effort in fundamental physics we've
gotten a lot further and we've managed

11934
03:24:32,469 --> 03:24:32,479
gotten a lot further and we've managed
 

11935
03:24:32,479 --> 03:24:33,269
gotten a lot further and we've managed
to

11936
03:24:33,269 --> 03:24:33,279
to
 

11937
03:24:33,279 --> 03:24:35,349
to
put a lot of puzzle pieces together that

11938
03:24:35,349 --> 03:24:35,359
put a lot of puzzle pieces together that
 

11939
03:24:35,359 --> 03:24:37,269
put a lot of puzzle pieces together that
that makes sense but the thing that i've

11940
03:24:37,269 --> 03:24:37,279
that makes sense but the thing that i've
 

11941
03:24:37,279 --> 03:24:38,870
that makes sense but the thing that i've
been thinking about recently is this

11942
03:24:38,870 --> 03:24:38,880
been thinking about recently is this
 

11943
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:41,110
been thinking about recently is this
field of complexity so i i've kind of

11944
03:24:41,110 --> 03:24:41,120
field of complexity so i i've kind of
 

11945
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:43,990
field of complexity so i i've kind of
was a sort of a a field builder back in

11946
03:24:43,990 --> 03:24:44,000
was a sort of a a field builder back in
 

11947
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,870
was a sort of a a field builder back in
the 1980s i was kind of like okay you

11948
03:24:46,870 --> 03:24:46,880
the 1980s i was kind of like okay you
 

11949
03:24:46,880 --> 03:24:49,990
the 1980s i was kind of like okay you
know can we uh you know i i'd understood

11950
03:24:49,990 --> 03:24:50,000
know can we uh you know i i'd understood
 

11951
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:51,110
know can we uh you know i i'd understood
this point that there was this sort of

11952
03:24:51,110 --> 03:24:51,120
this point that there was this sort of
 

11953
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:52,790
this point that there was this sort of
fundamental phenomenon of complexity and

11954
03:24:52,790 --> 03:24:52,800
fundamental phenomenon of complexity and
 

11955
03:24:52,800 --> 03:24:54,389
fundamental phenomenon of complexity and
showed up in lots of places

11956
03:24:54,389 --> 03:24:54,399
showed up in lots of places
 

11957
03:24:54,399 --> 03:24:56,229
showed up in lots of places
and i was like this is an interesting

11958
03:24:56,229 --> 03:24:56,239
and i was like this is an interesting
 

11959
03:24:56,239 --> 03:24:59,110
and i was like this is an interesting
sort of field of science and i was uh

11960
03:24:59,110 --> 03:24:59,120
sort of field of science and i was uh
 

11961
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:00,710
sort of field of science and i was uh
recently

11962
03:25:00,710 --> 03:25:00,720
recently
 

11963
03:25:00,720 --> 03:25:02,790
recently
was reminded i was at this the very

11964
03:25:02,790 --> 03:25:02,800
was reminded i was at this the very
 

11965
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:05,110
was reminded i was at this the very
first sort of get-together of what

11966
03:25:05,110 --> 03:25:05,120
first sort of get-together of what
 

11967
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:07,349
first sort of get-together of what
became the santa fe institute and i was

11968
03:25:07,349 --> 03:25:07,359
became the santa fe institute and i was
 

11969
03:25:07,359 --> 03:25:08,630
became the santa fe institute and i was
like in fact there's even an audio

11970
03:25:08,630 --> 03:25:08,640
like in fact there's even an audio
 

11971
03:25:08,640 --> 03:25:10,870
like in fact there's even an audio
recording of me sort of saying people

11972
03:25:10,870 --> 03:25:10,880
recording of me sort of saying people
 

11973
03:25:10,880 --> 03:25:11,910
recording of me sort of saying people
have been talking about oh what should

11974
03:25:11,910 --> 03:25:11,920
have been talking about oh what should
 

11975
03:25:11,920 --> 03:25:13,750
have been talking about oh what should
this play you know outfit do and i was

11976
03:25:13,750 --> 03:25:13,760
this play you know outfit do and i was
 

11977
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:15,910
this play you know outfit do and i was
saying well there is this thing that

11978
03:25:15,910 --> 03:25:15,920
saying well there is this thing that
 

11979
03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:17,110
saying well there is this thing that
i've been thinking about it's this kind

11980
03:25:17,110 --> 03:25:17,120
i've been thinking about it's this kind
 

11981
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:19,830
i've been thinking about it's this kind
of idea of complexity nice and um it's

11982
03:25:19,830 --> 03:25:19,840
of idea of complexity nice and um it's
 

11983
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:20,870
of idea of complexity nice and um it's
kind of like

11984
03:25:20,870 --> 03:25:20,880
kind of like
 

11985
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:22,710
kind of like
and that's that's what that ended up you

11986
03:25:22,710 --> 03:25:22,720
and that's that's what that ended up you
 

11987
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:24,309
and that's that's what that ended up you
implanted the seat of complexity to

11988
03:25:24,309 --> 03:25:24,319
implanted the seat of complexity to
 

11989
03:25:24,319 --> 03:25:25,830
implanted the seat of complexity to
santa fe that's beautiful it's a

11990
03:25:25,830 --> 03:25:25,840
santa fe that's beautiful it's a
 

11991
03:25:25,840 --> 03:25:27,750
santa fe that's beautiful it's a
beautiful vision but but i mean so that

11992
03:25:27,750 --> 03:25:27,760
beautiful vision but but i mean so that
 

11993
03:25:27,760 --> 03:25:30,550
beautiful vision but but i mean so that
but what's happened then is this idea of

11994
03:25:30,550 --> 03:25:30,560
but what's happened then is this idea of
 

11995
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:32,150
but what's happened then is this idea of
complexity and you know ken you know and

11996
03:25:32,150 --> 03:25:32,160
complexity and you know ken you know and
 

11997
03:25:32,160 --> 03:25:34,630
complexity and you know ken you know and
i started the first research center at

11998
03:25:34,630 --> 03:25:34,640
i started the first research center at
 

11999
03:25:34,640 --> 03:25:36,070
i started the first research center at
university of illinois for doing that in

12000
03:25:36,070 --> 03:25:36,080
university of illinois for doing that in
 

12001
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:38,389
university of illinois for doing that in
the first journal complex systems and so

12002
03:25:38,389 --> 03:25:38,399
the first journal complex systems and so
 

12003
03:25:38,399 --> 03:25:40,550
the first journal complex systems and so
on and uh and it's kind of an

12004
03:25:40,550 --> 03:25:40,560
on and uh and it's kind of an
 

12005
03:25:40,560 --> 03:25:43,110
on and uh and it's kind of an
interesting thing in in my life at least

12006
03:25:43,110 --> 03:25:43,120
interesting thing in in my life at least
 

12007
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:45,030
interesting thing in in my life at least
that it's kind of like you plant this

12008
03:25:45,030 --> 03:25:45,040
that it's kind of like you plant this
 

12009
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:47,349
that it's kind of like you plant this
seed you have this idea it's a kind of a

12010
03:25:47,349 --> 03:25:47,359
seed you have this idea it's a kind of a
 

12011
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:49,590
seed you have this idea it's a kind of a
science idea you have this idea of sort

12012
03:25:49,590 --> 03:25:49,600
science idea you have this idea of sort
 

12013
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:50,790
science idea you have this idea of sort
of focusing on the phenomenon of

12014
03:25:50,790 --> 03:25:50,800
of focusing on the phenomenon of
 

12015
03:25:50,800 --> 03:25:53,190
of focusing on the phenomenon of
complexity the deeper idea was this

12016
03:25:53,190 --> 03:25:53,200
complexity the deeper idea was this
 

12017
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:55,670
complexity the deeper idea was this
computational paradigm but the the

12018
03:25:55,670 --> 03:25:55,680
computational paradigm but the the
 

12019
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:57,269
computational paradigm but the the
nominal idea is this kind of idea of

12020
03:25:57,269 --> 03:25:57,279
nominal idea is this kind of idea of
 

12021
03:25:57,279 --> 03:25:59,590
nominal idea is this kind of idea of
complexity okay then you roll time

12022
03:25:59,590 --> 03:25:59,600
complexity okay then you roll time
 

12023
03:25:59,600 --> 03:26:02,150
complexity okay then you roll time
forward 30 years or whatever 35 years

12024
03:26:02,150 --> 03:26:02,160
forward 30 years or whatever 35 years
 

12025
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:04,469
forward 30 years or whatever 35 years
whatever it is um and you say what

12026
03:26:04,469 --> 03:26:04,479
whatever it is um and you say what
 

12027
03:26:04,479 --> 03:26:06,229
whatever it is um and you say what
happened okay well now there are a

12028
03:26:06,229 --> 03:26:06,239
happened okay well now there are a
 

12029
03:26:06,239 --> 03:26:07,990
happened okay well now there are a
thousand complexity institutes around

12030
03:26:07,990 --> 03:26:08,000
thousand complexity institutes around
 

12031
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,229
thousand complexity institutes around
the world um i think more or less we've

12032
03:26:10,229 --> 03:26:10,239
the world um i think more or less we've
 

12033
03:26:10,239 --> 03:26:12,950
the world um i think more or less we've
been trying to count them um and uh you

12034
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:12,960
been trying to count them um and uh you
 

12035
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:14,950
been trying to count them um and uh you
know there are 40 complexity journals i

12036
03:26:14,950 --> 03:26:14,960
know there are 40 complexity journals i
 

12037
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:17,670
know there are 40 complexity journals i
think um and so

12038
03:26:17,670 --> 03:26:17,680
think um and so
 

12039
03:26:17,680 --> 03:26:19,269
think um and so
it's kind of like what actually happened

12040
03:26:19,269 --> 03:26:19,279
it's kind of like what actually happened
 

12041
03:26:19,279 --> 03:26:21,750
it's kind of like what actually happened
in this field right and and i look at a

12042
03:26:21,750 --> 03:26:21,760
in this field right and and i look at a
 

12043
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:23,990
in this field right and and i look at a
lot of what happened and i'm like

12044
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:24,000
lot of what happened and i'm like
 

12045
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:26,229
lot of what happened and i'm like
uh you know i have to admit to some eye

12046
03:26:26,229 --> 03:26:26,239
uh you know i have to admit to some eye
 

12047
03:26:26,239 --> 03:26:28,550
uh you know i have to admit to some eye
rolling so to speak because it's kind of

12048
03:26:28,550 --> 03:26:28,560
rolling so to speak because it's kind of
 

12049
03:26:28,560 --> 03:26:30,790
rolling so to speak because it's kind of
like like what is what what's what

12050
03:26:30,790 --> 03:26:30,800
like like what is what what's what
 

12051
03:26:30,800 --> 03:26:32,150
like like what is what what's what
what's actually going on well what

12052
03:26:32,150 --> 03:26:32,160
what's actually going on well what
 

12053
03:26:32,160 --> 03:26:33,990
what's actually going on well what
people definitely got

12054
03:26:33,990 --> 03:26:34,000
people definitely got
 

12055
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:36,550
people definitely got
was this idea of computational models

12056
03:26:36,550 --> 03:26:36,560
was this idea of computational models
 

12057
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:38,469
was this idea of computational models
and then they got but they thought one

12058
03:26:38,469 --> 03:26:38,479
and then they got but they thought one
 

12059
03:26:38,479 --> 03:26:39,830
and then they got but they thought one
of the one of the kind of cognitive

12060
03:26:39,830 --> 03:26:39,840
of the one of the kind of cognitive
 

12061
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:42,389
of the one of the kind of cognitive
mistakes i think is they say we've got a

12062
03:26:42,389 --> 03:26:42,399
mistakes i think is they say we've got a
 

12063
03:26:42,399 --> 03:26:43,910
mistakes i think is they say we've got a
computational model

12064
03:26:43,910 --> 03:26:43,920
computational model
 

12065
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:45,590
computational model
and it

12066
03:26:45,590 --> 03:26:45,600
and it
 

12067
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:47,030
and it
and we're looking at a system that's

12068
03:26:47,030 --> 03:26:47,040
and we're looking at a system that's
 

12069
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:48,389
and we're looking at a system that's
complex

12070
03:26:48,389 --> 03:26:48,399
complex
 

12071
03:26:48,399 --> 03:26:50,229
complex
and our computational model gives

12072
03:26:50,229 --> 03:26:50,239
and our computational model gives
 

12073
03:26:50,239 --> 03:26:52,469
and our computational model gives
complexity by goalie that must mean it's

12074
03:26:52,469 --> 03:26:52,479
complexity by goalie that must mean it's
 

12075
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:53,429
complexity by goalie that must mean it's
right

12076
03:26:53,429 --> 03:26:53,439
right
 

12077
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:55,990
right
and unfortunately because complexity is

12078
03:26:55,990 --> 03:26:56,000
and unfortunately because complexity is
 

12079
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:57,750
and unfortunately because complexity is
a generic phenomenon and computational

12080
03:26:57,750 --> 03:26:57,760
a generic phenomenon and computational
 

12081
03:26:57,760 --> 03:26:59,510
a generic phenomenon and computational
irreducibility is a

12082
03:26:59,510 --> 03:26:59,520
irreducibility is a
 

12083
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:00,870
irreducibility is a
generic phenomenon that actually tells

12084
03:27:00,870 --> 03:27:00,880
generic phenomenon that actually tells
 

12085
03:27:00,880 --> 03:27:01,910
generic phenomenon that actually tells
you nothing

12086
03:27:01,910 --> 03:27:01,920
you nothing
 

12087
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:03,670
you nothing
and so then the question is well what

12088
03:27:03,670 --> 03:27:03,680
and so then the question is well what
 

12089
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:05,830
and so then the question is well what
can you do you know there's a a lot of

12090
03:27:05,830 --> 03:27:05,840
can you do you know there's a a lot of
 

12091
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:07,030
can you do you know there's a a lot of
things that have been sort of done under

12092
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:07,040
things that have been sort of done under
 

12093
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:08,550
things that have been sort of done under
this banner of complexity and i think

12094
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:08,560
this banner of complexity and i think
 

12095
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:10,550
this banner of complexity and i think
it's been very successful in providing

12096
03:27:10,550 --> 03:27:10,560
it's been very successful in providing
 

12097
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:12,790
it's been very successful in providing
sort of an interdisciplinary way of

12098
03:27:12,790 --> 03:27:12,800
sort of an interdisciplinary way of
 

12099
03:27:12,800 --> 03:27:14,469
sort of an interdisciplinary way of
connecting different fields together

12100
03:27:14,469 --> 03:27:14,479
connecting different fields together
 

12101
03:27:14,479 --> 03:27:16,309
connecting different fields together
which is powerful in itself right i mean

12102
03:27:16,309 --> 03:27:16,319
which is powerful in itself right i mean
 

12103
03:27:16,319 --> 03:27:18,550
which is powerful in itself right i mean
that's a biology in economics and yeah

12104
03:27:18,550 --> 03:27:18,560
that's a biology in economics and yeah
 

12105
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:20,150
that's a biology in economics and yeah
it is right and it's a good organizing

12106
03:27:20,150 --> 03:27:20,160
it is right and it's a good organizing
 

12107
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:22,070
it is right and it's a good organizing
principle but but in the end a lot of

12108
03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:22,080
principle but but in the end a lot of
 

12109
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:23,190
principle but but in the end a lot of
that is around this kind of

12110
03:27:23,190 --> 03:27:23,200
that is around this kind of
 

12111
03:27:23,200 --> 03:27:24,790
that is around this kind of
computational paradigm computational

12112
03:27:24,790 --> 03:27:24,800
computational paradigm computational
 

12113
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:27,190
computational paradigm computational
modeling that's the raw material that

12114
03:27:27,190 --> 03:27:27,200
modeling that's the raw material that
 

12115
03:27:27,200 --> 03:27:28,950
modeling that's the raw material that
powers that kind of uh that kind of

12116
03:27:28,950 --> 03:27:28,960
powers that kind of uh that kind of
 

12117
03:27:28,960 --> 03:27:30,950
powers that kind of uh that kind of
correspondence i think and the question

12118
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:30,960
correspondence i think and the question
 

12119
03:27:30,960 --> 03:27:32,870
correspondence i think and the question
is sort of what is the you know i was

12120
03:27:32,870 --> 03:27:32,880
is sort of what is the you know i was
 

12121
03:27:32,880 --> 03:27:34,790
is sort of what is the you know i was
just thinking recently you know we've

12122
03:27:34,790 --> 03:27:34,800
just thinking recently you know we've
 

12123
03:27:34,800 --> 03:27:37,110
just thinking recently you know we've
been i mean the the other we've been

12124
03:27:37,110 --> 03:27:37,120
been i mean the the other we've been
 

12125
03:27:37,120 --> 03:27:37,990
been i mean the the other we've been
we've been

12126
03:27:37,990 --> 03:27:38,000
we've been
 

12127
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:39,670
we've been
for years people told me you should

12128
03:27:39,670 --> 03:27:39,680
for years people told me you should
 

12129
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:41,429
for years people told me you should
start some will from institute that does

12130
03:27:41,429 --> 03:27:41,439
start some will from institute that does
 

12131
03:27:41,439 --> 03:27:43,670
start some will from institute that does
basic science you know all i have is a

12132
03:27:43,670 --> 03:27:43,680
basic science you know all i have is a
 

12133
03:27:43,680 --> 03:27:46,070
basic science you know all i have is a
company that that builds software and we

12134
03:27:46,070 --> 03:27:46,080
company that that builds software and we
 

12135
03:27:46,080 --> 03:27:47,429
company that that builds software and we
you know we have a little piece that

12136
03:27:47,429 --> 03:27:47,439
you know we have a little piece that
 

12137
03:27:47,439 --> 03:27:49,269
you know we have a little piece that
does basic science as kind of a hobby

12138
03:27:49,269 --> 03:27:49,279
does basic science as kind of a hobby
 

12139
03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:50,870
does basic science as kind of a hobby
people are saying you should start this

12140
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:50,880
people are saying you should start this
 

12141
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:53,110
people are saying you should start this
wolfram institute thing and and i've

12142
03:27:53,110 --> 03:27:53,120
wolfram institute thing and and i've
 

12143
03:27:53,120 --> 03:27:54,389
wolfram institute thing and and i've
been you know because i've known about

12144
03:27:54,389 --> 03:27:54,399
been you know because i've known about
 

12145
03:27:54,399 --> 03:27:55,910
been you know because i've known about
lots of institutes and i've seen kind of

12146
03:27:55,910 --> 03:27:55,920
lots of institutes and i've seen kind of
 

12147
03:27:55,920 --> 03:27:57,910
lots of institutes and i've seen kind of
that flow of money and and kind of you

12148
03:27:57,910 --> 03:27:57,920
that flow of money and and kind of you
 

12149
03:27:57,920 --> 03:27:59,110
that flow of money and and kind of you
know what happens in different

12150
03:27:59,110 --> 03:27:59,120
know what happens in different
 

12151
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:00,790
know what happens in different
situations and so on so i've been kind

12152
03:28:00,790 --> 03:28:00,800
situations and so on so i've been kind
 

12153
03:28:00,800 --> 03:28:03,269
situations and so on so i've been kind
of reluctant but uh but i've i've i have

12154
03:28:03,269 --> 03:28:03,279
of reluctant but uh but i've i've i have
 

12155
03:28:03,279 --> 03:28:04,950
of reluctant but uh but i've i've i have
realized that you know what we've done

12156
03:28:04,950 --> 03:28:04,960
realized that you know what we've done
 

12157
03:28:04,960 --> 03:28:07,110
realized that you know what we've done
with our company over the last 35 years

12158
03:28:07,110 --> 03:28:07,120
with our company over the last 35 years
 

12159
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:09,110
with our company over the last 35 years
you know we built a very good machine

12160
03:28:09,110 --> 03:28:09,120
you know we built a very good machine
 

12161
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:10,469
you know we built a very good machine
for doing r d

12162
03:28:10,469 --> 03:28:10,479
for doing r d
 

12163
03:28:10,479 --> 03:28:12,229
for doing r d
and you know innovating and creating

12164
03:28:12,229 --> 03:28:12,239
and you know innovating and creating
 

12165
03:28:12,239 --> 03:28:14,710
and you know innovating and creating
things and i just applied that machine

12166
03:28:14,710 --> 03:28:14,720
things and i just applied that machine
 

12167
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:16,710
things and i just applied that machine
to the physics project that's how we did

12168
03:28:16,710 --> 03:28:16,720
to the physics project that's how we did
 

12169
03:28:16,720 --> 03:28:18,229
to the physics project that's how we did
the physics project in a fairly short

12170
03:28:18,229 --> 03:28:18,239
the physics project in a fairly short
 

12171
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:21,510
the physics project in a fairly short
amount of time with a you know efficient

12172
03:28:21,510 --> 03:28:21,520
amount of time with a you know efficient
 

12173
03:28:21,520 --> 03:28:23,190
amount of time with a you know efficient
machine with you know various people

12174
03:28:23,190 --> 03:28:23,200
machine with you know various people
 

12175
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:26,150
machine with you know various people
involved and so on um and so you know it

12176
03:28:26,150 --> 03:28:26,160
involved and so on um and so you know it
 

12177
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:28,550
involved and so on um and so you know it
it works for basic science and it's like

12178
03:28:28,550 --> 03:28:28,560
it works for basic science and it's like
 

12179
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:30,309
it works for basic science and it's like
we can do more of this

12180
03:28:30,309 --> 03:28:30,319
we can do more of this
 

12181
03:28:30,319 --> 03:28:32,950
we can do more of this
and so biology and chemistry so it's

12182
03:28:32,950 --> 03:28:32,960
and so biology and chemistry so it's
 

12183
03:28:32,960 --> 03:28:35,110
and so biology and chemistry so it's
it's become an institute yes well it

12184
03:28:35,110 --> 03:28:35,120
it's become an institute yes well it
 

12185
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:36,389
it's become an institute yes well it
needs to become an institution an

12186
03:28:36,389 --> 03:28:36,399
needs to become an institution an
 

12187
03:28:36,399 --> 03:28:38,070
needs to become an institution an
official institute right right but the

12188
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:38,080
official institute right right but the
 

12189
03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:40,070
official institute right right but the
the thing that so i was thinking about

12190
03:28:40,070 --> 03:28:40,080
the thing that so i was thinking about
 

12191
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:42,710
the thing that so i was thinking about
okay so what do we do with complexity

12192
03:28:42,710 --> 03:28:42,720
okay so what do we do with complexity
 

12193
03:28:42,720 --> 03:28:44,469
okay so what do we do with complexity
you know what what there are all these

12194
03:28:44,469 --> 03:28:44,479
you know what what there are all these
 

12195
03:28:44,479 --> 03:28:46,229
you know what what there are all these
people who've you know what what should

12196
03:28:46,229 --> 03:28:46,239
people who've you know what what should
 

12197
03:28:46,239 --> 03:28:48,070
people who've you know what what should
happen to that field yeah and what i

12198
03:28:48,070 --> 03:28:48,080
happen to that field yeah and what i
 

12199
03:28:48,080 --> 03:28:50,070
happen to that field yeah and what i
realized is there's kind of this area of

12200
03:28:50,070 --> 03:28:50,080
realized is there's kind of this area of
 

12201
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:52,790
realized is there's kind of this area of
foundations of complexity that's about

12202
03:28:52,790 --> 03:28:52,800
foundations of complexity that's about
 

12203
03:28:52,800 --> 03:28:54,469
foundations of complexity that's about
these questions about simple programs

12204
03:28:54,469 --> 03:28:54,479
these questions about simple programs
 

12205
03:28:54,479 --> 03:28:56,469
these questions about simple programs
what they do that's far away from a

12206
03:28:56,469 --> 03:28:56,479
what they do that's far away from a
 

12207
03:28:56,479 --> 03:28:57,990
what they do that's far away from a
bunch of the detailed applications the

12208
03:28:57,990 --> 03:28:58,000
bunch of the detailed applications the
 

12209
03:28:58,000 --> 03:28:59,670
bunch of the detailed applications the
people well it's not far away it's it's

12210
03:28:59,670 --> 03:28:59,680
people well it's not far away it's it's
 

12211
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:02,630
people well it's not far away it's it's
the it's the under you know the bedrock

12212
03:29:02,630 --> 03:29:02,640
the it's the under you know the bedrock
 

12213
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:04,630
the it's the under you know the bedrock
underneath those applications so i

12214
03:29:04,630 --> 03:29:04,640
underneath those applications so i
 

12215
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:06,870
underneath those applications so i
realized recently this is my a recent

12216
03:29:06,870 --> 03:29:06,880
realized recently this is my a recent
 

12217
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:09,830
realized recently this is my a recent
kind of little uh innovation of a sort

12218
03:29:09,830 --> 03:29:09,840
kind of little uh innovation of a sort
 

12219
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:13,190
kind of little uh innovation of a sort
um a post that i'll do very soon

12220
03:29:13,190 --> 03:29:13,200
um a post that i'll do very soon
 

12221
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:15,670
um a post that i'll do very soon
um about um

12222
03:29:15,670 --> 03:29:15,680
um about um
 

12223
03:29:15,680 --> 03:29:18,229
um about um
uh kind of you know the foundations of

12224
03:29:18,229 --> 03:29:18,239
uh kind of you know the foundations of
 

12225
03:29:18,239 --> 03:29:20,469
uh kind of you know the foundations of
complexity what really are they i think

12226
03:29:20,469 --> 03:29:20,479
complexity what really are they i think
 

12227
03:29:20,479 --> 03:29:22,950
complexity what really are they i think
they're really two ideas two conceptual

12228
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:22,960
they're really two ideas two conceptual
 

12229
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:25,429
they're really two ideas two conceptual
ideas that i hadn't really enunciated i

12230
03:29:25,429 --> 03:29:25,439
ideas that i hadn't really enunciated i
 

12231
03:29:25,439 --> 03:29:27,269
ideas that i hadn't really enunciated i
think before one is what i call

12232
03:29:27,269 --> 03:29:27,279
think before one is what i call
 

12233
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:30,150
think before one is what i call
meta-modeling the other is ruleology

12234
03:29:30,150 --> 03:29:30,160
meta-modeling the other is ruleology
 

12235
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:32,229
meta-modeling the other is ruleology
so what is meta modeling so metamodeling

12236
03:29:32,229 --> 03:29:32,239
so what is meta modeling so metamodeling
 

12237
03:29:32,239 --> 03:29:34,150
so what is meta modeling so metamodeling
is you've got this complicated model and

12238
03:29:34,150 --> 03:29:34,160
is you've got this complicated model and
 

12239
03:29:34,160 --> 03:29:36,070
is you've got this complicated model and
it's a model of you know hedgehogs

12240
03:29:36,070 --> 03:29:36,080
it's a model of you know hedgehogs
 

12241
03:29:36,080 --> 03:29:37,670
it's a model of you know hedgehogs
interacting with this interacting with

12242
03:29:37,670 --> 03:29:37,680
interacting with this interacting with
 

12243
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,550
interacting with this interacting with
that

12244
03:29:38,550 --> 03:29:38,560
that
 

12245
03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:39,910
that
and the question is what's really

12246
03:29:39,910 --> 03:29:39,920
and the question is what's really
 

12247
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:42,070
and the question is what's really
underneath that what is it you know is

12248
03:29:42,070 --> 03:29:42,080
underneath that what is it you know is
 

12249
03:29:42,080 --> 03:29:44,550
underneath that what is it you know is
it a turing machine is it a cellular

12250
03:29:44,550 --> 03:29:44,560
it a turing machine is it a cellular
 

12251
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:46,309
it a turing machine is it a cellular
automaton you know what is the

12252
03:29:46,309 --> 03:29:46,319
automaton you know what is the
 

12253
03:29:46,319 --> 03:29:49,030
automaton you know what is the
underlying stuff underneath that model

12254
03:29:49,030 --> 03:29:49,040
underlying stuff underneath that model
 

12255
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:51,190
underlying stuff underneath that model
and so there's this kind of meta science

12256
03:29:51,190 --> 03:29:51,200
and so there's this kind of meta science
 

12257
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:54,150
and so there's this kind of meta science
question of given these models what is

12258
03:29:54,150 --> 03:29:54,160
question of given these models what is
 

12259
03:29:54,160 --> 03:29:56,469
question of given these models what is
the core model and i realized i mean to

12260
03:29:56,469 --> 03:29:56,479
the core model and i realized i mean to
 

12261
03:29:56,479 --> 03:29:58,309
the core model and i realized i mean to
me that's sort of an obvious question

12262
03:29:58,309 --> 03:29:58,319
me that's sort of an obvious question
 

12263
03:29:58,319 --> 03:29:59,750
me that's sort of an obvious question
but then i realized i've been doing

12264
03:29:59,750 --> 03:29:59,760
but then i realized i've been doing
 

12265
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:01,590
but then i realized i've been doing
language design for 40 years and

12266
03:30:01,590 --> 03:30:01,600
language design for 40 years and
 

12267
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:03,830
language design for 40 years and
language design is exactly that question

12268
03:30:03,830 --> 03:30:03,840
language design is exactly that question
 

12269
03:30:03,840 --> 03:30:05,590
language design is exactly that question
you know underneath all of this detailed

12270
03:30:05,590 --> 03:30:05,600
you know underneath all of this detailed
 

12271
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:07,830
you know underneath all of this detailed
stuff people do what are the underlying

12272
03:30:07,830 --> 03:30:07,840
stuff people do what are the underlying
 

12273
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:09,750
stuff people do what are the underlying
primitives and that's a question people

12274
03:30:09,750 --> 03:30:09,760
primitives and that's a question people
 

12275
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:11,910
primitives and that's a question people
haven't tended to ask about models they

12276
03:30:11,910 --> 03:30:11,920
haven't tended to ask about models they
 

12277
03:30:11,920 --> 03:30:13,349
haven't tended to ask about models they
say well we've got this nice model for

12278
03:30:13,349 --> 03:30:13,359
say well we've got this nice model for
 

12279
03:30:13,359 --> 03:30:14,790
say well we've got this nice model for
this and that and the other what's

12280
03:30:14,790 --> 03:30:14,800
this and that and the other what's
 

12281
03:30:14,800 --> 03:30:17,190
this and that and the other what's
really underneath it and what you know

12282
03:30:17,190 --> 03:30:17,200
really underneath it and what you know
 

12283
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:18,630
really underneath it and what you know
because once you have the thing that's

12284
03:30:18,630 --> 03:30:18,640
because once you have the thing that's
 

12285
03:30:18,640 --> 03:30:20,870
because once you have the thing that's
underneath it well for example this

12286
03:30:20,870 --> 03:30:20,880
underneath it well for example this
 

12287
03:30:20,880 --> 03:30:23,269
underneath it well for example this
multi-computation idea is an ultimate

12288
03:30:23,269 --> 03:30:23,279
multi-computation idea is an ultimate
 

12289
03:30:23,279 --> 03:30:25,510
multi-computation idea is an ultimate
meta modeling idea because it's saying

12290
03:30:25,510 --> 03:30:25,520
meta modeling idea because it's saying
 

12291
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:27,910
meta modeling idea because it's saying
underneath all these fields is one kind

12292
03:30:27,910 --> 03:30:27,920
underneath all these fields is one kind
 

12293
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:30,229
underneath all these fields is one kind
of paradigmatic structure and you know

12294
03:30:30,229 --> 03:30:30,239
of paradigmatic structure and you know
 

12295
03:30:30,239 --> 03:30:31,670
of paradigmatic structure and you know
you can you can imagine the same kind of

12296
03:30:31,670 --> 03:30:31,680
you can you can imagine the same kind of
 

12297
03:30:31,680 --> 03:30:34,790
you can you can imagine the same kind of
thing much more sort of uh

12298
03:30:34,790 --> 03:30:34,800
thing much more sort of uh
 

12299
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:37,750
thing much more sort of uh
much sort of shallower levels in in um

12300
03:30:37,750 --> 03:30:37,760
much sort of shallower levels in in um
 

12301
03:30:37,760 --> 03:30:39,349
much sort of shallower levels in in um
in different kinds of modeling so this

12302
03:30:39,349 --> 03:30:39,359
in different kinds of modeling so this
 

12303
03:30:39,359 --> 03:30:41,030
in different kinds of modeling so this
the first activity is this kind of meta

12304
03:30:41,030 --> 03:30:41,040
the first activity is this kind of meta
 

12305
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:44,070
the first activity is this kind of meta
modeling the the kind of the the models

12306
03:30:44,070 --> 03:30:44,080
modeling the the kind of the the models
 

12307
03:30:44,080 --> 03:30:46,309
modeling the the kind of the the models
about models so to speak you know what

12308
03:30:46,309 --> 03:30:46,319
about models so to speak you know what
 

12309
03:30:46,319 --> 03:30:48,389
about models so to speak you know what
is the what's what's you know drilling

12310
03:30:48,389 --> 03:30:48,399
is the what's what's you know drilling
 

12311
03:30:48,399 --> 03:30:50,870
is the what's what's you know drilling
down into models that's one thing the

12312
03:30:50,870 --> 03:30:50,880
down into models that's one thing the
 

12313
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:52,710
down into models that's one thing the
other thing is this this thing that i

12314
03:30:52,710 --> 03:30:52,720
other thing is this this thing that i
 

12315
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:54,790
other thing is this this thing that i
think we're going to call ruleology

12316
03:30:54,790 --> 03:30:54,800
think we're going to call ruleology
 

12317
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:56,389
think we're going to call ruleology
which is kind of the

12318
03:30:56,389 --> 03:30:56,399
which is kind of the
 

12319
03:30:56,399 --> 03:30:57,670
which is kind of the
okay you've got these simple rules

12320
03:30:57,670 --> 03:30:57,680
okay you've got these simple rules
 

12321
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:59,030
okay you've got these simple rules
you've got cellular automata you've got

12322
03:30:59,030 --> 03:30:59,040
you've got cellular automata you've got
 

12323
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:00,630
you've got cellular automata you've got
turing machines you've got substitution

12324
03:31:00,630 --> 03:31:00,640
turing machines you've got substitution
 

12325
03:31:00,640 --> 03:31:02,309
turing machines you've got substitution
systems you've got registered machines

12326
03:31:02,309 --> 03:31:02,319
systems you've got registered machines
 

12327
03:31:02,319 --> 03:31:03,670
systems you've got registered machines
got all these different things what do

12328
03:31:03,670 --> 03:31:03,680
got all these different things what do
 

12329
03:31:03,680 --> 03:31:06,550
got all these different things what do
they actually do in the wild and this is

12330
03:31:06,550 --> 03:31:06,560
they actually do in the wild and this is
 

12331
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:08,790
they actually do in the wild and this is
an area that i've spent a lot of time

12332
03:31:08,790 --> 03:31:08,800
an area that i've spent a lot of time
 

12333
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:10,469
an area that i've spent a lot of time
you know working on it's a lot of stuff

12334
03:31:10,469 --> 03:31:10,479
you know working on it's a lot of stuff
 

12335
03:31:10,479 --> 03:31:12,150
you know working on it's a lot of stuff
in my new kind of science book is about

12336
03:31:12,150 --> 03:31:12,160
in my new kind of science book is about
 

12337
03:31:12,160 --> 03:31:14,469
in my new kind of science book is about
this um you know this new book i wrote

12338
03:31:14,469 --> 03:31:14,479
this um you know this new book i wrote
 

12339
03:31:14,479 --> 03:31:16,469
this um you know this new book i wrote
about combinators is is full of stuff

12340
03:31:16,469 --> 03:31:16,479
about combinators is is full of stuff
 

12341
03:31:16,479 --> 03:31:17,510
about combinators is is full of stuff
like this

12342
03:31:17,510 --> 03:31:17,520
like this
 

12343
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:19,830
like this
and and this journal complex systems has

12344
03:31:19,830 --> 03:31:19,840
and and this journal complex systems has
 

12345
03:31:19,840 --> 03:31:21,269
and and this journal complex systems has
lots of papers about these kinds of

12346
03:31:21,269 --> 03:31:21,279
lots of papers about these kinds of
 

12347
03:31:21,279 --> 03:31:23,830
lots of papers about these kinds of
things but but there isn't really a home

12348
03:31:23,830 --> 03:31:23,840
things but but there isn't really a home
 

12349
03:31:23,840 --> 03:31:25,190
things but but there isn't really a home
for people who do

12350
03:31:25,190 --> 03:31:25,200
for people who do
 

12351
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:26,309
for people who do
or whatever

12352
03:31:26,309 --> 03:31:26,319
or whatever
 

12353
03:31:26,319 --> 03:31:29,590
or whatever
as you call the basic science of rules

12354
03:31:29,590 --> 03:31:29,600
as you call the basic science of rules
 

12355
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:30,389
as you call the basic science of rules
yes

12356
03:31:30,389 --> 03:31:30,399
yes
 

12357
03:31:30,399 --> 03:31:32,870
yes
yes right so it's it's like you've got

12358
03:31:32,870 --> 03:31:32,880
yes right so it's it's like you've got
 

12359
03:31:32,880 --> 03:31:35,269
yes right so it's it's like you've got
some what is it is it mathematics no it

12360
03:31:35,269 --> 03:31:35,279
some what is it is it mathematics no it
 

12361
03:31:35,279 --> 03:31:36,630
some what is it is it mathematics no it
isn't really like mathematics in fact

12362
03:31:36,630 --> 03:31:36,640
isn't really like mathematics in fact
 

12363
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:38,070
isn't really like mathematics in fact
from my now understanding of meta

12364
03:31:38,070 --> 03:31:38,080
from my now understanding of meta
 

12365
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:40,150
from my now understanding of meta
mathematics i understand that it's the

12366
03:31:40,150 --> 03:31:40,160
mathematics i understand that it's the
 

12367
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:42,309
mathematics i understand that it's the
molecular dynamics level it's not the

12368
03:31:42,309 --> 03:31:42,319
molecular dynamics level it's not the
 

12369
03:31:42,319 --> 03:31:43,990
molecular dynamics level it's not the
level that mathematicians have

12370
03:31:43,990 --> 03:31:44,000
level that mathematicians have
 

12371
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:45,670
level that mathematicians have
traditionally cared about it's not

12372
03:31:45,670 --> 03:31:45,680
traditionally cared about it's not
 

12373
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:47,590
traditionally cared about it's not
computer science because computer

12374
03:31:47,590 --> 03:31:47,600
computer science because computer
 

12375
03:31:47,600 --> 03:31:48,950
computer science because computer
science is about writing programs that

12376
03:31:48,950 --> 03:31:48,960
science is about writing programs that
 

12377
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:51,030
science is about writing programs that
do things you know that were for a

12378
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:51,040
do things you know that were for a
 

12379
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:53,110
do things you know that were for a
purpose not programs in the wild so to

12380
03:31:53,110 --> 03:31:53,120
purpose not programs in the wild so to
 

12381
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:55,030
purpose not programs in the wild so to
speak it's not physics it doesn't have

12382
03:31:55,030 --> 03:31:55,040
speak it's not physics it doesn't have
 

12383
03:31:55,040 --> 03:31:56,550
speak it's not physics it doesn't have
anything to do with you know maybe

12384
03:31:56,550 --> 03:31:56,560
anything to do with you know maybe
 

12385
03:31:56,560 --> 03:31:58,150
anything to do with you know maybe
underneath some physics but it's not

12386
03:31:58,150 --> 03:31:58,160
underneath some physics but it's not
 

12387
03:31:58,160 --> 03:32:00,710
underneath some physics but it's not
physics as such so it just hasn't had a

12388
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:00,720
physics as such so it just hasn't had a
 

12389
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:02,950
physics as such so it just hasn't had a
home and if you look at you know but

12390
03:32:02,950 --> 03:32:02,960
home and if you look at you know but
 

12391
03:32:02,960 --> 03:32:05,190
home and if you look at you know but
what's great about it is

12392
03:32:05,190 --> 03:32:05,200
what's great about it is
 

12393
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:07,670
what's great about it is
it's a surviving field so to speak it's

12394
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:07,680
it's a surviving field so to speak it's
 

12395
03:32:07,680 --> 03:32:09,110
it's a surviving field so to speak it's
something where you know one of the

12396
03:32:09,110 --> 03:32:09,120
something where you know one of the
 

12397
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:11,910
something where you know one of the
things i i find sort of inspiring about

12398
03:32:11,910 --> 03:32:11,920
things i i find sort of inspiring about
 

12399
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:13,910
things i i find sort of inspiring about
mathematics for example is you look at

12400
03:32:13,910 --> 03:32:13,920
mathematics for example is you look at
 

12401
03:32:13,920 --> 03:32:15,750
mathematics for example is you look at
mathematics that was done you know in

12402
03:32:15,750 --> 03:32:15,760
mathematics that was done you know in
 

12403
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:18,309
mathematics that was done you know in
ancient greece ancient you know babylon

12404
03:32:18,309 --> 03:32:18,319
ancient greece ancient you know babylon
 

12405
03:32:18,319 --> 03:32:20,710
ancient greece ancient you know babylon
egypt and so on it's still here today

12406
03:32:20,710 --> 03:32:20,720
egypt and so on it's still here today
 

12407
03:32:20,720 --> 03:32:22,389
egypt and so on it's still here today
you know you find an icosahedron that

12408
03:32:22,389 --> 03:32:22,399
you know you find an icosahedron that
 

12409
03:32:22,399 --> 03:32:24,870
you know you find an icosahedron that
somebody made in ancient egypt you look

12410
03:32:24,870 --> 03:32:24,880
somebody made in ancient egypt you look
 

12411
03:32:24,880 --> 03:32:27,110
somebody made in ancient egypt you look
at it oh that's a very modern thing it's

12412
03:32:27,110 --> 03:32:27,120
at it oh that's a very modern thing it's
 

12413
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:29,190
at it oh that's a very modern thing it's
an icosahedron you know it's it's a

12414
03:32:29,190 --> 03:32:29,200
an icosahedron you know it's it's a
 

12415
03:32:29,200 --> 03:32:31,750
an icosahedron you know it's it's a
timeless kind of kind of activity and

12416
03:32:31,750 --> 03:32:31,760
timeless kind of kind of activity and
 

12417
03:32:31,760 --> 03:32:33,750
timeless kind of kind of activity and
this idea of studying simple rules and

12418
03:32:33,750 --> 03:32:33,760
this idea of studying simple rules and
 

12419
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:36,150
this idea of studying simple rules and
what they do it's a timeless activity

12420
03:32:36,150 --> 03:32:36,160
what they do it's a timeless activity
 

12421
03:32:36,160 --> 03:32:37,670
what they do it's a timeless activity
and i can see that over the last 40

12422
03:32:37,670 --> 03:32:37,680
and i can see that over the last 40
 

12423
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:39,990
and i can see that over the last 40
years or so as you know

12424
03:32:39,990 --> 03:32:40,000
years or so as you know
 

12425
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:41,910
years or so as you know
even with cellular automata it's kind of

12426
03:32:41,910 --> 03:32:41,920
even with cellular automata it's kind of
 

12427
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:44,309
even with cellular automata it's kind of
like you know you can sort of catalogue

12428
03:32:44,309 --> 03:32:44,319
like you know you can sort of catalogue
 

12429
03:32:44,319 --> 03:32:45,429
like you know you can sort of catalogue
what what are the different cellular

12430
03:32:45,429 --> 03:32:45,439
what what are the different cellular
 

12431
03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:47,510
what what are the different cellular
autonomics are used for and you know

12432
03:32:47,510 --> 03:32:47,520
autonomics are used for and you know
 

12433
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:49,510
autonomics are used for and you know
like the the simplest rules like like

12434
03:32:49,510 --> 03:32:49,520
like the the simplest rules like like
 

12435
03:32:49,520 --> 03:32:51,349
like the the simplest rules like like
one you might even know this one rule

12436
03:32:51,349 --> 03:32:51,359
one you might even know this one rule
 

12437
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:54,550
one you might even know this one rule
184 it's um rule 184 is a minimal model

12438
03:32:54,550 --> 03:32:54,560
184 it's um rule 184 is a minimal model
 

12439
03:32:54,560 --> 03:32:56,710
184 it's um rule 184 is a minimal model
for road traffic flow and you know it's

12440
03:32:56,710 --> 03:32:56,720
for road traffic flow and you know it's
 

12441
03:32:56,720 --> 03:32:58,309
for road traffic flow and you know it's
also a minimal model for various other

12442
03:32:58,309 --> 03:32:58,319
also a minimal model for various other
 

12443
03:32:58,319 --> 03:33:00,070
also a minimal model for various other
things but it's kind of fun that you can

12444
03:33:00,070 --> 03:33:00,080
things but it's kind of fun that you can
 

12445
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:03,110
things but it's kind of fun that you can
literally say you know rule 90 is a

12446
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:03,120
literally say you know rule 90 is a
 

12447
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:05,269
literally say you know rule 90 is a
minimal model for this and this and this

12448
03:33:05,269 --> 03:33:05,279
minimal model for this and this and this
 

12449
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:07,830
minimal model for this and this and this
rule 4 is a minimal model for this and

12450
03:33:07,830 --> 03:33:07,840
rule 4 is a minimal model for this and
 

12451
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:09,590
rule 4 is a minimal model for this and
it's kind of remarkable that you can

12452
03:33:09,590 --> 03:33:09,600
it's kind of remarkable that you can
 

12453
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:11,750
it's kind of remarkable that you can
just by in this raw level of this kind

12454
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:11,760
just by in this raw level of this kind
 

12455
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:14,309
just by in this raw level of this kind
of study of rules they then branch

12456
03:33:14,309 --> 03:33:14,319
of study of rules they then branch
 

12457
03:33:14,319 --> 03:33:16,469
of study of rules they then branch
they're the raw material that you can

12458
03:33:16,469 --> 03:33:16,479
they're the raw material that you can
 

12459
03:33:16,479 --> 03:33:17,910
they're the raw material that you can
use to make models of different things

12460
03:33:17,910 --> 03:33:17,920
use to make models of different things
 

12461
03:33:17,920 --> 03:33:20,870
use to make models of different things
so it's a it's a very pure basic science

12462
03:33:20,870 --> 03:33:20,880
so it's a it's a very pure basic science
 

12463
03:33:20,880 --> 03:33:22,710
so it's a it's a very pure basic science
but it's one that you know people have

12464
03:33:22,710 --> 03:33:22,720
but it's one that you know people have
 

12465
03:33:22,720 --> 03:33:24,389
but it's one that you know people have
explored it but they've been kind of a

12466
03:33:24,389 --> 03:33:24,399
explored it but they've been kind of a
 

12467
03:33:24,399 --> 03:33:26,550
explored it but they've been kind of a
little bit in the wilderness and i think

12468
03:33:26,550 --> 03:33:26,560
little bit in the wilderness and i think
 

12469
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:27,830
little bit in the wilderness and i think
you know one of the things that i would

12470
03:33:27,830 --> 03:33:27,840
you know one of the things that i would
 

12471
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:31,110
you know one of the things that i would
like to do finally is is uh you know i

12472
03:33:31,110 --> 03:33:31,120
like to do finally is is uh you know i
 

12473
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:32,790
like to do finally is is uh you know i
always thought that sort of this notion

12474
03:33:32,790 --> 03:33:32,800
always thought that sort of this notion
 

12475
03:33:32,800 --> 03:33:35,830
always thought that sort of this notion
of pure and chaos pure and nks being the

12476
03:33:35,830 --> 03:33:35,840
of pure and chaos pure and nks being the
 

12477
03:33:35,840 --> 03:33:37,990
of pure and chaos pure and nks being the
acronym for my book new kind of science

03:33:37,990 --> 03:33:38,000
acronym for my book new kind of science
 

12479
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:40,070

um was um

12480
03:33:40,070 --> 03:33:40,080
um was um
 

12481
03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:41,429

was something that people should be

12482
03:33:41,429 --> 03:33:41,439
was something that people should be
 

12483
03:33:41,439 --> 03:33:43,110
was something that people should be
doing and you know we tried to figure

12484
03:33:43,110 --> 03:33:43,120
doing and you know we tried to figure
 

12485
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:44,710
doing and you know we tried to figure
out what's the right institutional

12486
03:33:44,710 --> 03:33:44,720
out what's the right institutional
 

12487
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:46,550
out what's the right institutional
structure to do this stuff you know we

12488
03:33:46,550 --> 03:33:46,560
structure to do this stuff you know we
 

12489
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:48,550
structure to do this stuff you know we
we dealt with a bunch of universities oh

12490
03:33:48,550 --> 03:33:48,560
we dealt with a bunch of universities oh
 

12491
03:33:48,560 --> 03:33:50,150
we dealt with a bunch of universities oh
you know can we do this here well what

12492
03:33:50,150 --> 03:33:50,160
you know can we do this here well what
 

12493
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:51,510
you know can we do this here well what
department would it be in it well it

12494
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:51,520
department would it be in it well it
 

12495
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:53,510
department would it be in it well it
isn't in a department it's it's its own

12496
03:33:53,510 --> 03:33:53,520
isn't in a department it's it's its own

03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:55,510
isn't in a department it's it's its own
new kind of thing that's why that's why

12498
03:33:55,510 --> 03:33:55,520
new kind of thing that's why that's why
 

12499
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:56,950
new kind of thing that's why that's why
the book was called the new kind of

12500
03:33:56,950 --> 03:33:56,960
the book was called the new kind of
 

12501
03:33:56,960 --> 03:33:59,830
the book was called the new kind of
science um it's kind of the the because

12502
03:33:59,830 --> 03:33:59,840
science um it's kind of the the because
 

12503
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:01,590
science um it's kind of the the because
that's an increasingly good description

12504
03:34:01,590 --> 03:34:01,600
that's an increasingly good description
 

12505
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:03,910
that's an increasingly good description
of what it is so to speak we're actually

12506
03:34:03,910 --> 03:34:03,920
of what it is so to speak we're actually
 

12507
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:05,269
of what it is so to speak we're actually
we were thinking about kind of the

12508
03:34:05,269 --> 03:34:05,279
we were thinking about kind of the
 

12509
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:07,990
we were thinking about kind of the
ruleological society because we're

12510
03:34:07,990 --> 03:34:08,000
ruleological society because we're
 

12511
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:09,910
ruleological society because we're
realizing that it's kind of

12512
03:34:09,910 --> 03:34:09,920
realizing that it's kind of
 

12513
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:11,349
realizing that it's kind of
it's it's some you know there's a

12514
03:34:11,349 --> 03:34:11,359
it's it's some you know there's a
 

12515
03:34:11,359 --> 03:34:13,190
it's it's some you know there's a
there's it's very it's very interesting

12516
03:34:13,190 --> 03:34:13,200
there's it's very it's very interesting
 

12517
03:34:13,200 --> 03:34:14,309
there's it's very it's very interesting
i mean i've never really done something

12518
03:34:14,309 --> 03:34:14,319
i mean i've never really done something
 

12519
03:34:14,319 --> 03:34:15,910
i mean i've never really done something
like this before because there's this

12520
03:34:15,910 --> 03:34:15,920
like this before because there's this
 

12521
03:34:15,920 --> 03:34:18,150
like this before because there's this
whole group of researchers who are

12522
03:34:18,150 --> 03:34:18,160
whole group of researchers who are
 

12523
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:20,630
whole group of researchers who are
who've been doing things that are really

12524
03:34:20,630 --> 03:34:20,640
who've been doing things that are really
 

12525
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:22,309
who've been doing things that are really
in some cases very elegant very

12526
03:34:22,309 --> 03:34:22,319
in some cases very elegant very
 

12527
03:34:22,319 --> 03:34:25,030
in some cases very elegant very
surviving very solid you know here's

12528
03:34:25,030 --> 03:34:25,040
surviving very solid you know here's
 

12529
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:26,630
surviving very solid you know here's
this thing that happens in this very

12530
03:34:26,630 --> 03:34:26,640
this thing that happens in this very
 

12531
03:34:26,640 --> 03:34:29,269
this thing that happens in this very
abstract system but it's like

12532
03:34:29,269 --> 03:34:29,279
abstract system but it's like
 

12533
03:34:29,279 --> 03:34:31,590
abstract system but it's like
it's like what is that part of you know

12534
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:31,600
it's like what is that part of you know
 

12535
03:34:31,600 --> 03:34:34,070
it's like what is that part of you know
it's it doesn't have a a home and i

12536
03:34:34,070 --> 03:34:34,080
it's it doesn't have a a home and i
 

12537
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:35,750
it's it doesn't have a a home and i
think that's something i you know i kind

12538
03:34:35,750 --> 03:34:35,760
think that's something i you know i kind
 

12539
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:37,830
think that's something i you know i kind
of fault myself for not having been more

12540
03:34:37,830 --> 03:34:37,840
of fault myself for not having been more
 

12541
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:39,349
of fault myself for not having been more
you know when complexity was developing

12542
03:34:39,349 --> 03:34:39,359
you know when complexity was developing
 

12543
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:43,349
you know when complexity was developing
in the 80s i didn't understand the the

12544
03:34:43,349 --> 03:34:43,359
in the 80s i didn't understand the the
 

12545
03:34:43,359 --> 03:34:46,229
in the 80s i didn't understand the the
the danger of applications that is it's

12546
03:34:46,229 --> 03:34:46,239
the danger of applications that is it's
 

12547
03:34:46,239 --> 03:34:47,590
the danger of applications that is it's
really cool that you can apply this to

12548
03:34:47,590 --> 03:34:47,600
really cool that you can apply this to
 

12549
03:34:47,600 --> 03:34:48,790
really cool that you can apply this to
economics and you can apply it to

12550
03:34:48,790 --> 03:34:48,800
economics and you can apply it to
 

12551
03:34:48,800 --> 03:34:50,710
economics and you can apply it to
evolutionary biology and this and that

12552
03:34:50,710 --> 03:34:50,720
evolutionary biology and this and that
 

12553
03:34:50,720 --> 03:34:52,870
evolutionary biology and this and that
and the other but what happens with

12554
03:34:52,870 --> 03:34:52,880
and the other but what happens with
 

12555
03:34:52,880 --> 03:34:54,469
and the other but what happens with
applications is everything gets sucked

12556
03:34:54,469 --> 03:34:54,479
applications is everything gets sucked
 

12557
03:34:54,479 --> 03:34:56,870
applications is everything gets sucked
into the applications and the pure stuff

12558
03:34:56,870 --> 03:34:56,880
into the applications and the pure stuff
 

12559
03:34:56,880 --> 03:34:58,870
into the applications and the pure stuff
it's like the pure mathematics there

12560
03:34:58,870 --> 03:34:58,880
it's like the pure mathematics there
 

12561
03:34:58,880 --> 03:35:00,870
it's like the pure mathematics there
isn't any pure mathematics so to speak

12562
03:35:00,870 --> 03:35:00,880
isn't any pure mathematics so to speak
 

12563
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:02,229
isn't any pure mathematics so to speak
it's all just applications of

12564
03:35:02,229 --> 03:35:02,239
it's all just applications of
 

12565
03:35:02,239 --> 03:35:05,110
it's all just applications of
mathematics and i i failed to kind of

12566
03:35:05,110 --> 03:35:05,120
mathematics and i i failed to kind of
 

12567
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:07,750
mathematics and i i failed to kind of
make sure that this kind of pure area

12568
03:35:07,750 --> 03:35:07,760
make sure that this kind of pure area
 

12569
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:10,630
make sure that this kind of pure area
was was kind of um maintained and and

12570
03:35:10,630 --> 03:35:10,640
was was kind of um maintained and and
 

12571
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:12,710
was was kind of um maintained and and
and developed and i think now you know

12572
03:35:12,710 --> 03:35:12,720
and developed and i think now you know
 

12573
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:14,710
and developed and i think now you know
one of the things i i want to try to do

12574
03:35:14,710 --> 03:35:14,720
one of the things i i want to try to do
 

12575
03:35:14,720 --> 03:35:16,150
one of the things i i want to try to do
and and you know it's a funny thing

12576
03:35:16,150 --> 03:35:16,160
and and you know it's a funny thing
 

12577
03:35:16,160 --> 03:35:18,550
and and you know it's a funny thing
because i'm used to look i've been a a

12578
03:35:18,550 --> 03:35:18,560
because i'm used to look i've been a a
 

12579
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:20,550
because i'm used to look i've been a a
tech ceo for more than half my life now

12580
03:35:20,550 --> 03:35:20,560
tech ceo for more than half my life now
 

12581
03:35:20,560 --> 03:35:22,469
tech ceo for more than half my life now
so you know this is what i know how to

12582
03:35:22,469 --> 03:35:22,479
so you know this is what i know how to
 

12583
03:35:22,479 --> 03:35:25,269
so you know this is what i know how to
do and um you know i can i can make

12584
03:35:25,269 --> 03:35:25,279
do and um you know i can i can make
 

12585
03:35:25,279 --> 03:35:27,670
do and um you know i can i can make
stuff happen and get projects to happen

12586
03:35:27,670 --> 03:35:27,680
stuff happen and get projects to happen
 

12587
03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:29,190
stuff happen and get projects to happen
even as it turns out basic science

12588
03:35:29,190 --> 03:35:29,200
even as it turns out basic science
 

12589
03:35:29,200 --> 03:35:31,830
even as it turns out basic science
projects in that kind of setting and and

12590
03:35:31,830 --> 03:35:31,840
projects in that kind of setting and and
 

12591
03:35:31,840 --> 03:35:34,469
projects in that kind of setting and and
how that translates into kind of

12592
03:35:34,469 --> 03:35:34,479
how that translates into kind of
 

12593
03:35:34,479 --> 03:35:35,590
how that translates into kind of
you know there are a lot of people

12594
03:35:35,590 --> 03:35:35,600
you know there are a lot of people
 

12595
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:36,950
you know there are a lot of people
working on for example our physics

12596
03:35:36,950 --> 03:35:36,960
working on for example our physics
 

12597
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:38,309
working on for example our physics
project sort of distributed through the

12598
03:35:38,309 --> 03:35:38,319
project sort of distributed through the
 

12599
03:35:38,319 --> 03:35:39,750
project sort of distributed through the
academic world and that's working just

12600
03:35:39,750 --> 03:35:39,760
academic world and that's working just
 

12601
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:41,670
academic world and that's working just
great but the question is you know can

12602
03:35:41,670 --> 03:35:41,680
great but the question is you know can
 

12603
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:44,550
great but the question is you know can
we have a sort of accelerator mechanism

12604
03:35:44,550 --> 03:35:44,560
we have a sort of accelerator mechanism
 

12605
03:35:44,560 --> 03:35:46,070
we have a sort of accelerator mechanism
that makes use of kind of what we've

12606
03:35:46,070 --> 03:35:46,080
that makes use of kind of what we've
 

12607
03:35:46,080 --> 03:35:49,510
that makes use of kind of what we've
learned in in sort of r d innovation and

12608
03:35:49,510 --> 03:35:49,520
learned in in sort of r d innovation and
 

12609
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:51,030
learned in in sort of r d innovation and
you know but on the other hand it's a

12610
03:35:51,030 --> 03:35:51,040
you know but on the other hand it's a
 

12611
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:52,389
you know but on the other hand it's a
funny thing because

12612
03:35:52,389 --> 03:35:52,399
funny thing because
 

12613
03:35:52,399 --> 03:35:55,269
funny thing because
you know in a company in the end the

12614
03:35:55,269 --> 03:35:55,279
you know in a company in the end the
 

12615
03:35:55,279 --> 03:35:57,190
you know in a company in the end the
thing is you know it's a company it

12616
03:35:57,190 --> 03:35:57,200
thing is you know it's a company it
 

12617
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:58,790
thing is you know it's a company it
makes products that sell things sells

12618
03:35:58,790 --> 03:35:58,800
makes products that sell things sells
 

12619
03:35:58,800 --> 03:36:01,190
makes products that sell things sells
things to people um in you know when

12620
03:36:01,190 --> 03:36:01,200
things to people um in you know when
 

12621
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:02,630
things to people um in you know when
you're doing basic research one of the

12622
03:36:02,630 --> 03:36:02,640
you're doing basic research one of the
 

12623
03:36:02,640 --> 03:36:04,710
you're doing basic research one of the
challenges is there isn't that same kind

12624
03:36:04,710 --> 03:36:04,720
challenges is there isn't that same kind
 

12625
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:07,750
challenges is there isn't that same kind
of of sort of mechanism and so it's it's

12626
03:36:07,750 --> 03:36:07,760
of of sort of mechanism and so it's it's
 

12627
03:36:07,760 --> 03:36:09,910
of of sort of mechanism and so it's it's
it's you know how do you drive the thing

12628
03:36:09,910 --> 03:36:09,920
it's you know how do you drive the thing
 

12629
03:36:09,920 --> 03:36:12,950
it's you know how do you drive the thing
in a in a kind of a led kind of way so

12630
03:36:12,950 --> 03:36:12,960
in a in a kind of a led kind of way so
 

12631
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:14,630
in a in a kind of a led kind of way so
that it really can can make forward

12632
03:36:14,630 --> 03:36:14,640
that it really can can make forward
 

12633
03:36:14,640 --> 03:36:16,710
that it really can can make forward
progress rather than you know what can

12634
03:36:16,710 --> 03:36:16,720
progress rather than you know what can
 

12635
03:36:16,720 --> 03:36:18,870
progress rather than you know what can
often happen in you know in in academic

12636
03:36:18,870 --> 03:36:18,880
often happen in you know in in academic
 

12637
03:36:18,880 --> 03:36:20,389
often happen in you know in in academic
settings where it's like well there are

12638
03:36:20,389 --> 03:36:20,399
settings where it's like well there are
 

12639
03:36:20,399 --> 03:36:22,070
settings where it's like well there are
all these flowers blooming but it's not

12640
03:36:22,070 --> 03:36:22,080
all these flowers blooming but it's not
 

12641
03:36:22,080 --> 03:36:24,229
all these flowers blooming but it's not
clear that they're you know that it's

12642
03:36:24,229 --> 03:36:24,239
clear that they're you know that it's
 

12643
03:36:24,239 --> 03:36:26,229
clear that they're you know that it's
that yeah they have a central mission

12644
03:36:26,229 --> 03:36:26,239
that yeah they have a central mission
 

12645
03:36:26,239 --> 03:36:28,389
that yeah they have a central mission
and a drive just like you do with the

12646
03:36:28,389 --> 03:36:28,399
and a drive just like you do with the
 

12647
03:36:28,399 --> 03:36:30,070
and a drive just like you do with the
company that's delivering a big

12648
03:36:30,070 --> 03:36:30,080
company that's delivering a big
 

12649
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:32,710
company that's delivering a big
overarching product and that's that's uh

12650
03:36:32,710 --> 03:36:32,720
overarching product and that's that's uh
 

12651
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:34,229
overarching product and that's that's uh
but the the challenges you know when you

12652
03:36:34,229 --> 03:36:34,239
but the the challenges you know when you
 

12653
03:36:34,239 --> 03:36:36,630
but the the challenges you know when you
have a the the the economics of the

12654
03:36:36,630 --> 03:36:36,640
have a the the the economics of the
 

12655
03:36:36,640 --> 03:36:39,190
have a the the the economics of the
world are such that you know when you're

12656
03:36:39,190 --> 03:36:39,200
world are such that you know when you're
 

12657
03:36:39,200 --> 03:36:40,790
world are such that you know when you're
delivering a product and people say well

12658
03:36:40,790 --> 03:36:40,800
delivering a product and people say well
 

12659
03:36:40,800 --> 03:36:42,630
delivering a product and people say well
that's useful we'll buy it

12660
03:36:42,630 --> 03:36:42,640
that's useful we'll buy it
 

12661
03:36:42,640 --> 03:36:44,150
that's useful we'll buy it
and then that kind of feeds back and

12662
03:36:44,150 --> 03:36:44,160
and then that kind of feeds back and
 

12663
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:46,550
and then that kind of feeds back and
okay then you can then you can pay the

12664
03:36:46,550 --> 03:36:46,560
okay then you can then you can pay the
 

12665
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:48,389
okay then you can then you can pay the
people who build it to eat you know so

12666
03:36:48,389 --> 03:36:48,399
people who build it to eat you know so
 

12667
03:36:48,399 --> 03:36:51,190
people who build it to eat you know so
they can eat and so on and with basic

12668
03:36:51,190 --> 03:36:51,200
they can eat and so on and with basic
 

12669
03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:53,830
they can eat and so on and with basic
science the the payoff

12670
03:36:53,830 --> 03:36:53,840
science the the payoff
 

12671
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:56,070
science the the payoff
is very much less visible and and you

12672
03:36:56,070 --> 03:36:56,080
is very much less visible and and you
 

12673
03:36:56,080 --> 03:36:57,429
is very much less visible and and you
know with this physics project as i say

12674
03:36:57,429 --> 03:36:57,439
know with this physics project as i say
 

12675
03:36:57,439 --> 03:36:59,750
know with this physics project as i say
the big surprise has been that i mean

12676
03:36:59,750 --> 03:36:59,760
the big surprise has been that i mean
 

12677
03:36:59,760 --> 03:37:00,710
the big surprise has been that i mean
you know

12678
03:37:00,710 --> 03:37:00,720
you know
 

12679
03:37:00,720 --> 03:37:02,309
you know
for example well the big surprise with

12680
03:37:02,309 --> 03:37:02,319
for example well the big surprise with
 

12681
03:37:02,319 --> 03:37:05,429
for example well the big surprise with
the physics project is that it's looks

12682
03:37:05,429 --> 03:37:05,439
the physics project is that it's looks
 

12683
03:37:05,439 --> 03:37:07,269
the physics project is that it's looks
like it has near-term applications and i

12684
03:37:07,269 --> 03:37:07,279
like it has near-term applications and i
 

12685
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:09,349
like it has near-term applications and i
was like i'm guessing this is 200 years

12686
03:37:09,349 --> 03:37:09,359
was like i'm guessing this is 200 years
 

12687
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:10,309
was like i'm guessing this is 200 years
away

12688
03:37:10,309 --> 03:37:10,319
away
 

12689
03:37:10,319 --> 03:37:12,469
away
it's um i was kind of using the analogy

12690
03:37:12,469 --> 03:37:12,479
it's um i was kind of using the analogy
 

12691
03:37:12,479 --> 03:37:14,389
it's um i was kind of using the analogy
of of you know newton

12692
03:37:14,389 --> 03:37:14,399
of of you know newton

12694
03:37:16,790 --> 03:37:16,800
uh starting a satellite launch company
 

12695
03:37:16,800 --> 03:37:18,950

which would have been kind of wrong time

12696
03:37:18,950 --> 03:37:18,960
which would have been kind of wrong time
 

12697
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:21,349
which would have been kind of wrong time
um and uh you know but but it turns out

12698
03:37:21,349 --> 03:37:21,359
um and uh you know but but it turns out
 

12699
03:37:21,359 --> 03:37:23,190
um and uh you know but but it turns out
that's not the case but but we can't

12700
03:37:23,190 --> 03:37:23,200
that's not the case but but we can't
 

12701
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:25,190
that's not the case but but we can't
guarantee that and if you say we're

03:37:25,190 --> 03:37:25,200
guarantee that and if you say we're
 

12703
