so
 

209
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,790
so
even though it seems totally

210
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
even though it seems totally
 

211
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,430
even though it seems totally
stupid and obvious to us now at the

212
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
stupid and obvious to us now at the
 

213
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,110
stupid and obvious to us now at the
moment then

214
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
moment then
 

215
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,630
moment then
posting a photo of what you were doing

216
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
posting a photo of what you were doing
 

217
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,990
posting a photo of what you were doing
at the moment was like not a thing

218
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
at the moment was like not a thing
 

219
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,789
at the moment was like not a thing
so

220
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
so
 

221
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,470
so
we decided to go after that because we

222
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
we decided to go after that because we
 

223
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,390
we decided to go after that because we
noticed that people who used our service

224
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
noticed that people who used our service
 

225
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,750
noticed that people who used our service
the one thing they happened to like the

226
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
the one thing they happened to like the
 

227
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,070
the one thing they happened to like the
most was posting a photo

most was posting a photo
 

229
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,670
most was posting a photo
so that was the beginning of instagram

230
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
so that was the beginning of instagram
 

231
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,589
so that was the beginning of instagram
and yes like we went through and we

232
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
and yes like we went through and we
 

233
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,030
and yes like we went through and we
added filters and there's a bunch of

234
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
added filters and there's a bunch of
 

235
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,190
added filters and there's a bunch of
stories around that but the origin of

236
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
stories around that but the origin of
 

237
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,789
stories around that but the origin of
this was that we were trying to be a

238
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
this was that we were trying to be a
 

239
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,630
this was that we were trying to be a
checking app realized that no one wanted

240
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
checking app realized that no one wanted
 

241
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,229
checking app realized that no one wanted
another checking app

242
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
another checking app
 

243
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,309
another checking app
it became a photo sharing app but one

244
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
it became a photo sharing app but one
 

245
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,830
it became a photo sharing app but one
that was much more about what you're

246
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
that was much more about what you're
 

247
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,350
that was much more about what you're
doing and where you are

248
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
doing and where you are
 

249
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,949
doing and where you are
and that's why when i say i think we've

250
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
and that's why when i say i think we've
 

251
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,869
and that's why when i say i think we've
replaced checkin apps

252
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
replaced checkin apps
 

253
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,910
replaced checkin apps
it became a check-in via a photo rather

254
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
it became a check-in via a photo rather
 

255
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,869
it became a check-in via a photo rather
than

256
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
than
 

257
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,509
than
saying your location and then optionally

258
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
saying your location and then optionally
 

259
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,270

00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
adding a photo when you were thinking
 

261
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,429
adding a photo when you were thinking
about what people like

262
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
about what people like
 

263
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,429
about what people like
from where did you get a sense that this

264
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
from where did you get a sense that this
 

265
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,750
from where did you get a sense that this
is what people like you you said we sat

266
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
is what people like you you said we sat
 

267
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,949
is what people like you you said we sat
down we wrote some stuff down on paper

268
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
down we wrote some stuff down on paper
 

269
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,189

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,629
and you would look at their data you
would say what are they sharing

332
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
would say what are they sharing
 

333
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,390
would say what are they sharing
what like what resonates what doesn't

334
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
what like what resonates what doesn't
 

335
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,590
what like what resonates what doesn't
resonate we think they're going to

336
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
resonate we think they're going to
 

337
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,510
resonate we think they're going to
resonate with x but turns out they

338
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
resonate with x but turns out they
 

339
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,950
resonate with x but turns out they
resonate with y

340
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
resonate with y
 

341
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,430
resonate with y
okay shift the company towards y

342
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
okay shift the company towards y
 

343
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,110
okay shift the company towards y
and it turns out if you do that enough

344
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
and it turns out if you do that enough
 

345
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,310
and it turns out if you do that enough
quickly enough you can get to a solution

346
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
quickly enough you can get to a solution
 

347
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,070
quickly enough you can get to a solution
that has product market fit most

348
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
that has product market fit most
 

349
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,510
that has product market fit most
companies fail

350
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
companies fail
 

351
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,430
companies fail
because they sit there and they don't

352
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
because they sit there and they don't

right
or

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
or
 

365
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,189

they their learning rate's too high and
 

367
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,110
they their learning rate's too high and
they wildly chase different ideas and

they wildly chase different ideas and
 

369
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,670
they wildly chase different ideas and
they never actually set on on one where

they never actually set on on one where

think when we sat down and we wrote out

374
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
think when we sat down and we wrote out
 

375
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,350
think when we sat down and we wrote out
those three ideas what we were saying is

376
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
those three ideas what we were saying is
 

377
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,590
those three ideas what we were saying is
what are the three possible

378
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
what are the three possible
 

379
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,150
what are the three possible
whether they're local or global maxima

380
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
whether they're local or global maxima
 

381
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,469
whether they're local or global maxima
in our world right

382
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
in our world right
 

383
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,710
in our world right
that users are telling us they like

384
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
that users are telling us they like
 

385
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,909
that users are telling us they like
because they're using the product that

386
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
because they're using the product that
 

387
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,790
because they're using the product that
way

388
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
way
 

389
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,309
way
it was clear people liked the photos

390
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
it was clear people liked the photos
 

391
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,350
it was clear people liked the photos
because that was the thing they were

392
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
because that was the thing they were
 

393
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,550
because that was the thing they were
doing

394
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
doing
 

395
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,629
doing
and we just said okay like what if we

396
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
and we just said okay like what if we
 

397
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,550
and we just said okay like what if we
just cut out most of the other stuff and

398
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
just cut out most of the other stuff and
 

399
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,390
just cut out most of the other stuff and
focus on that thing

400
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
focus on that thing
 

401
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,070
focus on that thing
um and then it happened to be a

402
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
um and then it happened to be a
 

403
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,710
um and then it happened to be a
multi-billion dollar business and

404
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
multi-billion dollar business and
 

405
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,270
multi-billion dollar business and
it's that easy by the way yeah i guess

406
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
it's that easy by the way yeah i guess
 

407
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,430
it's that easy by the way yeah i guess
so um well nobody ever writes about

408
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
so um well nobody ever writes about
 

409
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,870
so um well nobody ever writes about
neural networks that

410
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
neural networks that
 

411
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,110
neural networks that
miserably failed so this this particular

412
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
miserably failed so this this particular
 

413
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,790
miserably failed so this this particular
neural network succeeded this is the

414
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
neural network succeeded this is the
 

415
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,110
neural network succeeded this is the
sound all the time right yeah but nobody

416
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
sound all the time right yeah but nobody
 

417
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,749
sound all the time right yeah but nobody
right default state is failing yes

418
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
right default state is failing yes
 

419
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,150
right default state is failing yes
um when you said the way people are

420
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
um when you said the way people are
 

421
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,230
um when you said the way people are
using the app

422
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
using the app
 

423
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,150
using the app
is that the lost function for this

424
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
is that the lost function for this
 

425
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,790
is that the lost function for this
neural network or is it also self-report

426
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
neural network or is it also self-report
 

427
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,469
neural network or is it also self-report
like do you ever ask people what they

428
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
like do you ever ask people what they
 

429
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,710
like do you ever ask people what they
like or do you have to

430
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
like or do you have to
 

431
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,550
like or do you have to
track exactly what they're doing not

432
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
track exactly what they're doing not
 

433
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,830
track exactly what they're doing not
what they're saying

434
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
what they're saying
 

435
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,029

and i was really proud because i had
 

451
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,390
and i was really proud because i had
planned it out using a gantt chart and

452
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
planned it out using a gantt chart and
 

453
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,309

is when the turkey is cold and some
things are hot and something anyway you

464
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
things are hot and something anyway you
 

465
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,870
things are hot and something anyway you
got a gantt chart you actually have a

466
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
got a gantt chart you actually have a
 

467
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,510
got a gantt chart you actually have a
chart oh yeah yeah omni plan fairly

468
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
chart oh yeah yeah omni plan fairly
 

469
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,150
chart oh yeah yeah omni plan fairly
expensive like gantt chart thing that i

470
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
expensive like gantt chart thing that i
 

471
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,790
expensive like gantt chart thing that i
think maybe 10 people have purchased

472
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
think maybe 10 people have purchased
 

473
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,550
think maybe 10 people have purchased
in the world but i'm one of them and i

474
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
in the world but i'm one of them and i
 

475
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,629
in the world but i'm one of them and i
use it for recipe planning only around

476
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
use it for recipe planning only around
 

477
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,749
use it for recipe planning only around
big holidays that's brilliant by the way

478
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
big holidays that's brilliant by the way
 

479
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,990
big holidays that's brilliant by the way
do people do this kind of uh over

480
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
do people do this kind of uh over
 

481
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,070
do people do this kind of uh over
engineering it's not overdue it's just

is a complicated uh

486
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
is a complicated uh
 

487
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,749
is a complicated uh
set of events with some uncertainty with

you usually have two classes of people

604

you usually have two classes of people
 

605
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,790
you usually have two classes of people
people who just won't say bad things you

606
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800

what you hate most about this and they

610
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
what you hate most about this and they
 

611
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,430
what you hate most about this and they
won't do it they'll try but they won't

612
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
won't do it they'll try but they won't
 

613
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,870
won't do it they'll try but they won't
and then the other class of people are

614
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
and then the other class of people are
 

615
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,509
and then the other class of people are
just negative period about everything

616
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
just negative period about everything
 

617

like what is true and what isn't
 

621
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,870
like what is true and what isn't
so my rule of thumb with this

622
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
so my rule of thumb with this
 

623
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,910
so my rule of thumb with this
is you should always ask people

624
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
is you should always ask people
 

625
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,750
is you should always ask people

you have 50 beta users or something
but what's fascinating is that

654
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
but what's fascinating is that
 

655
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,630
but what's fascinating is that
data doesn't lie

656
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
data doesn't lie
 

657
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,870
data doesn't lie
people are very

they'll say oh i'm so busy i'm sorry i
didn't get to use the app like i'm just

664
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
didn't get to use the app like i'm just
 

665
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,269
didn't get to use the app like i'm just
you know um

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
you know before time spent became
 

679
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,790
you know before time spent became
kind of this loaded

680
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
kind of this loaded
 

681
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,550
kind of this loaded
term there

682
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
term there
 

683
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,230
term there
the idea that people

684
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
the idea that people
 

685
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,870
the idea that people
people's currency in their lives is time

686
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
people's currency in their lives is time
 

687
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,310
people's currency in their lives is time
and they only have a certain amount of

688
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
and they only have a certain amount of
 

689
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,150
and they only have a certain amount of
time to give things whether it's friends

690
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
time to give things whether it's friends
 

691
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,230
time to give things whether it's friends
or family or apps or tv shows or

692
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
or family or apps or tv shows or
 

693
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,350
or family or apps or tv shows or
whatever it's

694
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
whatever it's
 

695
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,870
whatever it's
there's no way of inventing more of it

696
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
there's no way of inventing more of it
 

697
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,550
there's no way of inventing more of it
at least not that i know of

698
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560

 

699
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,230

if they don't use it it's because it's

700
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
if they don't use it it's because it's
 

701
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,509
if they don't use it it's because it's
not great

702
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
not great
 

703
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,870
not great
so

704
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
so
 

705
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,949
so
the moral of the story is you can ask

706
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
the moral of the story is you can ask
 

707
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,389
the moral of the story is you can ask
all you want but you just have to look

708
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
all you want but you just have to look
 

709
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,670
all you want but you just have to look
at the data

710
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
at the data
 

711
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,670
at the data
and

712
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
and
 

713
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,750
and
data doesn't lie right i mean there's

714
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
data doesn't lie right i mean there's
 

715
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,190
data doesn't lie right i mean there's
metrics there's uh

716
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
metrics there's uh
 

717
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,550
metrics there's uh
data can obscure the key insight if

718
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
data can obscure the key insight if
 

719
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,430
data can obscure the key insight if
you're not careful so

720
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
you're not careful so
 

721
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,750
you're not careful so
so time spent in the app that's ones

722
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
so time spent in the app that's ones
 

723
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,350
so time spent in the app that's ones
there's so many metrics you can put at

724
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
there's so many metrics you can put at
 

725
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,870
there's so many metrics you can put at
this and they will give you totally

726
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
this and they will give you totally
 

727
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,389
this and they will give you totally
different insights

728
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
different insights
 

729
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,829
different insights
especially when you're trying to create

730
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
especially when you're trying to create
 

731
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,389
especially when you're trying to create
something that doesn't obviously exist

732
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
something that doesn't obviously exist
 

733
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,590
something that doesn't obviously exist
yet

734
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
yet
 

735
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,670
yet
so

736
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
so
 

737
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,710
so
you know

738
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
you know
 

739
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,790
you know
measuring maybe

740
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
measuring maybe
 

741
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,269
measuring maybe
why you left the app or measuring

742
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
why you left the app or measuring
 

743
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,870
why you left the app or measuring
special moments

744
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
special moments
 

745
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,550
special moments
of happiness that will make sure you

746
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
of happiness that will make sure you
 

747
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,710
of happiness that will make sure you
return to the app or moments of

748
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
return to the app or moments of
 

749
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,629
return to the app or moments of
happiness that are long lasting versus

750
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
happiness that are long lasting versus
 

751
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,949
happiness that are long lasting versus
like dopamine short term

752
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
like dopamine short term
 

753
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,190
like dopamine short term
all of those things but i think i

754
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
all of those things but i think i
 

755
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,750
all of those things but i think i
suppose in the beginning

756
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
suppose in the beginning
 

757
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,509
suppose in the beginning
you can just get away with just asking

758
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
you can just get away with just asking
 

759
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,110
you can just get away with just asking
the question

760
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
the question
 

761
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,750
the question
which features are used a lot let's do

762
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
which features are used a lot let's do
 

763
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,190
which features are used a lot let's do
more of that

764
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
more of that
 

765
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,629
more of that
and how hard was the decision

766
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
and how hard was the decision
 

767
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,629
and how hard was the decision
and uh i mean maybe you can tell me what

768
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
and uh i mean maybe you can tell me what
 

769
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,470
and uh i mean maybe you can tell me what
instagram looked in the beginning but

770
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
instagram looked in the beginning but
 

771
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,470
instagram looked in the beginning but
how hard was it to make

772
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
how hard was it to make

a revolutionary idea
 

777
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,030
a revolutionary idea
like um at whatever point instagram

that's quite brilliant
plus

788
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
plus

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,629
plus
i also don't know when this happened but

790
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
i also don't know when this happened but
 

791
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,509
i also don't know when this happened but
they're all shaped the same

792
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
they're all shaped the same
 

793
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,590
they're all shaped the same
it's like uh i have to tell you why

794
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
it's like uh i have to tell you why
 

795
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,389
it's like uh i have to tell you why
that's the interesting part

796
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
that's the interesting part
 

797
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,790
that's the interesting part
why is that so a couple of things one is

798
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800

 

799
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,190

data data like you're right you can over

800
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
data data like you're right you can over
 

801
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,190
data data like you're right you can over
interpret data like imagine trying to

802
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
interpret data like imagine trying to
 

803
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,629
interpret data like imagine trying to
fly a plane

804
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
fly a plane
 

805
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,629
fly a plane
by staring at

806
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
by staring at
 

807
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,389
by staring at
i don't know a single metric like

808
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
i don't know a single metric like
 

809
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,509
i don't know a single metric like
airspeed

810
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
airspeed
 

811
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,629
airspeed
you don't know if you're going up or

812
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
you don't know if you're going up or
 

813
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,230
you don't know if you're going up or
down i mean it correlates with up or

814
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
down i mean it correlates with up or
 

815
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,069
down i mean it correlates with up or
down but you don't actually know it will

816
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
down but you don't actually know it will
 

817
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,069
down but you don't actually know it will
never help you land the plane

818
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
never help you land the plane
 

819
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,230
never help you land the plane
so don't stare at one metric like it

820
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
so don't stare at one metric like it
 

821
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,150
so don't stare at one metric like it
turns out you have to synthesize a bunch

822
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
turns out you have to synthesize a bunch
 

823
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,389
turns out you have to synthesize a bunch
of metrics to know where to go

824
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
of metrics to know where to go
 

825
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,550
of metrics to know where to go
um but it doesn't lie like if your air

826
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
um but it doesn't lie like if your air
 

827
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,629
um but it doesn't lie like if your air
speed is zero unless it's not working

828
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
speed is zero unless it's not working
 

829
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,710
speed is zero unless it's not working
right if if it's zero

830
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
right if if it's zero
 

831
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,829
right if if it's zero
you're probably going to fall out of the

832
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
you're probably going to fall out of the
 

833
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,430
you're probably going to fall out of the
sky so

834
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
sky so
 

835
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,949
sky so
generally you look around and you have

836
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
generally you look around and you have
 

837
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,509
generally you look around and you have
the scan going yes

838
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
the scan going yes
 

839
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,189
the scan going yes
and you're just asking yourself is this

840
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
and you're just asking yourself is this
 

841
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,189
and you're just asking yourself is this
working or is this not working

842
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
working or is this not working
 

843
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,150
working or is this not working
um

844
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
um
 

845
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,790
um
but people have trouble explaining

846
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
but people have trouble explaining
 

847
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,629
but people have trouble explaining
how they actually feel

848
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
how they actually feel
 

849
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,790
how they actually feel
so just it's about synthesizing both of

850
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
so just it's about synthesizing both of
 

851
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,910
so just it's about synthesizing both of
them so then instagram right uh we were

852
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
them so then instagram right uh we were
 

853
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,710
them so then instagram right uh we were
talking about revolutionary moment where

854
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
talking about revolutionary moment where
 

855
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,470
talking about revolutionary moment where
where the feed became

856
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
where the feed became
 

857
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,430
where the feed became
square photos basically and photos first

858
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
square photos basically and photos first
 

859
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,870
square photos basically and photos first
and then square footage yeah um

860
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
and then square footage yeah um
 

861
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,670
and then square footage yeah um
it was clear to me that the biggest so

862
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680

 

863
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,509

i believe the biggest companies are

864
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
i believe the biggest companies are
 

865
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,790
i believe the biggest companies are
founded

866
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
founded
 

867
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,829
founded
when

868
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
when
 

869
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,870
when
enormous technical shifts happen and the

870
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
enormous technical shifts happen and the
 

871
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,710
enormous technical shifts happen and the
biggest technical shift that happened

872
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
biggest technical shift that happened
 

873
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,030
biggest technical shift that happened
right before instagram was founded was

874
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
right before instagram was founded was
 

875
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,829
right before instagram was founded was
the advent of a phone that didn't suck

876
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
the advent of a phone that didn't suck
 

877
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,750
the advent of a phone that didn't suck
the iphone right like in retrospect

878
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
the iphone right like in retrospect
 

879
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,430
the iphone right like in retrospect
we're like oh my god the first iphone

880
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
we're like oh my god the first iphone
 

881
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,949
we're like oh my god the first iphone
that almost had

882
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
that almost had
 

883
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,389
that almost had
like it wasn't that good

884
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
like it wasn't that good
 

885
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,389
like it wasn't that good
but compared to everything else at the

886
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
but compared to everything else at the
 

887
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,509
but compared to everything else at the
time it was

888
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
time it was
 

889
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,790
time it was
amazing

890
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
amazing
 

891
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,350
amazing
and by the way the first

892
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
and by the way the first
 

893
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,629
and by the way the first
phone that had an incredible camera

894
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
phone that had an incredible camera
 

895
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,870
phone that had an incredible camera
that could that could like do as well as

896
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
that could that could like do as well as
 

897
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,150
that could that could like do as well as
the point and shoot you might carry

898
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
the point and shoot you might carry
 

899
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,670
the point and shoot you might carry
around

900
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
around
 

901
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,990
around
was the iphone 4 and that was right when

902
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
was the iphone 4 and that was right when
 

903
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,910
was the iphone 4 and that was right when
instagram launched and we looked around

904
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
instagram launched and we looked around
 

905
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,150
instagram launched and we looked around
and we said what will change because

906
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
and we said what will change because
 

907
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,389
and we said what will change because
everyone has a camera in their pocket

908
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
everyone has a camera in their pocket
 

909
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,269
everyone has a camera in their pocket
and it was so clear to me that the the

910
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
and it was so clear to me that the the
 

911
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,389
and it was so clear to me that the the
world of

912
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
world of
 

913
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,790
world of
social networks before

914
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
social networks before
 

915
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,189
social networks before
it was based in the desktop and sitting

916
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
it was based in the desktop and sitting
 

917
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,350
it was based in the desktop and sitting
there and having a link you could share

918
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
there and having a link you could share
 

919
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,550
there and having a link you could share
right

920
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
right
 

921
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,750
right
and that wasn't going to be the case so

922
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
and that wasn't going to be the case so
 

923
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,430
and that wasn't going to be the case so
the question is what would you share if

924
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
the question is what would you share if
 

925
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,790
the question is what would you share if
you were out and about in the world

926
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
you were out and about in the world
 

927
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,870
you were out and about in the world
if not only did you have a camera that's

928
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
if not only did you have a camera that's
 

929
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,069
if not only did you have a camera that's
in your pocket but by the way that

930
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
in your pocket but by the way that
 

931
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,990
in your pocket but by the way that
camera had a network attached to it that

932
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
camera had a network attached to it that
 

933
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,629
camera had a network attached to it that
allowed you to share instantly

934
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
allowed you to share instantly
 

935
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,470
allowed you to share instantly
that seemed revolutionary and a bunch of

936
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
that seemed revolutionary and a bunch of
 

937
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,990
that seemed revolutionary and a bunch of
people saw it at the same time it wasn't

938
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
people saw it at the same time it wasn't
 

939
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,269
people saw it at the same time it wasn't
just instagram there were a bunch of

940
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
just instagram there were a bunch of
 

941
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,189
just instagram there were a bunch of
competitors

942
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
competitors
 

943
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,870
competitors
the thing we did

944
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
the thing we did
 

945
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,790
the thing we did
i think was not only well we focused on

946
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
i think was not only well we focused on
 

947
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,710
i think was not only well we focused on
two things so we wrote down those things

948
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
two things so we wrote down those things
 

949
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,389
two things so we wrote down those things
we circled photos and we said i think we

950
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
we circled photos and we said i think we
 

951
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,829
we circled photos and we said i think we
should invest in this

952
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
should invest in this
 

953
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,710
should invest in this
but then we said what sucks about photos

954
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
but then we said what sucks about photos
 

955
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,069
but then we said what sucks about photos

one they look like crap right they just
at least back then now

958
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
at least back then now
 

959
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,710
at least back then now

great compressed right
 

965
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,870
great compressed right
two

different networks you had to go to each
 

983
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,230
different networks you had to go to each
of the individual apps and select all of

984
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
of the individual apps and select all of
 

985
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,629
of the individual apps and select all of
them and upload individually and

986
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
them and upload individually and
 

987
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,910
them and upload individually and
so we're like all right those are the

988
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
so we're like all right those are the
 

989
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,990
so we're like all right those are the
pain points we're gonna focus on that so

990
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
pain points we're gonna focus on that so
 

991
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,590
pain points we're gonna focus on that so
one instead of

992
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
one instead of
 

993
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,910
one instead of
because they weren't beautiful um we

994
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
because they weren't beautiful um we
 

995
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,189
because they weren't beautiful um we
were like why don't we lean into the

996
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
were like why don't we lean into the
 

997
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,470
were like why don't we lean into the
fact that they're not beautiful and i

998
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
fact that they're not beautiful and i
 

999
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,629
fact that they're not beautiful and i
remember studying in florence my

1000
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
remember studying in florence my
 

1001
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,310
remember studying in florence my
photography teacher gave me this whole

1002
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
photography teacher gave me this whole
 

1003
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,590
photography teacher gave me this whole
gay camera and i'm not sure everyone

1004
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
gay camera and i'm not sure everyone
 

1005
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,949
gay camera and i'm not sure everyone
knows what a whole gay camera is but

1006
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
knows what a whole gay camera is but
 

1007
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,230
knows what a whole gay camera is but
they're these old-school plastic cameras

1008
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
they're these old-school plastic cameras
 

1009
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,990
they're these old-school plastic cameras
i think they're produced in china at the

1010
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
i think they're produced in china at the
 

1011
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,910
i think they're produced in china at the
time

1012
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
time
 

1013
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,430
time
and they're i want to say the original

1014
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
and they're i want to say the original
 

1015
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,590
and they're i want to say the original
ones like from the 70s or the 80s or

1016
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
ones like from the 70s or the 80s or
 

1017
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,629
ones like from the 70s or the 80s or
something they're supposed to be like

1018
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
something they're supposed to be like
 

1019
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,069
something they're supposed to be like
three dollar cameras for the every

1020
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
three dollar cameras for the every
 

1021
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,829
three dollar cameras for the every
person

1022
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
person
 

1023
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,030
person
they took nice medium format films large

1024
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
they took nice medium format films large
 

1025
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,910
they took nice medium format films large
large

1026
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
large
 

1027
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,029
large
negatives

1028
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
negatives
 

1029
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,350
negatives
but they kind of blurred the the the

1030
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
but they kind of blurred the the the
 

1031
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,189
but they kind of blurred the the the
light and they kind of like light leaked

1032
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
light and they kind of like light leaked
 

1033
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,590
light and they kind of like light leaked
into the side and there was this whole

1034
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
into the side and there was this whole
 

1035
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,350
into the side and there was this whole
resurgence where people looked at that

1036
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
resurgence where people looked at that
 

1037
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,789
resurgence where people looked at that
and said oh my god this is a style right

1038
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
and said oh my god this is a style right
 

1039
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,390
and said oh my god this is a style right
and i remember using that in florence

1040
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
and i remember using that in florence
 

1041
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,750
and i remember using that in florence
and just saying well why don't we just

1042
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
and just saying well why don't we just
 

1043
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,029
and just saying well why don't we just
like lean into the fact that these

1044
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
like lean into the fact that these
 

1045
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,150
like lean into the fact that these
photos suck and make them suck more

1046
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
photos suck and make them suck more
 

1047
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,069
photos suck and make them suck more
but in an artistic way

1048
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
but in an artistic way
 

1049
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,750
but in an artistic way
and it turns out that had product market

1050
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
and it turns out that had product market
 

1051
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,350
and it turns out that had product market
fit people really liked that they were

1052
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
fit people really liked that they were
 

1053
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,190
fit people really liked that they were
willing to share their not so great

1054
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
willing to share their not so great
 

1055
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,390
willing to share their not so great
photos if they

1056
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
photos if they
 

1057
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,270
photos if they
looked

1058
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
looked
 

1059
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,510
looked
not so great on purpose okay

1060
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
not so great on purpose okay
 

1061
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,270
not so great on purpose okay
it's the second part

1062
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
it's the second part
 

1063
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,110
it's the second part
that's the where the filters come into

1064
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
that's the where the filters come into
 

1065
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,110
that's the where the filters come into
the picture yeah so computational

1066
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
the picture yeah so computational
 

1067
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,750
the picture yeah so computational
modification of photos to make them look

1068
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
modification of photos to make them look
 

1069
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,070
modification of photos to make them look
extra crappy to where it becomes art

1070
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
extra crappy to where it becomes art
 

1071
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,750
extra crappy to where it becomes art
yeah yeah and

1072
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
yeah yeah and
 

1073
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,630
yeah yeah and
i mean

1074
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
i mean
 

1075
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,190
i mean
add light leaks add like an overlay

1076
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
add light leaks add like an overlay
 

1077
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,870
add light leaks add like an overlay
filter make them more contrasty than

1078
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
filter make them more contrasty than
 

1079
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,430
filter make them more contrasty than
they should be uh the first

1080
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
they should be uh the first
 

1081
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,430
they should be uh the first
filter we ever produced was called x-pro

1082
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
filter we ever produced was called x-pro
 

1083
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,230
filter we ever produced was called x-pro
2. and i designed it while i was in this

1084
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
2. and i designed it while i was in this
 

1085
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,230
2. and i designed it while i was in this
small little bed and breakfast room in

1086
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
small little bed and breakfast room in
 

1087
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,150
small little bed and breakfast room in
total santos mexico i was trying to take

1088
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
total santos mexico i was trying to take
 

1089
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,909
total santos mexico i was trying to take
a break from the

1090
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
a break from the
 

1091
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,990
a break from the
the bourbon days and i i remember saying

1092
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
the bourbon days and i i remember saying
 

1093
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,669
the bourbon days and i i remember saying
to my co-founder i just need like a week

1094
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
to my co-founder i just need like a week
 

1095
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,950
to my co-founder i just need like a week
to reset

1096
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
to reset
 

1097
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,470
to reset
and that was

1098
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
and that was
 

1099
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,950
and that was
on that trip worked on the first filter

1100
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
on that trip worked on the first filter
 

1101
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,549
on that trip worked on the first filter
because i said you know i think i can do

1102
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
because i said you know i think i can do
 

1103
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,510
because i said you know i think i can do
this and i literally iterated

1104
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
this and i literally iterated
 

1105
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,150
this and i literally iterated
one by one over the rgb values in the

1106
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
one by one over the rgb values in the
 

1107
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,150
one by one over the rgb values in the
array that was the photo

1108
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
array that was the photo
 

1109
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,630
array that was the photo
and just slightly shifted basically

1110
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
and just slightly shifted basically
 

1111
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,950
and just slightly shifted basically
there was a function of our function of

1112
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
there was a function of our function of
 

1113
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,710
there was a function of our function of
g function of b

1114
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
g function of b
 

1115
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,310
g function of b
that just shifted them slightly it

1116
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
that just shifted them slightly it
 

1117
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,870
that just shifted them slightly it
wasn't rocket science um and it turns

1118
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
wasn't rocket science um and it turns
 

1119
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,270
wasn't rocket science um and it turns
out that actually made your photo look

1120
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
out that actually made your photo look
 

1121
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,390
out that actually made your photo look
pretty cool

1122
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
pretty cool
 

1123
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,870
pretty cool
it just mapped from one color space to

1124
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
it just mapped from one color space to
 

1125
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,630
it just mapped from one color space to
another color space

1126
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
another color space
 

1127
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,390
another color space
it was simple but it was really slow i

1128
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
it was simple but it was really slow i
 

1129
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,110
it was simple but it was really slow i
mean if you applied a filter

1130
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
mean if you applied a filter
 

1131
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,710
mean if you applied a filter
i think it used to take two or three

1132
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
i think it used to take two or three
 

1133
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,390
i think it used to take two or three
seconds to render

1134
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
seconds to render
 

1135
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,830
seconds to render
only eventually would i figure out how

1136
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
only eventually would i figure out how
 

1137
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,230
only eventually would i figure out how
to do it on the gpu and i'm not even

1138
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
to do it on the gpu and i'm not even
 

1139
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,470
to do it on the gpu and i'm not even
sure it was gpu but was using opengl but

1140
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
sure it was gpu but was using opengl but
 

1141
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,190
sure it was gpu but was using opengl but
anyway um i would eventually figure that

1142
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
anyway um i would eventually figure that
 

1143
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,510
anyway um i would eventually figure that
out and then it would be instant but it

1144
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
out and then it would be instant but it
 

1145
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,350
out and then it would be instant but it
used to be really slow by the way anyone

1146
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
used to be really slow by the way anyone
 

1147
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,909
used to be really slow by the way anyone
who's watching or listening

1148
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
who's watching or listening
 

1149
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,549
who's watching or listening
it's amazing what you can get away with

1150
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
it's amazing what you can get away with
 

1151
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,230
it's amazing what you can get away with
in a startup as long as the product

1152
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
in a startup as long as the product
 

1153
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,310
in a startup as long as the product
outcome is right for the user like you

1154
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
outcome is right for the user like you
 

1155
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,630
outcome is right for the user like you
can be slow you can be terrible you can

1156
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
can be slow you can be terrible you can
 

1157
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,909
can be slow you can be terrible you can
be

1158
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
be
 

1159
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,950
be
as long as you have product market fit

1160
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
as long as you have product market fit
 

1161
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,549
as long as you have product market fit
people will put up with a lot and then

1162
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
people will put up with a lot and then
 

1163
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,830
people will put up with a lot and then
the question is just about compressing

1164
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
the question is just about compressing
 

1165
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,669
the question is just about compressing
making it more performant over time so

1166
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
making it more performant over time so
 

1167
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,270
making it more performant over time so
that they get that product market fit

1168
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
that they get that product market fit
 

1169
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,390
that they get that product market fit
instantly

1170
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
instantly
 

1171
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,230
instantly
so fascinating because there's some

1172
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
so fascinating because there's some
 

1173
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,590
so fascinating because there's some
things where

1174
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
things where
 

1175
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,590
things where
those three seconds would

1176
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
those three seconds would
 

1177
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,350
those three seconds would
make or break the app

1178
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
make or break the app
 

1179
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,590
make or break the app
but some things you're saying not it's

1180
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
but some things you're saying not it's
 

1181
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,510
but some things you're saying not it's
hard to know when you know it's what

1182
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
hard to know when you know it's what
 

1183
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,390
hard to know when you know it's what
it's the problem spotify solved

1184
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
it's the problem spotify solved
 

1185
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,789
it's the problem spotify solved
making streaming like

1186
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
making streaming like
 

1187
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,390
making streaming like
work

1188
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
work
 

1189
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,190
work
and

1190
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
and
 

1191
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,590
and
like delays in listening to music is a

1192
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
like delays in listening to music is a
 

1193
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,950
like delays in listening to music is a
huge negative

1194
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
huge negative
 

1195
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,510
huge negative
even like slight delays

1196
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
even like slight delays
 

1197
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,669
even like slight delays
but here you're saying i mean how do you

1198
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
but here you're saying i mean how do you
 

1199
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,950
but here you're saying i mean how do you
know

1200
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
know
 

1201
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,549
know
when those three seconds are okay are

1202
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
when those three seconds are okay are
 

1203
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,870
when those three seconds are okay are
you just gonna have to

1204
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
you just gonna have to
 

1205
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,990
you just gonna have to
try it out because to me my intuition

1206
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
try it out because to me my intuition
 

1207
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,190
try it out because to me my intuition
would be

1208
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
would be
 

1209
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,750
would be
those three seconds would kill the app

1210
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
those three seconds would kill the app
 

1211
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,149
those three seconds would kill the app
like i would try to do the opengl thing

1212
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
like i would try to do the opengl thing
 

1213
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,190
like i would try to do the opengl thing
right

1214
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
right
 

1215
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,549
right
so i wish i were that smart at the time

1216
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
so i wish i were that smart at the time
 

1217
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,510
so i wish i were that smart at the time
um

1218
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
um
 

1219
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,750
um
i wasn't i just knew how to do what i

1220
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
i wasn't i just knew how to do what i
 

1221
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,590
i wasn't i just knew how to do what i
knew how to do right

1222
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
knew how to do right
 

1223
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,350
knew how to do right
and i decided okay like why don't i just

1224
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
and i decided okay like why don't i just
 

1225
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,110
and i decided okay like why don't i just
iterate over the values and change them

1226
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
iterate over the values and change them
 

1227
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,950
iterate over the values and change them
and what's interesting

1228
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
and what's interesting
 

1229
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,669
and what's interesting
is that um

1230
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
is that um
 

1231
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,510
is that um
compared to the alternatives no one else

1232
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
compared to the alternatives no one else
 

1233
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,870
compared to the alternatives no one else
used opengl

1234
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
used opengl
 

1235
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,390
used opengl
right so everyone else was doing that

1236
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
right so everyone else was doing that
 

1237
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,549
right so everyone else was doing that
the dumb way and in fact they were doing

1238
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
the dumb way and in fact they were doing
 

1239
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,510
the dumb way and in fact they were doing
it at a high resolution now comes in the

1240
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
it at a high resolution now comes in the
 

1241
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,950
it at a high resolution now comes in the
small resolution that we'll talk about

1242
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:42,960
small resolution that we'll talk about
 

1243
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,149
small resolution that we'll talk about
for a second

1244
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
for a second
 

1245
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,950
for a second
um

1246
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
um
 

1247
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,470
um
by choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels

1248
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
by choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels
 

1249
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,789
by choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels
which i believe it was at the time

1250
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
which i believe it was at the time
 

1251
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,270
which i believe it was at the time
we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than

1252
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than
 

1253
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,950
we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than
our competitors who were trying to do

1254
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
our competitors who were trying to do
 

1255
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,990
our competitors who were trying to do
these enormous output like images yeah

1256
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
these enormous output like images yeah
 

1257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,029
these enormous output like images yeah
so instead of taking 20 seconds i mean

1258
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
so instead of taking 20 seconds i mean
 

1259
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,110
so instead of taking 20 seconds i mean
three seconds feels pretty good right

1260
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
three seconds feels pretty good right
 

1261
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,870
three seconds feels pretty good right
so on a relative basis we were winning

1262
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
so on a relative basis we were winning
 

1263
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,230
so on a relative basis we were winning
like a lot

1264
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
like a lot
 

1265
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,710
like a lot
okay so that's answer number one answer

1266
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
okay so that's answer number one answer
 

1267
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,630
okay so that's answer number one answer
number two is uh

1268
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
number two is uh
 

1269
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,310
number two is uh
we actually focused on latency in the

1270
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
we actually focused on latency in the
 

1271
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,909
we actually focused on latency in the
right places so we did this really

1272
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
right places so we did this really
 

1273
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,470
right places so we did this really
wonderful thing um

1274
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
wonderful thing um
 

1275
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,789
wonderful thing um
when you uploaded so uh the way it would

1276
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
when you uploaded so uh the way it would
 

1277
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,710
when you uploaded so uh the way it would
work is you know you'd take your phone

1278
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
work is you know you'd take your phone
 

1279

you'd take the photo and then you'd go
 

1281
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,870
you'd take the photo and then you'd go
to the um

1282
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
to the um
 

1283
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,789
to the um
you'd go the edit screen where you would

1284
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
you'd go the edit screen where you would
 

1285
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,630
you'd go the edit screen where you would
caption it

1286
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
caption it
 

1287
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,710
caption it
and on that caption screen you start

1288
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
and on that caption screen you start
 

1289
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,310
and on that caption screen you start
typing you think okay like what's a

1290

sending it down to the desktop that
 

1315
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,549
sending it down to the desktop that
would be a security uh uh

1316
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
would be a security uh uh
 

1317
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,870
would be a security uh uh

i always thought that was so fascinating

1322
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
i always thought that was so fascinating
 

1323
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,909
i always thought that was so fascinating
and unintuitive i was like mike why

1324
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
and unintuitive i was like mike why
 

1325
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,350
and unintuitive i was like mike why
don't we just do that but like we'll

1326
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
don't we just do that but like we'll
 

1327
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,310
don't we just do that but like we'll
just upload the photo and like assume

1328
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
just upload the photo and like assume
 

1329
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,310
just upload the photo and like assume
you're gonna upload the photo and if you

1330
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
you're gonna upload the photo and if you
 

1331
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,190
you're gonna upload the photo and if you
don't

1332
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
don't
 

1333
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,510
don't
forget about it we'll delete it right

1334
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
forget about it we'll delete it right
 

1335
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,190
forget about it we'll delete it right
so what ended up happening

1336
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
so what ended up happening
 

1337
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,990
so what ended up happening
was people would caption their uh photo

1338
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
was people would caption their uh photo
 

1339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,470
was people would caption their uh photo
they'd press done or upload

1340
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
they'd press done or upload
 

1341
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,310
they'd press done or upload
and you'd see this little progress bar

1342
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
and you'd see this little progress bar
 

1343
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,830
and you'd see this little progress bar
just go

1344
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
just go
 

1345
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,149
just go
it was lightning fast okay

1346
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
it was lightning fast okay
 

1347
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,470
it was lightning fast okay
we were no faster than anyone else at

1348
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
we were no faster than anyone else at
 

1349
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,909
we were no faster than anyone else at
the time but by choosing 512 by 512 and

1350
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
the time but by choosing 512 by 512 and
 

1351
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,909
the time but by choosing 512 by 512 and
doing in the background it almost

1352
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
doing in the background it almost
 

1353
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,990
doing in the background it almost
guaranteed that it was done by the time

1354
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
guaranteed that it was done by the time
 

1355
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,190
guaranteed that it was done by the time
you captioned

1356
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
you captioned
 

1357
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,990
you captioned
and everyone when they used it was like

1358
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
and everyone when they used it was like
 

1359
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,789
and everyone when they used it was like
how the hell is this thing so fast

1360
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
how the hell is this thing so fast
 

1361
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,710
how the hell is this thing so fast
but we were slow we just hid the the

1362
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
but we were slow we just hid the the
 

1363
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,470
but we were slow we just hid the the
slowness it wasn't like

1364
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
slowness it wasn't like
 

1365
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,909
slowness it wasn't like
these things are just like it's a shelly

1366
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
these things are just like it's a shelly
 

1367
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,190
these things are just like it's a shelly
game you're just hiding the latency

1368
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
game you're just hiding the latency
 

1369
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,230
game you're just hiding the latency
that

1370
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
that
 

1371
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,870
that
that mattered to people like a lot and i

1372
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
that mattered to people like a lot and i
 

1373
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,950
that mattered to people like a lot and i
think that so you were willing to put up

1374
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
think that so you were willing to put up
 

1375
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,669
think that so you were willing to put up
with a slow filter if it meant you could

1376
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
with a slow filter if it meant you could
 

1377
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,190
with a slow filter if it meant you could
share it immediately and of course we

1378
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
share it immediately and of course we
 

1379
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,029
share it immediately and of course we
added sharing options which let you

1380
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039
added sharing options which let you
 

1381
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,390
added sharing options which let you
distribute it really quickly that was

1382
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
distribute it really quickly that was
 

1383
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,070
distribute it really quickly that was
the third part

1384
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
the third part
 

1385
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,270
the third part
um

1386
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
um
 

1387
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,470
um
so latency matters but relative to what

1388
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
so latency matters but relative to what
 

1389
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,149
so latency matters but relative to what
and then

1390
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
and then
 

1391
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,070
and then
there's some like tricks you can get

1392
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
there's some like tricks you can get
 

1393
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,390
there's some like tricks you can get
around to just hiding the latency um

1394
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
around to just hiding the latency um
 

1395
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,470
around to just hiding the latency um
like i don't know if spotify starts

1396
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
like i don't know if spotify starts
 

1397
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,230
like i don't know if spotify starts
downloading the next song eagerly i'm

1398
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
downloading the next song eagerly i'm
 

1399
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,590
downloading the next song eagerly i'm
assuming they do

1400
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
assuming they do
 

1401
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,990
assuming they do
there are a bunch of ideas here that are

1402
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
there are a bunch of ideas here that are
 

1403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,149
there are a bunch of ideas here that are
not rocket science that

1404
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
not rocket science that
 

1405
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,669
not rocket science that
that really help

1406
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
that really help
 

1407
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,669
that really help
and all of that was

1408
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
and all of that was
 

1409
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,270
and all of that was
stuff you were explicitly having a

1410
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
stuff you were explicitly having a
 

1411
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,870
stuff you were explicitly having a
discussion about like

1412
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
discussion about like
 

1413
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,549
discussion about like
those designs and argument you were

1414
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
those designs and argument you were
 

1415
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,110
those designs and argument you were
having like arguments discussions

1416
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
having like arguments discussions
 

1417
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,350
having like arguments discussions
uh i'm sure it was arguments i mean

1418
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
uh i'm sure it was arguments i mean
 

1419
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,110
uh i'm sure it was arguments i mean
i'm not sure if you've met my co-founder

1420
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
i'm not sure if you've met my co-founder
 

1421
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,590
i'm not sure if you've met my co-founder
mike but he's a pretty nice guy and he's

we're like yeah just like
 

1429
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,390
we're like yeah just like
make this fast early seem fast

1430
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,400
make this fast early seem fast
 

1431
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,149
make this fast early seem fast
it'll be great i mean honestly i think

1432
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
it'll be great i mean honestly i think
 

1433
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,669
it'll be great i mean honestly i think
the most contentious thing and he would

1434
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
the most contentious thing and he would
 

1435
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,710
the most contentious thing and he would
say this too initially

1436
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
say this too initially
 

1437
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,549

was um i was on an iphone 3g so like the

1438

was um i was on an iphone 3g so like the
 

1439
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,029
was um i was on an iphone 3g so like the

1444
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
and his feed loaded super smoothly like
 

1445
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,630
and his feed loaded super smoothly like
when he would scroll from photo to photo

1446
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
when he would scroll from photo to photo
 

1447
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,190
when he would scroll from photo to photo
buttery smooth right but on my phone

every time you got to a new photo it was

1450
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
every time you got to a new photo it was
 

1451
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,830
every time you got to a new photo it was
like

1452
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
like
 

1453
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,830
like
a chunk allocate memory like all this

1454
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
a chunk allocate memory like all this
 

1455
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,190

stuff right
i was like mike that's unacceptable he's

1458
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
i was like mike that's unacceptable he's
 

1459

your phone basically you didn't actually

1462
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
your phone basically you didn't actually
 

1463
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,590
your phone basically you didn't actually
say that it's nicer than that um

1464
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
say that it's nicer than that um
 

1465
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,950
say that it's nicer than that um
but i could tell he wished like i would

1466
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
but i could tell he wished like i would
 

1467
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,549
but i could tell he wished like i would
just stop being cheap and just get a new

1468
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
just stop being cheap and just get a new
 

1469
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,430
just stop being cheap and just get a new
phone

1470
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
phone
 

1471
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,870
phone
but what's funny is we actually sat

1472
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
but what's funny is we actually sat
 

1473
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,350
but what's funny is we actually sat
there working on that little detail for

1474
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
there working on that little detail for
 

1475
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,870
there working on that little detail for
a few days before launch and

1476
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
a few days before launch and
 

1477
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,190
a few days before launch and
that polished experience plus the fact

1478
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
that polished experience plus the fact
 

1479
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,669
that polished experience plus the fact
that uploading seemed fast for all these

1480
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
that uploading seemed fast for all these
 

1481
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,230
that uploading seemed fast for all these
people who didn't have nice phones

1482
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
people who didn't have nice phones
 

1483
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,750
people who didn't have nice phones
i think meant a lot

1484
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
i think meant a lot
 

1485
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,950
i think meant a lot
because

1486
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
because
 

1487
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,430
because
far too often you see teams focus not on

1488
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
far too often you see teams focus not on
 

1489
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,390
far too often you see teams focus not on
performance

1490
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
performance
 

1491
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,990
performance
they focus on

1492
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
they focus on
 

1493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,830
they focus on
what's the cool computer science problem

1494
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
what's the cool computer science problem
 

1495
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,029
what's the cool computer science problem
they can solve

1496
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
they can solve
 

1497
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,269
they can solve
right can we scale this thing to a

1498
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
right can we scale this thing to a
 

1499
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,430
right can we scale this thing to a
billion users and they've got like 100

1500
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
billion users and they've got like 100
 

1501
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,870
billion users and they've got like 100
right

1502
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
right
 

1503
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,630
right
yeah

1504
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
yeah
 

1505
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,230
yeah
you talked about loss function so i want

1506
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
you talked about loss function so i want
 

1507
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,590
you talked about loss function so i want
to come back to that

1508
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
to come back to that
 

1509
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,990
to come back to that
but like the loss function is like do

1510
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
but like the loss function is like do
 

1511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,549
but like the loss function is like do
you provide a great happy magical

1512
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
you provide a great happy magical
 

1513
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,950
you provide a great happy magical
whatever experience for the consumer

1514
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
whatever experience for the consumer
 

1515
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,950

and listen if it happens to involve

1516
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
and listen if it happens to involve
 

1517
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,630
and listen if it happens to involve
something complex and technical then

1518
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
something complex and technical then
 

1519
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,510
something complex and technical then
great

1520
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
great
 

1521
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,070
great
but it turns out i think most of the

1522
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
but it turns out i think most of the
 

1523
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,149
but it turns out i think most of the
time

1524
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
time
 

1525
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,750

those experiences are just sitting there

1526
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
those experiences are just sitting there
 

1527
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,830
those experiences are just sitting there
waiting to be built with like not that

1528
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
waiting to be built with like not that
 

1529
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,070

complex solutions

1530
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
complex solutions
 

1531
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,070
complex solutions
uh but everyone is just like so stuck in

1532
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
uh but everyone is just like so stuck in
 

1533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,669
uh but everyone is just like so stuck in
their own head that they have to over

1534
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
their own head that they have to over
 

1535
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,110
their own head that they have to over
engineer everything and then they forget

1536
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
engineer everything and then they forget
 

1537
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,870
engineer everything and then they forget
about the easy stuff

1538
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
about the easy stuff
 

1539
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,269
about the easy stuff
i mean also maybe to flip the lost

1540
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
i mean also maybe to flip the lost
 

1541
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,710
i mean also maybe to flip the lost
function there is you're trying to

1542
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
function there is you're trying to
 

1543
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,430
function there is you're trying to
minimize the number of times

1544
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
minimize the number of times
 

1545
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,909
minimize the number of times
you there's unpleasant experience right

1546
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
you there's unpleasant experience right
 

1547
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,750
you there's unpleasant experience right
like uh the one you mention where when

1548
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
like uh the one you mention where when
 

1549
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,430
like uh the one you mention where when
you go to the next photo it freezes for

1550
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
you go to the next photo it freezes for
 

1551
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,590
you go to the next photo it freezes for
a little bit so it's almost as opposed

1552
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
a little bit so it's almost as opposed
 

1553
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,430
a little bit so it's almost as opposed
to maximizing pleasure it's probably

1554
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
to maximizing pleasure it's probably
 

1555
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,029
to maximizing pleasure it's probably
easier to minimize

1556
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
easier to minimize
 

1557
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,630
easier to minimize
the number of like

1558
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
the number of like
 

1559
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,750
the number of like
the friction

1560
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
the friction
 

1561
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,669
the friction
yeah and as we all know you just you

1562
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
yeah and as we all know you just you
 

1563
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,830
yeah and as we all know you just you
just uh you just make the pleasure

1564
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
just uh you just make the pleasure
 

1565
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,870
just uh you just make the pleasure
negative and then minimize everything so

1566
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
negative and then minimize everything so
 

1567
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,390
negative and then minimize everything so
we're mapping this all back to neural

1568
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,400
we're mapping this all back to neural
 

1569
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,909
we're mapping this all back to neural
networks but actually can i say one

1570
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
networks but actually can i say one
 

1571
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,830
networks but actually can i say one
thing on that which is

1572
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:17,840
thing on that which is
 

1573
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,350
thing on that which is
i don't know a lot about machine

1574
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
i don't know a lot about machine
 

1575
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,830
i don't know a lot about machine
learning but i feel like i've i've tried

1576
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
learning but i feel like i've i've tried
 

1577
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,470
learning but i feel like i've i've tried
studying a bunch that whole idea of

1578
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
studying a bunch that whole idea of
 

1579
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,789
studying a bunch that whole idea of
reinforcement learning

1580
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
reinforcement learning
 

1581
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,350
reinforcement learning
and planning out more than the greedy

1582
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
and planning out more than the greedy
 

1583
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,990
and planning out more than the greedy
single experience i think is

1584
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
single experience i think is
 

1585
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,190
single experience i think is
is the closest you can get to

1586
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
is the closest you can get to
 

1587
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,470
is the closest you can get to
like ideal product design thinking

1588
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
like ideal product design thinking
 

1589
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,870
like ideal product design thinking
where you're not saying hey like can we

1590
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
where you're not saying hey like can we
 

1591
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,710
where you're not saying hey like can we
have a great experience just this one

1592
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
have a great experience just this one
 

1593
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,590
have a great experience just this one
time

1594
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
time
 

1595
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,269
time
but like what is the right way to

1596
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
but like what is the right way to
 

1597
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,350
but like what is the right way to
onboard someone what series of

1598
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
onboard someone what series of
 

1599
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,909
onboard someone what series of
experiences correlate most with them

1600
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
experiences correlate most with them
 

1601
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,190
experiences correlate most with them
hanging on long term right so not just

1602
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
hanging on long term right so not just
 

1603
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,590
hanging on long term right so not just
saying oh did the photo load slowly a

1604
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
saying oh did the photo load slowly a
 

1605
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,510
saying oh did the photo load slowly a
couple times or did they get a great

1606
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
couple times or did they get a great
 

1607
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,909
couple times or did they get a great
photo at the top of their feed

1608
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
photo at the top of their feed
 

1609
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,350
photo at the top of their feed
but like what are the things that are

1610
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
but like what are the things that are
 

1611
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,750
but like what are the things that are
going to make this person come back

1612
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
going to make this person come back
 

1613
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,149
going to make this person come back
over the next week over the next month

1614
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
over the next week over the next month
 

1615
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,830
over the next week over the next month
and as a product designer asking

just minimize bad experiences in the

1620
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
just minimize bad experiences in the
 

1621
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,230
just minimize bad experiences in the
short run but like

1622
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
short run but like
 

1623
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,149
short run but like
how do i get someone to engage over the

1624
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
how do i get someone to engage over the
 

1625
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,750
how do i get someone to engage over the
next month

1626
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
next month
 

1627
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,070
next month
and i'm not going to claim at all that i

1628
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
and i'm not going to claim at all that i
 

1629
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,350
and i'm not going to claim at all that i
thought that way at all at the time

1630
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
thought that way at all at the time
 

1631
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,430
thought that way at all at the time
because i certainly didn't but if i were

1632
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
because i certainly didn't but if i were
 

1633
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,430
because i certainly didn't but if i were
going back and giving myself any advice

1634
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
going back and giving myself any advice
 

1635
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,029
going back and giving myself any advice
it would be thinking what are those what

1636
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
it would be thinking what are those what
 

1637
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,870
it would be thinking what are those what
are those second order effects that you

1638
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
are those second order effects that you
 

1639
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,149
are those second order effects that you
can create

1640
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
can create
 

1641
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,830
can create
and it turns out having your friends on

1642
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
and it turns out having your friends on
 

1643
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,110
and it turns out having your friends on
the service

1644
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
the service
 

1645
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,510
the service
it's an enormous win so starting with a

1646
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
it's an enormous win so starting with a
 

1647
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,990
it's an enormous win so starting with a
very small group of people that produce

1648
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
very small group of people that produce
 

1649
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,149
very small group of people that produce
content that you wanted to see which we

1650
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
content that you wanted to see which we
 

1651
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,549
content that you wanted to see which we
did we seeded the community very well i

1652
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
did we seeded the community very well i
 

1653
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,669
did we seeded the community very well i
think

1654
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
think
 

1655
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,669
think
ended up mattering and

1656
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
ended up mattering and
 

1657
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,470
ended up mattering and
so

1658
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
so
 

1659
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,149
so
yeah you said that community is one of

1660
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
yeah you said that community is one of
 

1661
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,789
yeah you said that community is one of
the most important things so it's from a

1662
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
the most important things so it's from a
 

1663
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,029
the most important things so it's from a
metrics perspective from uh maybe a

1664
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
metrics perspective from uh maybe a
 

1665
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,269
metrics perspective from uh maybe a
philosophy perspective

1666
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
philosophy perspective
 

1667
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,789
philosophy perspective
building a certain kind of community

1668
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
building a certain kind of community
 

1669
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,950
building a certain kind of community
within the app see i wasn't sure what

1670
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
within the app see i wasn't sure what
 

1671
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,710
within the app see i wasn't sure what
exactly you meant by that when when i've

1672
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
exactly you meant by that when when i've
 

1673
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,230
exactly you meant by that when when i've
heard you say that maybe you can

1674
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
heard you say that maybe you can
 

1675
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,269
heard you say that maybe you can
elaborate but as i understand now it's

1676
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
elaborate but as i understand now it's
 

1677
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,430
elaborate but as i understand now it's
can literally mean

1678
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
can literally mean
 

1679
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,669
can literally mean
get your friends onto the app

1680
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
get your friends onto the app
 

1681
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,549
get your friends onto the app
yeah

1682
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
yeah
 

1683
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,789
yeah
think of it this way

1684
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
think of it this way
 

1685
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,350
think of it this way
you can build an amazing restaurant or

1686
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
you can build an amazing restaurant or
 

1687
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,750
you can build an amazing restaurant or
bar or whatever right

1688
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
bar or whatever right
 

1689
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,190
bar or whatever right
but if you show up and you're the only

1690
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
but if you show up and you're the only
 

1691
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,750
but if you show up and you're the only
one there is it like does it matter how

1692
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
one there is it like does it matter how
 

1693
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,830
one there is it like does it matter how
good the food is

1694
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
good the food is
 

1695
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,110
good the food is
the drinks whatever um no um these are

1696
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
the drinks whatever um no um these are
 

1697
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,029
the drinks whatever um no um these are
inherently social experiences that we

1698
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
inherently social experiences that we
 

1699
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,389
inherently social experiences that we
were working on

1700
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
were working on
 

1701
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,269
were working on
so

1702
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
so
 

1703
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,430
so
the idea of having people there

1704
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
the idea of having people there
 

1705
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,070
the idea of having people there
like you needed to have that otherwise

1706
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
like you needed to have that otherwise
 

1707
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,669
like you needed to have that otherwise
it was just to filter out but by the way

1708
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
it was just to filter out but by the way
 

1709
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,110
it was just to filter out but by the way
part of the genius

1710
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,120
part of the genius
 

1711
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,470
part of the genius
i'm going to say genius even though i

1712
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
i'm going to say genius even though i
 

1713
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,710
i'm going to say genius even though i
wasn't really genius was starting to be

1714
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
wasn't really genius was starting to be
 

1715
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,710
wasn't really genius was starting to be
marauding as a filter app

1716
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
marauding as a filter app
 

1717
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,149
marauding as a filter app
was awesome

1718
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159
was awesome
 

1719
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,750
was awesome
the fact that you could so we talk about

1720
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
the fact that you could so we talk about
 

1721
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,830
the fact that you could so we talk about
single player mode a lot which is like

1722
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
single player mode a lot which is like
 

1723
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,070
single player mode a lot which is like
can you play the game alone

1724
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
can you play the game alone
 

1725
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,510
can you play the game alone
and instagram you could totally play

1726
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
and instagram you could totally play
 

1727
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,430
and instagram you could totally play
alone you could filter your photos and a

1728
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
alone you could filter your photos and a
 

1729
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,950
alone you could filter your photos and a
lot of people would tell me i didn't

1730
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:00,960
lot of people would tell me i didn't
 

1731
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,029
lot of people would tell me i didn't
even realize that this thing was a

1732
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
even realize that this thing was a
 

1733
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,389
even realize that this thing was a
social network

1734
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
social network
 

1735
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,710
social network
until my friend showed up it totally

1736
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
until my friend showed up it totally
 

1737
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,549
until my friend showed up it totally
worked as a single player

1738
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
worked as a single player
 

1739
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,710
worked as a single player
game and then when your friend showed up

1740
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
game and then when your friend showed up
 

1741
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,389
game and then when your friend showed up
all of a sudden it was like oh

1742
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
all of a sudden it was like oh
 

1743
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,470
all of a sudden it was like oh
not only was this great alone but now i

1744
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
not only was this great alone but now i
 

1745
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,870
not only was this great alone but now i
actually have this trove of photos that

1746
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
actually have this trove of photos that
 

1747
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,269
actually have this trove of photos that
people can look at and start liking and

1748
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
people can look at and start liking and
 

1749
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,029
people can look at and start liking and
then i can like theirs and

1750
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:21,039
then i can like theirs and
 

1751
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,590
then i can like theirs and
so it was this bootstrap method of how

1752
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
so it was this bootstrap method of how
 

1753
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,350
so it was this bootstrap method of how
do you make the thing not suck when the

1754
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
do you make the thing not suck when the
 

1755
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,870
do you make the thing not suck when the
restaurant is empty

1756
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
restaurant is empty
 

1757
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,549
restaurant is empty
yeah but the thing is when you say

1758
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
yeah but the thing is when you say
 

1759
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,789
yeah but the thing is when you say
friends i mean we're not necessarily

1760
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
friends i mean we're not necessarily
 

1761
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,149
friends i mean we're not necessarily
referring to friends in the physical

1762
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
referring to friends in the physical
 

1763
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,909
referring to friends in the physical
space so you're not bringing your

1764
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
space so you're not bringing your
 

1765
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,750
space so you're not bringing your
physical friends with you you're also

1766
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
physical friends with you you're also
 

1767
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,510
physical friends with you you're also
making new friends so you're finding new

1768
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
making new friends so you're finding new
 

1769
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,350
making new friends so you're finding new
community so it's not immediately

1770
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
community so it's not immediately
 

1771
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,669
community so it's not immediately
obvious to me that

1772
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
obvious to me that
 

1773
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,269
obvious to me that
it's like it's almost like building any

1774
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
it's like it's almost like building any
 

1775
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,870
it's like it's almost like building any
kind of community

1776
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
kind of community
 

1777
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,510
kind of community
it was it was both and what we learned

1778
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
it was it was both and what we learned
 

1779
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,590
it was it was both and what we learned
very early on was what made instagram

1780
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
very early on was what made instagram
 

1781
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,029
very early on was what made instagram
special and the reason why you would

1782
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
special and the reason why you would
 

1783
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,950
special and the reason why you would

00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
and they're like instances on amazon i
 

2103
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,430
and they're like instances on amazon i
was like what are those

2104
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
was like what are those
 

2105
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,589
was like what are those
and it was this moment where we realized

2106
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
and it was this moment where we realized
 

2107
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,910
and it was this moment where we realized
how deep in it we were because we had no

2108
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
how deep in it we were because we had no
 

2109
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,589
how deep in it we were because we had no
idea that aw aws existed nor should we

2110
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:23,599
idea that aw aws existed nor should we
 

2111
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,270
idea that aw aws existed nor should we
be using it anyway

2112
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
be using it anyway
 

2113
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,790
be using it anyway
that night we went back to the office

2114
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
that night we went back to the office
 

2115
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,950
that night we went back to the office
and we got on aws but we we did this

2116
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:28,960
and we got on aws but we we did this
 

2117
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,030
and we got on aws but we we did this
really dumb thing we're

2118
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
really dumb thing we're
 

2119
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,550
really dumb thing we're
i'm so sorry to people listening but um

2120
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
i'm so sorry to people listening but um
 

2121
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,870
i'm so sorry to people listening but um
we brought up an instance which was our

2122
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
we brought up an instance which was our
 

2123
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,710
we brought up an instance which was our
our database it's going to be a

2124
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
our database it's going to be a
 

2125
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,710
our database it's going to be a
replacement for our database

2126
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
replacement for our database
 

2127
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,109
replacement for our database
but we had it talking over the public

2128
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
but we had it talking over the public
 

2129
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,190
but we had it talking over the public
internet to our little box in la that

2130
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
internet to our little box in la that
 

2131
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,230
internet to our little box in la that
was our app server very nice yeah um

2132
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
was our app server very nice yeah um
 

2133
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,990
was our app server very nice yeah um
that's how sophisticated we were and

2134
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
that's how sophisticated we were and
 

2135
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,710
that's how sophisticated we were and
obviously that was very very slow

2136
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
obviously that was very very slow
 

2137
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,710
obviously that was very very slow
didn't work at all i mean it worked but

2138
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
didn't work at all i mean it worked but
 

2139
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,109
didn't work at all i mean it worked but
didn't work did we only like later that

2140
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
didn't work did we only like later that
 

2141
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,630
didn't work did we only like later that
night did we realize we had to have it

2142
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
night did we realize we had to have it
 

2143
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,990
night did we realize we had to have it
all together

2144
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
all together
 

2145
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,670
all together
but at least like if you're listening

2146
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
but at least like if you're listening
 

2147
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,829
but at least like if you're listening
right now and you're thinking you know i

2148
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
right now and you're thinking you know i
 

2149
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,109
right now and you're thinking you know i
have no chance i'm going to start to

2150
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
have no chance i'm going to start to
 

2151
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,790
have no chance i'm going to start to
start i have no chance

2152
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
start i have no chance
 

2153
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,230
start i have no chance
i don't know we did it and we made a

2154
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
i don't know we did it and we made a
 

2155
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,470
i don't know we did it and we made a
bunch of really dumb mistakes initially

2156
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
bunch of really dumb mistakes initially
 

2157
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,990
bunch of really dumb mistakes initially
i think the question is how quickly do

2158
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
i think the question is how quickly do
 

2159
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,430
i think the question is how quickly do
you learn that you're making a mistake

2160
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
you learn that you're making a mistake
 

2161
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,950
you learn that you're making a mistake
and do you do the right thing

2162
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
and do you do the right thing
 

2163
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,870
and do you do the right thing
immediately right after so you didn't

2164
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
immediately right after so you didn't
 

2165
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,589
immediately right after so you didn't
pay for those mistakes by you know by

2166
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
pay for those mistakes by you know by
 

2167
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,750
pay for those mistakes by you know by
failure so

2168
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
failure so
 

2169
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,750
failure so
yeah how quickly did you fix it

2170
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
yeah how quickly did you fix it
 

2171
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,430
yeah how quickly did you fix it
i guess there's a lot of ways to sneak

2172
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
i guess there's a lot of ways to sneak
 

2173
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,030
i guess there's a lot of ways to sneak
up to this question of how the hell do

2174
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
up to this question of how the hell do
 

2175
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,550
up to this question of how the hell do
you scale the thing

2176
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
you scale the thing
 

2177
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,390
you scale the thing
other startups if you have an idea how

2178
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
other startups if you have an idea how
 

2179
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,390
other startups if you have an idea how
do you scale the thing is this is just

2180
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
do you scale the thing is this is just
 

2181
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,990
do you scale the thing is this is just
aws

2182
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
aws
 

2183
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,510
aws
and uh

2184
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
and uh
 

2185
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,630
and uh
you try to write the kind of code that's

2186
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,640
you try to write the kind of code that's
 

2187
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,790
you try to write the kind of code that's
easy to spread across a large number of

2188
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
easy to spread across a large number of
 

2189
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,710
easy to spread across a large number of
instances and then

2190
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
instances and then
 

2191
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,990
instances and then
the rest is just put money into it

2192
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
the rest is just put money into it
 

2193
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,790
the rest is just put money into it
basically i would say a couple things

2194
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
basically i would say a couple things
 

2195
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,910
basically i would say a couple things
first off

2196
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
first off
 

2197
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,069
first off
don't even ask the question just find

2198
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
don't even ask the question just find
 

2199
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,589
don't even ask the question just find
product market fit

2200
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599
product market fit
 

2201
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,910
product market fit
duct tape it together right like if you

2202
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
duct tape it together right like if you
 

2203
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,230
duct tape it together right like if you
have to i think there's a big caveat

2204
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
have to i think there's a big caveat
 

2205
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,230
have to i think there's a big caveat
here which i want to get to

2206
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
here which i want to get to
 

2207
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,150
here which i want to get to
but generally all that matters is

2208
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
but generally all that matters is
 

2209
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,150
but generally all that matters is
product market fit that's all that

2210
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
product market fit that's all that
 

2211
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,870
product market fit that's all that
matters if people like your product

2212
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
matters if people like your product
 

2213
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,430
matters if people like your product
do not worry about when 50 000 people

2214
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
do not worry about when 50 000 people
 

2215
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,109
do not worry about when 50 000 people
use your product because you will be

2216
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
use your product because you will be
 

2217
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,790
use your product because you will be
happy that you have that problem when

2218
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
happy that you have that problem when
 

2219
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,990
happy that you have that problem when
you get there i actually can't name

2220
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
you get there i actually can't name
 

2221
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,190
you get there i actually can't name
many

2222
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
many
 

2223
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,550
many
startups

2224
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
startups
 

2225
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,150
startups
where they go from

2226
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
where they go from
 

2227
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,310
where they go from
nothing to something overnight and they

2228
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320
nothing to something overnight and they
 

2229
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,310
nothing to something overnight and they
can't figure out how to scale it there

2230
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320
can't figure out how to scale it there
 

2231
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,670
can't figure out how to scale it there
are some

2232
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
are some
 

2233
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,630
are some
but i think nowadays it's a when i say a

2234
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
but i think nowadays it's a when i say a
 

2235
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,550
but i think nowadays it's a when i say a
solved problem like

2236
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560
solved problem like
 

2237
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,109
solved problem like
there are ways of solving it

2238
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
there are ways of solving it
 

2239
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,870
there are ways of solving it
the base case is typically that startups

2240
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
the base case is typically that startups
 

2241
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,710
the base case is typically that startups
worry way too much about

2242
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
worry way too much about
 

2243
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,550
worry way too much about
scaling way too early and forget that

2244
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
scaling way too early and forget that
 

2245
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,670
scaling way too early and forget that
they actually have to make something

2246
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
they actually have to make something
 

2247
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,510
they actually have to make something
that people like that's the that's the

2248
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
that people like that's the that's the
 

2249
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,510
that people like that's the that's the
default mistake case

2250
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
default mistake case
 

2251
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,750
default mistake case
but what i'll say is um

2252
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
but what i'll say is um
 

2253
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,829
but what i'll say is um
once you start scaling

2254
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
once you start scaling
 

2255
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,310
once you start scaling
i mean hiring quickly people who have

2256
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
i mean hiring quickly people who have
 

2257
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,910
i mean hiring quickly people who have
seen the game before and just know how

2258
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
seen the game before and just know how
 

2259
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,950
seen the game before and just know how
to do it it it becomes um

2471
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,470
that's ads
so

2472
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,480
so
 

2473
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,750
so
you know

2474
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760
you know
 

2475
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,870
you know
if you

2476
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:34,880
if you
 

2477
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,190
if you
have a service that's amenable to that

2478
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
have a service that's amenable to that

have a service that's amenable to that
and

2480
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
and
 

2481
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,430
and
then i wouldn't worry too much about

2482
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
then i wouldn't worry too much about
 

2483
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,950
then i wouldn't worry too much about
that because if you get to the scale you

2484
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
that because if you get to the scale you
 

2485
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,309
that because if you get to the scale you
can hire some smart people and figure

2486
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,670
that out
i

2490
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
i
 

2491
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,829
i
do think that is really healthy for a

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,790
and there was this enormous demand of
like hey i really like this behavior i

2740
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
like hey i really like this behavior i
 

2741
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,950
like hey i really like this behavior i
love using instagram but

00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
something going on in my day like
 

2747
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,829
something going on in my day like
do i really have to put it on my profile

2748
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
do i really have to put it on my profile
 

2749
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,750
do i really have to put it on my profile
do i really have to make it last forever

2750
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
do i really have to make it last forever
 

2751
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,950
do i really have to make it last forever
do i really

2752
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
do i really

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,190
do i really
um and that opened up a door it created

2754
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
um and that opened up a door it created
 

2755
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,190
um and that opened up a door it created
a market right and then what's

2756
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
a market right and then what's
 

2757
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,710
a market right and then what's
fascinating is

2758
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
fascinating is
 

2759
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,550
fascinating is
instagram had an explore page for the

2760
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
instagram had an explore page for the
 

2761
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,870
instagram had an explore page for the
longest time it was image driven right

2762
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
longest time it was image driven right
 

2763
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,670
longest time it was image driven right
um

2764
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
um
 

2765
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,750
um
but there's absolutely a behavior where

2766
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
but there's absolutely a behavior where
 

2767
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,190
but there's absolutely a behavior where
you open up instagram and you sit on the

2768
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
you open up instagram and you sit on the
 

2769
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,190
you open up instagram and you sit on the
explore page all day that is effectively

2770
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
explore page all day that is effectively
 

2771
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,430
explore page all day that is effectively
tick tock but obviously focused on

2772
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
tick tock but obviously focused on
 

2773
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,150
tick tock but obviously focused on
videos and it's not like you could just

2774
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
videos and it's not like you could just
 

2775
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,550
videos and it's not like you could just
put the explore page in tik tok form and

2776
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
put the explore page in tik tok form and
 

2777
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,230
put the explore page in tik tok form and
it works it had to be video it had to

2778
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
it works it had to be video it had to
 

2779
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,670
it works it had to be video it had to
have music

2780
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:39,680
have music
 

2781
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,750
have music
these are the hard parts about product

2782
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
these are the hard parts about product
 

2783
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,109
these are the hard parts about product
development that are very hard to

2784
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
development that are very hard to
 

2785
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,150
development that are very hard to
predict

2786
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,160
predict
 

2787
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,990
predict
but um

2788
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,000
but um
 

2789
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,829
but um
they're all versions of the same thing

2790
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:47,839
they're all versions of the same thing
 

2791
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,990
they're all versions of the same thing
with varying

2792
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
with varying
 

2793
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,349
with varying
if you line them up in a bunch of

2794
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:51,359
if you line them up in a bunch of
 

2795
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,030
if you line them up in a bunch of
dimensions they're just like

2796
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
dimensions they're just like
 

2797
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,030
dimensions they're just like
kind of on

2798
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
kind of on
 

2799
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,309
kind of on
they're different values of the same

2800
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
they're different values of the same
 

2801
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,550
they're different values of the same
dimensions which is like i guess easy to

2802
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
dimensions which is like i guess easy to
 

2803
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,870
dimensions which is like i guess easy to
say in retrospect but like if i were an

2804
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
say in retrospect but like if i were an
 

2805
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,630
say in retrospect but like if i were an
entrepreneur going after that area i'd

2806
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
entrepreneur going after that area i'd
 

2807
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,030
entrepreneur going after that area i'd
ask myself like where's the opening

2808
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
ask myself like where's the opening
 

2809
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,870
ask myself like where's the opening
what needs to exist because tiktok

2810
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
what needs to exist because tiktok
 

2811
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,390
what needs to exist because tiktok
exists now

2812
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
exists now
 

2813
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,270
exists now
so i wonder how much

2814
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
so i wonder how much
 

2815
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,510
so i wonder how much
things that don't yet exist and can

2816
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
things that don't yet exist and can
 

2817
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,829
things that don't yet exist and can
exist is in the space of algorithms in

2818
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
exist is in the space of algorithms in
 

2819
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,990
exist is in the space of algorithms in
the space of recommender systems

2820
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,000
the space of recommender systems
 

2821
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,870
the space of recommender systems
so

2822
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
so
 

2823
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,470
so
in the space of how the feed is

2824
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
in the space of how the feed is
 

2825
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,870
in the space of how the feed is
generated so we kind of talk about the

2826
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
generated so we kind of talk about the
 

2827
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,589
generated so we kind of talk about the
actual elements of the um

2828
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
actual elements of the um
 

2829
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,270
actual elements of the um
the content that's what we've been

2830
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
the content that's what we've been
 

2831
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,750
the content that's what we've been
talking the difference between photos

2832
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
talking the difference between photos
 

2833
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,470
talking the difference between photos
between uh short videos longer videos i

2834
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
between uh short videos longer videos i
 

2835
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,030

wonder how much disruption is possible

2836
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
wonder how much disruption is possible
 

2837
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,030
wonder how much disruption is possible
in the way the algorithms work

2838
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040
in the way the algorithms work
 

2839
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,710
in the way the algorithms work
because a lot of the criticism towards

2840
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
because a lot of the criticism towards
 

2841
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,150
because a lot of the criticism towards
social media is in the way the

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
social media is in the way the
 

2843
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,390
social media is in the way the
algorithms work currently and it feels

00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,400
algorithms work currently and it feels
 

2845
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,589
algorithms work currently and it feels
like

like
first of all talking about

first of all talking about

first of all talking about
product market fit there's certainly a

00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,160
product market fit there's certainly a
 

2851
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,510
product market fit there's certainly a

00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
don't think anyone everyone said
 

2861
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,190
don't think anyone everyone said
complaining this is not doing this is

this is hurting me and this is hurting

society but i keep doing it because i'm
 

2867
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,270
society but i keep doing it because i'm
addicted to it

2868
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
addicted to it
 

2869
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,910
addicted to it
and they say we want something different

2870
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:09,920
and they say we want something different
 

2871
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,790
and they say we want something different
but we don't know what it feels like a

00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
but we don't know what it feels like a
 

2873
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,750
but we don't know what it feels like a
uh

2874
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
uh
 

2875
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,910
uh
just different uh it feels like there's

2876
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
just different uh it feels like there's
 

2877
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,750
just different uh it feels like there's
a hunger for that

2878
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
a hunger for that
 

2879
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,270
a hunger for that
but that's in the space of algorithms i

2880
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
but that's in the space of algorithms i
 

2881
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,950
but that's in the space of algorithms i
wonder if it's possible to disrupt in

2882
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
wonder if it's possible to disrupt in
 

2883
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,190
wonder if it's possible to disrupt in
that space absolutely

2884
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:23,200
that space absolutely
 

2885
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,549
that space absolutely
um

2886
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
um
 

2887
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,030
um
i have this thesis that

2888
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
i have this thesis that
 

2889
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,950
i have this thesis that
the worst part about social networks is

2890
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:28,960
the worst part about social networks is
 

2891
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,910
the worst part about social networks is
that they're uh

2892
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
that they're uh
 

2893
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,589
that they're uh
is the people

2894
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
is the people
 

2895
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,710
is the people
it's it's

2896
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
it's it's
 

2897
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,549
it's it's
it's a line that sounds funny right

2898
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
it's a line that sounds funny right
 

2899
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,829
it's a line that sounds funny right
because like that's why you call it a

2900
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
because like that's why you call it a

right search and discovery would you

2960
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
right search and discovery would you
 

2961
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,109
right search and discovery would you
search and discovery but my point is it

right
nice

2976
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
nice
 

2977
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,829
nice
yeah but like what did those do like

they basically distributed interesting

2980
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
they basically distributed interesting
 

2981
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,829
they basically distributed interesting
content to you right

2982
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
content to you right
 

2983
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,430

um

2984
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
um
 

2985
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,069
um
i think the most interesting part or the

2986
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
i think the most interesting part or the
 

2987
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,230
i think the most interesting part or the
future of social networks is going to be

2988
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
future of social networks is going to be
 

2989
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,470
future of social networks is going to be
making them less social because i think

2990
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
making them less social because i think
 

2991
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,470
making them less social because i think
people are part of the root cause of the

2992
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
people are part of the root cause of the
 

2993
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,230
people are part of the root cause of the
problem so for instance

2994
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,240
problem so for instance
 

2995
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,470
problem so for instance
um often in recommender systems we talk

2996
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480
um often in recommender systems we talk
 

2997
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,150
um often in recommender systems we talk
about two stages there's a candidate

2998
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
about two stages there's a candidate
 

2999
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,589
about two stages there's a candidate
generation step

3000
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:13,599
generation step
 

3001
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,829
generation step
which is just like of our vast trove of

3002
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:15,839
which is just like of our vast trove of
 

3003
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,309
which is just like of our vast trove of
stuff that you might want to see

3004
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
stuff that you might want to see
 

3005
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,710
stuff that you might want to see
what small subset

3006
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
what small subset
 

3007
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,390
what small subset
should we pick for you

3008
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,400
should we pick for you
 

3009
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,910
should we pick for you
okay

3010
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:23,920
okay
 

3011
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,750
okay
typically that is grabbed from things

3012
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
typically that is grabbed from things
 

3013
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,430
typically that is grabbed from things
your friends have shared

3014
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
your friends have shared
 

3015
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,230
your friends have shared
right

3016
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,240
right
 

3017
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,309
right
then there's a ranking step which says

3018
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
then there's a ranking step which says
 

3019
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,549
then there's a ranking step which says
okay now given these hundred 200 things

3020
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:32,559
okay now given these hundred 200 things
 

3021
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,790
okay now given these hundred 200 things
depends on the network right let's like

3022
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
depends on the network right let's like
 

3023
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,030
depends on the network right let's like
be really good about ranking them and

3024
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
be really good about ranking them and
 

3025
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,950
be really good about ranking them and
generally rank the things up higher that

3026
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
generally rank the things up higher that
 

3027
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,030
generally rank the things up higher that
get the most engagement right so what's

3028
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
get the most engagement right so what's
 

3029
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,470
get the most engagement right so what's
the problem with that

3030
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
the problem with that
 

3031
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,589
the problem with that
step one is we've limited everything you

3032
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
step one is we've limited everything you
 

3033
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,430
step one is we've limited everything you
could possibly see to things that your

3034
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
could possibly see to things that your
 

3035
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,349
could possibly see to things that your
friends have chosen to share

3036
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
friends have chosen to share
 

3037
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,150
friends have chosen to share
or maybe not friends but influencers

3038
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
or maybe not friends but influencers
 

3039
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,230
or maybe not friends but influencers
what things do people generally want to

3040
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,240
what things do people generally want to
 

3041
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,430
what things do people generally want to
share they want to share things that are

3042
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
share they want to share things that are
 

3043
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,790
share they want to share things that are
going to get likes that are going to

3044
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:56,800
going to get likes that are going to
 

3045
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,470
going to get likes that are going to
show up broadly

3046
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
show up broadly
 

3047
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,230
show up broadly
so they tend to be more emotionally

3048
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
so they tend to be more emotionally
 

3049
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,790
so they tend to be more emotionally
driven they tend to be more risque or

3050
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,800
driven they tend to be more risque or
 

3051
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,030
driven they tend to be more risque or
whatever so why do we have this problem

3052
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
whatever so why do we have this problem
 

3053
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,630
whatever so why do we have this problem
it's because

3054
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
it's because
 

3055
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,390
it's because
we show people things people have

3056
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,400
we show people things people have
 

3057
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,990
we show people things people have
decided to share and those things

3058
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
decided to share and those things
 

3059
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,069
decided to share and those things
self-select to being the things that are

3060
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
self-select to being the things that are
 

3061
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,990

imagine like
 

3189
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,030
imagine like
if you just stop thinking about query as

3190
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
if you just stop thinking about query as
 

3191
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,950

their age their gender where they're
from

3214
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
from
 

3215
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,710
from
maybe some kind of summarization of

3216
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
maybe some kind of summarization of
 

3217
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,430
maybe some kind of summarization of
their interests and and that's a query

3218
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,440
their interests and and that's a query
 

3219
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,270
their interests and and that's a query
right and that matches against documents

3220
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
right and that matches against documents
 

3221
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,470
right and that matches against documents
and by the way documents don't have to

3222
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
and by the way documents don't have to
 

3223
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,230
and by the way documents don't have to
be text they can be

3224
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,240
be text they can be
 

3225
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,390
be text they can be
videos they're however long i don't know

3226
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
videos they're however long i don't know
 

3227
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,750
videos they're however long i don't know
what the limit is on tick tock these

3228
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:49,760
what the limit is on tick tock these
 

3229
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,829
what the limit is on tick tock these
days they keep changing it my point is

3230
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
days they keep changing it my point is
 

3231
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,549
days they keep changing it my point is
just

3232
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
just
 

3233
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,390
just
you've got a query which is someone in

3234
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
you've got a query which is someone in
 

3235
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,230
you've got a query which is someone in
search of something that they want to

3236
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
search of something that they want to
 

3237
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,230
search of something that they want to
match and you've got the document it

3238
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
match and you've got the document it
 

3239
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,670
match and you've got the document it
doesn't have to be text it could be

3240
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
doesn't have to be text it could be
 

3241
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,990
doesn't have to be text it could be
anything and how do you match make and

3242
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,000
anything and how do you match make and
 

3243
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,589
anything and how do you match make and
that's one of these like i mean i've

3244
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:03,599
that's one of these like i mean i've
 

3245
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,069
that's one of these like i mean i've
spent a lot of time thinking about this

3246
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:06,079
spent a lot of time thinking about this
 

3247
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,829
spent a lot of time thinking about this
and i don't claim to have mastered it at

3248
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
and i don't claim to have mastered it at
 

3249
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,630
and i don't claim to have mastered it at
all

3250
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
all
 

3251
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,309
all
but i think it's so fascinating about

3252
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
but i think it's so fascinating about
 

3253
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,390
but i think it's so fascinating about
where that will go with new social

3254
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,400
where that will go with new social
 

3255
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,870
where that will go with new social
networks see what i'm also fascinated by

3256
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:14,880
networks see what i'm also fascinated by
 

3257
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,630
networks see what i'm also fascinated by
is metrics that are different than

3258
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
is metrics that are different than
 

3259
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,990
is metrics that are different than
engagement

3260
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,000
engagement
 

3261
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,510
engagement

what social networks are doing

3266
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
what social networks are doing
 

3267
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,349
what social networks are doing
is they

3268
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
is they
 

3269
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,230
is they
they in the short term bring out

3270
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
they in the short term bring out
 

3271
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,549
they in the short term bring out
different aspects of each human being so

3272
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
different aspects of each human being so
 

3273
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,390
different aspects of each human being so
first let me say

3274
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400
first let me say
 

3275
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,030
first let me say
that

3276
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040

 

3277
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,470

00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
an algorithm or a social network
 

3279
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,549
an algorithm or a social network
for each individual can bring out

3280
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
for each individual can bring out
 

3281
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,309
for each individual can bring out
the best of that person or the worst of

the best of that person or the worst of

different parts to us parts we're proud

3286
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
different parts to us parts we're proud
 

3287
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,190
different parts to us parts we're proud
of

3288
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
of
 

3289
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,990
of
that

3290
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
that
 

3291
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,710
that
that we are parts we're not so proud of

3292
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,720
that we are parts we're not so proud of
 

3293
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,470
that we are parts we're not so proud of
when we look at the big picture of our

3294
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
when we look at the big picture of our
 

3295
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,030
when we look at the big picture of our
lives when we look back 30 days from now

3296
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
lives when we look back 30 days from now
 

3297
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,710
lives when we look back 30 days from now
am i proud that i said those things or

3298
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
am i proud that i said those things or
 

3299
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,109
am i proud that i said those things or
not am i proud that i felt those things

3300
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
not am i proud that i felt those things
 

3301
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,990
not am i proud that i felt those things
am i proud that i experienced or read

3302
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
am i proud that i experienced or read
 

3303
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,230
am i proud that i experienced or read
those things or thought about those

3304
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
those things or thought about those
 

3305
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,990
those things or thought about those
things just in that kind of

3306
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
things just in that kind of
 

3307
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,990
things just in that kind of
self-reflective kind of way

3308
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
self-reflective kind of way
 

3309
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,630
self-reflective kind of way
and so coupled with that i wonder if

3310
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
and so coupled with that i wonder if
 

3311
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,069
and so coupled with that i wonder if
it's possible to have different metrics

3312
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:12,079
it's possible to have different metrics
 

3313
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,069
it's possible to have different metrics
they're not just about engagement

3314
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079
they're not just about engagement
 

3315
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,390
they're not just about engagement
but are about

3316
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
but are about
 

3317
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,950
but are about
long-term happiness

3318
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
long-term happiness
 

3319
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,789
long-term happiness
growth of a human being well they look

3320
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
growth of a human being well they look
 

3321
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,069
growth of a human being well they look
back and say

3322
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,079
back and say
 

3323
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,150
back and say
i am a better human being for having

3324
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
i am a better human being for having
 

3325
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,789
i am a better human being for having
spent 100 hours on that app

3326
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:26,799
spent 100 hours on that app
 

3327
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:27,589
spent 100 hours on that app
and

3328
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
and
 

3329
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,910
and
that feels like it's actually strongly

3330
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
that feels like it's actually strongly
 

3331
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,910
that feels like it's actually strongly
correlated with engagement

3332
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
correlated with engagement
 

3333
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,990
correlated with engagement
in the long term in the short term it

3334
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
in the long term in the short term it
 

3335
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,230
in the long term in the short term it
might not be but in long term it's like

3336
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:36,240
might not be but in long term it's like
 

3337
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,710
might not be but in long term it's like
the same kind of thing where you really

3338
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
the same kind of thing where you really
 

3339
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,630
the same kind of thing where you really
fall in love with the product

3340
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
fall in love with the product
 

3341
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,150
fall in love with the product
you fall in love with an iphone you fall

3342
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
you fall in love with an iphone you fall
 

3343
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,670
you fall in love with an iphone you fall
in love with a car

3344
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
in love with a car
 

3345
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,190
in love with a car
that's what makes you fall in love is

3346
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,200
that's what makes you fall in love is
 

3347
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,230
that's what makes you fall in love is
like

3348
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
like
 

3349
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,270
like
really

3350
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
really
 

3351
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,349
really
being proud

3352
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
being proud
 

3353
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,309
being proud
and just

3354
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:50,319
and just
 

3355
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,069
and just
in a self-reflective way understanding

3356
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
in a self-reflective way understanding
 

3357
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,750
in a self-reflective way understanding
that you're a better human being for

3358
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
that you're a better human being for
 

3359
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,510
that you're a better human being for
having used the thing and that's like

3360
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
having used the thing and that's like
 

3361
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,630
having used the thing and that's like
where the f

3362
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
where the f
 

3363
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,150
where the f
that's what great relationships are made

3364
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,160
that's what great relationships are made
 

3365
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,510
that's what great relationships are made
from it's not just like you're hot

3366
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
from it's not just like you're hot
 

3367
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,829
from it's not just like you're hot
and we like being together or something

3368
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
and we like being together or something
 

3369
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,349
and we like being together or something
like that it's more like i'm a better

3370
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
like that it's more like i'm a better
 

3371
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,430
like that it's more like i'm a better
human being because i'm with you

3372
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
human being because i'm with you
 

3373
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,430
human being because i'm with you
and that feels like a metric that could

3374
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:09,440
and that feels like a metric that could
 

3375
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,470
and that feels like a metric that could
be optimized for by the algorithms

3376
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
be optimized for by the algorithms
 

3377
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,270
be optimized for by the algorithms
um but you know anytime i kind of talk

3378
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,280
um but you know anytime i kind of talk
 

3379
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,670
um but you know anytime i kind of talk
about this with anybody they seem to say

3380
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
about this with anybody they seem to say
 

3381
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,589
about this with anybody they seem to say

3544
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
the more you use the product
 

3545
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,430
the more you use the product
the happier you are that was always the

3546
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
the happier you are that was always the
 

3547
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,870
the happier you are that was always the
argument at facebook by the way it was

3548
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
argument at facebook by the way it was
 

3549
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,470
argument at facebook by the way it was
like well

3550
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
like well
 

3551
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,069
like well
people use it more so they must be more

3552
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:08,079
people use it more so they must be more
 

3553
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,069
people use it more so they must be more
happy yeah turns out they're like a lot

3554
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
happy yeah turns out they're like a lot
 

3555
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,510
happy yeah turns out they're like a lot
of things you use more that make you

3556
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:11,520
of things you use more that make you
 

3557
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,270
of things you use more that make you
less happy in the world not talking

3558
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
less happy in the world not talking
 

3559
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,109
less happy in the world not talking
about facebook just you know let's think

3560
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
about facebook just you know let's think
 

3561
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:15,990
about facebook just you know let's think
about

3562
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
about
 

3563
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,750
about
whether it's gambling or whatever like

3564
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
whether it's gambling or whatever like
 

3565
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,349
whether it's gambling or whatever like
that you can do more of but doesn't

3566
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
that you can do more of but doesn't
 

3567
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,270
that you can do more of but doesn't
necessarily make you happier so the idea

3568
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
necessarily make you happier so the idea
 

3569
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,829
necessarily make you happier so the idea
that time equals happiness obviously

3570
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:23,839
that time equals happiness obviously
 

3571
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,150
that time equals happiness obviously
you can't map utility and time together

3572
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
you can't map utility and time together
 

3573
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,710
you can't map utility and time together
easily there are a lot of edge cases

3574
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:28,720
easily there are a lot of edge cases
 

3575
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,069
easily there are a lot of edge cases
so when you look around the world and

3576
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
so when you look around the world and
 

3577
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,589
so when you look around the world and
you say well what are all the ways we

3578
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
you say well what are all the ways we
 

3579
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,270
you say well what are all the ways we
can model utility that is like one of

3580
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:33,280
can model utility that is like one of
 

3581
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,230
can model utility that is like one of
the

3582
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
the
 

3583
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,910
the

please if you know someone smart doing
this introduce me because i'm fascinated

3586
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
this introduce me because i'm fascinated
 

3587
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,470
this introduce me because i'm fascinated
by it and it seems really tough

3588
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,480
by it and it seems really tough
 

3589
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,630
by it and it seems really tough
but the idea that reinforcement learning

3590
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:42,640
but the idea that reinforcement learning
 

3591
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,430
but the idea that reinforcement learning
like everyone interesting i know in

3592
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,440
like everyone interesting i know in
 

3593
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,270
like everyone interesting i know in
machine learning like i was really

3594
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
machine learning like i was really
 

3595
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,710
machine learning like i was really
interested in recommender systems and

3596
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
interested in recommender systems and
 

3597
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,190
interested in recommender systems and
supervised learning and

3598
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,200
supervised learning and
 

3599
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,950
supervised learning and
and the more i dug into it i was like oh

3600
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
and the more i dug into it i was like oh
 

3601
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,789
and the more i dug into it i was like oh
literally everyone smart is working on

3602
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:54,799
literally everyone smart is working on
 

3603
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,309
literally everyone smart is working on
reinforcement learning

3604
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:56,319
reinforcement learning
 

3605
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,069
reinforcement learning
like literally everyone you just made

3606
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
like literally everyone you just made
 

3607
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,829
like literally everyone you just made
people at open ai and deep mind very

3608
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
people at open ai and deep mind very
 

3609
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,670
people at open ai and deep mind very
happy yes but i mean but what's

3610
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:01,680
happy yes but i mean but what's
 

3611
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,349
happy yes but i mean but what's
interesting is like it's one thing to

3612
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
interesting is like it's one thing to
 

3613
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,470
interesting is like it's one thing to
train a game and like

3614
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480
train a game and like
 

3615
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,309
train a game and like
i mean that paper that where they just

3616
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
i mean that paper that where they just
 

3617
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,630
i mean that paper that where they just
took atari and they used a convnet to

3618
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,640
took atari and they used a convnet to
 

3619
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,750
took atari and they used a convnet to
basically just like train simple actions

3620
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:13,760
basically just like train simple actions
 

3621
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,589
basically just like train simple actions
mind-blowing right absolutely

3622
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
mind-blowing right absolutely
 

3623
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,710
mind-blowing right absolutely
mind-blowing but it's a game great

3624
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
mind-blowing but it's a game great
 

3625
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,750
mind-blowing but it's a game great
so now what if you're constructing

3626
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
so now what if you're constructing
 

3627
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,390
so now what if you're constructing
a feed for a person right

3628
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
a feed for a person right
 

3629
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,349
a feed for a person right
like

3630
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
like
 

3631
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,870
like
how can you

3632
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
how can you
 

3633
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,430
how can you
construct that feed in such a way

3634
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
construct that feed in such a way
 

3635
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,510
construct that feed in such a way
that optimizes for a diversity of

3636
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,520
that optimizes for a diversity of
 

3637
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,190
that optimizes for a diversity of
experience a

3638
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,200
experience a
 

3639
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,710
experience a
a long term happiness right

3640
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
a long term happiness right
 

3641
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,109
a long term happiness right
but that reward function it turns out in

3642
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
but that reward function it turns out in
 

3643
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,030
but that reward function it turns out in
reinforcement learning again

3644
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
reinforcement learning again
 

3645
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,390
reinforcement learning again
as i've learned

3646
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
as i've learned
 

3647
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,190
as i've learned
like reward design is really hard

3648
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
like reward design is really hard
 

3649
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,870
like reward design is really hard
and

3650
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
and
 

3651
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,630
and
i don't know like how do you design a

3652
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,640
i don't know like how do you design a
 

3653
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,710
i don't know like how do you design a
scalar reward for someone's happiness

3654
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
scalar reward for someone's happiness
 

3655
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,150
scalar reward for someone's happiness
over time i mean do you have to measure

3656
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
over time i mean do you have to measure
 

3657
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,150
over time i mean do you have to measure
dopamine levels like do you have to well

3658
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
dopamine levels like do you have to well
 

3659
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,470
dopamine levels like do you have to well
you have to have a lot of

3660
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
you have to have a lot of
 

3661
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,430
you have to have a lot of
a lot more signals from the human being

3662
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
a lot more signals from the human being
 

3663
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,789
a lot more signals from the human being
currently it feels like there's not

3664
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799
currently it feels like there's not
 

3665
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,870
currently it feels like there's not
enough signals coming from the human

3666
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
enough signals coming from the human
 

3667
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,789
enough signals coming from the human
being users of uh

3668
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:04,799
being users of uh
 

3669
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,950

01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,710
learning to work well
it needs to have a lot more data

3674
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
it needs to have a lot more data
 

3675
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,069
it needs to have a lot more data
needs to have a lot of data and that

01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:12,079
needs to have a lot of data and that
 

3677
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,430
needs to have a lot of data and that
actually is a challenge for anyone who

3678
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
actually is a challenge for anyone who
 

3679
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,349
actually is a challenge for anyone who
wants to start something which is you

01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:15,359
wants to start something which is you
 

3681
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,870
wants to start something which is you
don't have a lot of data so how do you

3682
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
don't have a lot of data so how do you
 

3683
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,030
don't have a lot of data so how do you
compete but i do think back to your

3684
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
compete but i do think back to your
 

3685
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,510
compete but i do think back to your

that's fascinating that's cool and i
think that's an open opportunity for

of the way there
 

4395
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,630
of the way there
and that feels like a big mountain to

4396

01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,080
so i distracted us from the original
 

4401
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,510
so i distracted us from the original
question no

4402
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:43,520
question no
 

4403
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,709
question no
return to machine learning because i'd

4404
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
return to machine learning because i'd
 

4405
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,709
return to machine learning because i'd
love to explore your interest there but

4406
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
love to explore your interest there but
 

4407

what does that world
look like why would you turn it down why

4424
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
look like why would you turn it down why
 

4425
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,709
look like why would you turn it down why
did you take it what was the calculation

4426
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
did you take it what was the calculation
 

4427
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,110
did you take it what was the calculation
that you were making ah thus enters the

4428
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
that you were making ah thus enters the

counterfactuals and not really knowing
 

4433
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,870
counterfactuals and not really knowing
and if only we could run that experiment

4434
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
and if only we could run that experiment
 

4435
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,110
and if only we could run that experiment
well the universe exists it's just

4436
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,120
well the universe exists it's just
 

4437
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,590
well the universe exists it's just
running in parallel to our own yeah

4438
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
running in parallel to our own yeah
 

4439
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,950
running in parallel to our own yeah
it's so fascinating right um

4440

probably hire more carefully because we

4470
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
probably hire more carefully because we
 

4471
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,470
probably hire more carefully because we
showed up

4472
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:52,480
showed up
 

4473
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,229
showed up
just like before i knew it we had like

4474
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
just like before i knew it we had like
 

4475
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,830
just like before i knew it we had like
100 people on the team and 200 and 300 i

4476
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
100 people on the team and 200 and 300 i
 

4477
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,950
100 people on the team and 200 and 300 i
don't know where all these people were

4478
01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:58,960
don't know where all these people were
 

4479

i never had to screen them they were
 

4483
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,950
i never had to screen them they were
just like internal transfers right

4484
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
just like internal transfers right
 

4485
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,550

so it's like relying on the facebook

4486
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560
so it's like relying on the facebook
 

4487
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,430
so it's like relying on the facebook
hiring machine which is quite sort of

4488
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
hiring machine which is quite sort of
 

4489
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,430
hiring machine which is quite sort of
i mean it's an elaborate machine it's

4490
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:11,440
i mean it's an elaborate machine it's
 

4491
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,350
i mean it's an elaborate machine it's
and it's great by the way they have

4492
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360

think people didn't like steve jobs but

6082
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,040
think people didn't like steve jobs but
 

6083
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,030
think people didn't like steve jobs but
like he delivered products

6084
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,040
like he delivered products
 

6085
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,870
like he delivered products
that and then they fell in love every

6086
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:58,880
that and then they fell in love every
 

6087
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,109
that and then they fell in love every
time

6088
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:01,119
time
 

6089
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:03,109
time
i guess you could say that the ceo the

6090
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
i guess you could say that the ceo the
 

6091
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,590
i guess you could say that the ceo the
leader is also a product

6092
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:05,600
leader is also a product
 

6093
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,430
leader is also a product
and if they keep delivering a product

6094
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:07,440
and if they keep delivering a product
 

6095
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,790
and if they keep delivering a product
that people like

6096
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:08,800
that people like
 

6097
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,470
that people like
by being in public and saying things

6098
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
by being in public and saying things
 

6099
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,030
by being in public and saying things
that people like that's also a way to

6100
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
that people like that's also a way to
 

6101
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,470
that people like that's also a way to
make people happy

6102
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,480
make people happy
 

6103
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,229
make people happy
but from a social network perspective it

6104
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:16,239
but from a social network perspective it
 

6105
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,270
but from a social network perspective it
makes me

6106
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:17,280
makes me
 

6107
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,669
makes me
wonder how difficult it is

6108
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
wonder how difficult it is
 

6109
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,510
wonder how difficult it is
to explain to people why certain things

6110
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:21,520
to explain to people why certain things
 

6111
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,270
to explain to people why certain things
happen like how to explain machine

6112
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:23,280
happen like how to explain machine
 

6113
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,310
happen like how to explain machine
learning to explain why

6114
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,320
learning to explain why
 

6115
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,350
learning to explain why
certain

6116
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
certain
 

6117
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,310
certain
uh

6118
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:28,320
uh
 

6119
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,310
uh
the

6120
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:30,320
the
 

6121
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,270
the
the woke mob effect happens or the

6122
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:33,280
the woke mob effect happens or the
 

6123
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,310
the woke mob effect happens or the
certain kinds of like bullying happens

6124
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:36,320
certain kinds of like bullying happens
 

6125
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,590
certain kinds of like bullying happens
which is like

6126
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:37,600
which is like
 

6127
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,910
which is like
it's human nature combined with

6128
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
it's human nature combined with
 

6129
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,750
it's human nature combined with
algorithm and it's very difficult to

6130
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
algorithm and it's very difficult to
 

6131
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,189
algorithm and it's very difficult to
control for how the spread of

6132
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
control for how the spread of
 

6133
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,430
control for how the spread of
quote-unquote misinformation happens

6134
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
quote-unquote misinformation happens
 

6135
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,669
quote-unquote misinformation happens
it's very difficult to control for that

6136
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:47,679
it's very difficult to control for that
 

6137
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,750
it's very difficult to control for that
and to you so you try to decelerate

6138
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760
and to you so you try to decelerate
 

6139
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,189
and to you so you try to decelerate
certain parts and you create more

6140
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:51,199
certain parts and you create more
 

6141
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:54,229
certain parts and you create more
problems then you solve and anything

6142
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:54,239
problems then you solve and anything
 

6143
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:55,910
problems then you solve and anything
that looks at all like censorship can

6144
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
that looks at all like censorship can
 

6145
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,510
that looks at all like censorship can
create huge amounts of problems that's

6146
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
create huge amounts of problems that's
 

6147
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,830
create huge amounts of problems that's
the slippery slope and then you have to

6148
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
the slippery slope and then you have to
 

6149
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,149
the slippery slope and then you have to
inject humans to oversee the machine

6150
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:02,159
inject humans to oversee the machine
 

6151
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,750
inject humans to oversee the machine
learning algorithms and anytime you

6152
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:03,760
learning algorithms and anytime you
 

6153
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,590
learning algorithms and anytime you
inject humans into the system it's gonna

6154
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:05,600
inject humans into the system it's gonna
 

6155
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,430
inject humans into the system it's gonna
create a huge number of problems and i

6156
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:07,440
create a huge number of problems and i
 

6157
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,870
create a huge number of problems and i
feel like it's up to the leader to

6158
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880
feel like it's up to the leader to
 

6159
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,790
feel like it's up to the leader to
communicate that effectively to be

6160
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800
communicate that effectively to be
 

6161
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,390
communicate that effectively to be
transparent

6162
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:12,400
transparent
 

6163
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,990
transparent
uh first of all design products that

6164
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
uh first of all design products that
 

6165
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,590
uh first of all design products that
don't have those problems and second of

6166
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:15,600
don't have those problems and second of
 

6167
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,510
don't have those problems and second of
all when they have those problems to be

6168
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
all when they have those problems to be
 

6169
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,189
all when they have those problems to be
able to communicate with them i guess

6170
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
able to communicate with them i guess
 

6171
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,950
able to communicate with them i guess
that's all going to

6172
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
that's all going to
 

6173
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,030
that's all going to
when you run a social network company

6174
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
when you run a social network company
 

6175
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,030
when you run a social network company
your job is hard

even know the name of the coming and his

6214
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
even know the name of the coming and his
 

6215
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,629
even know the name of the coming and his
answer is is if you just asked like your

6216
01:45:04,629 --> 01:45:04,639
answer is is if you just asked like your

grandfather the meaning of life yeah
yeah and you sit there and you're just

6220
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:08,239
yeah and you sit there and you're just
 

6221
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:10,550
yeah and you sit there and you're just
like what like yeah and there's that

6222
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:10,560
like what like yeah and there's that
 

6223
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,030
like what like yeah and there's that
bedside manner um

6224

bedside manner um
 

6225
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,629
bedside manner um
and if you lack that or if that's just

01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
and if you lack that or if that's just
 

6227
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,390
and if you lack that or if that's just
not intuitive to you

6228
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:16,400
not intuitive to you
 

6229
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,470
not intuitive to you
uh i think that

6230
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
uh i think that
 

6231
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,030
uh i think that
it can be a lot harder to gain the trust

6232
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
it can be a lot harder to gain the trust
 

6233
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,430
it can be a lot harder to gain the trust
of people and then add on top of that

6234
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
of people and then add on top of that
 

6235
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,470
of people and then add on top of that
missteps of companies right

6236
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,480
missteps of companies right
 

6237
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,990
missteps of companies right
it's i don't know if you have any

6238
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:28,000
it's i don't know if you have any
 

6239
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,990
it's i don't know if you have any
friends from the past where like maybe

6240
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000
friends from the past where like maybe
 

6241
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,229
friends from the past where like maybe

it requires an enormous amount of work
and most people aren't successful right

6560
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
and most people aren't successful right
 

6561
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,990
and most people aren't successful right
but even the ones that do don't skate by

6562
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:02,000
but even the ones that do don't skate by
 

6563
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,149
but even the ones that do don't skate by
um

6564
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:04,159
um
 

6565
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,709
um
i am okay if people choose not to work

6566
01:51:06,709 --> 01:51:06,719
i am okay if people choose not to work
 

6567
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,229
i am okay if people choose not to work
hard because i don't actually think

6568
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:08,239
hard because i don't actually think
 

6569
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:09,750
hard because i don't actually think
there's anything in this world that says

6570
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:09,760
there's anything in this world that says
 

6571
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,950
there's anything in this world that says
you have to work hard um

6572
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:12,960
you have to work hard um
 

6573
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,189
you have to work hard um
but i do think that great things require

6574
01:51:15,189 --> 01:51:15,199
but i do think that great things require
 

6575
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,109
but i do think that great things require
a lot of hard work so there's no way you

6576
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
a lot of hard work so there's no way you
 

6577
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:18,790
a lot of hard work so there's no way you
can expect to change the world without

01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
can expect to change the world without
 

6579
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,629
can expect to change the world without
working really hard and by the way

most have nudged the world in like a
 

6587
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,189
most have nudged the world in like a
slight direction

6588
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:27,199
slight direction
 

6589
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:28,390

very very slight

very very slight
 

6593
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,589
very very slight
like

even if elon accomplishes all the things
 

6597
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,910
even if elon accomplishes all the things
he wants to accomplish we will have uh

01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:35,920
he wants to accomplish we will have uh

have nudged the world in a slight
 

6601
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:39,750

direction but it requires enormous

6602
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:39,760

amount there was an interview with him

6604
01:51:41,189 --> 01:51:41,199
amount there was an interview with him
 

6605
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,030
amount there was an interview with him
where he was just like

6606
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,040
where he was just like
 

6607
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,629
where he was just like
he was interviewed i think at the tesla

6608
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
he was interviewed i think at the tesla
 

6609
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,390
he was interviewed i think at the tesla
factory and he was like

6610
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
factory and he was like
 

6611
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,149
factory and he was like
work is really hard this is actually

6612
01:51:48,149 --> 01:51:48,159
work is really hard this is actually
 

6613
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,270
work is really hard this is actually
unhealthy

6614
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,280
unhealthy
 

6615
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,510
unhealthy
and i can't recall the exact but he was

6616
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:51,520
and i can't recall the exact but he was
 

6617
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,589
and i can't recall the exact but he was
like visibly shaken about how hard he

6618
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:53,599
like visibly shaken about how hard he
 

6619
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:54,870
like visibly shaken about how hard he
had been working and he was like this is

6620
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:54,880
had been working and he was like this is
 

6621
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,669
had been working and he was like this is
bad

6622
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
bad
 

6623
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,189
bad
and unfortunately i think to have great

6624
01:51:57,189 --> 01:51:57,199
and unfortunately i think to have great
 

6625
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,950
and unfortunately i think to have great
outcomes you actually do need to work at

6626
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
outcomes you actually do need to work at
 

6627
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,790
outcomes you actually do need to work at
like three standard deviations above the

6628
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:00,800
like three standard deviations above the
 

6629
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,669
like three standard deviations above the
mean

6630
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
mean
 

6631
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,030
mean
but there's nothing saying that people

6632
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,040
but there's nothing saying that people
 

6633
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,189
but there's nothing saying that people
have to go for this the thing is but

6634
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
have to go for this the thing is but
 

6635
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,189
have to go for this the thing is but
what i would argue this is my personal

6636
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
what i would argue this is my personal
 

6637
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,270
what i would argue this is my personal
opinion is nobody has to do anything

6638
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:09,280
opinion is nobody has to do anything
 

6639
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,790
opinion is nobody has to do anything
first of all exactly they certainly

6640
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
first of all exactly they certainly
 

6641
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,510
first of all exactly they certainly
don't have to work hard exactly but

6642
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
don't have to work hard exactly but
 

6643
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,189
don't have to work hard exactly but
i think

6644
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:15,199
i think
 

6645
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:19,189
i think
hard work in a company should be admired

6646
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:19,199
hard work in a company should be admired
 

6647
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:22,229
hard work in a company should be admired

you shouldn't feel good about yourself

6652
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
you shouldn't feel good about yourself
 

6653
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,189
you shouldn't feel good about yourself
for not working hard

6654
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
for not working hard
 

6655

like
so for example i don't have to work out

6658
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:32,320

i hate running
 

6663
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,990
i hate running
but like i certainly don't feel good if

6664
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:38,000
but like i certainly don't feel good if
 

6665
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,750
but like i certainly don't feel good if
i don't run because i know for my health

ask this kind of silly question
 

6683
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,990
ask this kind of silly question
uh just just to get a sense of people

6684
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,000
uh just just to get a sense of people
 

6685

one that like if i'm hiring and so on i
 

6687
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,790
one that like if i'm hiring and so on i
just ask if they uh think it's better to

6688
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
just ask if they uh think it's better to
 

6689
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,950
just ask if they uh think it's better to
work hard or work smart

6690
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:02,960
work hard or work smart

work hard or work smart
it was helpful for me to

01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:04,800
it was helpful for me to
 

6693
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,189
it was helpful for me to
get a sense of people from that

6694

get a sense of people from that
 

6695
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,589
get a sense of people from that
because you think like the right both

6696
01:53:09,589 --> 01:53:09,599
because you think like the right both
 

6697
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:11,189
because you think like the right both
was that the answer was the answer's

6698
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:11,199
was that the answer was the answer's
 

6699
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:13,750
was that the answer was the answer's
both i usually try not to give them that

6700
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:13,760
both i usually try not to give them that
 

6701
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,070
both i usually try not to give them that
but sometimes i'll say both if that's an

6702
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,080
but sometimes i'll say both if that's an
 

6703
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,589
but sometimes i'll say both if that's an
option but a lot of people kind of

6704
01:53:19,589 --> 01:53:19,599
option but a lot of people kind of
 

6705
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,910
option but a lot of people kind of
a surprising number will say work smart

6706
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:21,920
a surprising number will say work smart
 

6707
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,390
a surprising number will say work smart
and they're usually people who don't

6708
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:24,400
and they're usually people who don't
 

6709
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,629
and they're usually people who don't
know how to work smart

know how to work smart
 

6711
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,709
know how to work smart
and uh they're they're literally just

and uh they're they're literally just
 

6713
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:29,669
and uh they're they're literally just
lazy

lazy
 

6715
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:31,510

better to work smart it means
you think you know what it means to work

6730
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:44,560
you think you know what it means to work
 

6731
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,709
you think you know what it means to work
smart at this early stage

6732
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
smart at this early stage
 

6733
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:49,750
smart at this early stage
to me people that say work hard or both

6734
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
to me people that say work hard or both
 

6735
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,589
to me people that say work hard or both
they have the humility to understand

6736
01:53:51,589 --> 01:53:51,599
they have the humility to understand
 

6737
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,990
they have the humility to understand
like i'm going to have to work my ass

6738
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,000
like i'm going to have to work my ass
 

6739
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,830
like i'm going to have to work my ass
off because i'm too dumb to know how to

6740
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
off because i'm too dumb to know how to
 

6741
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,430
off because i'm too dumb to know how to
work smart and people who are

6742
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,440
work smart and people who are
 

6743
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,750
work smart and people who are
self-critical in this way in some small

6744
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
self-critical in this way in some small
 

6745
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,350
self-critical in this way in some small
amount you have to have some confidence

6746
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:01,360
amount you have to have some confidence
 

6747
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,390
amount you have to have some confidence
but

6748
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,400
but
 

6749
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,229
but
you have if you have humility that means

6750
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:04,239
you have if you have humility that means
 

6751
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:05,830
you have if you have humility that means
you're going to actually eventually

6752
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:05,840
you're going to actually eventually
 

6753
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,589
you're going to actually eventually
figure out what it means to work smart

6754
01:54:07,589 --> 01:54:07,599
figure out what it means to work smart
 

6755
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,669
figure out what it means to work smart
and then to actually be successful you

6756
01:54:09,669 --> 01:54:09,679
and then to actually be successful you
 

6757
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,109
and then to actually be successful you
should do both

6758
01:54:11,109 --> 01:54:11,119
should do both
 

6759
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:11,910
should do both
so

6760
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:11,920
so
 

6761
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,910
so
i have a very particular take on this

6762
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:13,920
i have a very particular take on this
 

6763
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,350
i have a very particular take on this
which is that um

6764
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:17,360

 

6765
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,990

no one's forcing you to do anything all

6766
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,000
no one's forcing you to do anything all
 

6767
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,149
no one's forcing you to do anything all
choices have consequences

6768
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:22,159
choices have consequences
 

6769
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:23,030
choices have consequences
so

6770
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
so
 

6771
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,709
so
if you major in

6772
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
if you major in
 

6773
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:27,669
if you major in
i don't know theoretical literature i i

6774
01:54:27,669 --> 01:54:27,679
i don't know theoretical literature i i
 

6775
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:28,870
i don't know theoretical literature i i
don't even know if that's a major i'm

6776
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
don't even know if that's a major i'm
 

6777
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,390
don't even know if that's a major i'm
just making something up as opposed to

6778
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:30,400
just making something up as opposed to
 

6779
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,790
just making something up as opposed to
regular literature like if but like

6780
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:32,800
regular literature like if but like
 

6781
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,870
regular literature like if but like
literature yeah think about like like

6782
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
literature yeah think about like like
 

6783
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,950
literature yeah think about like like
theoretical yeah

6784
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:36,960
theoretical yeah
 

6785
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,510
theoretical yeah
spanish lit from the 14th century like

6786
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:39,520
spanish lit from the 14th century like
 

6787
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,589
spanish lit from the 14th century like
just make make up your esoteric thing

6788
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:41,599
just make make up your esoteric thing
 

6789
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,589
just make make up your esoteric thing
and then the number of people i went to

6790
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:43,599
and then the number of people i went to
 

6791
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:44,950
and then the number of people i went to
stanford with who get out in the world

6792

6795
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:50,229
are like wait what i can't find a job
like no one wants a theoretical like

6796
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:50,239
like no one wants a theoretical like
 

6797
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:51,589
like no one wants a theoretical like
there are plenty of counter examples of

6798
01:54:51,589 --> 01:54:51,599
there are plenty of counter examples of
 

6799
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,189
there are plenty of counter examples of
people have majored in esoteric things

6800
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
people have majored in esoteric things
 

6801
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:54,870
people have majored in esoteric things
and gone on to be very successful so i

6802
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:54,880
and gone on to be very successful so i
 

6803
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,149
and gone on to be very successful so i
just want to be clear it's not about the

6804
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
just want to be clear it's not about the
 

6805
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:57,430
just want to be clear it's not about the
major but

6806
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:57,440
major but
 

6807
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,030
major but
every choice you make

6808
01:54:59,030 --> 01:54:59,040
every choice you make
 

6809
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,510
every choice you make
whether it's to have kids like

6810
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:01,520
whether it's to have kids like
 

6811
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,669
whether it's to have kids like
i love my children it's so awesome to

6816
01:55:08,229 --> 01:55:08,239
really hard and also have kids it's
 

6817
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,790
really hard and also have kids it's
really hard and there's a reason why

6818
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
really hard and there's a reason why
 

6819
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,790
really hard and there's a reason why
certain very successful people like

6820
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:12,800
certain very successful people like

6823
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,390
don't have are not successful but people
who run very very large companies or

6824
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,400
who run very very large companies or
 

6825
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,470
who run very very large companies or
startups have chosen not to have kids

6826
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:18,480
startups have chosen not to have kids
 

6827
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,990
startups have chosen not to have kids
for a while or chosen not to like

6828
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:20,000
for a while or chosen not to like
 

6829
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,510
for a while or chosen not to like
prioritize them

6830
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:21,520
prioritize them
 

6831
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,350
prioritize them
everything's a choice and like i choose

6832
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:23,360
everything's a choice and like i choose
 

6833
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,510
everything's a choice and like i choose
to prioritize my children because like i

6834
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:25,520
to prioritize my children because like i
 

6835
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,669
to prioritize my children because like i
want to do that right

6836
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
want to do that right
 

6837
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,390
want to do that right
so everything's a choice

6838
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
so everything's a choice
 

6839
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,950
so everything's a choice
now once you've made that choice

6840
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:32,960
now once you've made that choice
 

6841
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,510
now once you've made that choice
i think it's important that the contract

6842
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,520
i think it's important that the contract
 

6843
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,270
i think it's important that the contract
is clear which is to say let's imagine

6844
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,280
is clear which is to say let's imagine
 

6845
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,629
is clear which is to say let's imagine

you were joining a new startup
 

6847
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,629
you were joining a new startup
it's important that that startup

6848
01:55:42,629 --> 01:55:42,639
it's important that that startup
 

6849
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,390
it's important that that startup
communicate that like the expectation is

6850
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:44,400
communicate that like the expectation is
 

6851
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,750
communicate that like the expectation is
like we're all working really really

6852
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
like we're all working really really
 

6853
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,270
like we're all working really really
hard right now you don't have to join

6854
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,280
hard right now you don't have to join
 

6855
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,629
hard right now you don't have to join
the startup

6856
01:55:48,629 --> 01:55:48,639
the startup
 

6857

01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,400
your position right
 

6879
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,750
your position right
um

6880
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:09,760
um
 

6881
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,070
um
that to me is wacko and that's actually

6882
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
that to me is wacko and that's actually
 

6883
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,669
that to me is wacko and that's actually
the world that it feels like we live in

6884
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
the world that it feels like we live in
 

6885
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,149
the world that it feels like we live in
in tech sometimes where people both want

6886
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
in tech sometimes where people both want
 

6887
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,589
in tech sometimes where people both want
to work for the yankees because it pays

6888
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
to work for the yankees because it pays
 

6889
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,430
to work for the yankees because it pays
a lot but like don't actually want to

6890
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
a lot but like don't actually want to
 

6891
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,030
a lot but like don't actually want to
work that hard

6892
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:21,040
work that hard
 

6893
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,669
work that hard
that i don't fully understand because if

6894
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
that i don't fully understand because if
 

6895
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:25,910
that i don't fully understand because if
you sign up for some of these things

6896
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:25,920
you sign up for some of these things
 

6897
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,510
you sign up for some of these things
just sign up for it but it's okay if you

6898
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:27,520
just sign up for it but it's okay if you
 

6899
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,350
just sign up for it but it's okay if you
don't want to sign up for it there's so

6900
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,360
don't want to sign up for it there's so
 

6901
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,589
don't want to sign up for it there's so
many wonderful careers in this world

01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
many wonderful careers in this world
 

6903
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,750

that don't require 80 hours a week but

6904
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:33,760
that don't require 80 hours a week but
 

6905
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:34,950
that don't require 80 hours a week but
when i read about companies going to

6906
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:34,960
when i read about companies going to
 

6907
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,550
when i read about companies going to
like four day work weeks and stuff i

6908
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
like four day work weeks and stuff i
 

6909
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,030
like four day work weeks and stuff i
just like i chuckle because i can't get

6910
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,040
just like i chuckle because i can't get
 

6911
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,109
just like i chuckle because i can't get
enough done with a seven day week i

6912
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:41,119
enough done with a seven day week i
 

6913
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:42,629
enough done with a seven day week i
don't know how

6914
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
don't know how
 

6915
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,070
don't know how
and people will say oh you're just not

6916
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
and people will say oh you're just not
 

6917
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,990
and people will say oh you're just not
working smart and it's like no i i work

6918
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:46,000
working smart and it's like no i i work
 

6919
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,990
working smart and it's like no i i work
pretty smart i think in general like i

6920
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
pretty smart i think in general like i
 

6921
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,430
pretty smart i think in general like i
would have gotten to this point if i

6922
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
would have gotten to this point if i
 

6923
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,629
would have gotten to this point if i
hadn't like some amount of working smart

6924
01:56:52,629 --> 01:56:52,639
hadn't like some amount of working smart
 

6925
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,310
hadn't like some amount of working smart
and there is balance though so i used to

6926
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:54,320
and there is balance though so i used to
 

6927
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,229
and there is balance though so i used to
be like a pretty big cyclist i don't do

6928
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:56,239
be like a pretty big cyclist i don't do
 

6929
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,149
be like a pretty big cyclist i don't do
it much anymore just because of kids and

6930
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
it much anymore just because of kids and
 

6931
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:01,589
it much anymore just because of kids and
like prioritizing other things right

6932
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
like prioritizing other things right
 

6933
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:02,950
like prioritizing other things right
but one of the most important things to

6934
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
but one of the most important things to
 

6935
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,990
but one of the most important things to
learn as a cyclist is to take a rest day

6936
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,000
learn as a cyclist is to take a rest day
 

6937
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,470
learn as a cyclist is to take a rest day
but to me and to cyclists like resting

6938
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
but to me and to cyclists like resting
 

6939
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,510
but to me and to cyclists like resting
is a function of optimizing for the long

6940
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,520
is a function of optimizing for the long
 

6941
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:12,550
is a function of optimizing for the long
run

6942
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:12,560
run
 

6943
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,470
run
it's not like a thing that you do for

6944
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:14,480
it's not like a thing that you do for
 

6945
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,070
it's not like a thing that you do for
its own merits

6946
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
its own merits
 

6947
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,750
its own merits
it's actually like if you don't rest

6948
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
it's actually like if you don't rest
 

6949
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,950
it's actually like if you don't rest
your muscles don't recover and then

6950
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:18,960
your muscles don't recover and then
 

6951
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,310
your muscles don't recover and then
you're just not as like you're not

6952
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
you're just not as like you're not
 

6953
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,750
you're just not as like you're not
training as efficiently you should

6954
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:21,760
training as efficiently you should
 

6955
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,070
training as efficiently you should
probably the the successful people i've

6956
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:24,080
probably the the successful people i've
 

6957
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,830
probably the the successful people i've
known in terms of athletes they hate

6958
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
known in terms of athletes they hate
 

6959
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,950
known in terms of athletes they hate
rest days

6960
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:26,960
rest days
 

6961
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,310
rest days
but they know they have to do it for the

6962
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
but they know they have to do it for the
 

6963
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,070
but they know they have to do it for the
long term like absolutely they think

6964
01:57:30,070 --> 01:57:30,080
long term like absolutely they think
 

6965
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,990
long term like absolutely they think
their opposition is getting stronger and

6966
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,000
their opposition is getting stronger and
 

6967
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,550
their opposition is getting stronger and
stronger and that's the feeling but you

6968
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
stronger and that's the feeling but you
 

6969
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,229
stronger and that's the feeling but you
know it's the right thing and usually

6970
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
know it's the right thing and usually
 

6971
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:38,310
know it's the right thing and usually
you need a coach to help you yeah

6972
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:38,320
you need a coach to help you yeah
 

6973
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,149
you need a coach to help you yeah
totally so i mean i use this thing

6974
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:40,159
totally so i mean i use this thing
 

6975
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:41,350
totally so i mean i use this thing
called training peaks and it's

6976
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:41,360
called training peaks and it's
 

6977
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,629
called training peaks and it's
interesting because it actually

6978
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
interesting because it actually
 

6979
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,709
interesting because it actually
mathematically shows like where you are

6980
01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
mathematically shows like where you are
 

6981
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:46,390
mathematically shows like where you are
on the curve and all this stuff

6982
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:46,400
on the curve and all this stuff
 

6983
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,550
on the curve and all this stuff
yeah but you have to re like you have to

6984
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,560
yeah but you have to re like you have to
 

6985
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,870
yeah but you have to re like you have to
have that rest but it it's a function of

6986
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
have that rest but it it's a function of
 

6987
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,709
have that rest but it it's a function of
going harder for longer again it's this

6988
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
going harder for longer again it's this
 

6989
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,189
going harder for longer again it's this
reinforcement learning like planning the

6990
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:55,199
reinforcement learning like planning the
 

6991
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:57,109
reinforcement learning like planning the
aggregate and long but a lot of people

6992
01:57:57,109 --> 01:57:57,119
aggregate and long but a lot of people
 

6993
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,030
aggregate and long but a lot of people
will hide behind laziness by saying that

6994
01:57:59,030 --> 01:57:59,040
will hide behind laziness by saying that
 

6995
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,470
will hide behind laziness by saying that
they're trying to optimize for the long

6996
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:00,480
they're trying to optimize for the long
 

6997
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,830
they're trying to optimize for the long
run and they're not they're just not

6998
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:01,840
run and they're not they're just not
 

6999
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,910
run and they're not they're just not
working very hard but again you don't

7000
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:03,920
working very hard but again you don't
 

7001
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,510
working very hard but again you don't
have to sign up for it it's totally cool

7002
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:05,520
have to sign up for it it's totally cool
 

7003
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,430
have to sign up for it it's totally cool
like i don't think less of people for

7004
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:07,440
like i don't think less of people for
 

7005
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,189
like i don't think less of people for
like not working super hard just like

7006
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:09,199
like not working super hard just like
 

7007
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:10,709
like not working super hard just like
don't sign up for things that require

7008
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:10,719
don't sign up for things that require
 

7009
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:12,310
don't sign up for things that require
working super hard and some of that

7010
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:12,320
working super hard and some of that
 

7011
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,390
working super hard and some of that
requires for the leadership to have the

7012
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:14,400
requires for the leadership to have the
 

7013
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,390
requires for the leadership to have the
guts the boldness to communicate

7014
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:16,400
guts the boldness to communicate
 

7015
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,070
guts the boldness to communicate
effectively at the very beginning i mean

7016
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:18,080
effectively at the very beginning i mean
 

7017
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,430
effectively at the very beginning i mean
sometimes i think

7018
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,440
sometimes i think
 

7019
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,109
sometimes i think
most of the problems arise from the fact

7020
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:21,119
most of the problems arise from the fact
 

7021
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:22,149
most of the problems arise from the fact
that the

7022
01:58:22,149 --> 01:58:22,159
that the
 

7023
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,550
that the
leadership is kind of hesitant

7024
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:24,560
leadership is kind of hesitant
 

7025
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:28,470
leadership is kind of hesitant
to to communicate this the socially

7026
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:28,480
to to communicate this the socially
 

7027
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,470
to to communicate this the socially
um difficult

7028
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
um difficult
 

7029
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,629
um difficult
truth of what it takes to be

7030
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
truth of what it takes to be
 

7031
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,950
truth of what it takes to be

02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:37,920
is it just the way of human nature sure
 

7511
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,750
is it just the way of human nature sure
and like the idea that we're gonna find

7512
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
and like the idea that we're gonna find
 

7513
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,510
and like the idea that we're gonna find
a mutually exclusive answer here is

7514
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:41,520
a mutually exclusive answer here is
 

7515
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,350
a mutually exclusive answer here is
crazy there's not one place it's a

7516
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:43,360
crazy there's not one place it's a
 

7517
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,510
crazy there's not one place it's a
combination of a lot of these things

7518
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:45,520
combination of a lot of these things
 

7519
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:47,109
combination of a lot of these things
and then the question is like is it true

7520
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
and then the question is like is it true
 

7521
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:49,270
and then the question is like is it true
at all right like i'm not actually

7522
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:49,280
at all right like i'm not actually
 

7523
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,149
at all right like i'm not actually
saying that's not true or that it's true

saying that's not true or that it's true
 

7525
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:53,109
saying that's not true or that it's true
but

7526
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
but
 

7527
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:55,510
but
there's always more nuance here

7528
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,520
there's always more nuance here
 

7529
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,629
there's always more nuance here

about debugging the why because i don't
 

7631
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:35,430
about debugging the why because i don't
know is it

7632

know is it
 

7633
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,870
know is it
like i don't know this research it was

7634
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:36,880
like i don't know this research it was
 

7635
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:39,589
like i don't know this research it was
written well after i left right like

7636
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
written well after i left right like
 

7637
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,910
written well after i left right like
is it the algorithm is it the explorer

7638
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
is it the algorithm is it the explorer
 

7639
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,069
is it the algorithm is it the explorer
page is it the people you might know

7640
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:44,079
page is it the people you might know
 

7641
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,870
page is it the people you might know
unit connecting you to you know ideas

7642
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:46,880
unit connecting you to you know ideas
 

7643
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,950

that are dangerous like i i really don't

7644
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:48,960
that are dangerous like i i really don't
 

7645

that are dangerous like i i really don't
know yeah um

7646
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
know yeah um
 

7647
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,430
know yeah um
so we'd have to have a much deeper

7648
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:53,440
so we'd have to have a much deeper
 

7649
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,430
so we'd have to have a much deeper
i think dive to understand where the

7650
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:55,440
i think dive to understand where the
 

7651
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,830
i think dive to understand where the
blame lies what's very unpleasant to me

7652

7655
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:02,709
to consider now i don't know if this is
true but to consider the very fact that

7656
02:09:02,709 --> 02:09:02,719
true but to consider the very fact that
 

7657
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:05,589
true but to consider the very fact that
there might be some complicated games

7658
02:09:05,589 --> 02:09:05,599
there might be some complicated games
 

7659
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:07,830
there might be some complicated games
being played here for example you know

like let's put that aside for a second

8008
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
like let's put that aside for a second
 

8009
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:05,750
like let's put that aside for a second
yeah

8010
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:05,760
yeah
 

8011
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,270
yeah
then there are the documents themselves

8012
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:07,280
then there are the documents themselves
 

8013
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,430
then there are the documents themselves
they say what they say

8014
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:09,440
they say what they say
 

8015
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:10,790
they say what they say
to your point

8016
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:10,800
to your point
 

8017
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,229
to your point
a lot of the things that like people

8018
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:12,239
a lot of the things that like people
 

8019
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:13,910
a lot of the things that like people
have been worried about

8020
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:13,920
have been worried about
 

8021
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,669
have been worried about
already in the documents are or they're

8022
02:15:15,669 --> 02:15:15,679
already in the documents are or they're
 

8023
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:18,149
already in the documents are or they're
already been said externally and

8024
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:18,159
already been said externally and
 

8025
02:15:18,159 --> 02:15:19,350

um
i don't know i'm just like i'm i'm

8028
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:21,760
i don't know i'm just like i'm i'm
 

8029
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,510
i don't know i'm just like i'm i'm
thankful that i am focused on new things

8030
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
thankful that i am focused on new things
 

8031
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:25,669
thankful that i am focused on new things
with my life

8032
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
with my life
 

8033
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:27,430
with my life
well let me just say i just think it's a

8034
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,440
well let me just say i just think it's a
 

8035
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,669
well let me just say i just think it's a
really hard problem that probably

8036
02:15:29,669 --> 02:15:29,679
really hard problem that probably
 

8037
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:32,149
really hard problem that probably
facebook and twitter are trying to solve

8038
02:15:32,149 --> 02:15:32,159
facebook and twitter are trying to solve
 

8039
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:33,990
facebook and twitter are trying to solve
i'm actually just fascinated by how hard

8040
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,000
i'm actually just fascinated by how hard
 

8041
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,310
i'm actually just fascinated by how hard
this problem is there are fundamental

8042
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,320
this problem is there are fundamental
 

8043
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:39,030
this problem is there are fundamental
issues at facebook in tone and in an

8044
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
issues at facebook in tone and in an
 

8045
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,669
issues at facebook in tone and in an
approach of how product gets built and

8046
02:15:41,669 --> 02:15:41,679
approach of how product gets built and
 

8047
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:43,750
approach of how product gets built and
the objective functions and

8048
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:43,760
the objective functions and
 

8049
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:44,709
the objective functions and
um

8050
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:44,719
um
 

8051
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:47,109
um
and since people uh uh organizations are

8052
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:47,119
and since people uh uh organizations are
 

8053
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:50,310
and since people uh uh organizations are
not people so yawn and fair right like

8054
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:50,320
not people so yawn and fair right like
 

8055
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,589
not people so yawn and fair right like
there are a lot of really great people

8056
02:15:51,589 --> 02:15:51,599
there are a lot of really great people
 

8057
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,189
there are a lot of really great people
who like literally just want to push

8058
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199
who like literally just want to push
 

8059
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,270
who like literally just want to push
reinforcement learning forward they

8060
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:55,280
reinforcement learning forward they
 

8061
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,430
reinforcement learning forward they
literally just want to teach a robot to

8062
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
literally just want to teach a robot to
 

8063
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:00,229
literally just want to teach a robot to
touch feel lift right like

8064
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
touch feel lift right like
 

8065
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:01,990
touch feel lift right like
they're not thinking about political

8066
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:02,000
they're not thinking about political
 

8067
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,470
they're not thinking about political
misinformation right yeah but there's a

8068
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,480
misinformation right yeah but there's a
 

8069
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,950
misinformation right yeah but there's a
there's a strong connection between what

8070
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:06,960
there's a strong connection between what
 

8071
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,270
there's a strong connection between what
funds that research and an enormously

8072
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,280
funds that research and an enormously
 

8073
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:11,430
funds that research and an enormously
profitable machine

8074
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:11,440
profitable machine
 

8075
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:14,149
profitable machine
uh that has trade-offs and

8076
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:14,159
uh that has trade-offs and
 

8077
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:16,790
uh that has trade-offs and
uh one cannot

8078
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:16,800
uh one cannot
 

8079
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,629
uh one cannot
one cannot separate the two you are not

8080
02:16:18,629 --> 02:16:18,639
one cannot separate the two you are not
 

8081
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:21,350
one cannot separate the two you are not
completely separate from the system

8082
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
completely separate from the system
 

8083
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:22,550
completely separate from the system
so

8084
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:22,560
so
 

8085
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,390
so
i agree it can feel really frustrating

8086
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:24,400
i agree it can feel really frustrating
 

8087
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:26,629
i agree it can feel really frustrating
to feel if you're internally internal

8088
02:16:26,629 --> 02:16:26,639
to feel if you're internally internal
 

8089
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:28,149
to feel if you're internally internal
there that you're working on something

8090
02:16:28,149 --> 02:16:28,159
there that you're working on something
 

8091
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:30,069
there that you're working on something
completely unrelated and you feel like

8092
02:16:30,069 --> 02:16:30,079
completely unrelated and you feel like
 

8093
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:32,629
completely unrelated and you feel like
your group's good i can understand that

8094
02:16:32,629 --> 02:16:32,639
your group's good i can understand that
 

8095
02:16:32,639 --> 02:16:34,309
your group's good i can understand that
but there's some responsibility still

8096
02:16:34,309 --> 02:16:34,319
but there's some responsibility still
 

8097
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:35,429
but there's some responsibility still
you have to acknowledge it's like the

8098
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
you have to acknowledge it's like the
 

8099
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,030
you have to acknowledge it's like the
ray dalio thing you have to look in the

8100
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
ray dalio thing you have to look in the
 

8101
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:38,870
ray dalio thing you have to look in the
mirror and see if there's problems and

8102
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:38,880
mirror and see if there's problems and
 

8103
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:43,509
mirror and see if there's problems and
you have to fix those problems

8104
02:16:43,509 --> 02:16:43,519

 

8105
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:44,629

you mentioned machine learning

8106
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:44,639
you mentioned machine learning
 

8107
02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:47,429
you mentioned machine learning
reinforcement quite a bit i mean to me

8108
02:16:47,429 --> 02:16:47,439
reinforcement quite a bit i mean to me
 

8109
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:49,190
reinforcement quite a bit i mean to me
social networks is one of the exciting

5 10 20 years do you think we're going
 

8123
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:02,230
5 10 20 years do you think we're going
to see impact of machine learning

8124
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
to see impact of machine learning
 

8125
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:04,790
to see impact of machine learning
when you try on the philosophical level

8126
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:04,800
when you try on the philosophical level
 

8127
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:07,110
when you try on the philosophical level
on a technical level what do you think

8128
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:07,120
on a technical level what do you think
 

8129
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,509
on a technical level what do you think
or or within social networks themselves

8130
02:17:11,509 --> 02:17:11,519

 

8131
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:15,190

well i think the obvious answers are

8132
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:15,200
well i think the obvious answers are
 

8133
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,669
well i think the obvious answers are
climate change right like think about

8134
02:17:17,669 --> 02:17:17,679
climate change right like think about
 

8135
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:19,669
climate change right like think about
how much fuel

8136
02:17:19,669 --> 02:17:19,679
how much fuel
 

8137
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,309
how much fuel
or or just waste there is in energy

8138
02:17:22,309 --> 02:17:22,319
or or just waste there is in energy

today because

8142
02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:25,280
today because
 

8143
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,389
today because
we don't plan accordingly because we

8144
02:17:28,389 --> 02:17:28,399
we don't plan accordingly because we
 

8145
02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:30,870
we don't plan accordingly because we
take the least efficient route or the

8146
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:30,880
take the least efficient route or the
 

8147
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,629
take the least efficient route or the
logistics and stuff the supply chain all

8148

logistics and stuff the supply chain all
 

8149
02:17:32,639 --> 02:17:34,709

that kind of stuff yeah i mean

8150
02:17:34,709 --> 02:17:34,719
that kind of stuff yeah i mean
 

8151
02:17:34,719 --> 02:17:36,230
that kind of stuff yeah i mean
listen if we're going to fight climate

8152
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,240
listen if we're going to fight climate
 

8153
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,270
listen if we're going to fight climate
change like

8154
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:37,280
change like
 

8155
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,549
change like
one really way

8156
02:17:38,549 --> 02:17:38,559
one really way
 

8157
02:17:38,559 --> 02:17:40,389
one really way
one awesome way to do it is figure out

8158
02:17:40,389 --> 02:17:40,399
one awesome way to do it is figure out
 

8159
02:17:40,399 --> 02:17:42,469
one awesome way to do it is figure out
how to optimize how we operate as a

8160
02:17:42,469 --> 02:17:42,479
how to optimize how we operate as a
 

8161
02:17:42,479 --> 02:17:44,230
how to optimize how we operate as a
species and

8162
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,240
species and
 

8163
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:46,549
species and
and minimize the amount of energy we

8164
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:46,559
and minimize the amount of energy we
 

8165
02:17:46,559 --> 02:17:49,190
and minimize the amount of energy we
consume to maximize whatever economic

8166
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,200
consume to maximize whatever economic
 

8167
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,870
consume to maximize whatever economic
impact we want to have

8168
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:50,880
impact we want to have
 

8169
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:52,389
impact we want to have
because right now those two are very

8170
02:17:52,389 --> 02:17:52,399
because right now those two are very
 

8171
02:17:52,399 --> 02:17:54,790
because right now those two are very
much tied together and

8172
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800
much tied together and
 

8173
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,389
much tied together and
i don't believe that has to be the case

8174
02:17:56,389 --> 02:17:56,399
i don't believe that has to be the case
 

8175
02:17:56,399 --> 02:17:57,990
i don't believe that has to be the case
there's this really interesting you've

8176
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:58,000
there's this really interesting you've
 

8177
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,830
there's this really interesting you've
read it um

8178
02:17:59,830 --> 02:17:59,840
read it um
 

8179
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,030
read it um
for people who are listening there's

8180
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:01,040
for people who are listening there's
 

8181
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,709
for people who are listening there's
this really interesting paper on

8182
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:02,719
this really interesting paper on
 

8183
02:18:02,719 --> 02:18:04,549
this really interesting paper on
reinforcement learning and energy

8184
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
reinforcement learning and energy
 

8185
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:06,230
reinforcement learning and energy
consumption inside buildings it's like

8186
02:18:06,230 --> 02:18:06,240
consumption inside buildings it's like
 

8187
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:08,230
consumption inside buildings it's like
one of the seminal ones right um but

8188
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:08,240
one of the seminal ones right um but
 

8189
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,309
one of the seminal ones right um but
imagine that at massive scale that's

8190
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
imagine that at massive scale that's
 

8191
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:13,190
imagine that at massive scale that's
super interesting i mean they've done

8192
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,200
super interesting i mean they've done
 

8193
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,509
super interesting i mean they've done
like resource planning for servers for

8194
02:18:15,509 --> 02:18:15,519
like resource planning for servers for
 

8195
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:17,750
like resource planning for servers for
peak load using reinforcement learning i

8196
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:17,760
peak load using reinforcement learning i
 

8197
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:18,870
peak load using reinforcement learning i
don't know if that was at google or

8198
02:18:18,870 --> 02:18:18,880
don't know if that was at google or
 

8199
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:20,870
don't know if that was at google or
somewhere else but like okay great you

8200
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:20,880
somewhere else but like okay great you
 

8201
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:22,389
somewhere else but like okay great you
do it for servers but what if you could

8202
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:22,399
do it for servers but what if you could
 

8203
02:18:22,399 --> 02:18:24,389
do it for servers but what if you could
do it for just capacity and general

8204
02:18:24,389 --> 02:18:24,399
do it for just capacity and general
 

8205
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:26,709
do it for just capacity and general
energy capacity for cities and planning

8206
02:18:26,709 --> 02:18:26,719
energy capacity for cities and planning
 

8207
02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:28,469
energy capacity for cities and planning
for traffic and of course there's all

8208
02:18:28,469 --> 02:18:28,479
for traffic and of course there's all
 

8209
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:32,150
for traffic and of course there's all
the um self-driving cars and

8210
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:32,160
the um self-driving cars and
 

8211
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:33,190
the um self-driving cars and
i don't know like i'm not going to

8212
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,200
i don't know like i'm not going to
 

8213
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:37,589
i don't know like i'm not going to
pontificate like crazy ideas

8214
02:18:37,589 --> 02:18:37,599
pontificate like crazy ideas
 

8215
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:39,589
pontificate like crazy ideas
using reinforcement learning or machine

8216
02:18:39,589 --> 02:18:39,599
using reinforcement learning or machine
 

8217
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:41,270
using reinforcement learning or machine
learning it's just so clear to me that

8218
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:41,280
learning it's just so clear to me that
 

8219
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,750
learning it's just so clear to me that
humans don't think quickly enough so

8220
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:43,760
humans don't think quickly enough so
 

8221
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,270
humans don't think quickly enough so
it's interesting to think about machine

8222
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:45,280
it's interesting to think about machine
 

8223
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:46,469
it's interesting to think about machine
learning

8224
02:18:46,469 --> 02:18:46,479
learning
 

8225
02:18:46,479 --> 02:18:48,870
learning
helping a little bit

8226
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:48,880
helping a little bit
 

8227
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:51,110
helping a little bit
at scale so a little bit to a large

8228
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:51,120
at scale so a little bit to a large
 

8229
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:53,270
at scale so a little bit to a large
number of people that has a huge impact

8230
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:53,280
number of people that has a huge impact
 

8231
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,349
number of people that has a huge impact
so if you optimize

8232
02:18:55,349 --> 02:18:55,359
so if you optimize
 

8233
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:57,110
so if you optimize
say google maps something like that

8234
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,120
say google maps something like that
 

8235
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:59,190
say google maps something like that
trajectory planning or would it map

8236
02:18:59,190 --> 02:18:59,200
trajectory planning or would it map
 

8237
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,469
trajectory planning or would it map
quest first

8238
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
quest first
 

8239
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:02,629
quest first
uh yeah getting here i looked and it was

8240
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
uh yeah getting here i looked and it was
 

8241
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,150
uh yeah getting here i looked and it was
like here's the most energy efficient

8242
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,160
like here's the most energy efficient
 

8243
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,669
like here's the most energy efficient
route i was like i'm gonna be late i

8244
02:19:05,669 --> 02:19:05,679
route i was like i'm gonna be late i
 

8245
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:07,270
route i was like i'm gonna be late i
need to take the fastest route as

8246
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:07,280
need to take the fastest route as
 

8247
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:10,469
need to take the fastest route as
opposed to unrolling the map yeah yeah

8248
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:10,479
opposed to unrolling the map yeah yeah
 

8249
02:19:10,479 --> 02:19:12,309
opposed to unrolling the map yeah yeah
like and that's going to be very

8250
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:12,319
like and that's going to be very
 

8251
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:13,429
like and that's going to be very
inefficient no matter what i was

8252
02:19:13,429 --> 02:19:13,439
inefficient no matter what i was
 

8253
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:15,270
inefficient no matter what i was
definitely the other day like part of

8254
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:15,280
definitely the other day like part of
 

8255
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:18,469
definitely the other day like part of
the epsilon of epsilon greedy with waze

8256
02:19:18,469 --> 02:19:18,479
the epsilon of epsilon greedy with waze
 

8257
02:19:18,479 --> 02:19:21,190
the epsilon of epsilon greedy with waze
where like i was sent on like a weird

8258
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:21,200
where like i was sent on like a weird
 

8259
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,950
where like i was sent on like a weird
route that i could tell they're like we

8260
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960
route that i could tell they're like we
 

8261
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,509
route that i could tell they're like we
just need to collect data of this road

8262
02:19:25,509 --> 02:19:25,519
just need to collect data of this road
 

8263
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:27,910
just need to collect data of this road
like we just kevin's the ant they sent

8264
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:27,920
like we just kevin's the ant they sent
 

8265
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,669
like we just kevin's the ant they sent
out kevin's definitely gonna be the

8266
02:19:29,669 --> 02:19:29,679
out kevin's definitely gonna be the
 

8267
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:32,230
out kevin's definitely gonna be the
guinea pig and great now we have did you

8268
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:32,240
guinea pig and great now we have did you
 

8269
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:34,790
guinea pig and great now we have did you
at least feel pride oh going through it

8270
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:34,800
at least feel pride oh going through it
 

8271
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,389
at least feel pride oh going through it
i was like oh this is fun like now they

8272
02:19:36,389 --> 02:19:36,399
i was like oh this is fun like now they
 

8273
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:38,309
i was like oh this is fun like now they
get data about this weird shortcut and

8274
02:19:38,309 --> 02:19:38,319
get data about this weird shortcut and
 

8275
02:19:38,319 --> 02:19:39,669
get data about this weird shortcut and
actually i hit all the green lights and

8276
02:19:39,669 --> 02:19:39,679
actually i hit all the green lights and
 

8277
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:41,990
actually i hit all the green lights and
it worked and i'm like this is a problem

8278
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,000
it worked and i'm like this is a problem
 

8279
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,750
it worked and i'm like this is a problem
data bad data they're just going to

8280
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:43,760
data bad data they're just going to
 

8281
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,150
data bad data they're just going to
imagine i could see you slowing down and

8282
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:46,160
imagine i could see you slowing down and
 

8283
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,669
imagine i could see you slowing down and
stopping in a green light just to give

8284
02:19:47,669 --> 02:19:47,679
stopping in a green light just to give
 

8285
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:49,670
stopping in a green light just to give
them the right kind of data yeah

8286
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:49,680
them the right kind of data yeah
 

8287
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,110
them the right kind of data yeah
um but to answer your question like i

8288
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:51,120
um but to answer your question like i
 

8289
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,270
um but to answer your question like i
feel like that was fairly unsatisfying

8290
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
feel like that was fairly unsatisfying
 

8291
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,590
feel like that was fairly unsatisfying
and it's easy to say climate change but

8292
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:55,600
and it's easy to say climate change but
 

8293
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:57,670
and it's easy to say climate change but
what i would say is

8294
02:19:57,670 --> 02:19:57,680
what i would say is
 

8295
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,590
what i would say is
at instagram everything we applied

8296
02:19:59,590 --> 02:19:59,600
at instagram everything we applied
 

8297
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,630
at instagram everything we applied
machining learning to uh got better for

understand it as an executive and i

8304
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:08,240
understand it as an executive and i
 

8305
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:10,469
understand it as an executive and i
think that's actually one of the issues

8306
02:20:10,469 --> 02:20:10,479
think that's actually one of the issues
 

8307
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:11,750
think that's actually one of the issues
that uh

8308
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:11,760
that uh
 

8309
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,110
that uh
and when i say understand i mean the

8310
02:20:13,110 --> 02:20:13,120
and when i say understand i mean the
 

8311
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,790
and when i say understand i mean the
mathematics of it like i understand what

8312
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:14,800
mathematics of it like i understand what
 

8313
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,870
mathematics of it like i understand what
it does i understand that it helps

8314
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
it does i understand that it helps
 

8315
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:20,070
it does i understand that it helps
but um there are a lot of executives now

8316
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:20,080
but um there are a lot of executives now
 

8317
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:20,950
but um there are a lot of executives now
that

8318
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:20,960
that
 

8319
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,550
that
talk about it and the way that they talk

8320
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:22,560
talk about it and the way that they talk
 

8321
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:24,150
talk about it and the way that they talk
about the internet or they talked about

8322
02:20:24,150 --> 02:20:24,160
about the internet or they talked about
 

8323
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:25,590
about the internet or they talked about
the internet like 10 years ago they're

8324
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:25,600
the internet like 10 years ago they're
 

8325
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,110
the internet like 10 years ago they're
like we're gonna build mobile and you're

8326
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:27,120
like we're gonna build mobile and you're
 

8327
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:28,070
like we're gonna build mobile and you're
like what does that mean they're like

8328
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
like what does that mean they're like
 

8329
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:29,429
like what does that mean they're like
we're just gonna do mobile and you're

8330
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:29,439
we're just gonna do mobile and you're
 

8331
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:30,710
we're just gonna do mobile and you're
like okay

8332
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
like okay
 

8333
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,270
like okay
um so my sense is the next generation of

8334
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,280
um so my sense is the next generation of
 

8335
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,510
um so my sense is the next generation of
leaders will have grown up having had

8336
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:35,520
leaders will have grown up having had
 

8337
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,950
leaders will have grown up having had
classes

8338
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:36,960
classes
 

8339
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:38,710
classes
in reinforcement learning supervised

8340
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:38,720
in reinforcement learning supervised
 

8341
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:40,070
in reinforcement learning supervised
learning whatever

8342
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:40,080
learning whatever
 

8343
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:42,309
learning whatever
and they will be able to thoughtfully

8344
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:42,319
and they will be able to thoughtfully
 

8345
02:20:42,319 --> 02:20:43,590
and they will be able to thoughtfully
apply it to their companies and the

8346
02:20:43,590 --> 02:20:43,600
apply it to their companies and the
 

8347
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:46,150
apply it to their companies and the
places it it is needed most

8348
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:46,160
places it it is needed most
 

8349
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:47,990
places it it is needed most
and that's really cool because i mean

8350
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:48,000
and that's really cool because i mean
 

8351
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,270
and that's really cool because i mean
talk about efficiency gains

8352
02:20:51,270 --> 02:20:51,280
talk about efficiency gains
 

8353
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,630
talk about efficiency gains
i it's

8354
02:20:52,630 --> 02:20:52,640
i it's
 

8355
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,150
i it's
that that's what excites me the most

8356
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:54,160
that that's what excites me the most
 

8357
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:55,830
that that's what excites me the most
about it yeah so there's it's

8358
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:55,840
about it yeah so there's it's
 

8359
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,990
about it yeah so there's it's
interesting just to get a fundamental

8360
02:20:57,990 --> 02:20:58,000
interesting just to get a fundamental
 

8361
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,429
interesting just to get a fundamental
first principles understanding of

8362
02:20:59,429 --> 02:20:59,439
first principles understanding of
 

8363
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:01,750
first principles understanding of
certain concepts of machine learning so

8364
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:01,760
certain concepts of machine learning so
 

8365
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:03,750
certain concepts of machine learning so
supervised learning from an executive

8366
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:03,760
supervised learning from an executive
 

8367
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:05,910
supervised learning from an executive
perspective supervised learning you have

8368
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:05,920
perspective supervised learning you have
 

8369
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,590
perspective supervised learning you have
to have a lot of humans label a lot of

8370
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:07,600
to have a lot of humans label a lot of
 

8371
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:09,990
to have a lot of humans label a lot of
data so the question there is okay can

8372
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:10,000
data so the question there is okay can
 

8373
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,190
data so the question there is okay can
we gather

8374
02:21:11,190 --> 02:21:11,200
we gather
 

8375
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,710
we gather
a large amount of data that can be

8376
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:12,720
a large amount of data that can be
 

8377
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,230
a large amount of data that can be
labeled well

8378
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:14,240
labeled well
 

8379
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:16,070
labeled well
and that's the question tesla asks like

8380
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:16,080
and that's the question tesla asks like
 

8381
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,870
and that's the question tesla asks like
can we create a data engine that keeps

8382
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:18,880
can we create a data engine that keeps
 

8383
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,070
can we create a data engine that keeps
um

8384
02:21:20,070 --> 02:21:20,080
um
 

8385
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:21,590
um
sending an imperfect machine learning

8386
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:21,600
sending an imperfect machine learning
 

8387
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:23,830
sending an imperfect machine learning
system out there whenever it fails it

8388
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:23,840
system out there whenever it fails it
 

8389
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:26,230
system out there whenever it fails it
gives us data back we label it by human

8390
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:26,240
gives us data back we label it by human
 

8391
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:27,910
gives us data back we label it by human
and we send it back and forth so this

8392
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:27,920
and we send it back and forth so this
 

8393
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,990
and we send it back and forth so this
way then there is uh yamaha coons

8394
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,000
way then there is uh yamaha coons
 

8395
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,510
way then there is uh yamaha coons
excited about this self-supervised

8396
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
excited about this self-supervised
 

8397
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,510
excited about this self-supervised
learning where

8398
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:33,520
learning where
 

8399
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:36,150
learning where
you do much less human labeling and

8400
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:36,160
you do much less human labeling and
 

8401
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:38,389
you do much less human labeling and
there's some kind of mechanism for the

8402
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:38,399
there's some kind of mechanism for the
 

8403
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:41,030
there's some kind of mechanism for the
system to learn it by itself on the on

8404
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:41,040
system to learn it by itself on the on
 

8405
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,030
system to learn it by itself on the on
the human generated data and then

8406
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:43,040
the human generated data and then
 

8407
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,870
the human generated data and then
there's the reinforcement learning which

8408
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:44,880
there's the reinforcement learning which
 

8409
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,389
there's the reinforcement learning which
is like

8410
02:21:46,389 --> 02:21:46,399
is like
 

8411
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:48,710
is like
basically allowing it's it's applying

8412
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:48,720
basically allowing it's it's applying
 

8413
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:52,790
basically allowing it's it's applying
the alpha zero uh technology that uh

8414
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:52,800
the alpha zero uh technology that uh
 

8415
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,389
the alpha zero uh technology that uh
allowed through self-play

8416
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:54,399
allowed through self-play
 

8417
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:57,190
allowed through self-play
to learn how to solve the game of go and

8418
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:57,200
to learn how to solve the game of go and
 

8419
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:57,990
to learn how to solve the game of go and
and

it can you formulate the problem you're

8426
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,240
it can you formulate the problem you're
 

8427
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:06,070
it can you formulate the problem you're
trying to solve in a way that's amenable

8428
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:06,080
trying to solve in a way that's amenable
 

8429
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:08,070
trying to solve in a way that's amenable
to reinforcement learning and can you

8430
02:22:08,070 --> 02:22:08,080
to reinforcement learning and can you
 

8431
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:09,750
to reinforcement learning and can you
get the right kind of signal at scale

8432
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:09,760
get the right kind of signal at scale
 

8433
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,750
get the right kind of signal at scale
because you need a lot a lot of signal

8434
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:11,760
because you need a lot a lot of signal
 

8435
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,270
because you need a lot a lot of signal
and that that's that's kind of

8436
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:13,280
and that that's that's kind of
 

8437
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:15,590
and that that's that's kind of
fascinating to see which part of a

8438
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:15,600
fascinating to see which part of a
 

8439
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:17,750
fascinating to see which part of a
social network can you convert into a

8440
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
social network can you convert into a
 

8441
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:19,510
social network can you convert into a
reinforcement learning problem the

8442
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,520
reinforcement learning problem the
 

8443
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,429
reinforcement learning problem the
fascinating thing about reinforcement

8444
02:22:21,429 --> 02:22:21,439
fascinating thing about reinforcement
 

8445
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:23,510
fascinating thing about reinforcement
learning i think

8446
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:23,520
learning i think
 

8447
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:27,030
learning i think
is that we now have learned to apply

8448
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:27,040
is that we now have learned to apply
 

8449
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,990
is that we now have learned to apply
uh neural networks to guess

8450
02:22:29,990 --> 02:22:30,000
uh neural networks to guess
 

8451
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,270
uh neural networks to guess
uh

8452
02:22:31,270 --> 02:22:31,280
uh
 

8453
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:34,150
uh
you know q func like the q function

8454
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
you know q func like the q function
 

8455
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,389
you know q func like the q function
basically the values for any state in

8456
02:22:36,389 --> 02:22:36,399
basically the values for any state in
 

8457
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:37,830
basically the values for any state in
action

8458
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:37,840
action
 

8459
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,510
action
and that is fascinating because we used

8460
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:39,520
and that is fascinating because we used
 

8461
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:41,190
and that is fascinating because we used
to just like i don't know have like a

8462
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:41,200
to just like i don't know have like a
 

8463
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:42,710
to just like i don't know have like a
linear regression like hope it worked

8464
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:42,720
linear regression like hope it worked
 

8465
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,190
linear regression like hope it worked
and that was the fanciest version of it

8466
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,200
and that was the fanciest version of it
 

8467
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:46,630
and that was the fanciest version of it
but now you look at it i'm like trying

8468

but now you look at it i'm like trying
 

8469
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:48,070
but now you look at it i'm like trying
to learn this stuff and i look at it i'm

02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,160
like there are like 17 different
 

8473
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:51,990
like there are like 17 different
acronyms of different ways you can try

8474
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:52,000
acronyms of different ways you can try
 

8475
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,710
acronyms of different ways you can try
to apply this no one quite agrees like

8476
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:54,720
to apply this no one quite agrees like
 

8477
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,550
to apply this no one quite agrees like
what's the best generally if you're

8478
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:56,560
what's the best generally if you're
 

8479
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,710
what's the best generally if you're
trying to like build a neural network

8480
02:22:58,710 --> 02:22:58,720
trying to like build a neural network
 

8481
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:00,630
trying to like build a neural network
they're pretty well-trodden ways of

8482
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:00,640
they're pretty well-trodden ways of
 

8483
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:01,910
they're pretty well-trodden ways of
doing that

8484
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:01,920
doing that
 

8485
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:05,270
doing that
you use atom you use relu you use like

8486
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
you use atom you use relu you use like
 

8487
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,349
you use atom you use relu you use like
there's just like general good ideas and

8488
02:23:07,349 --> 02:23:07,359
there's just like general good ideas and
 

8489
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:09,190
there's just like general good ideas and
in in reinforcement learning i feel like

8490
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:09,200
in in reinforcement learning i feel like
 

8491
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:13,510
in in reinforcement learning i feel like
the consensus is like it totally depends

8492
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:13,520
the consensus is like it totally depends
 

8493
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,510
the consensus is like it totally depends
and by the way it's really hard to get

8494
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,520
and by the way it's really hard to get
 

8495
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,750
and by the way it's really hard to get
it to converge and it's noisy and it

8496
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:17,760
it to converge and it's noisy and it
 

8497
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,550
it to converge and it's noisy and it
like

8498
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:18,560
like
 

8499
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:19,670
like
so there are all these really

8500
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:19,680
so there are all these really
 

8501
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:21,190
so there are all these really
interesting ideas around building

get in an accident to learn that an
 

8513
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:33,349
get in an accident to learn that an
accident is bad so you start simulating

8514
02:23:33,349 --> 02:23:33,359
accident is bad so you start simulating
 

8515
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:35,190
accident is bad so you start simulating
accidents simulating aggressive drivers

most people are like yeah we tried a lot

8542
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:03,520
most people are like yeah we tried a lot
 

8543
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:05,349
most people are like yeah we tried a lot
of things didn't quite ever make it work

8544
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
of things didn't quite ever make it work
 

8545
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:07,270
of things didn't quite ever make it work
i mean for the longest time facebook ads

8546
02:24:07,270 --> 02:24:07,280
i mean for the longest time facebook ads
 

8547
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:09,670
i mean for the longest time facebook ads
was effectively a logistic regression

8548
02:24:09,670 --> 02:24:09,680
was effectively a logistic regression
 

8549
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:11,750
was effectively a logistic regression
okay i don't know what it is now but

8550
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:11,760
okay i don't know what it is now but
 

8551
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,110
okay i don't know what it is now but
like if you look at this paper they

8552
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:13,120
like if you look at this paper they
 

8553
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:14,150
like if you look at this paper they
published back in the day it was

8554
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,160
published back in the day it was
 

8555
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,910
published back in the day it was
literally just a logistic regression

8556
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:15,920
literally just a logistic regression
 

8557
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:18,870
literally just a logistic regression
made a lot of money um

8558
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:18,880
made a lot of money um
 

8559
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,270
made a lot of money um
so even at these like extremely large

8560
02:24:21,270 --> 02:24:21,280
so even at these like extremely large
 

8561
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,349
so even at these like extremely large
scales if we are not yet touching what

8562
02:24:23,349 --> 02:24:23,359
scales if we are not yet touching what
 

8563
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,429
scales if we are not yet touching what
reinforcement learning can truly do

8564
02:24:25,429 --> 02:24:25,439
reinforcement learning can truly do
 

8565
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:26,870
reinforcement learning can truly do
imagine what the next 10 years looks

8566
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:26,880
imagine what the next 10 years looks
 

8567
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,510
imagine what the next 10 years looks
like yeah how cool is that it's amazing

8568
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
like yeah how cool is that it's amazing
 

8569
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,190
like yeah how cool is that it's amazing
so i really like the use of

8570
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,200
so i really like the use of
 

8571
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,630
so i really like the use of
reinforcement learning as part of the

8572
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:32,640
reinforcement learning as part of the
 

8573
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,710
reinforcement learning as part of the
simulation for example

8574
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:34,720
simulation for example
 

8575
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:36,389
simulation for example
like with self-driving cars it's

8576
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:36,399
like with self-driving cars it's
 

8577
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:38,469
like with self-driving cars it's
modeling pedestrians so the nice thing

8578
02:24:38,469 --> 02:24:38,479
modeling pedestrians so the nice thing
 

8579
02:24:38,479 --> 02:24:40,309
modeling pedestrians so the nice thing
about reinforcement learning

8580
02:24:40,309 --> 02:24:40,319
about reinforcement learning
 

8581
02:24:40,319 --> 02:24:42,550
about reinforcement learning
it can be used to

8582
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:42,560
it can be used to
 

8583
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:44,870
it can be used to
learn agents within the world

8584
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:44,880
learn agents within the world
 

8585
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:46,950
learn agents within the world
so they can learn to behave properly

8586
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:46,960
so they can learn to behave properly
 

8587
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,190
so they can learn to behave properly
like you can teach pedestrians to

8588
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:49,200
like you can teach pedestrians to
 

8589
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,710
like you can teach pedestrians to
like you don't hard code the way they

8590
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:50,720
like you don't hard code the way they
 

8591
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,429
like you don't hard code the way they
behave they learn how to behave in that

8592
02:24:53,429 --> 02:24:53,439
behave they learn how to behave in that
 

8593
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:55,670
behave they learn how to behave in that
same way i do have a hope was it jack

8594
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:55,680
same way i do have a hope was it jack
 

8595

interactions i believe yeah

8600
02:25:03,429 --> 02:25:03,439
interactions i believe yeah
 

8601
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:04,469
interactions i believe yeah
like

8602
02:25:04,469 --> 02:25:04,479
like
 

8603
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,790
like
simulating interactions

8604
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
simulating interactions
 

8605
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,790
simulating interactions
so you can learn how to manage that it's

8606
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:08,800
so you can learn how to manage that it's
 

8607
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,950
so you can learn how to manage that it's
fascinating so where most of your

8608
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:10,960
fascinating so where most of your
 

8609
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:13,349
fascinating so where most of your
algorithm development happens on in

8610
02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:13,359
algorithm development happens on in
 

8611
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:14,870
algorithm development happens on in
virtual worlds

8612
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:14,880
virtual worlds
 

8613
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,950
virtual worlds
and then you can really learn how to

8614
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:16,960
and then you can really learn how to
 

8615
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:19,270
and then you can really learn how to
design the interface how you design much

8616
02:25:19,270 --> 02:25:19,280
design the interface how you design much
 

8617
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:21,349
design the interface how you design much
of aspects of the experience

8618
02:25:21,349 --> 02:25:21,359
of aspects of the experience
 

8619
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:23,590
of aspects of the experience
in terms of the how you select what's

8620
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:23,600
in terms of the how you select what's
 

8621
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:24,950
in terms of the how you select what's
shown in the feed all those kinds of

it feels like if you can connect
 

8627
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,870

your money in the smp and this is bad
 

9301
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,830
your money in the smp and this is bad
because the smp has done wonderfully

9302
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:23,840
because the smp has done wonderfully
 

9303
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:25,830
because the smp has done wonderfully
well in the last year right

9304
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:25,840

about it
 

9315

you know the truman show when he gets
 

9631
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:42,710
you know the truman show when he gets
the edge and he like knocks against it

9632
02:41:42,710 --> 02:41:42,720
the edge and he like knocks against it
 

9633
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,630
the edge and he like knocks against it
he's like what like there's this

9634
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:44,640
he's like what like there's this

awakening that happens when you get to
 

9637
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:48,389
awakening that happens when you get to
that edge that you realize oh

9638
02:41:48,389 --> 02:41:48,399
that edge that you realize oh
 

9639
02:41:48,399 --> 02:41:50,150
that edge that you realize oh
like sure it's great it's great that we

9640
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,160
like sure it's great it's great that we
 

9641
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:53,429
like sure it's great it's great that we
all chase money and fame and and success

9642
02:41:53,429 --> 02:41:53,439
all chase money and fame and and success
 

9643
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:55,510
all chase money and fame and and success
but you hit the edge and and i'm not

9644
02:41:55,510 --> 02:41:55,520
but you hit the edge and and i'm not
 

9645
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:57,190
but you hit the edge and and i'm not
even claiming i hit an edge like like

9646
02:41:57,190 --> 02:41:57,200
even claiming i hit an edge like like
 

9647
02:41:57,200 --> 02:41:58,870
even claiming i hit an edge like like
elon's hit an edge like there's clearly

9648
02:41:58,870 --> 02:41:58,880
elon's hit an edge like there's clearly
 

9649
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:00,710
elon's hit an edge like there's clearly
larger scales

9650
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:00,720
larger scales
 

9651
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:02,469
larger scales
but what's cool is you learn that like

9652
02:42:02,469 --> 02:42:02,479
but what's cool is you learn that like
 

9653
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:03,990
but what's cool is you learn that like
it doesn't actually matter and that

9654
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:04,000
it doesn't actually matter and that
 

9655
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,269
it doesn't actually matter and that
there are all these other things that

9656
02:42:05,269 --> 02:42:05,279
there are all these other things that
 

9657
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:06,469
there are all these other things that
truly matter

9658
02:42:06,469 --> 02:42:06,479
truly matter
 

9659
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:08,790
truly matter
um that's not a case for working less

9660
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:08,800
um that's not a case for working less
 

9661
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,870
um that's not a case for working less
hard that's not a case for taking it

9662
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:10,880
hard that's not a case for taking it
 

9663
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:12,710
hard that's not a case for taking it
easy that's not a case for the four day

9664
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:12,720
easy that's not a case for the four day
 

9665
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:13,750
easy that's not a case for the four day
work week

9666
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:13,760
work week
 

9667
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,150
work week
what that is a case for is designing

9668
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:16,160
what that is a case for is designing
 

9669
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:18,309
what that is a case for is designing
your life exactly the way you want to

9670
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:18,319
your life exactly the way you want to
 

9671
02:42:18,319 --> 02:42:19,830
your life exactly the way you want to
design it because

9672
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
design it because
 

9673
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,990
design it because
i don't know i i think we go around the

9674
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:22,000
i don't know i i think we go around the
 

9675
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,550
i don't know i i think we go around the
or you know the sun a certain number of

9676
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:24,560
or you know the sun a certain number of
 

9677
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:27,510
or you know the sun a certain number of
times and then we die and then that's it

9678
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:27,520
times and then we die and then that's it
 

9679
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:29,670
times and then we die and then that's it
that's me are you afraid of that moment

9680
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:29,680
that's me are you afraid of that moment
 

9681
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:31,750
that's me are you afraid of that moment
no not at all in fact

no not at all in fact
at least not yet

9684
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:36,000

 

9685
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,710

listen i'm like a pilot like i do

9686
02:42:38,710 --> 02:42:38,720
listen i'm like a pilot like i do

02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:48,800
i gotta choose uh uh mindfully and
 

9693
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:50,790

purposefully the thing i am doing right
 

9695
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:52,309
purposefully the thing i am doing right
now

9696
02:42:52,309 --> 02:42:52,319
now
 

9697
02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:54,230
now
and not just fall into it because you're

9698
02:42:54,230 --> 02:42:54,240
and not just fall into it because you're
 

9699
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:55,670
and not just fall into it because you're
gonna wake up one day and ask yourself

9700
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:55,680
gonna wake up one day and ask yourself
 

9701
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:57,110
gonna wake up one day and ask yourself
why the hell you spent the last 10 years

9702
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,120
why the hell you spent the last 10 years
 

9703
02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:00,469
why the hell you spent the last 10 years
doing x y or z yeah so i guess

9704
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:00,479
doing x y or z yeah so i guess
 

9705
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:03,750
doing x y or z yeah so i guess
my like shorter answer to this is

9706
02:43:03,750 --> 02:43:03,760
my like shorter answer to this is
 

9707
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,150
my like shorter answer to this is
doing things on purpose

9708
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:06,160
doing things on purpose
 

9709
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:08,389
doing things on purpose
because you choose to do them

9710
02:43:08,389 --> 02:43:08,399
because you choose to do them
 

9711
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,230
because you choose to do them
so important in life

9712
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:10,240
so important in life
 

9713
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:11,830
so important in life
and not just like floating down the

9714
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:11,840
and not just like floating down the
 

9715
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:14,070
and not just like floating down the
river of life hitting branches along the

9716
02:43:14,070 --> 02:43:14,080
river of life hitting branches along the
 

9717
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,950
river of life hitting branches along the
way because you will hit branches right

9718
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:16,960
way because you will hit branches right
 

9719
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:19,190
way because you will hit branches right
but rather like literally plotting a

9720
02:43:19,190 --> 02:43:19,200
but rather like literally plotting a
 

9721
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:21,110
but rather like literally plotting a
course and not having a 10-year plan but

9722
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
course and not having a 10-year plan but
 

9723
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:24,870
course and not having a 10-year plan but
just choosing every day to opt in

9724
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:24,880
just choosing every day to opt in
 

9725
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:28,150
just choosing every day to opt in
that i think has been more

9726
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:28,160
that i think has been more
 

9727
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:29,429
that i think has been more
like i haven't figured out the meaning

9728
02:43:29,429 --> 02:43:29,439
like i haven't figured out the meaning
 

9729
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:30,550
like i haven't figured out the meaning
of life by any stretch of the

9730
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:30,560
of life by any stretch of the
 

9731
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:32,550
of life by any stretch of the
imagination but it certainly isn't money

9732
02:43:32,550 --> 02:43:32,560
imagination but it certainly isn't money
 

9733
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:33,830
imagination but it certainly isn't money
and it certainly isn't fame and it

9734
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:33,840
and it certainly isn't fame and it
 

9735
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:36,150
and it certainly isn't fame and it
certainly isn't travel and it's like and

9736
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:36,160
certainly isn't travel and it's like and
 

9737
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:37,990
certainly isn't travel and it's like and
it's way more of like opting into the
