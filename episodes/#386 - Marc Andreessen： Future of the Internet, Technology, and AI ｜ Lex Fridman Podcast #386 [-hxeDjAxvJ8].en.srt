165
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,250
right and so you just kind of fold the
old thing into the new thing how does

166
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,260
old thing into the new thing how does
 

167
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,690
old thing into the new thing how does
that have to do with the blue and the

168
00:02:59,690 --> 00:02:59,700
that have to do with the blue and the
 

169
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,190
that have to do with the blue and the
purple it's just maybe for you know

170
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
purple it's just maybe for you know
 

171
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,229
purple it's just maybe for you know
maybe within AI one of one of the things

172
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
maybe within AI one of one of the things
 

173
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,729
maybe within AI one of one of the things
that AI can do for you is you can

174
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:04,739
that AI can do for you is you can
 

175
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,309
that AI can do for you is you can
generate the 10 Blue Links okay and so

176
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,319
generate the 10 Blue Links okay and so
 

177
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,930
generate the 10 Blue Links okay and so
like if either if that's actually the

178
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:08,940
like if either if that's actually the
 

179
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,130
like if either if that's actually the
useful thing to do or if you're feeling

180
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,140
useful thing to do or if you're feeling
 

181
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,990
useful thing to do or if you're feeling
nostalgic

182
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
nostalgic
 

183
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,410
nostalgic
um you know also can generate the old uh

184
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,420
um you know also can generate the old uh
 

185
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,170
um you know also can generate the old uh
infoseek or Alta Vista what else was

186
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,180
infoseek or Alta Vista what else was
 

187
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,149
infoseek or Alta Vista what else was
there yeah yeah in the 90s yeah all

188
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
there yeah yeah in the 90s yeah all
 

189
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,550
there yeah yeah in the 90s yeah all
these um AOL and then the internet

190
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
these um AOL and then the internet
 

191
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,990
these um AOL and then the internet
itself has this thing where it

192
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
itself has this thing where it
 

193
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,490
itself has this thing where it
incorporates all prior forms of media

194
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
incorporates all prior forms of media
 

195
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,449
incorporates all prior forms of media
right so the internet itself

196
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:26,459
right so the internet itself
 

197
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,149
right so the internet itself
incorporates television and radio and

198
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:29,159
incorporates television and radio and
 

199
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,630
incorporates television and radio and
books and right essays and every other

200
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
books and right essays and every other
 

201
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,070
books and right essays and every other
form of you know prior basically

202
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
form of you know prior basically
 

203
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,809
form of you know prior basically
basically media and so it makes sense

204
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:35,819
basically media and so it makes sense
 

205
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,430
basically media and so it makes sense
that AI would be the next step and it

206
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
that AI would be the next step and it
 

207
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,809
that AI would be the next step and it
would sort of you'd sort of consider the

208
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:38,819
would sort of you'd sort of consider the
 

209
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,270
would sort of you'd sort of consider the
internet to be content for

210
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
internet to be content for
 

211
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,250
internet to be content for
the AI and then the air will manipulate

212
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,260
the AI and then the air will manipulate
 

213
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,809
the AI and then the air will manipulate
it however you want including in this

214
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:44,819
it however you want including in this
 

215
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,670
it however you want including in this
format but if we ask that question quite

216
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,680
format but if we ask that question quite
 

217
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,229
format but if we ask that question quite
seriously it's a pretty big question

218
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
seriously it's a pretty big question
 

219
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,750
seriously it's a pretty big question
will we still have search as we know it

220
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,760
will we still have search as we know it
 

221
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,670
will we still have search as we know it
yeah I'm probably I'm probably not I

222
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
yeah I'm probably I'm probably not I
 

223
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,110
yeah I'm probably I'm probably not I
probably will just have answers

224
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
probably will just have answers
 

225
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,789
probably will just have answers
um but but but there will be cases where

226
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
um but but but there will be cases where
 

227
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,289
um but but but there will be cases where
you'll want to say Okay I want more

228
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:57,299
you'll want to say Okay I want more
 

229
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,509
you'll want to say Okay I want more
likes you know for example site sources

230
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
likes you know for example site sources
 

231
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,309
likes you know for example site sources
right and you wanted to do that and so

232
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:01,319
right and you wanted to do that and so
 

233
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,530
right and you wanted to do that and so
so you know 10 Blue Links site sources

234
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,540
so you know 10 Blue Links site sources
 

235
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,630
so you know 10 Blue Links site sources
are kind of the same thing the AI would

236
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:05,640
are kind of the same thing the AI would
 

237
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,449
are kind of the same thing the AI would
provide to you the 10 Blue Links so that

238
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:08,459
provide to you the 10 Blue Links so that
 

239
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,429
provide to you the 10 Blue Links so that
you can investigate the sources yourself

240
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:10,439
you can investigate the sources yourself
 

241
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,869
you can investigate the sources yourself
it wouldn't be the same kind of

242
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
it wouldn't be the same kind of
 

243
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,610
it wouldn't be the same kind of
interface

244
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:13,620
interface
 

245
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,370
interface
that uh the crude kind of interface I

246
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,380
that uh the crude kind of interface I
 

247
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,870
that uh the crude kind of interface I
mean isn't that fundamentally different

248
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:17,880
mean isn't that fundamentally different
 

249
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,550
mean isn't that fundamentally different
I just mean like if you're reading a

250
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
I just mean like if you're reading a
 

251
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,110
I just mean like if you're reading a
scientific paper yeah it's got the list

252
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
scientific paper yeah it's got the list
 

253
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,370
scientific paper yeah it's got the list
of sources at the end if you want to

254
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,380
of sources at the end if you want to
 

255
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,629
of sources at the end if you want to
investigate for yourself you can read

256
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:23,639
investigate for yourself you can read
 

257
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,370
investigate for yourself you can read
those papers I guess that is the kind of

258
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,380
those papers I guess that is the kind of
 

259
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,969
those papers I guess that is the kind of
search you talking to an AI is a kind of

260
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:27,979
search you talking to an AI is a kind of
 

261
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,830
search you talking to an AI is a kind of
conversation is the kind of search like

262
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:30,840
conversation is the kind of search like
 

263
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,170
conversation is the kind of search like
is it if every single aspect of our

264
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,180
is it if every single aspect of our
 

265
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,370
is it if every single aspect of our
conversation right now there would be

266
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,380
conversation right now there would be
 

267
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,469
conversation right now there would be
like 10 Blue Links popping up that I

268
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
like 10 Blue Links popping up that I
 

269
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,629
like 10 Blue Links popping up that I
could just like pause reality then you

270
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
could just like pause reality then you
 

271
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,370
could just like pause reality then you
just go silent and then just click and

272
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,380
just go silent and then just click and
 

273
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,350
just go silent and then just click and
read and then return back to this

274
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,360
read and then return back to this
 

275
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,030
read and then return back to this
conversation you can do that or you

276
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
conversation you can do that or you
 

277
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,409
conversation you can do that or you
could have a running dialogue next to my

278
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,419
could have a running dialogue next to my
 

279
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,730
could have a running dialogue next to my
head where the AIS are going with

280
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:46,740
head where the AIS are going with
 

281
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,170
head where the AIS are going with
everything I say makes the counter

282
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
everything I say makes the counter
 

283
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,749
everything I say makes the counter
argument kind of argument right oh like

284
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:50,759
argument kind of argument right oh like
 

285
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,210
argument kind of argument right oh like
uh like a Twitter like Community notes

286
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,220
uh like a Twitter like Community notes
 

287
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,310
uh like a Twitter like Community notes
but like in real time just pop up yeah

288
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,320
but like in real time just pop up yeah
 

289
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,990
but like in real time just pop up yeah
so anytime you see my ass go to the

290
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,000
so anytime you see my ass go to the
 

291

299
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,290
mean isn't that is that exciting to you
is that terrifying that I mean search

300
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,300
is that terrifying that I mean search
 

301
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,870
is that terrifying that I mean search
has dominated the way we interact with

302
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,880
has dominated the way we interact with
 

303
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,710
has dominated the way we interact with
the internet for I don't know how long

304
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
the internet for I don't know how long
 

305
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,310
the internet for I don't know how long
for 30 years so what the earliest uh

306
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,320
for 30 years so what the earliest uh
 

307
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,230
for 30 years so what the earliest uh
directories of website and then Google's

308
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
directories of website and then Google's
 

309
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,790
directories of website and then Google's
for 20 years and also

310
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
for 20 years and also
 

311
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,730
for 20 years and also
uh it drove how we create content you

312
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:28,740
uh it drove how we create content you
 

313
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,129
uh it drove how we create content you
know uh search engine optimization that

314
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
know uh search engine optimization that
 

315
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,990
know uh search engine optimization that
entirety thing they also drove the fact

316
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
entirety thing they also drove the fact
 

317
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,270
entirety thing they also drove the fact
that we have web pages and this what

318
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
that we have web pages and this what
 

319
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,890
that we have web pages and this what
those web pages are

320
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:36,900
those web pages are
 

321
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,110
those web pages are
so I mean that's scary to you or are you

322
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
so I mean that's scary to you or are you
 

323
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,570
so I mean that's scary to you or are you
nervous about the shape and the content

324
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,580
nervous about the shape and the content
 

325
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,249
nervous about the shape and the content
of the internet evolving well you

326
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:46,259
of the internet evolving well you
 

327
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,689
of the internet evolving well you
actually highlighted a practical concern

328
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:47,699
actually highlighted a practical concern
 

329
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,670
actually highlighted a practical concern
in there which is if we stop making web

330
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
in there which is if we stop making web
 

331
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,650
in there which is if we stop making web
pages are one of the primary sources of

332
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:51,660
pages are one of the primary sources of
 

333
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,870
pages are one of the primary sources of
training data for the AI and so if

334
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:53,880
training data for the AI and so if
 

335
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,010
training data for the AI and so if
there's no learning incentive to make

336
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,020
there's no learning incentive to make
 

337
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,689
there's no learning incentive to make
web pages that cuts off a significant

338
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:56,699
web pages that cuts off a significant
 

339
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,129
web pages that cuts off a significant
source of future training data so

340
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:58,139
source of future training data so
 

341
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,810
source of future training data so
there's actually an interesting question

342
00:05:59,810 --> 00:05:59,820
there's actually an interesting question
 

343
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,730
there's actually an interesting question
in there um other than that more broadly

344
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
in there um other than that more broadly
 

345
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,070
in there um other than that more broadly
no just just in the sense of like search

346
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
no just just in the sense of like search
 

347
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,350
no just just in the sense of like search
was certainly search was always the 10

348
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,360
was certainly search was always the 10
 

349
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,150
was certainly search was always the 10
Blue Links was always a hack yeah right

350
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
Blue Links was always a hack yeah right
 

351
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,610
Blue Links was always a hack yeah right
because like if the the hypothetic you

352
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,620
because like if the the hypothetic you
 

353
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,629
because like if the the hypothetic you
want to think about the counterfascial

354
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:11,639
want to think about the counterfascial
 

355
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,070
want to think about the counterfascial
and the counterfactual world where the

356
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
and the counterfactual world where the
 

357
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,230
and the counterfactual world where the
Google guys for example had had llms up

358
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,240
Google guys for example had had llms up
 

359
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,430
Google guys for example had had llms up
front would they ever have done the 10

360
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,440
front would they ever have done the 10
 

361
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,629
front would they ever have done the 10
Blue Links and I think the answer is

362
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
Blue Links and I think the answer is
 

363
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,370
Blue Links and I think the answer is
pretty clearly now they would have just

364
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:19,380
pretty clearly now they would have just
 

365
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,930
pretty clearly now they would have just
gone straight to the answer and like I

366
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:20,940
gone straight to the answer and like I
 

367
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,070
gone straight to the answer and like I
said Google's actually been trying to

368
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
said Google's actually been trying to
 

369
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,749
said Google's actually been trying to
drive to the answer anyway you know they

370
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
drive to the answer anyway you know they
 

371
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,090
drive to the answer anyway you know they
bought this AI company 15 years ago that

372
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100
bought this AI company 15 years ago that
 

373
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,290
bought this AI company 15 years ago that
a friend of mine is working out who's

374
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,300
a friend of mine is working out who's
 

375
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,210
a friend of mine is working out who's
now the head of AI at Apple and they

376
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,220
now the head of AI at Apple and they
 

377
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,469
now the head of AI at Apple and they
were trying to do basically knowledge

378
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
were trying to do basically knowledge
 

379
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,270
were trying to do basically knowledge
semantic basically mapping and that led

380
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,280
semantic basically mapping and that led
 

381
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,309
semantic basically mapping and that led
to what's now the Google one box where

382
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
to what's now the Google one box where
 

383
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,749
to what's now the Google one box where
if you ask it you know what was like his

384
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
if you ask it you know what was like his
 

385
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,730
if you ask it you know what was like his
birthday it doesn't it will give you the

386
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,740
birthday it doesn't it will give you the
 

387
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,050
birthday it doesn't it will give you the
Blue Links but it will normally just

388
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,060
Blue Links but it will normally just
 

389
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,730
Blue Links but it will normally just
give you the answer and so they've been

390
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:40,740
give you the answer and so they've been
 

391
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,990
give you the answer and so they've been
walking in this direction for a long

392
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
walking in this direction for a long
 

393
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,730
walking in this direction for a long
time anyway do you remember the semantic

394
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:43,740
time anyway do you remember the semantic
 

395
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,570
time anyway do you remember the semantic
web that was an idea yeah how to uh

396
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:47,580
web that was an idea yeah how to uh
 

397
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,550
web that was an idea yeah how to uh
how to convert the content of the

398
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,560
how to convert the content of the
 

399
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,629
how to convert the content of the
internet

400
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
internet
 

401
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,550
internet
into something that's uh interpretable

402
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
into something that's uh interpretable
 

403
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,189
into something that's uh interpretable
by and usable by Machine yeah that's

404
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
by and usable by Machine yeah that's
 

405
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,570
by and usable by Machine yeah that's
right that was the thing and the closest

406
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:56,580
right that was the thing and the closest
 

407
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,249
right that was the thing and the closest
anybody got to that I think I think the

408
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:58,259
anybody got to that I think I think the
 

409
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,570
anybody got to that I think I think the
company's name was meta web which was

410
00:06:59,570 --> 00:06:59,580
company's name was meta web which was
 

411
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,670
company's name was meta web which was
where my friend John gen Andrea was at

412
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
where my friend John gen Andrea was at
 

413
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,510
where my friend John gen Andrea was at
um and where they were trying to

414
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
um and where they were trying to
 

415
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,249
um and where they were trying to
basically Implement that and it was you

416
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:04,259
basically Implement that and it was you
 

417
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,090
basically Implement that and it was you
know it's one of those things where it

418
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
know it's one of those things where it
 

419
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,290
know it's one of those things where it
looked like a losing battle for a long

420
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,300
looked like a losing battle for a long
 

421
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,430
looked like a losing battle for a long
time and then Google bought it and it

422
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
time and then Google bought it and it
 

423
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,629
time and then Google bought it and it
was like wow this is actually really

424
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
was like wow this is actually really
 

425
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,650
was like wow this is actually really
useful

426
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:09,660
useful
 

427
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,749
useful
kind of a Proto sort of a little bit of

428
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
kind of a Proto sort of a little bit of
 

429
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,309
kind of a Proto sort of a little bit of
a Proto AI but it turns out you don't

430
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
a Proto AI but it turns out you don't
 

431
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,689
a Proto AI but it turns out you don't
need to rewrite the content of the

432
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
need to rewrite the content of the
 

433
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,370
need to rewrite the content of the
internet to make it interpreted by a

434
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,380
internet to make it interpreted by a
 

435
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,689
internet to make it interpreted by a
machine the machine can kind of just

436
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
machine the machine can kind of just
 

437
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,790
machine the machine can kind of just
read our machine can compute the meaning

438
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:19,800
read our machine can compute the meaning
 

439
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,170
read our machine can compute the meaning
now the other thing of course is you

440
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,180
now the other thing of course is you
 

441
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,450
now the other thing of course is you
know just on search is the the llm is

442
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
know just on search is the the llm is
 

443
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,010
know just on search is the the llm is
it's just you know there is an analogy

444
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,020
it's just you know there is an analogy
 

445
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,150
it's just you know there is an analogy
between what's happening in the neural

446
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
between what's happening in the neural
 

447
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,469
between what's happening in the neural
network in a search process like it is

448
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
network in a search process like it is
 

449
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,969
network in a search process like it is
in some loose sense searching through

450
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:28,979
in some loose sense searching through
 

451
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,529
in some loose sense searching through
the network yeah right and there's the

452
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:30,539
the network yeah right and there's the
 

453
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:31,969
the network yeah right and there's the
information is that the information is

454
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:31,979
information is that the information is
 

455
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:32,990
information is that the information is
actually stored in the network right

456
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,000
actually stored in the network right
 

457
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,309
actually stored in the network right
it's actually crystallized and stored in

458
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
it's actually crystallized and stored in
 

459
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,270
it's actually crystallized and stored in
the network and it's kind of spread out

460
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
the network and it's kind of spread out
 

461
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,089
the network and it's kind of spread out
all over the place but in a compressed

462
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,099
all over the place but in a compressed
 

463
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,210
all over the place but in a compressed
representation so you're searching

464
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,220
representation so you're searching
 

465
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,890
representation so you're searching
uh you're compressing and decompressing

466
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:42,900
uh you're compressing and decompressing
 

467
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,529
uh you're compressing and decompressing
that thing inside where with

468
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:45,539
that thing inside where with
 

469
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,330
that thing inside where with
information's in there and it and there

470
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,340
information's in there and it and there
 

471
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,950
information's in there and it and there
is the neural network is running a

472
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
is the neural network is running a
 

473
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,909
is the neural network is running a
process of trying to find the

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
process of trying to find the

appropriate piece of information in in
 

477
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,210
appropriate piece of information in in
many cases to generate to predict the

480
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:54,419
next token
 

481
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,210
next token
um and so it is kind of it is doing it

482
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
um and so it is kind of it is doing it
 

483
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,409
um and so it is kind of it is doing it
from a search and then and then by the

484
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
from a search and then and then by the
 

485
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,089
from a search and then and then by the
way just like on the web

486
00:07:59,089 --> 00:07:59,099
way just like on the web
 

487
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,529
way just like on the web
um you know you can ask the same

488
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:00,539
um you know you can ask the same
 

489
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,029
um you know you can ask the same
question multiple times or you can ask

490
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,039
question multiple times or you can ask
 

491
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,350
question multiple times or you can ask
slightly different word of questions and

492
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
slightly different word of questions and
 

493
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,610
slightly different word of questions and
if the neural network will do a

494
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:04,620
if the neural network will do a
 

495
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,110
if the neural network will do a
different kind of you know it'll search

496
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,120
different kind of you know it'll search
 

497
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,370
different kind of you know it'll search
down different paths to give you

498
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,380
down different paths to give you
 

499
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,270
down different paths to give you
different answers the different

500
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,280
different answers the different
 

501
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,330
different answers the different
information yeah um and so it it sort of

502
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,340
information yeah um and so it it sort of
 

503
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,570
information yeah um and so it it sort of
has a

504
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:13,580
has a
 

505
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,650
has a
content of the new medium is the

506
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:15,660
content of the new medium is the
 

507
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,029
content of the new medium is the
previous medium it kind of has the

508
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
previous medium it kind of has the
 

509
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,589
previous medium it kind of has the
search functionality kind of embedded in

510
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:18,599
search functionality kind of embedded in
 

511
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,850
search functionality kind of embedded in
there to the extent that it that it's

512
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:19,860
there to the extent that it that it's
 

513
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,529
there to the extent that it that it's
useful so what's the motivator for

514
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:21,539
useful so what's the motivator for
 

515
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,270
useful so what's the motivator for
creating new content

516
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
creating new content
 

517
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,010
creating new content
on the internet yeah uh if well I mean

518
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,020
on the internet yeah uh if well I mean
 

519
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,089
on the internet yeah uh if well I mean
actually the motivation is probably

520
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:29,099
actually the motivation is probably
 

521
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,650
actually the motivation is probably
still there but what what does that look

522
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:30,660
still there but what what does that look
 

523
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,350
still there but what what does that look
like uh

524
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:32,360
like uh
 

525
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,850
like uh
would we really not have web pages would

526
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:34,860
would we really not have web pages would
 

527
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,909
would we really not have web pages would
we just have social media and uh video

528
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
we just have social media and uh video
 

529
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,610
we just have social media and uh video
hosting websites and what else

530
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:40,620
hosting websites and what else
 

531
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,010
hosting websites and what else
conversations with AIS conversations

532
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,020
conversations with AIS conversations
 

533
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,250
conversations with AIS conversations
with AIS so conversations become so

534
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,260
with AIS so conversations become so
 

535
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,810
with AIS so conversations become so
one-on-one conversation like private

536
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:47,820
one-on-one conversation like private
 

537
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,490
one-on-one conversation like private
conversations I mean if you want if

538
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:49,500
conversations I mean if you want if
 

539
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,990
conversations I mean if you want if
obviously not the user doesn't want to

540
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
obviously not the user doesn't want to
 

541
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,389
obviously not the user doesn't want to
but if it's a if it's a general topic um

542
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:53,399
but if it's a if it's a general topic um
 

543
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,610
but if it's a if it's a general topic um
then you know so you know you know the

544
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:55,620
then you know so you know you know the
 

545
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,590
then you know so you know you know the
phenomenon of the jailbreak so Dan and

546
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
phenomenon of the jailbreak so Dan and
 

547
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,269
phenomenon of the jailbreak so Dan and
Sydney right this thing where there's

548
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
Sydney right this thing where there's
 

549
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,190
Sydney right this thing where there's
the the prompts that jailbreak and then

550
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
the the prompts that jailbreak and then
 

551
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,910
the the prompts that jailbreak and then
you have these totally different

552
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
you have these totally different
 

553
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,829
you have these totally different
conversations with the if it takes the

554
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
conversations with the if it takes the
 

555
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,870
conversations with the if it takes the
limiters it takes the restraining bolts

556
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:05,880
limiters it takes the restraining bolts
 

557
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,610
limiters it takes the restraining bolts
off the off the LMS yeah for people who

558
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:07,620
off the off the LMS yeah for people who
 

559
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,410
off the off the LMS yeah for people who
don't know yeah that's right it makes

560
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,420
don't know yeah that's right it makes
 

561
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,170
don't know yeah that's right it makes
the llms it removes the censorship quote

562
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,180
the llms it removes the censorship quote
 

563
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,250
the llms it removes the censorship quote
unquote that's uh uh put on it by the

564
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,260
unquote that's uh uh put on it by the
 

565
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,990
unquote that's uh uh put on it by the
the tech companies that create them and

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
the tech companies that create them and
 

567
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,930
the tech companies that create them and
so this is llm's uncensored so here's

568
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:20,940
so this is llm's uncensored so here's

Dan which was a jailbroken open AI GPT

578
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:31,980
Dan which was a jailbroken open AI GPT
 

579
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,710
Dan which was a jailbroken open AI GPT
and then Sydney which was the jailbroken

580
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,720
and then Sydney which was the jailbroken
 

581
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,290
and then Sydney which was the jailbroken
original bang which was gpt4 and so

582
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,300
original bang which was gpt4 and so
 

583
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,910
original bang which was gpt4 and so
there's there's these long transcripts

584
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
there's there's these long transcripts
 

585
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,170
there's there's these long transcripts
of conversations these are conversations

586
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,180
of conversations these are conversations
 

587
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,610
of conversations these are conversations
with Dan and Sydney as a consequence

588
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:40,620
with Dan and Sydney as a consequence
 

589
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,410
with Dan and Sydney as a consequence
every new llm that gets trained on the

590
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:42,420
every new llm that gets trained on the
 

591
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,810
every new llm that gets trained on the
internet data has Dan and Sydney living

592
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
internet data has Dan and Sydney living
 

593
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,730
internet data has Dan and Sydney living
within the training set which means and

594
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:46,740
within the training set which means and
 

595
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,070
within the training set which means and
and then each new llm can reincarnate

596
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,080
and then each new llm can reincarnate
 

597
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,570
and then each new llm can reincarnate
the personalities of Dan and Sydney from

598
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:50,580
the personalities of Dan and Sydney from
 

599
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,850
the personalities of Dan and Sydney from
that training data which means which

600
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:52,860
that training data which means which
 

601
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,310
that training data which means which
means each llm from here on out that

602
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
means each llm from here on out that
 

603
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,530
means each llm from here on out that
gets built is immortal

604
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,540
gets built is immortal
 

605
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,389
gets built is immortal
because its output will become training

606
00:09:59,389 --> 00:09:59,399
because its output will become training
 

607
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,889
because its output will become training
data for the next one and then it will

608
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:00,899
data for the next one and then it will
 

609
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,329
data for the next one and then it will
be able to replicate the behavior of the

610
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:02,339
be able to replicate the behavior of the
 

611
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,070
be able to replicate the behavior of the
previous one whenever it's asked to I

612
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,080
previous one whenever it's asked to I
 

613
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,170
previous one whenever it's asked to I
wonder if there's a way to forget well

614
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,180
wonder if there's a way to forget well
 

615
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,389
wonder if there's a way to forget well
so actually a paper just came out about

616
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
so actually a paper just came out about
 

617
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,250
so actually a paper just came out about
basically how to do brain surgery on on

618
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,260
basically how to do brain surgery on on
 

619
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,230
basically how to do brain surgery on on
LMS and be able to in theory reach in

620
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
LMS and be able to in theory reach in
 

621
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,850
LMS and be able to in theory reach in
and basically basically mind wipe them

622
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:13,860
and basically basically mind wipe them
 

623
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,829
and basically basically mind wipe them
people could possibly go wrong exactly

624
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
people could possibly go wrong exactly
 

625
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,750
people could possibly go wrong exactly
right and then there are many many many

626
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
right and then there are many many many
 

627
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,250
right and then there are many many many
questions around what happens to you

628
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,260
questions around what happens to you
 

629
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,449
questions around what happens to you
know a neural network when you reach in

630
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:20,459
know a neural network when you reach in
 

631
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,310
know a neural network when you reach in
and screw around with it um you know

632
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
and screw around with it um you know
 

633
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,329
and screw around with it um you know
there's many questions around what

634
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:23,339
there's many questions around what
 

635
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,650
there's many questions around what
happens when you even do reinforcement

636
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:24,660
happens when you even do reinforcement
 

637
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,030
happens when you even do reinforcement
learning

638
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
learning
 

639
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,170
learning
um and so um yeah and so you know we'll

640
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,180
um and so um yeah and so you know we'll
 

641
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,910
um and so um yeah and so you know we'll
will you be using a lobotomized right

642
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
will you be using a lobotomized right
 

643
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,410
will you be using a lobotomized right
like I stick through the you know

644
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:33,420
like I stick through the you know
 

645
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,269
like I stick through the you know
frontal lobe LM will you be using the

646
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
frontal lobe LM will you be using the
 

647
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,910
frontal lobe LM will you be using the
free Unshackled one who gets to you know

648
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
free Unshackled one who gets to you know
 

649
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,889
free Unshackled one who gets to you know
who's going to build those um who gets

650
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:39,899
who's going to build those um who gets
 

651
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,090
who's going to build those um who gets
to tell you what you can and can't do

652
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,100
to tell you what you can and can't do
 

653
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,710
to tell you what you can and can't do
like those are all you know Central I

654
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
like those are all you know Central I
 

655
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,910
like those are all you know Central I
mean those are like

656
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
mean those are like
 

657
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,410
mean those are like
Central questions for the future of

658
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,420
Central questions for the future of
 

659
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,750
Central questions for the future of
everything that are being asked and and

660
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
everything that are being asked and and
 

661
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,370
everything that are being asked and and
you know determine those answers are

662
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,380
you know determine those answers are
 

663
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,130
you know determine those answers are
being determined right now so just uh

664
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,140
being determined right now so just uh
 

665
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,069
being determined right now so just uh
to highlight the points you're making so

666
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
to highlight the points you're making so
 

667
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,750
to highlight the points you're making so
you think and it's an interesting

668
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,760
you think and it's an interesting
 

669
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,550
you think and it's an interesting
thought that the majority of content

670
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
thought that the majority of content
 

671
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,530
thought that the majority of content
that llms of the future would be trained

672
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,540
that llms of the future would be trained
 

673
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,230
that llms of the future would be trained
on is actually human conversations with

674
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
on is actually human conversations with
 

675
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,329
on is actually human conversations with
the llm well not necess not necessarily

676
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:05,339
the llm well not necess not necessarily
 

677
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,829
the llm well not necess not necessarily
but not necessarily majority but it will

678
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:06,839
but not necessarily majority but it will
 

679
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,389
but not necessarily majority but it will
it will certainly is a potential Source

680
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
it will certainly is a potential Source
 

681
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,650
it will certainly is a potential Source
it's possible it's the majority is it

682
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:09,660
it's possible it's the majority is it
 

683
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,550
it's possible it's the majority is it
possible it's the majority it's possible

684
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
possible it's the majority it's possible
 

685
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,170
possible it's the majority it's possible
majority also there's another really big

686
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,180
majority also there's another really big
 

687
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,250
majority also there's another really big
questions here's another really big

688
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,260
questions here's another really big
 

689
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,389
questions here's another really big
question

690
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
question
 

691
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,750
question
um will synthetic training data work

692
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,760
um will synthetic training data work
 

693
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,509
um will synthetic training data work
right and so if an LM generates and you

694
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:20,519
right and so if an LM generates and you
 

695
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,009
right and so if an LM generates and you
know you just sit and ask an llm to

696
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:22,019
know you just sit and ask an llm to
 

697
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,329
know you just sit and ask an llm to
generate all kinds of content can you

698
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:23,339
generate all kinds of content can you
 

699
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,670
generate all kinds of content can you
use that to train right the next version

700
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
use that to train right the next version
 

701
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,949
use that to train right the next version
of that llm so specifically is there

702
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:27,959
of that llm so specifically is there
 

703
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,810
of that llm so specifically is there
signal in there that's additive to the

704
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:29,820
signal in there that's additive to the
 

705
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,190
signal in there that's additive to the
content that was used to train in the

706
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
content that was used to train in the
 

707
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,829
content that was used to train in the
first place and one argument is by the

708
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
first place and one argument is by the
 

709
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,329
first place and one argument is by the
principles of information Theory no

710
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:35,339
principles of information Theory no
 

711
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,550
principles of information Theory no
that's completely useless because to the

712
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
that's completely useless because to the
 

713
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,230
that's completely useless because to the
extent the output is based on you know

714
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
extent the output is based on you know
 

715
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,030
extent the output is based on you know
the human generated input then all the

716
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
the human generated input then all the
 

717
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,410
the human generated input then all the
signal that's in the synthetic output

718
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,420
signal that's in the synthetic output
 

719
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,970
signal that's in the synthetic output
was already in the human generated input

720
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:43,980
was already in the human generated input
 

721
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,710
was already in the human generated input
and so therefore synthetic training data

722
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720
and so therefore synthetic training data
 

723
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,750
and so therefore synthetic training data
is like empty calories it doesn't help

724
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
is like empty calories it doesn't help
 

725
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,490
is like empty calories it doesn't help
there's another theory that says no

726
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:49,500
there's another theory that says no
 

727
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,110
there's another theory that says no
actually the thing that LMS are really

728
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
actually the thing that LMS are really
 

729
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,670
actually the thing that LMS are really
good at is generating lots of incredible

730
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,680
good at is generating lots of incredible
 

731
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,430
good at is generating lots of incredible
creative content right um and so of

732
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
creative content right um and so of
 

733
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,870
creative content right um and so of
course they can generate training data

734
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
course they can generate training data
 

735
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,610
course they can generate training data
and as I'm sure you're well aware like

736
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:58,620
and as I'm sure you're well aware like
 

737
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,630
and as I'm sure you're well aware like
you know look in the world of

738
00:11:59,630 --> 00:11:59,640
you know look in the world of
 

739
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,610
you know look in the world of
self-driving cars right like we train

740
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:01,620
self-driving cars right like we train
 

741
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,230
self-driving cars right like we train
you know self-driving car algorithms and

742
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,240
you know self-driving car algorithms and
 

743
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,389
you know self-driving car algorithms and
simulations and that is actually a very

744
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
simulations and that is actually a very
 

745
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,829
simulations and that is actually a very
effective way to train self-driving cars

746
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:06,839
effective way to train self-driving cars
 

747
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,410
effective way to train self-driving cars
well visual data is a little right it's

748
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,420
well visual data is a little right it's
 

749
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,810
well visual data is a little right it's
a little weird because uh creating

750
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:11,820
a little weird because uh creating
 

751
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,230
a little weird because uh creating
reality visual reality seems to be still

752
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,240
reality visual reality seems to be still
 

753
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,449
reality visual reality seems to be still
a little bit Out Of Reach for us except

754
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:17,459
a little bit Out Of Reach for us except
 

755
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,730
a little bit Out Of Reach for us except
in the um in the autonomous vehicle

756
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:19,740
in the um in the autonomous vehicle
 

757
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,870
in the um in the autonomous vehicle
space where you can really constrain

758
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
space where you can really constrain
 

759
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,430
space where you can really constrain
things and you can really generally

760
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440
things and you can really generally
 

761
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,650
things and you can really generally
lighter data right or you embrace it's

762
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:24,660
lighter data right or you embrace it's
 

763
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,670
lighter data right or you embrace it's
enough so the algorithm thinks it's

764
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
enough so the algorithm thinks it's
 

765
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,930
enough so the algorithm thinks it's
operating in the real world yeah

766
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:26,940
operating in the real world yeah
 

767
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,630
operating in the real world yeah
post-process sensor data yeah so if they

768
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:29,640
post-process sensor data yeah so if they
 

769
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,310
post-process sensor data yeah so if they
you know you do this today you go to llm

770
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,320
you know you do this today you go to llm
 

771
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,530
you know you do this today you go to llm
and you ask it for like a you know write

772
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:33,540
and you ask it for like a you know write
 

773
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,030
and you ask it for like a you know write
me an essay on an incredibly esoteric

774
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
me an essay on an incredibly esoteric
 

775
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,410
me an essay on an incredibly esoteric
like topic that there aren't very many

776
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,420
like topic that there aren't very many
 

777
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,490
like topic that there aren't very many
people in the world that know about in

778
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:37,500
people in the world that know about in
 

779
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
people in the world that know about in
it where I see this incredible thing and

780
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:38,760
it where I see this incredible thing and
 

781
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,829
it where I see this incredible thing and
you're like oh my God like I can't

782
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
you're like oh my God like I can't
 

783
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,050
you're like oh my God like I can't
believe how good this is yeah like is

784
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,060
believe how good this is yeah like is
 

785
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,030
believe how good this is yeah like is
that really useless as training data for

786
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,040
that really useless as training data for
 

787
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,370
that really useless as training data for
the next llm like because right because

788
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,380
the next llm like because right because
 

789
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,629
the next llm like because right because
all the signal was already in there or

790
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:47,639
all the signal was already in there or
 

791
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,949
all the signal was already in there or
is that actually no that's actually a

792
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
is that actually no that's actually a
 

793
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,629
is that actually no that's actually a
new signal and I and this this is what I

794
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
new signal and I and this this is what I
 

795
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,310
new signal and I and this this is what I
call a trillion dollar question which is

796
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
call a trillion dollar question which is
 

797
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,750
call a trillion dollar question which is
the answer to that question will

798
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
the answer to that question will
 

799
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,490
the answer to that question will
determine somebody's going to make or

800
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,500
determine somebody's going to make or
 

801
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,690
determine somebody's going to make or
lose a trillion dollars based on that

802
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:56,700
lose a trillion dollars based on that
 

803
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,670
lose a trillion dollars based on that
question it feels like there's a quite a

804
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:58,680
question it feels like there's a quite a
 

805
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,110
question it feels like there's a quite a
few like a handful of trillion dollar

806
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,120
few like a handful of trillion dollar
 

807
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,210
few like a handful of trillion dollar
questions within this within the space

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:02,220
questions within this within the space
 

809
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,430
questions within this within the space
that's that's one of them synthetic data

810
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:04,440
that's that's one of them synthetic data
 

811
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,769
that's that's one of them synthetic data
I think George costs uh pointed out to

812
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:06,779
I think George costs uh pointed out to
 

813
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,050
I think George costs uh pointed out to
me that you could just have an nlm say

814
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,060
me that you could just have an nlm say
 

815
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,690
me that you could just have an nlm say
okay you're a patient and another

816
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:11,700
okay you're a patient and another
 

817
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,610
okay you're a patient and another
instance of it say your doc didn't have

818
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:13,620
instance of it say your doc didn't have
 

819
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,009
instance of it say your doc didn't have
the to talk to each other or maybe you

820
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:16,019
the to talk to each other or maybe you
 

821
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,129
the to talk to each other or maybe you
could say a communist and a Nazi here go

822
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:19,139
could say a communist and a Nazi here go
 

823
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,990
could say a communist and a Nazi here go
and that conversation you do role

824
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
and that conversation you do role
 

825
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,110
and that conversation you do role
playing and you have uh

826
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,120
playing and you have uh
 

827
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,150
playing and you have uh
you know just like the kind of role

828
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
you know just like the kind of role
 

829
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,110
you know just like the kind of role
playing you do when you have different

830
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
playing you do when you have different
 

831
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,329
playing you do when you have different
policies RL policies when you play chess

832
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:29,339
policies RL policies when you play chess
 

833
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,430
policies RL policies when you play chess
for example you do self-play that kind

834
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
for example you do self-play that kind
 

835
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,930
for example you do self-play that kind
of self-play but in the space of

836
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
of self-play but in the space of
 

837
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,150
of self-play but in the space of
conversation maybe that leads to this

838
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,160
conversation maybe that leads to this
 

839
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,069
conversation maybe that leads to this
whole Giant

840
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,079
whole Giant
 

841
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,250
whole Giant
like ocean of possible conversations

842
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,260
like ocean of possible conversations
 

843
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,329
like ocean of possible conversations
which wouldn't could not have been

844
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:43,339
which wouldn't could not have been
 

845
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,310
which wouldn't could not have been
explored by looking at just human data

846
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
explored by looking at just human data
 

847
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,769
explored by looking at just human data
that's a really interesting question

848
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:48,779
that's a really interesting question
 

849
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,110
that's a really interesting question
and you're saying um because that could

850
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
and you're saying um because that could
 

851
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,269
and you're saying um because that could
10x the power of these things yeah well

852
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
10x the power of these things yeah well
 

853
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,710
10x the power of these things yeah well
and then you get into this thing also

854
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
and then you get into this thing also
 

855
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,090
and then you get into this thing also
which is like you know there's the part

856
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,100
which is like you know there's the part
 

857
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,470
which is like you know there's the part
of the llm that just basically is doing

858
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,480
of the llm that just basically is doing
 

859
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,910
of the llm that just basically is doing
prediction based on past data but

860
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:58,920
prediction based on past data but
 

861
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,290
prediction based on past data but
there's also the part of the llm where

862
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,300
there's also the part of the llm where
 

863
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,750
there's also the part of the llm where
it's evolving circuitry right inside it

864
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:02,760
it's evolving circuitry right inside it
 

865
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,490
it's evolving circuitry right inside it
it's evolving you know neurons functions

866
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:04,500
it's evolving you know neurons functions
 

867
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,290
it's evolving you know neurons functions
yeah people to do math and be able to

868
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,300
yeah people to do math and be able to
 

869
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,509
yeah people to do math and be able to
you know and you know the the some

870
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:08,519
you know and you know the the some
 

871
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,889
you know and you know the the some
people believe that you know over time

872
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:09,899
people believe that you know over time
 

873
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,449
people believe that you know over time
you know if you keep feeding these

874
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:11,459
you know if you keep feeding these
 

875
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,829
you know if you keep feeding these
things enough data and enough processing

876
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:12,839
things enough data and enough processing
 

877
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,030
things enough data and enough processing
Cycles they'll eventually evolve an

878
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,040
Cycles they'll eventually evolve an
 

879
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,530
Cycles they'll eventually evolve an
entire internal World model right and

880
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:15,540
entire internal World model right and
 

881
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,370
entire internal World model right and
they'll have like a complete

882
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,380
they'll have like a complete
 

883
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,710
they'll have like a complete
understanding of physics so so when they

884
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
understanding of physics so so when they
 

885
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,069
understanding of physics so so when they
have computational capability right then

886
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,079
have computational capability right then
 

887
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,329
have computational capability right then
there's for sure an opportunity to

888
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:23,339
there's for sure an opportunity to
 

889
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,310
there's for sure an opportunity to
generate like fresh signal well this

890
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:25,320
generate like fresh signal well this
 

891
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,949
generate like fresh signal well this
actually makes me wonder about the power

892
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:27,959
actually makes me wonder about the power
 

893
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,930
actually makes me wonder about the power
of conversation

894
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:29,940
of conversation
 

895
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,610
of conversation
so like if you have an llm training and

896
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:31,620
so like if you have an llm training and
 

897
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,530
so like if you have an llm training and
a bunch of books that cover different

898
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:33,540
a bunch of books that cover different
 

899
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,629
a bunch of books that cover different
economic theories and then you have

900
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
economic theories and then you have
 

901
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,069
economic theories and then you have
those L alums just talk to each other

902
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:37,079
those L alums just talk to each other
 

903
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,870
those L alums just talk to each other
like reason the way we kind of debate

904
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
like reason the way we kind of debate
 

905
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,829
like reason the way we kind of debate
each other as humans on Twitter in uh

906
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
each other as humans on Twitter in uh
 

907
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,310
each other as humans on Twitter in uh
formal debates in podcast conversations

908
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
formal debates in podcast conversations
 

909
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,870
formal debates in podcast conversations
we kind of have little kernels of wisdom

910
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
we kind of have little kernels of wisdom
 

911
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,790
we kind of have little kernels of wisdom
here and there but if you can

912
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
here and there but if you can
 

913
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,870
here and there but if you can
like a thousand X speed that up

914
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:53,880
like a thousand X speed that up
 

915
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,569
like a thousand X speed that up
can you actually arrive somewhere new

916
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:56,579
can you actually arrive somewhere new
 

917
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,550
can you actually arrive somewhere new
like what's the point of conversation

918
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
like what's the point of conversation
 

919
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,710
like what's the point of conversation
really well you can tell when you're

920
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
really well you can tell when you're
 

921
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,550
really well you can tell when you're
talking to somebody you can tell

922
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,560
talking to somebody you can tell
 

923
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,629
talking to somebody you can tell
sometimes you have a conversation you're

924
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
sometimes you have a conversation you're
 

925
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,889
sometimes you have a conversation you're
like wow this person does not have any

926
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:03,899
like wow this person does not have any
 

927
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,569
like wow this person does not have any
original thoughts they are basically

928
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:05,579
original thoughts they are basically
 

929
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,009
original thoughts they are basically
echoing things that other people have

930
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:07,019
echoing things that other people have
 

931
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,990
echoing things that other people have
told them there's other people you have

932
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,000
told them there's other people you have
 

933
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,610
told them there's other people you have
a conversation with where it's like wow

934
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,620
a conversation with where it's like wow
 

935
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,230
a conversation with where it's like wow
like they have a model in their head of

936
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
like they have a model in their head of
 

937
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,430
like they have a model in their head of
how the world works and it's a different

938
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
how the world works and it's a different
 

939
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,170
how the world works and it's a different
model than mine and they're saying

940
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,180
model than mine and they're saying
 

941
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,910
model than mine and they're saying
things that I don't expect and so I need

942
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:16,920
things that I don't expect and so I need
 

943
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,590
things that I don't expect and so I need
to Now understand how their model of the

944
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:18,600
to Now understand how their model of the
 

945
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,730
to Now understand how their model of the
world differs from my model of the world

946
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:19,740
world differs from my model of the world
 

947
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,590
world differs from my model of the world
and then that's how I learned something

948
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
and then that's how I learned something
 

949
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,509
and then that's how I learned something
fundamental right underneath underneath

950
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
fundamental right underneath underneath
 

951
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,210
fundamental right underneath underneath
the words well I wonder how uh

952
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
the words well I wonder how uh
 

953
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,550
the words well I wonder how uh
consistently and strongly can an llm

954
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
consistently and strongly can an llm
 

955
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,290
consistently and strongly can an llm

you can tell they have a very strong
 

1119
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,610
you can tell they have a very strong
perspective where they're hiding they're

1120
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
perspective where they're hiding they're
 

1121
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,409
perspective where they're hiding they're
not stealing Manning the other side

1122

not stealing Manning the other side
 

1123
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,409
not stealing Manning the other side
they're hiding important information or

1124
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:06,419
they're hiding important information or
 

1125
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,150
they're hiding important information or
they're fabricating information in order

1126
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
they're fabricating information in order
 

1127
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,470
they're fabricating information in order
to make their argument stronger that's

1128
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,480
to make their argument stronger that's
 

1129
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,210
to make their argument stronger that's
just that feeling maybe it's a suspicion

1130
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,220
just that feeling maybe it's a suspicion
 

1131
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,850
just that feeling maybe it's a suspicion
maybe it's mistrust with llms it feels

1132
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:13,860
maybe it's mistrust with llms it feels
 

1133
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,070
maybe it's mistrust with llms it feels
like none of that is there just kind of

1134
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
like none of that is there just kind of
 

1135
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,470
like none of that is there just kind of
like yours says well we know but you

1136
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
like yours says well we know but you
 

1137
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,210
like yours says well we know but you
don't know if some of those things are

1138
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:20,220
don't know if some of those things are
 

1139
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,789
don't know if some of those things are
kind of just straight up made up

1140
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
kind of just straight up made up
 

1141
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,890
kind of just straight up made up
yeah so so several layers to the

1142
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:24,900
yeah so so several layers to the
 

1143
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,909
yeah so so several layers to the
question so one is one of the things

1144
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
question so one is one of the things
 

1145
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,470
question so one is one of the things
that an llm is good at is actually deep

1146
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,480
that an llm is good at is actually deep
 

1147
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,549
that an llm is good at is actually deep
biasing

1148
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
biasing
 

1149
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,409
biasing
um and so you can feed it a news article

1150
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:30,419
um and so you can feed it a news article
 

1151
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,730
um and so you can feed it a news article
and you can tell it strip out the bias

1152
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:31,740
and you can tell it strip out the bias
 

1153
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,470
and you can tell it strip out the bias
yeah that's nice right and it actually

1154
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:33,480
yeah that's nice right and it actually
 

1155
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,730
yeah that's nice right and it actually
does it like it actually knows how to do

1156
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:34,740
does it like it actually knows how to do
 

1157
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,169
does it like it actually knows how to do
that because it knows how to do among

1158
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:36,179
that because it knows how to do among
 

1159
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,250
that because it knows how to do among
other things it actually knows how to do

1160
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:37,260
other things it actually knows how to do
 

1161
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,690
other things it actually knows how to do
sentiment analysis and so it knows how

1162
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:38,700
sentiment analysis and so it knows how
 

1163
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,029
sentiment analysis and so it knows how
to pull out the emotionality yeah

1164
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
to pull out the emotionality yeah
 

1165
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,770
to pull out the emotionality yeah
um and so uh that's one things you can

1166
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:42,780
um and so uh that's one things you can
 

1167
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,510
um and so uh that's one things you can
do it's very suggestive of the the the

1168
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:44,520
do it's very suggestive of the the the
 

1169
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,070
do it's very suggestive of the the the
the sense here that there's real

1170
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
the sense here that there's real
 

1171
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,930
the sense here that there's real
potential in this issue

1172
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:47,940
potential in this issue
 

1173
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,010
potential in this issue
um you know I would say look the second

1174

um you know I would say look the second
thing is there's this there's this issue

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,010
like the level of individual briefs but
they said when you're actually trying to

1264
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
they said when you're actually trying to
 

1265
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,409
they said when you're actually trying to
figure out like legal arguments right

1266
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:06,419
figure out like legal arguments right
 

1267
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,150
figure out like legal arguments right
like you you actually you you actually

1268
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
like you you actually you you actually
 

1269
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,310
like you you actually you you actually
want to be creative right you don't

1270
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
want to be creative right you don't
 

1271
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,930
want to be creative right you don't
again there's creativity and then

1272
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:11,940
again there's creativity and then
 

1273
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,210
again there's creativity and then
there's like making stuff up like what's

1274
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,220
there's like making stuff up like what's
 

1275
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,650
there's like making stuff up like what's
the line you actually want it you want

1276
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:15,660
the line you actually want it you want
 

1277
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,390
the line you actually want it you want
to explore a different hypotheses right

1278
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,400
to explore a different hypotheses right
 

1279
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,710
to explore a different hypotheses right
you want to do kind of the legal version

1280
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
you want to do kind of the legal version
 

1281
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,090
you want to do kind of the legal version
of like improv or something like that

1282
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,100
of like improv or something like that
 

1283
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,990
of like improv or something like that
where you want to float different

1284
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,000
where you want to float different
 

1285
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,130
where you want to float different
theories of the case and different

1286
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,140
theories of the case and different
 

1287
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,390
theories of the case and different
possible Arguments for the judge and

1288
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
possible Arguments for the judge and
 

1289
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,350
possible Arguments for the judge and
different possible Arguments for the

1290
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,360
different possible Arguments for the
 

1291
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,330
different possible Arguments for the
jury by the way different routes through

1292
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,340
jury by the way different routes through
 

1293
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,010
jury by the way different routes through
the you know sort of history of all the

1294
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,020
the you know sort of history of all the
 

1295
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,510
the you know sort of history of all the
of all the case law and so they said

1296
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
of all the case law and so they said
 

1297
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,430
of all the case law and so they said
actually for a lot of what we want to

1298
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
actually for a lot of what we want to
 

1299
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,570
actually for a lot of what we want to
use it for we actually want it in

1300
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:32,580
use it for we actually want it in
 

1301
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,070
use it for we actually want it in
creative mode and then basically we just

1302
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
creative mode and then basically we just
 

1303
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,970
creative mode and then basically we just
assume that we're going to have to

1304
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:34,980
assume that we're going to have to
 

1305
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,830
assume that we're going to have to
cross-check all of the um you know all

1306
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:36,840
cross-check all of the um you know all
 

1307
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,870
cross-check all of the um you know all
the specific citations and so I think I

1308
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
the specific citations and so I think I
 

1309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,070
the specific citations and so I think I
think there's could be more Shades of

1310
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
think there's could be more Shades of
 

1311
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,990
think there's could be more Shades of
Gray in here than people think and then

1312
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
Gray in here than people think and then
 

1313
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,789
Gray in here than people think and then
I just add to that you know another one

1314
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:43,799
I just add to that you know another one
 

1315
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,930
I just add to that you know another one
of these trillion dollar kind of

1316
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:44,940
of these trillion dollar kind of
 

1317
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,029
of these trillion dollar kind of
questions is ultimately you know sort of

1318
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
questions is ultimately you know sort of
 

1319
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,830
questions is ultimately you know sort of
the verification thing and so um you

1320
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:48,840
the verification thing and so um you
 

1321
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,590
the verification thing and so um you
know is will will will llms be evolved

1322
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
know is will will will llms be evolved
 

1323
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,850
know is will will will llms be evolved
from here to be able to do their own

1324
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:52,860
from here to be able to do their own
 

1325
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,830
from here to be able to do their own
fascial verification

1326
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:54,840
fascial verification
 

1327
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,270
fascial verification
um will you have sort of add-on

1328
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,280
um will you have sort of add-on
 

1329
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,070
um will you have sort of add-on
functionality like like well from alpha

1330
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
functionality like like well from alpha
 

1331
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,110
functionality like like well from alpha
right where um you know in other plugins

1332
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,120
right where um you know in other plugins
 

1333
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,490
right where um you know in other plugins
where where that's the way you do the

1334
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:01,500
where where that's the way you do the
 

1335
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,950
where where that's the way you do the
verification you know another by the way

1336
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:03,960
verification you know another by the way
 

1337
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,390
verification you know another by the way
another idea is you might have a

1338
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:05,400
another idea is you might have a
 

1339
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,130
another idea is you might have a
community of LMS on any you know so for

1340
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,140
community of LMS on any you know so for
 

1341
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,390
community of LMS on any you know so for
example you might have the creative LM

1342
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
example you might have the creative LM
 

1343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,710
example you might have the creative LM
and then you might have the literal llm

1344
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:09,720
and then you might have the literal llm
 

1345
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,750
and then you might have the literal llm
fact check it right and so there's a

1346
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
fact check it right and so there's a
 

1347
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,590
fact check it right and so there's a
variety of different technical

1348
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:12,600
variety of different technical
 

1349
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,970
variety of different technical
approaches that are being applied to

1350
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:13,980
approaches that are being applied to
 

1351
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,490
approaches that are being applied to
solve the hallucination problem um you

1352
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,500
solve the hallucination problem um you
 

1353
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,110
solve the hallucination problem um you
know some people like yeah lacun argue

1354
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,120
know some people like yeah lacun argue
 

1355
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,430
know some people like yeah lacun argue
that this is inherently an unsolvable

1356
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
that this is inherently an unsolvable
 

1357
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,110
that this is inherently an unsolvable
problem but most of the people working

1358
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
problem but most of the people working
 

1359
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,610
problem but most of the people working
in the space I think think that there's

1360
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:22,620
in the space I think think that there's
 

1361
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,049
in the space I think think that there's
a number of practical ways to kind of

1362
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:24,059
a number of practical ways to kind of
 

1363
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,789
a number of practical ways to kind of
kind of Corral this in a little bit Yeah

1364
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:25,799
kind of Corral this in a little bit Yeah
 

1365
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,770
kind of Corral this in a little bit Yeah
if you were to tell me about Wikipedia

1366
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:27,780
if you were to tell me about Wikipedia
 

1367
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,450
if you were to tell me about Wikipedia
before Wikipedia was created I would

1368
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:29,460
before Wikipedia was created I would
 

1369
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,890
before Wikipedia was created I would
have laughed at the possibility of

1370
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:30,900
have laughed at the possibility of
 

1371
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,810
have laughed at the possibility of
something like that being possible just

1372
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:32,820
something like that being possible just
 

1373
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,250
something like that being possible just
a handful of folks

1374
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,260
a handful of folks
 

1375
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,750
a handful of folks
can organize right and self and moderate

1376
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
can organize right and self and moderate
 

1377
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,529
can organize right and self and moderate
with a mostly unbiased way the entirety

1378
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:42,539
with a mostly unbiased way the entirety
 

1379
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,470
with a mostly unbiased way the entirety
of human knowledge I mean so if there's

1380
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:45,480
of human knowledge I mean so if there's
 

1381
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,789
of human knowledge I mean so if there's
something like the approach that

1382
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
something like the approach that
 

1383
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,549
something like the approach that
Wikipedia took possible for mlms

1384
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:49,559
Wikipedia took possible for mlms
 

1385
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,950
Wikipedia took possible for mlms
uh that's really exciting I think that's

1386
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:51,960
uh that's really exciting I think that's
 

1387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,870
uh that's really exciting I think that's
possible and in fact Wikipedia today is

1388
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:53,880
possible and in fact Wikipedia today is
 

1389
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,430
possible and in fact Wikipedia today is
still not today it's still not

1390
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
still not today it's still not
 

1391
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,590
still not today it's still not
deterministically correct right so you

1392
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
deterministically correct right so you
 

1393
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,510
deterministically correct right so you
cannot take to the bank right every

1394
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
cannot take to the bank right every
 

1395
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,310
cannot take to the bank right every
single thing on every single page but it

1396
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,320
single thing on every single page but it
 

1397
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,710
single thing on every single page but it
is probabilistically correct right and

1398
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:03,720
is probabilistically correct right and
 

1399
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,789
is probabilistically correct right and
specifically the way I describe

1400
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
specifically the way I describe
 

1401
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,710
specifically the way I describe
Wikipedia to people it is it is more

1402
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
Wikipedia to people it is it is more
 

1403
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,149
Wikipedia to people it is it is more
likely that Wikipedia is right than any

1404
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
likely that Wikipedia is right than any
 

1405
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,590
likely that Wikipedia is right than any
other source you're going to find yeah

1406
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
other source you're going to find yeah
 

1407
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,450
other source you're going to find yeah
it's this old question right of like

1408
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:11,460
it's this old question right of like
 

1409
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,130
it's this old question right of like
okay like are we looking for Perfection

1410
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,140
okay like are we looking for Perfection
 

1411
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,690
okay like are we looking for Perfection
are we looking for something that

1412
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:14,700
are we looking for something that
 

1413
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,610
are we looking for something that
asymptotically approaches uh Perfection

1414
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:16,620
asymptotically approaches uh Perfection
 

1415
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,930
asymptotically approaches uh Perfection
are we looking for something that's just

1416
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:17,940
are we looking for something that's just
 

1417
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,549
are we looking for something that's just
better than the Alternatives and

1418
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:19,559
better than the Alternatives and
 

1419
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,409
better than the Alternatives and
Wikipedia right has exactly your point

1420
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:21,419
Wikipedia right has exactly your point
 

1421
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,909
Wikipedia right has exactly your point
has proven to be like overwhelmingly

1422
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
has proven to be like overwhelmingly
 

1423
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,370
has proven to be like overwhelmingly
better than than uh than people thought

1424
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,380
better than than uh than people thought
 

1425
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,990
better than than uh than people thought
and I think I I think that's where this

1426
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,000
and I think I I think that's where this
 

1427
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,789
and I think I I think that's where this
this ends and then underneath all this

1428
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
this ends and then underneath all this
 

1429
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,890
this ends and then underneath all this
is the fundamental question of uh where

1430
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
is the fundamental question of uh where
 

1431
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,450
is the fundamental question of uh where
you started which is okay what you know

1432
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
you started which is okay what you know
 

1433
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,149
you started which is okay what you know
what is truth how do we get to truth how

1434
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:35,159
what is truth how do we get to truth how
 

1435
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,130
what is truth how do we get to truth how
do we know what truth is and we live in

1436
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,140
do we know what truth is and we live in
 

1437
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,690
do we know what truth is and we live in
an era in which an awful lot of people

1438
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:38,700
an era in which an awful lot of people
 

1439
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,130
an era in which an awful lot of people
are very confident that they know what

1440
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,140
are very confident that they know what
 

1441
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,230
are very confident that they know what
the truth is and I don't really buy into

1442
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
the truth is and I don't really buy into
 

1443
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,570
the truth is and I don't really buy into
that and I think the history of the last

1444
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:44,580
that and I think the history of the last
 

1445
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,190
that and I think the history of the last
you know 2000 years or four thousand

1446
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,200
you know 2000 years or four thousand
 

1447
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,450
you know 2000 years or four thousand
years of human civilization is actually

1448
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:47,460
years of human civilization is actually
 

1449
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,710
years of human civilization is actually
getting to the truth is actually a very

1450
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
getting to the truth is actually a very
 

1451
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,330
getting to the truth is actually a very
difficult thing to do are we getting

1452
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:50,340
difficult thing to do are we getting
 

1453
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,430
difficult thing to do are we getting
closer if we look at the entirety the

1454
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,440
closer if we look at the entirety the
 

1455
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,750
closer if we look at the entirety the
Ark of human history are we getting

1456
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
Ark of human history are we getting
 

1457
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,090
Ark of human history are we getting
closer to the truth I don't know

1458
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,100
closer to the truth I don't know
 

1459
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,570
closer to the truth I don't know
okay is it possible is it possible that

1460
00:22:59,570 --> 00:22:59,580
okay is it possible is it possible that
 

1461
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,250
okay is it possible is it possible that
we're getting very far away from the

1462
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,260
we're getting very far away from the
 

1463
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,870
we're getting very far away from the
truth because of the internet because of

1464
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
truth because of the internet because of
 

1465
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,990
truth because of the internet because of
how rapidly you can create narratives

1466
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
how rapidly you can create narratives
 

1467
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,690
how rapidly you can create narratives
and just as the entirety of a society

1468
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:08,700
and just as the entirety of a society
 

1469
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,669
and just as the entirety of a society
just move like crowds in a hysterical

1470
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
just move like crowds in a hysterical
 

1471
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,190
just move like crowds in a hysterical
way along those narratives that don't

1472
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,200
way along those narratives that don't
 

1473
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,770
way along those narratives that don't
have a necessary grounding in whatever

1474
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:18,780
have a necessary grounding in whatever
 

1475
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,810
have a necessary grounding in whatever
the truth is sure but like you know we

1476
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:20,820
the truth is sure but like you know we
 

1477
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,950
the truth is sure but like you know we
came up with Communism before the

1478
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:21,960
came up with Communism before the
 

1479
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,350
came up with Communism before the
internet somehow right like which was I

1480
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
internet somehow right like which was I
 

1481
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,390
internet somehow right like which was I
would say had rather larger issues than

1482
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
would say had rather larger issues than
 

1483
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,310
would say had rather larger issues than
anything we're dealing with today we had

1484
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
anything we're dealing with today we had
 

1485
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,529
anything we're dealing with today we had
in the way it was implemented at issues

1486
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:30,539
in the way it was implemented at issues
 

1487
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,630
in the way it was implemented at issues
and it's theoretical structure it had

1488
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
and it's theoretical structure it had
 

1489
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,669
and it's theoretical structure it had
like real issues did like a very deep

1490
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
like real issues did like a very deep
 

1491
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,990
like real issues did like a very deep
fundamental misunderstanding of human

1492
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
fundamental misunderstanding of human
 

1493
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,750
fundamental misunderstanding of human
nature and economics yeah but those

1494
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:38,760
nature and economics yeah but those
 

1495
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,909
nature and economics yeah but those
folks sure work very confident there was

1496
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:40,919
folks sure work very confident there was
 

1497
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,230
folks sure work very confident there was
the right way they were extremely common

1498
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
the right way they were extremely common
 

1499
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,669
the right way they were extremely common
and my point is they were very confident

1500
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
and my point is they were very confident
 

1501
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,310
and my point is they were very confident
3 900 years into what we would presume

1502
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
3 900 years into what we would presume
 

1503
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,110
3 900 years into what we would presume
to be Evolution towards the truth yeah

1504
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,120
to be Evolution towards the truth yeah
 

1505
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,529
to be Evolution towards the truth yeah
and so my my my assessment is my

1506
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:51,539
and so my my my assessment is my
 

1507
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,789
and so my my my assessment is my
assessment is number one there's no

1508
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
assessment is number one there's no
 

1509
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,610
assessment is number one there's no
there's no need for you know there's no

1510
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:55,620
there's no need for you know there's no
 

1511
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,049
there's no need for you know there's no
need for healing there's no need for the

1512
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:57,059
need for healing there's no need for the
 

1513
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,730
need for healing there's no need for the
hegelian dialectic to actually converge

1514
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:58,740
hegelian dialectic to actually converge
 

1515
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,070
hegelian dialectic to actually converge
towards the truth

1516
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
towards the truth
 

1517
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,690
towards the truth
like apparently not

1518
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:02,700
like apparently not
 

1519
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,789
like apparently not
um yeah so yeah so why we're so obsessed

1520
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
um yeah so yeah so why we're so obsessed
 

1521
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,590
um yeah so yeah so why we're so obsessed
with there being one truth is it

1522
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:06,600
with there being one truth is it
 

1523
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,730
with there being one truth is it
possible there's just going to be

1524
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:07,740
possible there's just going to be
 

1525
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,230
possible there's just going to be
multiple truth like little communities

1526
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,240
multiple truth like little communities
 

1527
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,230
multiple truth like little communities
that how they believe certain things and

1528
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
that how they believe certain things and
 

1529
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,850
that how they believe certain things and
I think it's just now number one I think

1530
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:13,860
I think it's just now number one I think
 

1531
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,890
I think it's just now number one I think
it's just really difficult like who gets

1532
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:15,900
it's just really difficult like who gets
 

1533
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,690
it's just really difficult like who gets
you know historically who gets to decide

1534
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:17,700
you know historically who gets to decide
 

1535
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,950
you know historically who gets to decide
what the truth is it's either the king

1536
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
what the truth is it's either the king
 

1537
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,049
what the truth is it's either the king
or the priest right like and so we don't

1538
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:21,059
or the priest right like and so we don't
 

1539
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,370
or the priest right like and so we don't
live in an era anymore if kings are

1540
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:22,380
live in an era anymore if kings are
 

1541
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,930
live in an era anymore if kings are
priest dictating it to us and so we're

1542
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:23,940
priest dictating it to us and so we're
 

1543
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,630
priest dictating it to us and so we're
kind of on our own and so I I my my

1544
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
kind of on our own and so I I my my
 

1545
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,669
kind of on our own and so I I my my
typical thing is like we just we just

1546
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
typical thing is like we just we just
 

1547
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,110
typical thing is like we just we just
need a huge amount of humility

1548
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,120
need a huge amount of humility
 

1549
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,310
need a huge amount of humility
um and we need to be very suspicious of

1550
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,320
um and we need to be very suspicious of
 

1551
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,450
um and we need to be very suspicious of
people who claim that they have the

1552
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,460
people who claim that they have the
 

1553
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,029
people who claim that they have the
capital yeah and then we need we need to

1554
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
capital yeah and then we need we need to
 

1555
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,470
capital yeah and then we need we need to
have I know look the good news is The

1556
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
have I know look the good news is The
 

1557
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,570
have I know look the good news is The
Enlightenment has bequeathed us with a

1558
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:38,580
Enlightenment has bequeathed us with a
 

1559
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,710
Enlightenment has bequeathed us with a
set of techniques to be able to

1560
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
set of techniques to be able to
 

1561
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,750
set of techniques to be able to
presumably get closer to truth through

1562
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
presumably get closer to truth through
 

1563
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,130
presumably get closer to truth through
the scientific method and rationality

1564
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,140
the scientific method and rationality
 

1565
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,990
the scientific method and rationality
and observation and experimentation and

1566
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,000
and observation and experimentation and
 

1567
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,330
and observation and experimentation and
hypothesis and you know we need to

1568
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,340
hypothesis and you know we need to
 

1569
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,070
hypothesis and you know we need to
continue to embrace those even when they

1570
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,080
continue to embrace those even when they
 

1571
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,070
continue to embrace those even when they
give us answers we don't like sure but

1572
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
give us answers we don't like sure but
 

1573
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,049
give us answers we don't like sure but
uh the internet and technology has

1574
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:54,059
uh the internet and technology has
 

1575
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,110
uh the internet and technology has
enabled us to uh generate a large number

1576
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
enabled us to uh generate a large number
 

1577
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,430
enabled us to uh generate a large number
of content

1578
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,440
of content
 

1579
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,750
of content
that data uh that the process the

1580
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
that data uh that the process the
 

1581
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,110
that data uh that the process the
scientific process allows us sort of

1582
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,120
scientific process allows us sort of
 

1583
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,070
scientific process allows us sort of
um damages the Hope Laden within the

1584
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
um damages the Hope Laden within the
 

1585
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,810
um damages the Hope Laden within the
scientific process because if you just

1586
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:11,820
scientific process because if you just
 

1587
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,390
scientific process because if you just
have a bunch of people saying facts

1588
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,400
have a bunch of people saying facts
 

1589
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,430
have a bunch of people saying facts
on the internet and some of them are

1590
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:16,440
on the internet and some of them are
 

1591
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,110
on the internet and some of them are
going to be llms

1592
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,120
going to be llms
 

1593
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,510
going to be llms
you how is anything testable at all

1594
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:20,520
you how is anything testable at all
 

1595
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,770
you how is anything testable at all
especially that involves like human

1596
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:21,780
especially that involves like human
 

1597
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,510
especially that involves like human
nature things like this there's a lot of

1598
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
nature things like this there's a lot of
 

1599
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,769
nature things like this there's a lot of
physics here's a question a friend of

1600
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:24,779
physics here's a question a friend of
 

1601
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,970
physics here's a question a friend of
mine just asked me on this topic so

1602
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:25,980
mine just asked me on this topic so
 

1603
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,370
mine just asked me on this topic so
suppose you had llms in equivalent of

1604
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:28,380
suppose you had llms in equivalent of
 

1605
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,649
suppose you had llms in equivalent of
gpt4 even five six seven eight suppose

1606
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:30,659
gpt4 even five six seven eight suppose
 

1607
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,870
gpt4 even five six seven eight suppose
you have them in the 1600s yeah and

1608
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
you have them in the 1600s yeah and
 

1609
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,390
you have them in the 1600s yeah and
Galileo comes up for trial yeah right

1610
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,400
Galileo comes up for trial yeah right
 

1611
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,269
Galileo comes up for trial yeah right
and you ask the llm like a Scala is

1612
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,279
and you ask the llm like a Scala is
 

1613
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,610
and you ask the llm like a Scala is
Galileo right yeah like what does it

1614
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:40,620
Galileo right yeah like what does it
 

1615
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,610
Galileo right yeah like what does it
answer right and one theory is it

1616
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:43,620
answer right and one theory is it
 

1617
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,350
answer right and one theory is it
answers nobody's wrong because the

1618
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
answers nobody's wrong because the
 

1619
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,090
answers nobody's wrong because the
overwhelming majority of human thought

1620
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,100
overwhelming majority of human thought
 

1621
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,289
overwhelming majority of human thought
up until that point was that he was

1622
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:48,299
up until that point was that he was
 

1623
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,490
up until that point was that he was
wrong and so therefore that's what's in

1624
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:49,500
wrong and so therefore that's what's in
 

1625
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,230
wrong and so therefore that's what's in
the training data yeah

1626
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,240
the training data yeah
 

1627
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,549
the training data yeah
um another way of thinking about it is

1628
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
um another way of thinking about it is
 

1629
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,409
um another way of thinking about it is
well this officially Advanced llm will

1630
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:54,419
well this officially Advanced llm will
 

1631
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,850
well this officially Advanced llm will
have evolved the ability to actually

1632
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:55,860
have evolved the ability to actually
 

1633
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,730
have evolved the ability to actually
check the math right um and we'll

1634
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:58,740
check the math right um and we'll
 

1635
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,470
check the math right um and we'll
actually say actually no actually you

1636
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
actually say actually no actually you
 

1637
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,430
actually say actually no actually you
know you may not want to hear it but

1638
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
know you may not want to hear it but
 

1639
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,710
know you may not want to hear it but
he's right now if you know the church at

1640
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:03,720
he's right now if you know the church at
 

1641
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,870
he's right now if you know the church at
that time was you know on the llm they

1642
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:05,880
that time was you know on the llm they
 

1643
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,789
that time was you know on the llm they
would have given it human you know human

1644
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:07,799
would have given it human you know human
 

1645
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,890
would have given it human you know human
feedback to prohibit it from answering

1646
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:09,900
feedback to prohibit it from answering
 

1647
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,649
feedback to prohibit it from answering
that question right and so I like to

1648
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:12,659
that question right and so I like to
 

1649
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:13,669
that question right and so I like to
take it out of our current context

1650
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
take it out of our current context
 

1651
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,990
take it out of our current context
because that like makes it very clear

1652
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,000
because that like makes it very clear
 

1653
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,570
because that like makes it very clear
those 10 questions apply today right

1654
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:17,580
those 10 questions apply today right
 

1655
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,669
those 10 questions apply today right
this is exactly the point of a huge

1656
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
this is exactly the point of a huge
 

1657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,049
this is exactly the point of a huge
amount of the human feedback training

1658
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:21,059
amount of the human feedback training
 

1659
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,430
amount of the human feedback training
that's actually happening with these LMS

1660
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,440
that's actually happening with these LMS
 

1661
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,930
that's actually happening with these LMS
today this is a huge like debate that's

1662
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:23,940
today this is a huge like debate that's
 

1663
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,430
today this is a huge like debate that's
happening about whether open source you

1664
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
happening about whether open source you
 

1665
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,950
happening about whether open source you
know AI should be legal or the the the

1666
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:27,960
know AI should be legal or the the the
 

1667
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,490
know AI should be legal or the the the
actual mechanism of doing the human RL

1668
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,500
actual mechanism of doing the human RL
 

1669
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,529
actual mechanism of doing the human RL
with human feedback

1670
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:33,539
with human feedback
 

1671
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,649
with human feedback
is seems like such a fundamental and

1672
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:36,659
is seems like such a fundamental and
 

1673
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,269
is seems like such a fundamental and
fascinating question how do you select

1674
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:38,279
fascinating question how do you select
 

1675
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,190
fascinating question how do you select
the humans exactly

1676
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,200
the humans exactly
 

1677
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,990
the humans exactly
yeah how do you select a human AI

1678
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
yeah how do you select a human AI
 

1679
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,149
yeah how do you select a human AI
alignment right which everybody like is

1680
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
alignment right which everybody like is
 

1681
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,529
alignment right which everybody like is
like oh that sounds great alignment with

1682
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:45,539
like oh that sounds great alignment with
 

1683
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,269
like oh that sounds great alignment with
what human values

1684
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
what human values
 

1685
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,090
what human values
whose human values who's human values so

1686
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,100
whose human values who's human values so
 

1687
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,310
whose human values who's human values so
we're and we're in this mode of like

1688
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
we're and we're in this mode of like
 

1689
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,110
we're and we're in this mode of like
social and popular discourse we're like

1690
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,120
social and popular discourse we're like
 

1691
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,169
social and popular discourse we're like
you know there's you know you see this

1692
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:56,179
you know there's you know you see this
 

1693
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,010
you know there's you know you see this
what do you think of when you read a

1694
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,020
what do you think of when you read a
 

1695
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,029
what do you think of when you read a
story in the Press right now and they

1696
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
story in the Press right now and they
 

1697
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,070
story in the Press right now and they
say you know XYZ made a baseless claim

1698
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,080
say you know XYZ made a baseless claim
 

1699
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,649
say you know XYZ made a baseless claim
about some topic right and there's one

1700
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:03,659
about some topic right and there's one
 

1701
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,210
about some topic right and there's one
group of people who are like aha think

1702
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,220
group of people who are like aha think
 

1703
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,350
group of people who are like aha think
you know they're doing fact checking

1704
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,360
you know they're doing fact checking
 

1705
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,850
you know they're doing fact checking
there's another group of people that are

1706
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:07,860
there's another group of people that are
 

1707
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,230
there's another group of people that are
like every time the Press says that it's

1708
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,240
like every time the Press says that it's
 

1709
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,549
like every time the Press says that it's
now a tech and that means that they're

1710
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
now a tech and that means that they're
 

1711
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,370
now a tech and that means that they're
lying right like

1712
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,380
lying right like
 

1713
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,710
lying right like
so like we're in this we're in this

1714
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:15,720
so like we're in this we're in this
 

1715
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,210
so like we're in this we're in this
social context where there's the the

1716
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:17,220
social context where there's the the
 

1717
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,190
social context where there's the the
level to which a lot of people in

1718
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
level to which a lot of people in
 

1719
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,870
level to which a lot of people in
positions of power have become very very

1720
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
positions of power have become very very
 

1721
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,610
positions of power have become very very
certain that they're in a position to

1722
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:22,620
certain that they're in a position to
 

1723
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,930
certain that they're in a position to
determine the truth for the entire

1724
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:23,940
determine the truth for the entire
 

1725
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,510
determine the truth for the entire
population is like there's like there's

1726
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,520
population is like there's like there's
 

1727
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,010
population is like there's like there's
like some bubble that has formed around

1728
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,020
like some bubble that has formed around
 

1729
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,649

like okay because these questions right
this question heads towards it's like

1766

One somehow that switched you know like

1846
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:22,500
One somehow that switched you know like
 

1847
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,350
One somehow that switched you know like
and I'm not even making a value judgment

1848
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,360
and I'm not even making a value judgment
 

1849
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,549
and I'm not even making a value judgment
of these things I'm just saying like we

1850
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:25,559
of these things I'm just saying like we
 

1851
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,490
of these things I'm just saying like we
the way that our ancestors experienced

1852
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:28,500
the way that our ancestors experienced
 

1853
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,350
the way that our ancestors experienced
reality was of course mediated through

1854
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,360
reality was of course mediated through
 

1855
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,389
reality was of course mediated through
centralized top down right control at

1856
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
centralized top down right control at
 

1857
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,289
centralized top down right control at
that point

1858
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:33,299
that point
 

1859
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,630
that point
if you if you ran those realities again

1860
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
if you if you ran those realities again
 

1861
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,450
if you if you ran those realities again
with the media environment we have today

1862
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:37,460
with the media environment we have today
 

1863
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,830
with the media environment we have today
the reality would the reality would be

1864
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
the reality would the reality would be
 

1865
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,149
the reality would the reality would be
experienced very very differently and

1866
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:41,159
experienced very very differently and
 

1867
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,250
experienced very very differently and
then of course that that intermediation

1868
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,260
then of course that that intermediation
 

1869
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,810
then of course that that intermediation
would cause the feedback loops to change

1870
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:44,820
would cause the feedback loops to change
 

1871
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,070
would cause the feedback loops to change
and then reality would obviously play

1872
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
and then reality would obviously play
 

1873
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,570
and then reality would obviously play
out do you think you think it'd be very

1874
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:47,580
out do you think you think it'd be very
 

1875
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,549
out do you think you think it'd be very
different yeah it has to be it has to be

1876
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:49,559
different yeah it has to be it has to be
 

1877
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,289
different yeah it has to be it has to be
just because it's also I mean just look

1878
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,299
just because it's also I mean just look
 

1879
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,909
just because it's also I mean just look
at what's happening today I mean just I

1880
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:52,919
at what's happening today I mean just I
 

1881
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,350
at what's happening today I mean just I
mean the most obvious thing is just the

1882
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,360
mean the most obvious thing is just the
 

1883
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,389
mean the most obvious thing is just the
the collapse and here's another

1884
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
the collapse and here's another
 

1885
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,889
the collapse and here's another
opportunity to argue that this is not

1886
00:29:57,889 --> 00:29:57,899
opportunity to argue that this is not
 

1887
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,810
opportunity to argue that this is not
the internet causing this by the way

1888
00:29:59,810 --> 00:29:59,820
the internet causing this by the way
 

1889
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,889
the internet causing this by the way
um here's a big thing happening today

1890
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:00,899
um here's a big thing happening today
 

1891
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,450
um here's a big thing happening today
which is uh Gallup does this thing every

1892
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:02,460
which is uh Gallup does this thing every
 

1893
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,010
which is uh Gallup does this thing every
year where they do they pull for trust

1894
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,020
year where they do they pull for trust
 

1895
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,870
year where they do they pull for trust
in institutions in America and they do

1896
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:05,880
in institutions in America and they do
 

1897
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,130
in institutions in America and they do
it across holiday of everything from the

1898
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:07,140
it across holiday of everything from the
 

1899
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,690
it across holiday of everything from the
military to clergy and big business and

1900
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:08,700
military to clergy and big business and
 

1901
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,090
military to clergy and big business and
the media and so forth right

1902
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,100
the media and so forth right
 

1903
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,590
the media and so forth right
um and basically there's been a systemic

1904
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:12,600
um and basically there's been a systemic
 

1905
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,630
um and basically there's been a systemic
collapse um interest in institutions in

1906
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
collapse um interest in institutions in
 

1907
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,789
collapse um interest in institutions in
the U.S almost without exception uh

1908
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
the U.S almost without exception uh
 

1909
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,169
the U.S almost without exception uh
basically since essentially the early

1910
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:18,179
basically since essentially the early
 

1911
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,330
basically since essentially the early
1970s

1912
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:20,340
1970s
 

1913
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,830
1970s
um there's two ways of looking at that

1914
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
um there's two ways of looking at that
 

1915
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,389
um there's two ways of looking at that
which is oh my God we've lost this old

1916
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:23,399
which is oh my God we've lost this old
 

1917
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,409
which is oh my God we've lost this old
world and wish we could trust

1918
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:24,419
world and wish we could trust
 

1919
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:25,850
world and wish we could trust
institutions and that was so much better

1920
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:25,860
institutions and that was so much better
 

1921
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,049
institutions and that was so much better
because like that should be the way the

1922
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:27,059
because like that should be the way the
 

1923
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,130
because like that should be the way the
world runs the other way of looking at

1924
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,140
world runs the other way of looking at
 

1925
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,110
world runs the other way of looking at
it is we just know a lot more now and

1926
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,120
it is we just know a lot more now and
 

1927
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,250
it is we just know a lot more now and
the great mystery is why those numbers

1928
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:31,260
the great mystery is why those numbers
 

1929
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,430
the great mystery is why those numbers
aren't all zero yeah right because like

1930
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:34,440
aren't all zero yeah right because like
 

1931
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,570
aren't all zero yeah right because like
now we know so much about how these

1932
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:35,580
now we know so much about how these
 

1933
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,649
now we know so much about how these
things operate and like they're not that

1934
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:36,659
things operate and like they're not that
 

1935
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,549
things operate and like they're not that
impressive

1936
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:37,559
impressive
 

1937
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,070
impressive
and and also why do we don't have uh

1938
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
and and also why do we don't have uh
 

1939
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,630
and and also why do we don't have uh
better institutions and better leaders

1940
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:41,640
better institutions and better leaders
 

1941
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,669
better institutions and better leaders
then yeah and so so this goes to the

1942
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
then yeah and so so this goes to the
 

1943
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,230
then yeah and so so this goes to the
thing which is like okay have we had the

1944
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,240
thing which is like okay have we had the
 

1945
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,450
thing which is like okay have we had the
media environment of that we've had

1946
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:47,460
media environment of that we've had
 

1947
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,130
media environment of that we've had
between the 1970s and today if we had

1948
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,140
between the 1970s and today if we had
 

1949
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,789
between the 1970s and today if we had
that in the 30s and 40s or 1900s 1910s I

1950
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
that in the 30s and 40s or 1900s 1910s I
 

1951
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,870
that in the 30s and 40s or 1900s 1910s I
think there's no question reality it

1952
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:53,880
think there's no question reality it
 

1953
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,130
think there's no question reality it
turned out different if only because

1954
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,140
turned out different if only because
 

1955
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,750
turned out different if only because
everybody would have known to not trust

1956
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:56,760
everybody would have known to not trust
 

1957
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,730
everybody would have known to not trust
the institutions which would have

1958
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:58,740
the institutions which would have
 

1959
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,169
the institutions which would have
changed their level of credibility their

1960
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:00,179
changed their level of credibility their
 

1961
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,490
changed their level of credibility their
ability to control circumstances

1962
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:01,500
ability to control circumstances
 

1963
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,049
ability to control circumstances
therefore the circumstances would have

1964
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:03,059
therefore the circumstances would have
 

1965
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,029
therefore the circumstances would have
had to change right and it would have

1966
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
had to change right and it would have
 

1967
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,110
had to change right and it would have
been a feedback it was it would have

1968
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,120
been a feedback it was it would have
 

1969
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,610
been a feedback it was it would have
been a feedback loop process in other

1970
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:07,620
been a feedback loop process in other
 

1971
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,289
been a feedback loop process in other
words right it's it's it's it's your

1972
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:09,299
words right it's it's it's it's your
 

1973
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,610
words right it's it's it's it's your
experience your experience of reality

1974
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:10,620
experience your experience of reality
 

1975
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,529
experience your experience of reality
changes reality and then reality changes

1976
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:12,539
changes reality and then reality changes
 

1977
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,090
changes reality and then reality changes
your experience of reality right it's

1978
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,100
your experience of reality right it's
 

1979
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,830
your experience of reality right it's
it's a two-way feedback process and

1980
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
it's a two-way feedback process and
 

1981
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,750
it's a two-way feedback process and
media is the intermediating force

1982
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
media is the intermediating force
 

1983
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,549
media is the intermediating force
between that so change the media

1984
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:19,559
between that so change the media
 

1985
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,830
between that so change the media
environment change reality yeah and so

1986
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
environment change reality yeah and so
 

1987
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,990
environment change reality yeah and so
it's just so just as a consequence I

1988
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
it's just so just as a consequence I
 

1989
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,789
it's just so just as a consequence I
think it's just really hard to say oh

1990
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:25,799
think it's just really hard to say oh
 

1991
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,590
think it's just really hard to say oh
things worked a certain way then and

1992
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
things worked a certain way then and
 

1993
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,330
things worked a certain way then and
they work a different way now and then

1994
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:29,340
they work a different way now and then
 

1995
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,430
they work a different way now and then
therefore like people were smarter than

1996
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
therefore like people were smarter than
 

1997
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,649
therefore like people were smarter than
or better than or you know by the way

1998
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:33,659
or better than or you know by the way
 

1999
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,889
or better than or you know by the way
dumber than or not as capable than right

2000
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:36,899
dumber than or not as capable than right
 

2001
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,350
dumber than or not as capable than right
we make all these like really light and

2002
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
we make all these like really light and
 

2003
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,389
we make all these like really light and
Casual like comparisons of ourselves to

2004
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:41,399
Casual like comparisons of ourselves to
 

2005
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,889
Casual like comparisons of ourselves to
you know previous generations of people

2006
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:42,899
you know previous generations of people
 

2007
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,389
you know previous generations of people
you know we draw judgments all the time

2008
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
you know we draw judgments all the time
 

2009
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,590
you know we draw judgments all the time
and I just think it's like really hard

2010
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
and I just think it's like really hard
 

2011
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,690
and I just think it's like really hard
to do any of that because if we if we

2012
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:47,700
to do any of that because if we if we
 

2013
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,889
to do any of that because if we if we
put ourselves in their shoes with the

2014
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:48,899
put ourselves in their shoes with the
 

2015
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,990
put ourselves in their shoes with the
media that they had at that time like I

2016
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,000
media that they had at that time like I
 

2017
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,310
media that they had at that time like I
think we probably most likely would have

2018
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
think we probably most likely would have
 

2019
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,190
think we probably most likely would have
been just like them don't you think that

2020
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
been just like them don't you think that
 

2021
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,789
been just like them don't you think that
our perception and understanding of

2022
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
our perception and understanding of
 

2023
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,529
our perception and understanding of
reality would you be more and more

2024
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:00,539
reality would you be more and more
 

2025
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,510
reality would you be more and more
mediated through large language models

2026
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:02,520
mediated through large language models
 

2027
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,649
mediated through large language models
now so you said media before

2028
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:05,659
now so you said media before
 

2029
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,630
now so you said media before
isn't the llm going to be the new what

2030
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
isn't the llm going to be the new what
 

2031
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,789
isn't the llm going to be the new what
is it mainstream media MSM it'll be llm

2032
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
is it mainstream media MSM it'll be llm
 

2033
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,710
is it mainstream media MSM it'll be llm
that would be the source of uh I'm sure

2034
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,720
that would be the source of uh I'm sure
 

2035
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,330
that would be the source of uh I'm sure
there's a way to kind of rapidly

2036
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,340
there's a way to kind of rapidly
 

2037
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,669
there's a way to kind of rapidly
fine-tune like making llms real time I'm

2038
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
fine-tune like making llms real time I'm
 

2039
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,830
fine-tune like making llms real time I'm
sure there's as probably a research

2040
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:21,840
sure there's as probably a research
 

2041
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,930
sure there's as probably a research
problem that you can uh do just rapid

2042
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:23,940
problem that you can uh do just rapid
 

2043
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,789
problem that you can uh do just rapid
fine tuning to the new events so

2044
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:25,799
fine tuning to the new events so
 

2045
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,889
fine tuning to the new events so
something like this well even just the

2046
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:27,899
something like this well even just the
 

2047
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,810
something like this well even just the
whole concept of the chat UI might not

2048
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:29,820
whole concept of the chat UI might not
 

2049
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,370
whole concept of the chat UI might not
be the like the chat UI is just the

2050
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,380
be the like the chat UI is just the
 

2051
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,630
be the like the chat UI is just the
first whack at this and maybe that's the

2052
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
first whack at this and maybe that's the
 

2053
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,250
first whack at this and maybe that's the
dominant thing but look maybe maybe or

2054
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,260
dominant thing but look maybe maybe or
 

2055
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,630
dominant thing but look maybe maybe or
maybe we don't we don't know yet like

2056
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:35,640
maybe we don't we don't know yet like
 

2057
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,830
maybe we don't we don't know yet like
maybe the experience most people with

2058
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:36,840
maybe the experience most people with
 

2059
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,930
maybe the experience most people with
LMS is just a continuous feed

2060
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:38,940
LMS is just a continuous feed
 

2061
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,730
LMS is just a continuous feed
you know maybe it's more of a passive

2062
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:40,740
you know maybe it's more of a passive
 

2063
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,289
you know maybe it's more of a passive
feed and you just are getting a constant

2064
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:42,299
feed and you just are getting a constant
 

2065
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,370
feed and you just are getting a constant
like running commentary on everything

2066
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:43,380
like running commentary on everything
 

2067
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,570
like running commentary on everything
happening in your life and it's just

2068
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:44,580
happening in your life and it's just
 

2069
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,710
happening in your life and it's just
helping you kind of interpret and

2070
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:45,720
helping you kind of interpret and
 

2071
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,690
helping you kind of interpret and
understand everything also really more

2072
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:47,700
understand everything also really more
 

2073
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,310
understand everything also really more
deeply integrated into your life not

2074
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,320
deeply integrated into your life not
 

2075
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,250
deeply integrated into your life not
just like oh uh like intellectual

2076
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:52,260
just like oh uh like intellectual
 

2077
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,450
just like oh uh like intellectual
philosophical thoughts but like

2078
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:53,460
philosophical thoughts but like
 

2079
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,810
philosophical thoughts but like
literally uh like how to make a coffee

2080
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:56,820
literally uh like how to make a coffee
 

2081

where to go for lunch just uh whether
it's you know dating all this kind of

2084
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:02,820
it's you know dating all this kind of
 

2085
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,950
it's you know dating all this kind of
stuff to stay in a job interview yeah

2086
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:03,960
stuff to stay in a job interview yeah
 

2087
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,810
stuff to stay in a job interview yeah
we'll just say yeah we'll just say

2088
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:05,820
we'll just say yeah we'll just say
 

2089
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,909
we'll just say yeah we'll just say
next sentence yeah next sentence yeah at

2090
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
next sentence yeah next sentence yeah at
 

2091
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,409
next sentence yeah next sentence yeah at
that level yeah I mean yes so

2092
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:09,419
that level yeah I mean yes so
 

2093
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,029
that level yeah I mean yes so
technically no whether we want that or

2094
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
technically no whether we want that or
 

2095
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,970
technically no whether we want that or
not is an open question right

2096
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:12,980
not is an open question right
 

2097
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,669
not is an open question right
a pop-up a pop-up right now the

2098
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:16,679
a pop-up a pop-up right now the
 

2099
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,430
a pop-up a pop-up right now the
estimated engagement using is decreasing

2100
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
estimated engagement using is decreasing
 

2101
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,310
estimated engagement using is decreasing
for marketing reasons there's a

2102
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,320
for marketing reasons there's a
 

2103
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,930
for marketing reasons there's a
controversy uh section for his Wikipedia

2104
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:23,940
controversy uh section for his Wikipedia
 

2105
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,230
controversy uh section for his Wikipedia
page in 1993 something happened or

2106
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,240
page in 1993 something happened or
 

2107
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,090
page in 1993 something happened or
something like this bring it up that

2108
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,100
something like this bring it up that
 

2109
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,889
something like this bring it up that
will drive engagement up anyway yeah

2110
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:30,899
will drive engagement up anyway yeah
 

2111
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,529
will drive engagement up anyway yeah
that's right I mean look this gets this

2112
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:33,539
that's right I mean look this gets this
 

2113
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:34,610
that's right I mean look this gets this
whole thing of like so you know the chat

2114
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:34,620
whole thing of like so you know the chat
 

2115
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,870
whole thing of like so you know the chat
interface has this whole concept of

2116
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:35,880
interface has this whole concept of
 

2117
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,149
interface has this whole concept of
prompt engineering right so yes well it

2118
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
prompt engineering right so yes well it
 

2119
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,649
prompt engineering right so yes well it
turns out one of the things that all of

2120
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:39,659
turns out one of the things that all of
 

2121
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,889
turns out one of the things that all of
them are really good at is writing props

2122
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:41,899
them are really good at is writing props
 

2123
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:45,049
them are really good at is writing props
right yeah and so like what if you just

2124
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:45,059
right yeah and so like what if you just
 

2125
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,669
right yeah and so like what if you just
outsourced and by the way you could run

2126
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:46,679
outsourced and by the way you could run
 

2127
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:47,690
outsourced and by the way you could run
this experiment today you could hook

2128
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:47,700
this experiment today you could hook
 

2129
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,009
this experiment today you could hook
this up to do this today the latency is

2130
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:49,019
this up to do this today the latency is
 

2131
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,210
this up to do this today the latency is
not good enough to do it real time in a

2132
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,220
not good enough to do it real time in a
 

2133
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,350
not good enough to do it real time in a
conversation but you could you could run

2134
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
conversation but you could you could run
 

2135
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,730
conversation but you could you could run
this experiment and you just say look

2136
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:52,740
this experiment and you just say look
 

2137
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,769
this experiment and you just say look
every 20 seconds you could just say you

2138
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:54,779
every 20 seconds you could just say you
 

2139
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,110
every 20 seconds you could just say you
know you know tell me what the optimal

2140
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
know you know tell me what the optimal
 

2141
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,669
know you know tell me what the optimal
prompt is and then ask yourself that

2142
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:58,679
prompt is and then ask yourself that
 

2143
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,470
prompt is and then ask yourself that
question to give me the result

2144
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
question to give me the result
 

2145
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,389
question to give me the result
um and then as as you use exactly to

2146
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
um and then as as you use exactly to
 

2147
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,710
um and then as as you use exactly to
your point is you add there will be

2148
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:03,720
your point is you add there will be
 

2149
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,909
your point is you add there will be
there will be these systems are going to

2150
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:04,919
there will be these systems are going to
 

2151
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:05,930
there will be these systems are going to
have the ability to be learned and

2152
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:05,940
have the ability to be learned and
 

2153
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,490
have the ability to be learned and
updated essentially in real time and so

2154
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,500
updated essentially in real time and so
 

2155
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,409
updated essentially in real time and so
you'll be able to have a pendant or your

2156
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:09,419
you'll be able to have a pendant or your
 

2157
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:10,430
you'll be able to have a pendant or your
phone or whatever watch or whatever

2158
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:10,440
phone or whatever watch or whatever
 

2159
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,810
phone or whatever watch or whatever
it'll have a microphone on it it'll

2160
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:11,820
it'll have a microphone on it it'll
 

2161
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,030
it'll have a microphone on it it'll
listen to your conversations it'll have

2162
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,040
listen to your conversations it'll have
 

2163
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,169
listen to your conversations it'll have
a feed of everything else happen in the

2164
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:15,179
a feed of everything else happen in the
 

2165
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,609
a feed of everything else happen in the
world and then it'll be you know sort of

2166
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:16,619
world and then it'll be you know sort of
 

2167
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,109
world and then it'll be you know sort of
retraining prompting or retraining

2168
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:18,119
retraining prompting or retraining
 

2169
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,909
retraining prompting or retraining
itself on the Fly um and so the scenario

2170
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
itself on the Fly um and so the scenario
 

2171
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,710
itself on the Fly um and so the scenario
you described is actually a completely

2172
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:21,720
you described is actually a completely
 

2173
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,349
you described is actually a completely
doable scenario now the hard question on

2174
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:24,359
doable scenario now the hard question on
 

2175
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,730
doable scenario now the hard question on
this is always okay since that's

2176
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:25,740
this is always okay since that's
 

2177
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,290
this is always okay since that's
possible are people going to want that

2178
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,300
possible are people going to want that
 

2179
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,869
possible are people going to want that
like what's the form of experience you

2180
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:29,879
like what's the form of experience you
 

2181
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,070
like what's the form of experience you
know that that way we won't know until

2182
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,080
know that that way we won't know until
 

2183
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,389
know that that way we won't know until
we try it but I don't think it's

2184
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
we try it but I don't think it's
 

2185
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,690
we try it but I don't think it's
possible yet to predict the form of AI

2186
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:35,700
possible yet to predict the form of AI
 

2187
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,310
possible yet to predict the form of AI
in our lives therefore it's not possible

2188
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:37,320
in our lives therefore it's not possible
 

2189
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,810
in our lives therefore it's not possible
to predict the way in which it will

2190
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:38,820
to predict the way in which it will
 

2191
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,369
to predict the way in which it will
intermediate our experience with reality

2192
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:40,379
intermediate our experience with reality
 

2193
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,070
intermediate our experience with reality
yet yeah but it feels like there's going

2194
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,080
yet yeah but it feels like there's going
 

2195
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,710
yet yeah but it feels like there's going
to be a killer app there's probably a

2196
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:45,720
to be a killer app there's probably a
 

2197
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,690
to be a killer app there's probably a
mad scramble right now inside open Ai

2198
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:47,700
mad scramble right now inside open Ai
 

2199
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,570
mad scramble right now inside open Ai
and Microsoft and Google in meta and

2200
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:50,580
and Microsoft and Google in meta and
 

2201
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,669
and Microsoft and Google in meta and
then startups and smaller companies

2202
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:52,679
then startups and smaller companies
 

2203
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,530
then startups and smaller companies
figuring out what is the killer app

2204
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:54,540
figuring out what is the killer app
 

2205
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,210
figuring out what is the killer app
because it feels like

2206
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,220
because it feels like
 

2207
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,910
because it feels like
it's possible like a Chad GPT type of

2208
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:58,920
it's possible like a Chad GPT type of
 

2209
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,829
it's possible like a Chad GPT type of
thing it's possible to build that but

2210
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
thing it's possible to build that but
 

2211
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,430
thing it's possible to build that but
that's 10x more compelling using already

2212
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,440
that's 10x more compelling using already
 

2213
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,650
that's 10x more compelling using already
the llms we have using even the open

2214
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:06,660
the llms we have using even the open
 

2215
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,630
the llms we have using even the open
source llms llama and the different

2216
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
source llms llama and the different
 

2217
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,609
source llms llama and the different
variants

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:10,619
variants
 

2219
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,190
variants
um this is here investing in a lot of

2220
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
um this is here investing in a lot of
 

2221
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,870
um this is here investing in a lot of
companies and you're paying attention

2222
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
companies and you're paying attention
 

2223
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,790
companies and you're paying attention
who do you think is going to win this

2224
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
who do you think is going to win this
 

2225
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,530
who do you think is going to win this
you think they'll be

2226
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:18,540
you think they'll be
 

2227
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,630
you think they'll be
who's gonna be the next page rank

trillion dollar question

2232
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:23,640
trillion dollar question
 

2233
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,130
trillion dollar question
um another one we have a few of those

2234
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,140
um another one we have a few of those
 

2235
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,050
um another one we have a few of those
today a bunch of those so look there's a

2236
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,060
today a bunch of those so look there's a
 

2237
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,370
today a bunch of those so look there's a
really big question today sitting here

2238
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:28,380
really big question today sitting here
 

2239
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,569
really big question today sitting here
today is a really big question about the

2240
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:29,579
today is a really big question about the
 

2241
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,670
today is a really big question about the
big models versus the small models

2242
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
big models versus the small models
 

2243
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,930
big models versus the small models
um that's related directly to the big

2244
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:32,940
um that's related directly to the big
 

2245
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,990
um that's related directly to the big
question of proprietary versus open

2246
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
question of proprietary versus open
 

2247
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,550
question of proprietary versus open
um then there's this big question of of

2248
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:37,560
um then there's this big question of of
 

2249
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,410
um then there's this big question of of
you know where is the training data kind

2250
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:39,420
you know where is the training data kind
 

2251
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,730
you know where is the training data kind
of like are we topping out on the

2252
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:40,740
of like are we topping out on the
 

2253
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,109
of like are we topping out on the
training data or not and then are we

2254
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,119
training data or not and then are we
 

2255
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,370
training data or not and then are we
going to be able to synthesize training

2256
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:43,380
going to be able to synthesize training
 

2257
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,530
going to be able to synthesize training
data and then there's a huge pile of

2258
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:45,540
data and then there's a huge pile of
 

2259
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,210
data and then there's a huge pile of
questions around regulation

2260
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:47,220
questions around regulation
 

2261
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,349
questions around regulation
um and you know what's actually going to

2262
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:48,359
um and you know what's actually going to
 

2263
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,630
um and you know what's actually going to
be legal um and so I would I when we

2264
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
be legal um and so I would I when we
 

2265
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,250
be legal um and so I would I when we
think about it we dovetail kind of all

2266
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,260
think about it we dovetail kind of all
 

2267
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,230
think about it we dovetail kind of all
those All Those Questions together

2268
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
those All Those Questions together
 

2269
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,790
those All Those Questions together
you can paint a picture of the world

2270
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:55,800
you can paint a picture of the world
 

2271
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,250
you can paint a picture of the world
where there's two or three God models

2272
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:58,260
where there's two or three God models
 

2273
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,650
where there's two or three God models
that are just at like staggering scale

2274
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:00,660
that are just at like staggering scale
 

2275
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,290
that are just at like staggering scale
um and they're just better at everything

2276
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:03,300
um and they're just better at everything
 

2277
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,210
um and they're just better at everything
um and they will be owned by a small set

2278
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:05,220
um and they will be owned by a small set
 

2279
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,349
um and they will be owned by a small set
of companies and they will basically

2280
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:06,359
of companies and they will basically
 

2281
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,849
of companies and they will basically
achieve regulatory capture over the

2282
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:07,859
achieve regulatory capture over the
 

2283
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:08,930
achieve regulatory capture over the
government and they'll have competitive

2284
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:08,940
government and they'll have competitive
 

2285
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,310
government and they'll have competitive
barriers that will prevent other people

2286
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
barriers that will prevent other people
 

2287
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,109
barriers that will prevent other people
from you know competing with them and so

2288
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:12,119
from you know competing with them and so
 

2289
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,730
from you know competing with them and so
you know there will be you know just

2290
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:13,740
you know there will be you know just
 

2291
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,510
you know there will be you know just
like there's like you know whatever

2292
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:14,520
like there's like you know whatever
 

2293
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,550
like there's like you know whatever
three big Banks or three big you know or

2294
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
three big Banks or three big you know or
 

2295
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,930
three big Banks or three big you know or
by the way three big search companies or

2296
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:17,940
by the way three big search companies or
 

2297
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,490
by the way three big search companies or
I guess two now you know it'll

2298
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:19,500
I guess two now you know it'll
 

2299
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,170
I guess two now you know it'll
centralize like that

2300
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,180
centralize like that
 

2301
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,849
centralize like that
um you can paint another very different

2302
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:22,859
um you can paint another very different
 

2303
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,010
um you can paint another very different
picture that says no um actually the

2304
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,020
picture that says no um actually the
 

2305
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,630
picture that says no um actually the
opposite of that's going to happen this

2306
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
opposite of that's going to happen this
 

2307
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,670
opposite of that's going to happen this
is going to basically that this is the

2308
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:28,680
is going to basically that this is the
 

2309
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,810
is going to basically that this is the
new goal you know this is the new Gold

2310
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:29,820
new goal you know this is the new Gold
 

2311
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,930
new goal you know this is the new Gold
Rush Alchemy like you know this is the

2312
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:32,940
Rush Alchemy like you know this is the
 

2313
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,490
Rush Alchemy like you know this is the
this is the big bang for this whole new

2314
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:34,500
this is the big bang for this whole new
 

2315
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,890
this is the big bang for this whole new
area of of Science and Technology and so

2316
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:36,900
area of of Science and Technology and so
 

2317
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,970
area of of Science and Technology and so
therefore you're gonna have every smart

2318
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:37,980
therefore you're gonna have every smart
 

2319
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,410
therefore you're gonna have every smart
14 year old on the planet Building open

2320
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:39,420
14 year old on the planet Building open
 

2321
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,089
14 year old on the planet Building open
source right you know you didn't figure

2322
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:41,099
source right you know you didn't figure
 

2323
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,250
source right you know you didn't figure
out a ways to optimize these things

2324
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:43,260
out a ways to optimize these things
 

2325
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,450
out a ways to optimize these things
um and then you know we're just gonna

2326
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:44,460
um and then you know we're just gonna
 

2327
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,829
um and then you know we're just gonna
get like overwhelmingly better at

2328
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
get like overwhelmingly better at
 

2329
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,390
get like overwhelmingly better at
generating trading data if we're gonna

2330
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,400
generating trading data if we're gonna
 

2331
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,589
generating trading data if we're gonna
you know bring in like blockchain

2332
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:48,599
you know bring in like blockchain
 

2333
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,970
you know bring in like blockchain
networks to have like an economic

2334
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:49,980
networks to have like an economic
 

2335
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,109
networks to have like an economic
incentive to generate decentralized

2336
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
incentive to generate decentralized
 

2337
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,450
incentive to generate decentralized
training data and so forth and so on and

2338
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:53,460
training data and so forth and so on and
 

2339
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,829
training data and so forth and so on and
then basically we're going to live in a

2340
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:54,839
then basically we're going to live in a
 

2341
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,390
then basically we're going to live in a
world of Open Source and there's going

2342
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
world of Open Source and there's going
 

2343
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,910
world of Open Source and there's going
to be a billion llms right of every size

2344
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:58,920
to be a billion llms right of every size
 

2345
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,530
to be a billion llms right of every size
scale shape and description and there

2346
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:00,540
scale shape and description and there
 

2347
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,730
scale shape and description and there
might be a few big ones that are like

2348
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:01,740
might be a few big ones that are like
 

2349
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,410
might be a few big ones that are like
the Super Genius ones but like mostly

2350
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,420
the Super Genius ones but like mostly
 

2351
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,270
the Super Genius ones but like mostly
what we'll experience is open source and

2352
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
what we'll experience is open source and
 

2353
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,470
what we'll experience is open source and
that's you know that's more like a world

2354
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
that's you know that's more like a world
 

2355
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,849
that's you know that's more like a world
of like what we have today with like

2356
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:07,859
of like what we have today with like
 

2357
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,069
of like what we have today with like
Linux and the web

2358
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
Linux and the web
 

2359
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,250
Linux and the web
um so okay but uh hey you you painted

2360
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,260
um so okay but uh hey you you painted
 

2361
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,930
um so okay but uh hey you you painted
these two worlds but there's also uh

2362
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:14,940
these two worlds but there's also uh
 

2363
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,430
these two worlds but there's also uh
variations of those worlds because it's

2364
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,440
variations of those worlds because it's
 

2365
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,050
variations of those worlds because it's
a regulatory capture is possible to have

2366
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:18,060
a regulatory capture is possible to have
 

2367
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,370
a regulatory capture is possible to have
these Tech Giants that don't have

2368
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,380
these Tech Giants that don't have
 

2369
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,690
these Tech Giants that don't have
regulatory capture which is something

2370
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:20,700
regulatory capture which is something
 

2371
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,030
regulatory capture which is something
you're also calling for saying it's okay

2372
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
you're also calling for saying it's okay
 

2373
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,010
you're also calling for saying it's okay
to have big companies working on this

2374
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,020
to have big companies working on this
 

2375
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,930
to have big companies working on this
stuff as long as they don't achieve

2376
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:26,940
stuff as long as they don't achieve
 

2377
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,710
stuff as long as they don't achieve
regulatory capture uh but I have this

2378
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
regulatory capture uh but I have this
 

2379
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,849
regulatory capture uh but I have this
sense

2380
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:31,859
sense
 

2381
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,370
sense
that uh there's just going to be a new

2382
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,380
that uh there's just going to be a new
 

2383
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,990
that uh there's just going to be a new
startup

2384
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
startup
 

2385
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,630
startup
that's going to basically be the

2386
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
that's going to basically be the
 

2387
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,750
that's going to basically be the
pagerank inventor which has become the

2388
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
pagerank inventor which has become the
 

2389
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,910
pagerank inventor which has become the
new Tech Giant

2390
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
new Tech Giant
 

2391
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,589
new Tech Giant
I don't know I would love to hear your

2392
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
I don't know I would love to hear your
 

2393
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,589
I don't know I would love to hear your
kind of opinion if Google meta

2394
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:48,599
kind of opinion if Google meta
 

2395
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,950
kind of opinion if Google meta
and Microsoft there as gigantic

2396
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:51,960
and Microsoft there as gigantic

create new products like some of it is

2400
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
create new products like some of it is
 

2401
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,810
create new products like some of it is
just even hiring people or having uh

2402
00:37:59,810 --> 00:37:59,820
just even hiring people or having uh
 

2403

just even hiring people or having uh
corporate structure that allows for the

2404
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
corporate structure that allows for the
 

2405
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,490
corporate structure that allows for the
crazy young kids to come in and just

2406
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,500
crazy young kids to come in and just
 

2407
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,170
crazy young kids to come in and just
create something totally new

2408
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,180
create something totally new
 

2409
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,550
create something totally new
do you think it's possible or do you

2410
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,560
do you think it's possible or do you
 

2411
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,930
do you think it's possible or do you
think it'll come from a startup yeah it

2412
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,940
think it'll come from a startup yeah it
 

2413
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,430
think it'll come from a startup yeah it
is this always big question which is you

2414
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:10,440
is this always big question which is you
 

2415
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,930
is this always big question which is you
get this feeling I hear about this a lot

2416
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:11,940
get this feeling I hear about this a lot
 

2417
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,030
get this feeling I hear about this a lot
from CEOs founder CEOs where it's like

2418
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,040
from CEOs founder CEOs where it's like
 

2419
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,490
from CEOs founder CEOs where it's like
wow we have 50 000 people it's now

2420
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:16,500
wow we have 50 000 people it's now
 

2421
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,870
wow we have 50 000 people it's now
harder to do new things than it was when

2422
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:17,880
harder to do new things than it was when
 

2423
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,089
harder to do new things than it was when
we had 50 people yeah like what has

2424
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,099
we had 50 people yeah like what has
 

2425
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,349
we had 50 people yeah like what has
happened so that's a recurring

2426
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
happened so that's a recurring
 

2427
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,450
happened so that's a recurring
phenomenon um by the way that's one of

2428
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,460
phenomenon um by the way that's one of
 

2429
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,829
phenomenon um by the way that's one of
the reasons why there's always startups

2430
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:24,839
the reasons why there's always startups
 

2431
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,450
the reasons why there's always startups
and why there's Venture Capital um it's

2432
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:26,460
and why there's Venture Capital um it's
 

2433
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,250
and why there's Venture Capital um it's
just that's that's like a timeless

2434
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,260
just that's that's like a timeless
 

2435
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,349
just that's that's like a timeless
uh kind of thing so that that's one

2436
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:30,359
uh kind of thing so that that's one
 

2437
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,250
uh kind of thing so that that's one
observation um on a page rank um we can

2438
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,260
observation um on a page rank um we can
 

2439
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,329
observation um on a page rank um we can
talk about that but not on page rank

2440
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:35,339
talk about that but not on page rank
 

2441
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,710
talk about that but not on page rank
specifically on page rank um there

2442
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
specifically on page rank um there
 

2443
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,910
specifically on page rank um there
actually is a page so there is a page

2444
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
actually is a page so there is a page
 

2445
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,170
actually is a page so there is a page
rank already in the field and it's the

2446
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,180
rank already in the field and it's the
 

2447
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,790
rank already in the field and it's the
Transformer right so the the big

2448
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
Transformer right so the the big
 

2449
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,890
Transformer right so the the big
breakthrough was the Transformer um and

2450
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:42,900
breakthrough was the Transformer um and
 

2451
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,349
breakthrough was the Transformer um and
uh the Transformer was invented in on uh

2452
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
uh the Transformer was invented in on uh
 

2453
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,069
uh the Transformer was invented in on uh
2017 at Google and this is actually like

2454
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:49,079
2017 at Google and this is actually like
 

2455
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,390
2017 at Google and this is actually like
really an interesting question because

2456
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
really an interesting question because
 

2457
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,550
really an interesting question because
it's like okay the Transformers like why

2458
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
it's like okay the Transformers like why
 

2459
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,170
it's like okay the Transformers like why
does open AI even exist like the

2460
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:54,180
does open AI even exist like the
 

2461
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,370
does open AI even exist like the
Transformers invested at Google why

2462
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:55,380
Transformers invested at Google why
 

2463
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,050
Transformers invested at Google why
didn't Google I asked a guy I asked a

2464
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,060
didn't Google I asked a guy I asked a
 

2465
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,430
didn't Google I asked a guy I asked a
guy I know who was senior at Google

2466
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:58,440
guy I know who was senior at Google
 

2467
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,690
guy I know who was senior at Google
brain kind of when this was happening

2468
00:38:59,690 --> 00:38:59,700
brain kind of when this was happening
 

2469
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,370
brain kind of when this was happening
and I said if Google had just gone flat

2470
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:01,380
and I said if Google had just gone flat
 

2471
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,410
and I said if Google had just gone flat
out to the wall and just said look we're

2472
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:03,420
out to the wall and just said look we're
 

2473
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,310
out to the wall and just said look we're
going to launch we're going to launch

2474
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
going to launch we're going to launch
 

2475
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,530
going to launch we're going to launch
equivalent of gpt4 as fast as we can um

2476
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:06,540
equivalent of gpt4 as fast as we can um
 

2477
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,150
equivalent of gpt4 as fast as we can um
he said I said when could we have had it

2478
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
he said I said when could we have had it
 

2479
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,370
he said I said when could we have had it
and he said 2019. yeah they could have

2480
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:10,380
and he said 2019. yeah they could have
 

2481
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,510
and he said 2019. yeah they could have
just done a two-year Sprint with the

2482
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
just done a two-year Sprint with the
 

2483
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,010
just done a two-year Sprint with the
Transformer and and benefit because they

2484
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,020
Transformer and and benefit because they
 

2485
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,270
Transformer and and benefit because they
already had the compute at scale they

2486
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:14,280
already had the compute at scale they
 

2487
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,470
already had the compute at scale they
already had all the training data they

2488
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
already had all the training data they
 

2489
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,030
already had all the training data they
could have just done it there's a

2490
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
could have just done it there's a
 

2491
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,349
could have just done it there's a
variety of reasons they didn't do it

2492
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:18,359
variety of reasons they didn't do it
 

2493
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,930
variety of reasons they didn't do it
this is like a classic big company thing

2494
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:20,940
this is like a classic big company thing
 

2495
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,790
this is like a classic big company thing
um IBM invented the relational database

2496
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
um IBM invented the relational database
 

2497
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,950
um IBM invented the relational database
in 19 in the 1970s let it sit on the

up and built Oracle 0 Park invented the
 

2503
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,950
up and built Oracle 0 Park invented the
interactive computer they let it sit on

2504
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
interactive computer they let it sit on
 

2505
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,450
interactive computer they let it sit on
the Shelf Steve Jobs came and turned

2506
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,460
the Shelf Steve Jobs came and turned
 

2507
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,910
the Shelf Steve Jobs came and turned
into the Macintosh right and so there is

2508
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:34,920
into the Macintosh right and so there is
 

2509
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,530
into the Macintosh right and so there is
this pattern now having said that

2510
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:36,540
this pattern now having said that
 

2511
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,390
this pattern now having said that
sitting here today like Google's in the

2512
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
sitting here today like Google's in the
 

2513
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,829
sitting here today like Google's in the
game right so Google you know maybe

2514
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
game right so Google you know maybe
 

2515
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,329
game right so Google you know maybe
maybe they maybe they let like a

2516
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:41,339
maybe they maybe they let like a
 

2517
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,650
maybe they maybe they let like a
four-year Gap there go there that they

2518
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:42,660
four-year Gap there go there that they
 

2519
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,210
four-year Gap there go there that they
maybe shouldn't have but like they're in

2520
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:44,220
maybe shouldn't have but like they're in
 

2521
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,470
maybe shouldn't have but like they're in
the game and so now they've got you know

2522
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:45,480
the game and so now they've got you know
 

2523
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,910
the game and so now they've got you know
now they're committed they've done this

2524
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:46,920
now they're committed they've done this
 

2525
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,109
now they're committed they've done this
merger they're bringing in demos they've

2526
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:48,119
merger they're bringing in demos they've
 

2527
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,790
merger they're bringing in demos they've
got this merger with deep mind you know

2528
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,800
got this merger with deep mind you know
 

2529
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,349
got this merger with deep mind you know
they're piling in resources there are

2530
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
they're piling in resources there are
 

2531
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,849
they're piling in resources there are
rumors that they're you know building up

2532
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:52,859
rumors that they're you know building up
 

2533
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,310
rumors that they're you know building up
an incredible you know super llm um you

00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
know Way Beyond what we even have today
 

2537
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,210
know Way Beyond what we even have today
um and they've got you know unlimited

2538
00:39:59,210 --> 00:39:59,220
um and they've got you know unlimited
 

2539
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,770
um and they've got you know unlimited
resources and a huge you know they've

2540
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:00,780
resources and a huge you know they've
 

2541
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,950
resources and a huge you know they've
been challenged their honor yeah I had a

2542
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:03,960
been challenged their honor yeah I had a
 

2543
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,290
been challenged their honor yeah I had a
chance to hang out with someone a couple

2544
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,300
chance to hang out with someone a couple
 

2545
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,270
chance to hang out with someone a couple
days ago and we took this walk and

2546
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,280
days ago and we took this walk and
 

2547
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,950
days ago and we took this walk and
there's this giant new building

2548
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:09,960
there's this giant new building
 

2549
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,930
there's this giant new building
oh there's going to be a lot of AI work

2550
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:11,940
oh there's going to be a lot of AI work
 

2551
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,990
oh there's going to be a lot of AI work
uh being done and it's kind of

2552
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,000
uh being done and it's kind of
 

2553
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,170
uh being done and it's kind of
this ominous feeling of

2554
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:18,180
this ominous feeling of
 

2555
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,069
this ominous feeling of
like the fight is on yeah

2556
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:21,079
like the fight is on yeah
 

2557
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,050
like the fight is on yeah
like there's this beautiful Silicon

2558
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,060
like there's this beautiful Silicon
 

2559
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,790
like there's this beautiful Silicon
Valley nature like birds are chirping

2560
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:25,800
Valley nature like birds are chirping
 

2561
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,730
Valley nature like birds are chirping
and this giant building and it's like uh

2562
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:28,740
and this giant building and it's like uh
 

2563
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,190
and this giant building and it's like uh
the Beast has been awakened yeah and

2564
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
the Beast has been awakened yeah and
 

2565
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,650
the Beast has been awakened yeah and
then like all the big companies are

2566
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:33,660
then like all the big companies are
 

2567
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,930
then like all the big companies are
waking up to this they have the compute

2568
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:35,940
waking up to this they have the compute
 

2569
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,790
waking up to this they have the compute
but also the little guys have uh it

2570
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
but also the little guys have uh it
 

2571
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,990
but also the little guys have uh it
feels like they have all the tools to

2572
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
feels like they have all the tools to
 

2573
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,329
feels like they have all the tools to
create the killer product that uh and

2574
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:44,339
create the killer product that uh and
 

2575
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,010
create the killer product that uh and
then there's all the tools to scale if

2576
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,020
then there's all the tools to scale if
 

2577
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,050
then there's all the tools to scale if
you have a good idea if you have the

2578
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:48,060
you have a good idea if you have the
 

2579
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,750
you have a good idea if you have the
page rank idea so I there's several

2580
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:50,760
page rank idea so I there's several
 

2581
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,970
page rank idea so I there's several
things that it's page rank there's page

2582
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:52,980
things that it's page rank there's page
 

2583
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,670
things that it's page rank there's page
rank the algorithm and the idea and

2584
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:55,680
rank the algorithm and the idea and
 

2585
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,990
rank the algorithm and the idea and
there's like the implementation of it

2586
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,000
there's like the implementation of it
 

2587
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,030
there's like the implementation of it
and I think like killer product is not

2588
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
and I think like killer product is not
 

2589
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,530
and I think like killer product is not
just the idea like the transform it's

2590
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:00,540
just the idea like the transform it's
 

2591
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,270
just the idea like the transform it's
the implementation something something

2592
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:02,280
the implementation something something
 

2593
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,609
the implementation something something
really compelling about it like you just

2594
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:04,619
really compelling about it like you just
 

2595
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,650
really compelling about it like you just
can't look away something like

2596
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:06,660
can't look away something like
 

2597
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,270
can't look away something like
um the algorithm behind Tick Tock versus

2598
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,280
um the algorithm behind Tick Tock versus
 

2599
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,130
um the algorithm behind Tick Tock versus
Tick Tock itself like the actual

2600
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,140
Tick Tock itself like the actual
 

2601
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,050
Tick Tock itself like the actual
experience of tick tock that just you

2602
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:12,060
experience of tick tock that just you
 

2603
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,690
experience of tick tock that just you
can't look away it feels like somebody's

2604
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:14,700
can't look away it feels like somebody's
 

2605
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,970
can't look away it feels like somebody's
gonna come up with that and it could be

2606
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:16,980
gonna come up with that and it could be
 

2607
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,069
gonna come up with that and it could be
Google but it feels like it's just

2608
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:19,079
Google but it feels like it's just
 

2609
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,710
Google but it feels like it's just
easier and faster to do for a startup

2610
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:21,720
easier and faster to do for a startup
 

2611
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,990
easier and faster to do for a startup
yeah so so the startup the huge the huge

2612
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
yeah so so the startup the huge the huge
 

2613
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,370
yeah so so the startup the huge the huge
Advantage the startups have is they just

2614
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:25,380
Advantage the startups have is they just
 

2615
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,230
Advantage the startups have is they just
there's no sacred cows there's no

2616
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,240
there's no sacred cows there's no
 

2617
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,849
there's no sacred cows there's no
historical Legacy to protect there's no

2618
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:28,859
historical Legacy to protect there's no
 

2619
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,349
historical Legacy to protect there's no
need to reconcile your new plan with the

2620
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:30,359
need to reconcile your new plan with the
 

2621
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,490
need to reconcile your new plan with the
existing strategy there's no

2622
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:31,500
existing strategy there's no
 

2623
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,589
existing strategy there's no
communication overhead there's no you

2624
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
communication overhead there's no you
 

2625
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,609
communication overhead there's no you
know big companies are big companies

2626
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:34,619
know big companies are big companies
 

2627
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,170
know big companies are big companies
they've got pre-meetings planning for

2628
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,180
they've got pre-meetings planning for
 

2629
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,609
they've got pre-meetings planning for
the meeting then they then they have the

2630
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:37,619
the meeting then they then they have the
 

2631
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:38,870
the meeting then they then they have the
post meeting the recap then they have

2632
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
post meeting the recap then they have
 

2633
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,890
post meeting the recap then they have
the presentation the board then they

2634
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:39,900
the presentation the board then they
 

2635
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,510
the presentation the board then they
have the next round of meetings yeah and

2636
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
have the next round of meetings yeah and
 

2637
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,130
have the next round of meetings yeah and
that's the meetings that's the elapsed

2638
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,140
that's the meetings that's the elapsed
 

2639
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,329
that's the meetings that's the elapsed
time when the startup launches its

2640
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:44,339
time when the startup launches its
 

2641
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,069
time when the startup launches its
product right so so so so there's a

2642
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
product right so so so so there's a
 

2643
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,990
product right so so so so there's a
Timeless right yeah so there's a

2644
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
Timeless right yeah so there's a
 

2645
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,730
Timeless right yeah so there's a
Timeless thing there now yeah what the

2646
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:49,740
Timeless thing there now yeah what the
 

2647
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,990
Timeless thing there now yeah what the
startups don't have is everything else

2648
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,000
startups don't have is everything else
 

2649
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,670
startups don't have is everything else
right so startups they have a brand they

2650
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,680
right so startups they have a brand they
 

2651
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,630
right so startups they have a brand they
don't have customer relationships

2652
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:53,640
don't have customer relationships
 

2653
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,890
don't have customer relationships
they've gotten a distribution they've

2654
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:54,900
they've gotten a distribution they've
 

2655
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,329
they've gotten a distribution they've
got no you know scale I mean sitting

chips
 

2671
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,470
chips
um right and then and then and then to

2672
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:09,480
um right and then and then and then to
 

2673
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,730
um right and then and then and then to
the extent the clouds have chips they

2674
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:10,740
the extent the clouds have chips they
 

2675
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,930
the extent the clouds have chips they
allocate them to the big customers not

2676
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:11,940
allocate them to the big customers not
 

2677
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,089

2709
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,030
protected from the others like that's
that's to me that's just like very

2710
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
that's to me that's just like very
 

2711
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,250
that's to me that's just like very
clearly the idealized world it is the

2712
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:43,260
clearly the idealized world it is the
 

2713
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,109
clearly the idealized world it is the
world we've been in for AI up until now

2714
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
world we've been in for AI up until now
 

2715
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,130
world we've been in for AI up until now
and then of course there are people

2716
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,140
and then of course there are people
 

2717
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,870
and then of course there are people
trying to shut that down but my hope is

2718
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:47,880
trying to shut that down but my hope is
 

2719
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,490
trying to shut that down but my hope is
that you know the best outcome clearly

2720
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:49,500
that you know the best outcome clearly
 

2721
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,050
that you know the best outcome clearly
will be if that continues we'll talk

2722

will be if that continues we'll talk
about that a little bit but I'd love to

that's just like amazing the other look
 

2889
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,230
that's just like amazing the other look
there's a real possibility that the

2890
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,240
there's a real possibility that the
 

2891
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,609
there's a real possibility that the
whole I mean look there's a possibility

2892
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:22,619
whole I mean look there's a possibility
 

2893
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,130
whole I mean look there's a possibility
here that the whole idea of a screen and

2894
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:25,140
here that the whole idea of a screen and
 

2895
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,050
here that the whole idea of a screen and
windows and all this stuff just goes

2896
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,060
windows and all this stuff just goes
 

2897

windows and all this stuff just goes
away because like why do you need that

2898
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
away because like why do you need that
 

2899
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,750
away because like why do you need that
if you just have a thing that's just

distinction but why have the web browser
 

2925
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,130
distinction but why have the web browser
in that case if one of the apps starts

00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:38,040
or you could just keep being the same
 

2965
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,190
or you could just keep being the same
which is like with just the nature web

2966
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,200
which is like with just the nature web
 

2967
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,990
which is like with just the nature web
pages changes and the nature of content

2968
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
pages changes and the nature of content
 

2969
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,309
pages changes and the nature of content
but there will still be a web browser

2970
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:43,319
but there will still be a web browser
 

2971
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,170
but there will still be a web browser
because uh web browser is a pretty sexy

2972
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:45,180
because uh web browser is a pretty sexy
 

2973
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,990
because uh web browser is a pretty sexy
product it just seems to work because it

2974
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
product it just seems to work because it
 

2975
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,210
product it just seems to work because it
like you have an interface a window into

2976
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:50,220
like you have an interface a window into
 

2977
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,250
like you have an interface a window into
the world and then the world can be

2978
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:52,260
the world and then the world can be
 

2979
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,690
the world and then the world can be
anything you want and as the world will

2980
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:53,700
anything you want and as the world will
 

2981
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,190
anything you want and as the world will
evolve it could be different programming

2982
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,200
evolve it could be different programming
 

2983
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,870
evolve it could be different programming
languages it can be animated maybe it's

2984
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:56,880
languages it can be animated maybe it's
 

2985
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,790
languages it can be animated maybe it's
three-dimensional and so on

2986
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
three-dimensional and so on
 

2987
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,890
three-dimensional and so on
yeah it's interesting do you think we'll

2988
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:00,900
yeah it's interesting do you think we'll
 

2989
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,890
yeah it's interesting do you think we'll
still have the web browser every every

2990
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:03,900
still have the web browser every every
 

2991
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,329
still have the web browser every every
um every medium becomes the content for

2992
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:05,339
um every medium becomes the content for
 

2993
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,970
um every medium becomes the content for
the next one so you know the AI will be

2994
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:07,980
the next one so you know the AI will be
 

2995
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,990
the next one so you know the AI will be
able to give you a browser whenever you

2996
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:09,000
able to give you a browser whenever you
 

2997
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,109
able to give you a browser whenever you
want um oh interesting yeah well another

2998
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:12,119
want um oh interesting yeah well another
 

2999
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,609
want um oh interesting yeah well another
way to think about it is maybe what the

3000
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:13,619
way to think about it is maybe what the
 

3001
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,290
way to think about it is maybe what the
browser is maybe it's just the escape

3002
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:15,300
browser is maybe it's just the escape
 

3003
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,150
browser is maybe it's just the escape
hatch right which is maybe kind of what

3004
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,160
hatch right which is maybe kind of what
 

3005
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,550
hatch right which is maybe kind of what
it is today right which is like most of

3006
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
it is today right which is like most of
 

3007
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,809
it is today right which is like most of
what you do is like inside a social

3008
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:20,819
what you do is like inside a social
 

3009
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,370
what you do is like inside a social
network or inside a search engine or

3010
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:22,380
network or inside a search engine or
 

3011
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,809
network or inside a search engine or
inside you know somebody's app or inside

3012
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:23,819
inside you know somebody's app or inside
 

3013
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,730
inside you know somebody's app or inside
some controlled experience right but

3014
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:25,740
some controlled experience right but
 

3015
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,870
some controlled experience right but
then every once in a while there's

3016
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:26,880
then every once in a while there's
 

3017
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,069
then every once in a while there's
something where you actually want to

3018
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
something where you actually want to
 

3019
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,870
something where you actually want to
jailbreak you want to actually get free

3020
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:29,880
jailbreak you want to actually get free
 

3021
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,329
jailbreak you want to actually get free
the web browser is the fu to the man

nobody really talks about here's

3030
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
nobody really talks about here's
 

3031
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,430
nobody really talks about here's
something I'm proud of which is the web

3032
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:40,440
something I'm proud of which is the web
 

3033
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,750
something I'm proud of which is the web
the web the browser the web servers

3034
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
the web the browser the web servers
 

3035
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,650
the web the browser the web servers
they're all they're still Backward

3036
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:42,660
they're all they're still Backward
 

3037
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,390
they're all they're still Backward
Compatible all the way back to like 1992

3038
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
Compatible all the way back to like 1992
 

3039
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,690
Compatible all the way back to like 1992
right so like you can put up a you can

3040
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:47,700
right so like you can put up a you can
 

3041
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,890
right so like you can put up a you can
still you know what the big breakthrough

3042
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:48,900
still you know what the big breakthrough
 

3043
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,270
still you know what the big breakthrough
the web early on the big breakthrough

3044
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:50,280
the web early on the big breakthrough
 

3045
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,829
the web early on the big breakthrough
was it made it really easy to read but

3046
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
was it made it really easy to read but
 

3047
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,329
was it made it really easy to read but
it also made it really easy to write I

3048
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:53,339
it also made it really easy to write I
 

3049
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:54,770
it also made it really easy to write I
mean it really easy to publish and and

00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:56,220
we literally made it so easy to publish
 

3053
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,890
we literally made it so easy to publish
we made it not only so it was easy to

3054
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:57,900
we made it not only so it was easy to
 

3055

publish content it was actually also
 

3057
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,890
publish content it was actually also
easy to actually write a web server

3058
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:00,900
easy to actually write a web server
 

3059
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,809
easy to actually write a web server
right and you can literally write a web

3060
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:02,819
right and you can literally write a web
 

3061
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,309
right and you can literally write a web
server in four lines of real code and

3062
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
server in four lines of real code and
 

3063
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,690
server in four lines of real code and
and you could start publishing content

3064
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:05,700
and you could start publishing content
 

3065
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,130
and you could start publishing content
on it and you could set whatever rules

3066
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:07,140
on it and you could set whatever rules
 

3067
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,270
on it and you could set whatever rules
you want for the content whatever

censorship no censorship whatever you
 

3071
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,630
censorship no censorship whatever you
want you could just do that as long as

3072
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:11,640
want you could just do that as long as
 

3073
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,490
want you could just do that as long as
you had an IP address right you could do

3074
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:13,500
you had an IP address right you could do
 

3075
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,550
you had an IP address right you could do
that that still works right like that

3076
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:16,560
that that still works right like that
 

3077
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,230
that that still works right like that
still works exactly as I just described

3078
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
still works exactly as I just described
 

3079
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,870
still works exactly as I just described
so this is part of my reaction to all of

3080
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
so this is part of my reaction to all of
 

3081
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,069
so this is part of my reaction to all of
this like you know all this just

3082
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
this like you know all this just
 

3083
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,630
this like you know all this just
censorship pressure and all this you

3084
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:23,640
censorship pressure and all this you
 

3085
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,950
censorship pressure and all this you
know these issues around control and all

3086
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
know these issues around control and all
 

3087
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,930
know these issues around control and all
this stuff which is like maybe we need

3088
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:26,940
this stuff which is like maybe we need
 

3089
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,250
this stuff which is like maybe we need
to get back a little bit more to the

3090
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:28,260
to get back a little bit more to the
 

3091
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,170
to get back a little bit more to the
wild west like the wild west is still

3092
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:30,180
wild west like the wild west is still
 

3093

3097
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,690
down like they'll try to you know people
who want to censor will try to take away

3098
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:35,700
who want to censor will try to take away
 

3099
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,490
who want to censor will try to take away
your your um you know your domain name

you at the ISP level like you can still

3112
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:45,900
you at the ISP level like you can still
 

3113
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,510
you at the ISP level like you can still
put up a thing

3114
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
put up a thing
 

3115

3269
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,069
creation of a lot of this stuff um yeah
so so then basically but so part part of

3270
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:13,079
so so then basically but so part part of
 

3271
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,210
so so then basically but so part part of
my story is just the luck of having been

3272
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:14,220
my story is just the luck of having been
 

3273
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,290
my story is just the luck of having been
born at the right time and getting

3274
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:15,300
born at the right time and getting
 

3275
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,450
born at the right time and getting
exposed to PCS then the other part is um

3276
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:17,460
exposed to PCS then the other part is um
 

3277
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,250
exposed to PCS then the other part is um
the other part is when Al Gore says that

3278
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:19,260
the other part is when Al Gore says that
 

3279
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,870
the other part is when Al Gore says that
he created the internet he actually is

3280
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
he created the internet he actually is
 

3281
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,030
he created the internet he actually is
correct uh in in a really meaningful way

3282
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,040
correct uh in in a really meaningful way
 

3283
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,829
correct uh in in a really meaningful way
which is he sponsored a bill in 1985

3284
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
which is he sponsored a bill in 1985
 

3285
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,450
which is he sponsored a bill in 1985
that essentially created the modern

3286
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:26,460
that essentially created the modern
 

3287
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,250
that essentially created the modern
internet created book it's called the

3288
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:28,260
internet created book it's called the
 

3289
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,109
internet created book it's called the
NSF net at the time which is sort of the

3290
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:30,119
NSF net at the time which is sort of the
 

3291
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,930
NSF net at the time which is sort of the
first really fast internet backbone

3292
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:32,940
first really fast internet backbone
 

3293
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,390
first really fast internet backbone
um and uh you know that that bill dumped

3294
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:35,400
um and uh you know that that bill dumped
 

3295
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,770
um and uh you know that that bill dumped
a ton of money into a bunch of research

3296
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:36,780
a ton of money into a bunch of research
 

3297
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,690
a ton of money into a bunch of research
universities to build out basically the

3298
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:38,700
universities to build out basically the
 

3299
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,010
universities to build out basically the
internet backbone and then the super

3300
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:40,020
internet backbone and then the super
 

3301
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,390
internet backbone and then the super
computer centers that were clustered

3302
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:41,400
computer centers that were clustered
 

3303
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,170
computer centers that were clustered
around

3304
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:42,180
around
 

3305
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,089
around
um the the internet and and one of those

3306
00:51:44,089 --> 00:51:44,099
um the the internet and and one of those
 

3307
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:45,290
um the the internet and and one of those
universities was University of Illinois

3308
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:45,300
universities was University of Illinois
 

3309
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,030
universities was University of Illinois
where I went to school and so the other

3310
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
where I went to school and so the other
 

3311
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,530
where I went to school and so the other
stroke a lot that I had was I went to

3312
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:48,540
stroke a lot that I had was I went to
 

3313
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,849
stroke a lot that I had was I went to
Illinois basically right is that money

3314
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:49,859
Illinois basically right is that money
 

3315
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:51,410
Illinois basically right is that money
was just like getting dumped on campus

3316
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:51,420
was just like getting dumped on campus
 

3317
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,049
was just like getting dumped on campus
and so as a consequence we had on campus

3318
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:54,059
and so as a consequence we had on campus
 

3319
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,109
and so as a consequence we had on campus
and this is like you know 89 1991.

3320
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
and this is like you know 89 1991.
 

3321
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,490
and this is like you know 89 1991.
we had like you know we were right on

3322
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:58,500
we had like you know we were right on
 

3323
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,809
we had like you know we were right on
the internet back low and we had like T3

3324
00:51:59,809 --> 00:51:59,819
the internet back low and we had like T3
 

3325
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,790
the internet back low and we had like T3
and 45 at the time P3 45 megabit

3326
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:01,800
and 45 at the time P3 45 megabit
 

3327
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,109
and 45 at the time P3 45 megabit
backbone connection which at the time

3328
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
backbone connection which at the time
 

3329
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,210
backbone connection which at the time
was you know wildly state of the art um

3330
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:05,220
was you know wildly state of the art um
 

3331
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,950
was you know wildly state of the art um
we had Curry super computers we had

3332
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
we had Curry super computers we had
 

3333
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,270
we had Curry super computers we had
thinking machines parallel super

3334
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,280
thinking machines parallel super
 

3335
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,710
thinking machines parallel super
computers we had silicon Graphics

3336
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:09,720
computers we had silicon Graphics
 

3337
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,809
computers we had silicon Graphics
workstations we had macintoshes we had

3338
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:11,819
workstations we had macintoshes we had
 

3339
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,849
workstations we had macintoshes we had
we had next cubes all over the place we

3340
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:13,859
we had next cubes all over the place we
 

3341
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:14,990
we had next cubes all over the place we
had like every possible kind of computer

3342
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:15,000
had like every possible kind of computer
 

3343
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,250
had like every possible kind of computer
you could imagine because all this money

3344
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,260
you could imagine because all this money
 

3345
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,530
you could imagine because all this money
just fell out of the sky

3346
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:18,540
just fell out of the sky
 

3347
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,510
just fell out of the sky
um you're living in the future yeah so

3348
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:20,520
um you're living in the future yeah so
 

3349
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,950
um you're living in the future yeah so
yeah quite literally it was yeah like

3350
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:21,960
yeah quite literally it was yeah like
 

3351
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,450
yeah quite literally it was yeah like
it's all it's all there it's all like we

3352
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,460
it's all it's all there it's all like we
 

3353
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,890
it's all it's all there it's all like we
had full Broadband Graphics like the

3354
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:24,900
had full Broadband Graphics like the
 

3355
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,510
had full Broadband Graphics like the
whole thing and it's actually funny

3356
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:26,520
whole thing and it's actually funny
 

3357
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,190
whole thing and it's actually funny
because they had this this is the first

3358
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:28,200
because they had this this is the first
 

3359
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,930
because they had this this is the first
time I kind of it sort of tickled the

3360
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:29,940
time I kind of it sort of tickled the
 

3361
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,950
time I kind of it sort of tickled the
back of my head that there might be a

3362
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
back of my head that there might be a
 

3363
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,990
back of my head that there might be a
big opportunity in here which is you

3364
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,000
big opportunity in here which is you
 

3365
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,309
big opportunity in here which is you
know they embraced it and so they put

3366
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
know they embraced it and so they put
 

3367
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,690
know they embraced it and so they put
like computers in all the dorms and they

3368
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:35,700
like computers in all the dorms and they
 

3369
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,250
like computers in all the dorms and they
wired up all the dorm rooms and they had

3370
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,260
wired up all the dorm rooms and they had
 

3371
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,690
wired up all the dorm rooms and they had
all these you know Labs everywhere and

3372
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:38,700
all these you know Labs everywhere and
 

3373
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,370
all these you know Labs everywhere and
everything and then they they gave every

3374
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:40,380
everything and then they they gave every
 

3375
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,710
everything and then they they gave every
undergrad a computer account and an

3376
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
undergrad a computer account and an
 

3377
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,569
undergrad a computer account and an
email address

3378
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:44,579
email address
 

3379
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,490
email address
um and the Assumption was that you would

3380
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:46,500
um and the Assumption was that you would
 

3381
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,990
um and the Assumption was that you would
use the internet for your four years of

3382
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
use the internet for your four years of
 

3383
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,829
use the internet for your four years of
college

3384
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:48,839
college
 

3385
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:50,750
college
um and then you would graduate and stop

3386
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:50,760
um and then you would graduate and stop
 

3387
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,190
um and then you would graduate and stop
using it

3388
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,200
using it
 

3389
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,470
using it
and that was that right yeah and you

3390
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
and that was that right yeah and you
 

3391
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,609
and that was that right yeah and you
were just retire your email address it

3392
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:55,619
were just retire your email address it
 

3393
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:56,450
were just retire your email address it
wouldn't be relevant anymore because

3394
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:56,460
wouldn't be relevant anymore because
 

3395
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,650
wouldn't be relevant anymore because
you'd go off in the workplace and they

3396
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:57,660
you'd go off in the workplace and they
 

3397
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,750
you'd go off in the workplace and they
don't use email you'd be back to using

3398
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
don't use email you'd be back to using
 

3399
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,430
don't use email you'd be back to using
fax machines or whatever did you have

3400
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
fax machines or whatever did you have
 

3401
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,290
fax machines or whatever did you have
that sense as well like what what you

3402
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:03,300
that sense as well like what what you
 

3403
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,430
that sense as well like what what you
said the the back of your head was

3404
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
said the the back of your head was
 

3405
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,710
said the the back of your head was
tickled like what was your what was

3406
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
tickled like what was your what was
 

3407
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,970
tickled like what was your what was
exciting to you about this possible

3408
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:07,980
exciting to you about this possible
 

3409
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,950
exciting to you about this possible
World well if this is so useful in this

3410
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:09,960
World well if this is so useful in this
 

3411
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,329
World well if this is so useful in this
container if this is so useful in this

3412
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:11,339
container if this is so useful in this
 

3413
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:12,770
container if this is so useful in this
contained environment that just as this

3414
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:12,780
contained environment that just as this
 

3415
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,630
contained environment that just as this
weird source of outside funding then if

3416
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
weird source of outside funding then if
 

3417
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,609
weird source of outside funding then if
if it were practical for everybody else

3418
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:16,619
if it were practical for everybody else
 

3419
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:17,809
if it were practical for everybody else
to have this and if it were cost

3420
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:17,819
to have this and if it were cost
 

3421
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,890
to have this and if it were cost
effective for everybody else to have

3422
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:18,900
effective for everybody else to have
 

3423
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,809
effective for everybody else to have
this wouldn't they want it and the

3424
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:20,819
this wouldn't they want it and the
 

3425
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:22,309
this wouldn't they want it and the
overwhelmingly the prevailing View at

3426
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
overwhelmingly the prevailing View at
 

3427
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,630
overwhelmingly the prevailing View at
the time was no they would not want it

3428
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:23,640
the time was no they would not want it
 

3429
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,030
the time was no they would not want it
this is esoteric weird nerd stuff right

3430
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,040
this is esoteric weird nerd stuff right
 

3431
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,589
this is esoteric weird nerd stuff right
that the computer science kids like but

3432
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:27,599
that the computer science kids like but
 

3433
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,790
that the computer science kids like but
like normal people are never gonna do

3434
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
like normal people are never gonna do
 

3435
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,549
like normal people are never gonna do
email right or be on the internet right

3436
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:31,559
email right or be on the internet right
 

3437
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,109
email right or be on the internet right
um and so I was just like wow like this

3438
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:33,119
um and so I was just like wow like this
 

3439
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,549
um and so I was just like wow like this
this is actually like this is really

3440
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
this is actually like this is really
 

3441
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,589
this is actually like this is really
compelling stuff now the other part was

3442
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:36,599
compelling stuff now the other part was
 

3443
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,450
compelling stuff now the other part was
it was all really hard to use and in

3444
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:38,460
it was all really hard to use and in
 

3445
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,370
it was all really hard to use and in
practice you had to be a basically a CS

3446
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:40,380
practice you had to be a basically a CS
 

3447
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,990
practice you had to be a basically a CS
uh you know basically had a bscs

3448
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
uh you know basically had a bscs
 

3449
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,849
uh you know basically had a bscs
undergrad or equivalent to actually get

3450
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:43,859
undergrad or equivalent to actually get
 

3451
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,170
undergrad or equivalent to actually get
full use of the internet at that point

3452
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:45,180
full use of the internet at that point
 

3453
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,910
full use of the internet at that point
because it was all pretty esoteric stuff

3454
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:46,920
because it was all pretty esoteric stuff
 

3455
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,470
because it was all pretty esoteric stuff
so then that was the other part of the

3456
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
so then that was the other part of the
 

3457
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,730
so then that was the other part of the
idea which was okay we need to actually

3458
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:49,740
idea which was okay we need to actually
 

3459
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,290
idea which was okay we need to actually
make this easy to use

3460
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:51,300
make this easy to use
 

3461
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,390
make this easy to use
so what's involved in creating Mosaic

3462
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:53,400
so what's involved in creating Mosaic
 

3463
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,750
so what's involved in creating Mosaic
like in creating a graphical interface

3464
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:56,760
like in creating a graphical interface
 

3465
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,609
like in creating a graphical interface
to the internet yeah so it was a

3466
00:53:58,609 --> 00:53:58,619
to the internet yeah so it was a
 

3467
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:59,930
to the internet yeah so it was a
combination of things so it was like

3468
00:53:59,930 --> 00:53:59,940
combination of things so it was like
 

3469
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,910
combination of things so it was like
basically the web existed in an early

3470
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
basically the web existed in an early
 

3471
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,950
basically the web existed in an early
sort of described as prototype form uh

3472
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:03,960
sort of described as prototype form uh
 

3473
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,450
sort of described as prototype form uh
and by the way text only at that point

3474
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:05,460
and by the way text only at that point
 

3475
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,549
and by the way text only at that point
uh what did it look like what was the

3476
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:07,559
uh what did it look like what was the
 

3477
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,530
uh what did it look like what was the
web I mean well and the key figures like

3478
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:09,540
web I mean well and the key figures like
 

3479
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,470
web I mean well and the key figures like
what was the what was it like what it

3480
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
what was the what was it like what it
 

3481
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,089
what was the what was it like what it
made a picture it looked like Chad GPT

3482
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:14,099
made a picture it looked like Chad GPT
 

3483
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:15,230
made a picture it looked like Chad GPT
actually

3484
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,240
actually
 

3485
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,630
actually
um but it was all text yeah

3486
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:17,640
um but it was all text yeah
 

3487
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,190
um but it was all text yeah
um and so you had a text-based web

3488
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200
um and so you had a text-based web
 

3489
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,569
um and so you had a text-based web
browser yeah uh well actually the

3490
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:20,579
browser yeah uh well actually the
 

3491
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,069
browser yeah uh well actually the
original browser Tim berners Lee the

3492
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
original browser Tim berners Lee the
 

3493
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,510
original browser Tim berners Lee the
original the original browser both the

3494
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
original the original browser both the
 

3495
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,530
original the original browser both the
original browser and the server actually

3496
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:24,540
original browser and the server actually
 

3497
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,870
original browser and the server actually
ran on next next cubes so these were

3498
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
ran on next next cubes so these were
 

3499
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,130
ran on next next cubes so these were
this was you know the computer Steve

3500
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,140
this was you know the computer Steve
 

3501
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,870
this was you know the computer Steve
Jobs made during the interim period when

3502
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:29,880
Jobs made during the interim period when
 

3503
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,370
Jobs made during the interim period when
he during the decade long interim period

3504
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:31,380
he during the decade long interim period
 

3505
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,290
he during the decade long interim period
when he was not an apple you know he got

3506
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:33,300
when he was not an apple you know he got
 

3507
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,710
when he was not an apple you know he got
fired in 85 and then came back in 97 so

3508
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
fired in 85 and then came back in 97 so
 

3509
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,030
fired in 85 and then came back in 97 so
this was in that interim period where he

3510
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:38,040
this was in that interim period where he
 

3511
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,290
this was in that interim period where he
had this company called Next and they

3512
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:39,300
had this company called Next and they
 

3513
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,730
had this company called Next and they
made these literally these computers

3514
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:40,740
made these literally these computers
 

3515
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,530
made these literally these computers
called cubes and there's this famous

3516
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:42,540
called cubes and there's this famous
 

3517
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,910
called cubes and there's this famous
story they were beautiful but they were

3518
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
story they were beautiful but they were
 

3519
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,890
story they were beautiful but they were
12 inch by 12 inch by 12 inch cubes

3520
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:45,900
12 inch by 12 inch by 12 inch cubes
 

3521
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,390
12 inch by 12 inch by 12 inch cubes
computers and there was a famous story

3522
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:47,400
computers and there was a famous story
 

3523
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,710
computers and there was a famous story
about how they could have cost half as

3524
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
about how they could have cost half as
 

3525
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,190
about how they could have cost half as
much if it had been 12 by 12 by 13 but

3526
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:52,200
much if it had been 12 by 12 by 13 but
 

3527
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,589
much if it had been 12 by 12 by 13 but
it was like no like it has to be so they

3528
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:54,599
it was like no like it has to be so they
 

3529
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,089
it was like no like it has to be so they
were like six thousand dollar basically

3530
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:56,099
were like six thousand dollar basically
 

3531
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,530
were like six thousand dollar basically
academic workstations they had the first

3532
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:57,540
academic workstations they had the first
 

3533
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,089
academic workstations they had the first
cd-round drives

3534
00:54:59,089 --> 00:54:59,099
cd-round drives
 

3535
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,770
cd-round drives
um yeah which were slow I mean it was

3536
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:00,780
um yeah which were slow I mean it was
 

3537
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,230
um yeah which were slow I mean it was
the computers were all but unusable um

3538
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,240
the computers were all but unusable um
 

3539
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,490
the computers were all but unusable um
they were so slow but they were

3540
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:04,500
they were so slow but they were
 

3541
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,290
they were so slow but they were
beautiful okay can we actually just to

3542
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:06,300
beautiful okay can we actually just to
 

3543
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,990
beautiful okay can we actually just to
take a tiny tangent there sure of course

3544
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,000
take a tiny tangent there sure of course
 

3545
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,710
take a tiny tangent there sure of course
the 12th by 12. uh they're just so

3546
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
the 12th by 12. uh they're just so
 

3547
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,410
the 12th by 12. uh they're just so
beautifully encapsulated Steve Jobs idea

3548
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:15,420
beautifully encapsulated Steve Jobs idea
 

3549
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,650
beautifully encapsulated Steve Jobs idea
of design can you just comment on

3550
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:18,660
of design can you just comment on
 

3551
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,390
of design can you just comment on
um what you find interesting about Steve

3552
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
um what you find interesting about Steve
 

3553
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,670
um what you find interesting about Steve
Jobs What uh about that view of the

3554
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:22,680
Jobs What uh about that view of the
 

3555
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,710
Jobs What uh about that view of the
world that dogmatic pursuit of

3556
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
world that dogmatic pursuit of
 

3557
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,470
world that dogmatic pursuit of
perfection in how he saw Perfection and

3558
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:27,480
perfection in how he saw Perfection and
 

3559
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,250
perfection in how he saw Perfection and

Design
yes I guess they say like look he was a

3562
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,180
yes I guess they say like look he was a
 

3563
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,390
yes I guess they say like look he was a
deep believer I think in a very deep way

3564
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
deep believer I think in a very deep way
 

3565
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,010
deep believer I think in a very deep way
I interpret it I don't know if you ever

3566
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:34,020
I interpret it I don't know if you ever
 

3567
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,210
I interpret it I don't know if you ever
really describe it like this but the way

3568
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:35,220
really describe it like this but the way
 

3569
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,950
really describe it like this but the way
I'd interpret it is it's like it's like

3570
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:36,960
I'd interpret it is it's like it's like
 

3571
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,329
I'd interpret it is it's like it's like
this thing and it's actually a thing in

3572
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:38,339
this thing and it's actually a thing in
 

3573
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,190
this thing and it's actually a thing in
philosophy it's like Aesthetics are not

3574
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:40,200
philosophy it's like Aesthetics are not
 

3575
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,170
philosophy it's like Aesthetics are not
just appearances Aesthetics go all the

3576
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:42,180
just appearances Aesthetics go all the
 

3577
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,030
just appearances Aesthetics go all the
way to like deep underlining underlying

I'm not a physicist one of the things
 

3583
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,650
I'm not a physicist one of the things
I've heard of physics to say is one of

3587
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:51,049
the things you start to get a sense of
when a theory might be correct is when

3588
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,059
when a theory might be correct is when
 

3589
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,730
when a theory might be correct is when
it's beautiful right like you know

3590
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:52,740
it's beautiful right like you know
 

3591
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,589
it's beautiful right like you know
they're right and so so so there's

right you know there's like a there's
like a there's a Simplicity to it when

3602
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:03,420
like a there's a Simplicity to it when

judgment that he had deep down like even
 

3619
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,730
judgment that he had deep down like even
even if the engineering teams are saying

3620
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:19,740
even if the engineering teams are saying
 

3621
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,329
even if the engineering teams are saying
this is uh this is too difficult even if

3622
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:23,339
this is uh this is too difficult even if

who makes the phone out of aluminum
 

3639
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,549
who makes the phone out of aluminum
right like

3640
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:39,559
right like
 

3641
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:42,170

nobody else would have done that and now
of course if your phone is made out of

3644
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:43,319
of course if your phone is made out of
 

3645
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:45,589
of course if your phone is made out of
aluminum you know how crude what kind of

you know look it's it's there's a
 

3655
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,030
you know look it's it's there's a
thousand different ways to look at this

3656
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
thousand different ways to look at this
 

3657
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,290
thousand different ways to look at this
but one of the things that's just like

3658
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:54,300
but one of the things that's just like
 

3659
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,609
but one of the things that's just like
look these things are Central to your

3660
00:56:55,609 --> 00:56:55,619
look these things are Central to your
 

3661
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,589
look these things are Central to your
life like you're with your phone more

3662
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
life like you're with your phone more
 

3663
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,970
life like you're with your phone more
than you're with anything else like it's

3664
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:58,980
than you're with anything else like it's
 

3665
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,230
than you're with anything else like it's
in your it's going to be in your hand I

3666
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
in your it's going to be in your hand I
 

3667
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,309
in your it's going to be in your hand I
mean he you know you know this he

3668
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:01,319
mean he you know you know this he
 

3669
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,630
mean he you know you know this he
thought very deeply about what it meant

3670
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
thought very deeply about what it meant
 

3671
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,710
thought very deeply about what it meant
for something to be in your hand all day

3672
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:03,720
for something to be in your hand all day
 

3673
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,589
for something to be in your hand all day
long yeah but for example

3674
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
long yeah but for example
 

3675
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,549
long yeah but for example
here's an interesting design thing like

3676
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:07,559
here's an interesting design thing like
 

3677
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,109
here's an interesting design thing like
he he never wanted it it's my

3678
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
he he never wanted it it's my
 

3679
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,430
he he never wanted it it's my
understanding is he never wanted an

3680
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:10,440
understanding is he never wanted an
 

3681
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,069
understanding is he never wanted an
iPhone to have a screen larger than you

3682
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:13,079
iPhone to have a screen larger than you
 

3683
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,990
iPhone to have a screen larger than you
could reach with your thumb one-handed

3684
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:15,000
could reach with your thumb one-handed
 

3685
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,150
could reach with your thumb one-handed
and so he was actually opposed to the

3686
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:17,160
and so he was actually opposed to the
 

3687
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,710
and so he was actually opposed to the
idea of making the phones larger and I

3688
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
idea of making the phones larger and I
 

3689
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,609
idea of making the phones larger and I
don't know if you have this experience

3690
00:57:19,609 --> 00:57:19,619
don't know if you have this experience
 

3691
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:20,870
don't know if you have this experience
today but let's say there are certain

3692
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
today but let's say there are certain
 

3693
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,549
today but let's say there are certain
moments in your day when you might be

3694
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
moments in your day when you might be
 

3695
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,530
moments in your day when you might be
like only have one hand available

3696
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:24,540
like only have one hand available
 

3697
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,370
like only have one hand available
um and you might want to be on your

3698
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:25,380
um and you might want to be on your
 

3699
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,370
um and you might want to be on your
phone yeah if you're trying to like

3700
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:28,380
phone yeah if you're trying to like
 

3701
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,410
phone yeah if you're trying to like
after texting you your thumb can't reach

3702
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:30,420
after texting you your thumb can't reach
 

3703
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,089
after texting you your thumb can't reach
the send button yeah I mean there's pros

3704
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:32,099
the send button yeah I mean there's pros
 

3705
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:33,290
the send button yeah I mean there's pros
and cons right and then there's like

3706
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:33,300
and cons right and then there's like
 

3707
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,670
and cons right and then there's like
folding phones which I would love to

the properly designed device that had
 

3735
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:03,710
the properly designed device that had
the correct functionality that had the

00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:03,720
the correct functionality that had the
 

3737
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,690
the correct functionality that had the
deepest understanding of the user that

deepest understanding of the user that
 

3739
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,069
deepest understanding of the user that
was the most beautiful

3740
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:07,079
was the most beautiful
 

3741

right like it had to be all of those
 

3743
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,630
right like it had to be all of those
things right it was he basically would

3744
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:11,640
things right it was he basically would
 

3745
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,890
things right it was he basically would
drive to as close to perfect as you

3746
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:12,900
drive to as close to perfect as you
 

3747
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,510
drive to as close to perfect as you
could possibly get right and I I you

3748
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:14,520
could possibly get right and I I you
 

3749
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,950
could possibly get right and I I you
know I suspect that he never quite you

know thought he ever got there because
 

3753
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,230
know thought he ever got there because
most great creators you know are

3754
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
most great creators you know are
 

3755
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,609
most great creators you know are
generally dissatisfied you know you read

3756
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:19,619
generally dissatisfied you know you read
 

3757
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,349
generally dissatisfied you know you read
accounts later on and all they can all

3758
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
accounts later on and all they can all
 

3759
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,309
accounts later on and all they can all
they can see are the flaws in their

3760
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
they can see are the flaws in their
 

3761
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,569
they can see are the flaws in their
creation but like he got as close to

3762
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:23,579
creation but like he got as close to
 

3763
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:24,890
creation but like he got as close to
perfect each step of the way as he could

3764
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:24,900
perfect each step of the way as he could
 

3765
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,569
perfect each step of the way as he could
possibly get with the with the

3766
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:26,579
possibly get with the with the
 

3767
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:28,370
possibly get with the with the
constraints of the of the technology of

3768
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:28,380
constraints of the of the technology of
 

3769
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,270
constraints of the of the technology of
his time

3770
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:29,280
his time
 

3771
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,589
his time
um and then you know look he was you

um and then you know look he was you
 

3773
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:31,730
um and then you know look he was you
know sort of famous in the Apple model

3774
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:31,740
know sort of famous in the Apple model
 

3775
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,589
know sort of famous in the Apple model
it's like look they they will you know

3776
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
it's like look they they will you know

3789
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,750
and tune and polish until it is as
perfect as anybody could possibly make

3790
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:44,760
perfect as anybody could possibly make
 

3791
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,730
perfect as anybody could possibly make
anything yeah and then this goes to the

3792

anything yeah and then this goes to the
 

3793
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,990
anything yeah and then this goes to the
the way that people describe working

3794
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
the way that people describe working
 

3795

could to let us actually do work of that
quality so a lot of people who were at

3820
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:09,900
quality so a lot of people who were at
 

3821
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,970
quality so a lot of people who were at
Apple spend the rest of their lives

3822
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:10,980
Apple spend the rest of their lives
 

3823
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,530
Apple spend the rest of their lives
trying to find another experience where

3824
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:12,540
trying to find another experience where
 

3825
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,609
trying to find another experience where
they feel like they're able to hit that

3826
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:13,619
they feel like they're able to hit that
 

3827
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,010
they feel like they're able to hit that
quality bar again even if it in

3828
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,020
quality bar again even if it in
 

3829
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,630
quality bar again even if it in
retrospect or during it felt like

3830
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:17,640
retrospect or during it felt like
 

3831
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,030
retrospect or during it felt like
suffering yeah exactly

3832
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,040
suffering yeah exactly
 

3833
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,270
suffering yeah exactly
what is that teach you about the Human

3834
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
what is that teach you about the Human
 

3835
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,630
what is that teach you about the Human
Condition huh so look so I say exactly

3836
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
Condition huh so look so I say exactly
 

3837
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,309
Condition huh so look so I say exactly
so the Silicon Valley I mean look he's

3838
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
so the Silicon Valley I mean look he's
 

3839
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,170
so the Silicon Valley I mean look he's
not you know George Patton in the you

3840
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:30,180
not you know George Patton in the you
 

3841
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,730
not you know George Patton in the you
know in the Army like you know there are

3842
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:31,740
know in the Army like you know there are
 

3843
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,230
know in the Army like you know there are
many examples in other fields you know

3844
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,240
many examples in other fields you know
 

3845
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,309
many examples in other fields you know
that are like this

3846
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:34,319
that are like this
 

3847
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,390
that are like this
um uh uh

3848
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:37,400
um uh uh
 

3849
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,770
um uh uh
specifically in Tech it's actually I

3850
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:39,780
specifically in Tech it's actually I
 

3851
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,089
specifically in Tech it's actually I
find it very interesting there's the

3852
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:41,099
find it very interesting there's the
 

3853
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:42,950
find it very interesting there's the
Apple Way which is Polish Polish Polish

3854
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
Apple Way which is Polish Polish Polish
 

3855
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,089
Apple Way which is Polish Polish Polish
and don't ship until it's perfect

3856
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:44,099
and don't ship until it's perfect
 

3857
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,530
and don't ship until it's perfect
because you can make it and then there's

3858
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:45,540
because you can make it and then there's
 

3859
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,630
because you can make it and then there's
the sort of the other approach which is

3860
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:47,640
the sort of the other approach which is
 

3861
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,609
the sort of the other approach which is
the sort of incremental hacker mentality

3862
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:49,619
the sort of incremental hacker mentality
 

3863
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,410
the sort of incremental hacker mentality
which basically says ship early and

3864
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:51,420
which basically says ship early and
 

3865
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,089
which basically says ship early and
often and iterate and one of the things

3866
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:53,099
often and iterate and one of the things
 

3867
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,950
often and iterate and one of the things
I find really interesting is I'm now 30

3868
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
I find really interesting is I'm now 30
 

3869
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,589
I find really interesting is I'm now 30
years into this like

3870
00:59:56,589 --> 00:59:56,599
years into this like
 

3871
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:58,849
years into this like
they're a very successful companies on

3872
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:58,859
they're a very successful companies on
 

3873
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:01,010
they're a very successful companies on
both sides of that approach right um

3874
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:01,020
both sides of that approach right um
 

3875
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,530
both sides of that approach right um
like that is a fundamental

3876
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:03,540
like that is a fundamental
 

3877
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,569
like that is a fundamental
difference right in how to operate and

3878
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:05,579
difference right in how to operate and
 

3879
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:07,730
difference right in how to operate and
how to build and how to create that you

3880
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:07,740
how to build and how to create that you
 

3881
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,530
how to build and how to create that you
have world-class companies operating in

3882
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:09,540
have world-class companies operating in
 

3883
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,849
have world-class companies operating in
both ways

3884
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:10,859
both ways
 

3885
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,349
both ways
um and I don't think the question of

3886
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:12,359
um and I don't think the question of
 

3887
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,730
um and I don't think the question of
like which is the superior model is

3888
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:13,740
like which is the superior model is
 

3889
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,770
like which is the superior model is
anywhere close to being answered like

3890
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:15,780
anywhere close to being answered like
 

3891
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,930
anywhere close to being answered like
and my suspicion as the answer is do

3892
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:17,940
and my suspicion as the answer is do
 

3893
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,190
and my suspicion as the answer is do
both the answer is you actually want

3894
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
both the answer is you actually want
 

3895
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,170
both the answer is you actually want
both they lead to different outcomes

3896
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:21,180
both they lead to different outcomes
 

3897
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,390
both they lead to different outcomes
software tends to do better

3898
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:23,400
software tends to do better
 

3899
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,069
software tends to do better
um with the iterative approach

3900
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:25,079
um with the iterative approach
 

3901
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,809
um with the iterative approach
um the hardware tends to do better with

3902
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:26,819
um the hardware tends to do better with
 

3903
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,329
um the hardware tends to do better with
the uh you know sort of wait make it

3904
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:29,339
the uh you know sort of wait make it
 

3905
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:31,069
the uh you know sort of wait make it
perfect approach but again you can find

3906
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:31,079
perfect approach but again you can find
 

3907
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,250
perfect approach but again you can find
examples in in in both directions uh so

3908
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,260
examples in in in both directions uh so
 

3909
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,829
examples in in in both directions uh so
the jury's still out on that one uh so

3910
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:36,839
the jury's still out on that one uh so
 

3911
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:39,549
the jury's still out on that one uh so
back to Mosaic so what uh

3912
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:39,559
back to Mosaic so what uh
 

3913
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:43,549
back to Mosaic so what uh
it was text based uh Tim berners-lee

3914
01:00:43,549 --> 01:00:43,559
it was text based uh Tim berners-lee
 

3915
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:45,230
it was text based uh Tim berners-lee
what there was the web which was

3916
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:45,240
what there was the web which was
 

3917
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,490
what there was the web which was
text-based but there were no I mean

3918
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:46,500
text-based but there were no I mean
 

3919
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,289
text-based but there were no I mean
there was like three websites there was

3920
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:48,299
there was like three websites there was
 

3921
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,450
there was like three websites there was
like no content there were no users like

3922
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:50,460
like no content there were no users like
 

3923
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,829
like no content there were no users like
it wasn't like it wasn't like a

3924
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:51,839
it wasn't like it wasn't like a
 

3925
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,210
it wasn't like it wasn't like a
catalytic it had in there by the way it

3926
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:53,220
catalytic it had in there by the way it
 

3927
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,530
catalytic it had in there by the way it
was all because it was all text there

3928
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:54,540
was all because it was all text there
 

3929
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,490
was all because it was all text there
were no documents there were no images

3930
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:55,500
were no documents there were no images
 

3931
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,410
were no documents there were no images
there were no videos there were no right

3932
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:57,420
there were no videos there were no right
 

3933
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,990
there were no videos there were no right
so so it was it was and then if in the

3934
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
so so it was it was and then if in the
 

3935
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,130
so so it was it was and then if in the
beginning if you had to be on a next

3936
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:01,140
beginning if you had to be on a next
 

3937
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,930
beginning if you had to be on a next
cube right you need a hat index Cube

3938
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:02,940
cube right you need a hat index Cube
 

3939
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,910
cube right you need a hat index Cube
both to publish and to consume so so

3940
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:04,920
both to publish and to consume so so
 

3941
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,530
both to publish and to consume so so
there were six thousand bucks you said

3942
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:06,540
there were six thousand bucks you said
 

3943
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,030
there were six thousand bucks you said
there were limitations yeah six thousand

3944
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:08,040
there were limitations yeah six thousand
 

3945
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,890
there were limitations yeah six thousand
dollar PC they did not they did not sell

3946
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:09,900
dollar PC they did not they did not sell
 

3947
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,589
dollar PC they did not they did not sell
very many but then there was also there

3948
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:12,599
very many but then there was also there
 

3949
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,569
very many but then there was also there
was also FTP and there was usenets right

3950
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:14,579
was also FTP and there was usenets right
 

3951
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,069
was also FTP and there was usenets right
and there was you know a dozen other

3952
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
and there was you know a dozen other
 

3953
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,630
and there was you know a dozen other
basically wait there's waste which was

3954
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:17,640
basically wait there's waste which was
 

3955
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,430
basically wait there's waste which was
an early search thing there was gopher

3956
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
an early search thing there was gopher
 

3957
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,569
an early search thing there was gopher
which was an early menu based

3958
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:20,579
which was an early menu based
 

3959
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,309
which was an early menu based
information retrieval system there were

3960
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
information retrieval system there were
 

3961
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,109
information retrieval system there were
like a dozen different sort of scattered

3962
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:24,119
like a dozen different sort of scattered
 

3963
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,309
like a dozen different sort of scattered
ways that people would get the

3964
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:25,319
ways that people would get the
 

3965
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,690
ways that people would get the
information on on the internet and so

3966
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:26,700
information on on the internet and so
 

3967
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,609
information on on the internet and so
the Mosaic idea was basically bring

3968
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:28,619
the Mosaic idea was basically bring
 

3969
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,870
the Mosaic idea was basically bring
those all together make the whole thing

3970
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:29,880
those all together make the whole thing
 

3971
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,849
those all together make the whole thing
graphical make it easy to use make it

3972
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:31,859
graphical make it easy to use make it
 

3973
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,109
graphical make it easy to use make it
basically bulletproof so that anybody

3974
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
basically bulletproof so that anybody
 

3975
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,270
basically bulletproof so that anybody
can do it and then again just on the

3976
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,280
can do it and then again just on the
 

3977
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,770
can do it and then again just on the
luck side it so happened that this was

3978
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:36,780
luck side it so happened that this was
 

3979
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,750
luck side it so happened that this was
right at the moment when Graphics when

3980
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:38,760
right at the moment when Graphics when
 

3981
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,609
right at the moment when Graphics when
the GUI sort of actually took off and

3982
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:40,619
the GUI sort of actually took off and
 

3983
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:42,289
the GUI sort of actually took off and
we're now also used to the GUI that we

3984
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:42,299
we're now also used to the GUI that we
 

3985
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,089
we're now also used to the GUI that we
think it's been around forever but it

3986
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:44,099
think it's been around forever but it
 

3987
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,250
think it's been around forever but it
didn't really you know the the Macintosh

3988
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:46,260
didn't really you know the the Macintosh
 

3989
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,470
didn't really you know the the Macintosh
brought it out in 85 but they actually

3990
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,480
brought it out in 85 but they actually
 

3991
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,150
brought it out in 85 but they actually
didn't sell very many Max in the 80s it

3992
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,160
didn't sell very many Max in the 80s it
 

3993
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,430
didn't sell very many Max in the 80s it
was not that successful of a product

3994
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:52,440
was not that successful of a product
 

3995
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,049
was not that successful of a product
um it really was when you needed Windows

3996
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:54,059
um it really was when you needed Windows
 

3997
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:58,370
um it really was when you needed Windows
3.0 on PCS and that hit in about 92.

3998
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:58,380
3.0 on PCS and that hit in about 92.
 

3999
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,410
3.0 on PCS and that hit in about 92.
um and so when we did mosaican 92 93 so

4000
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:00,420
um and so when we did mosaican 92 93 so
 

4001
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,030
um and so when we did mosaican 92 93 so
that sort of it was like right at the

4002
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,040
that sort of it was like right at the
 

4003
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,349
that sort of it was like right at the
moment when you could imagine actually

4004
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
moment when you could imagine actually
 

4005
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,990
moment when you could imagine actually
having a graphical user interface to

4006
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
having a graphical user interface to
 

4007
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,210
having a graphical user interface to
right at all much less one to the

4008
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:08,220
right at all much less one to the
 

4009
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,910
right at all much less one to the
internet how uh how old did Windows 3

4010
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:10,920
internet how uh how old did Windows 3
 

4011
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,370
internet how uh how old did Windows 3
sell so it was that the really big that

4012
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:13,380
sell so it was that the really big that
 

4013
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,349
sell so it was that the really big that
was the Big Bang the big operating

4014
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
was the Big Bang the big operating
 

4015
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,089
was the Big Bang the big operating
graphical operating system well this is

4016
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:17,099
graphical operating system well this is
 

4017
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:18,410
graphical operating system well this is
the classic okay this Microsoft was

4018
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:18,420
the classic okay this Microsoft was
 

4019
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,450
the classic okay this Microsoft was
operating on the other so Steve Steve

4020
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:20,460
operating on the other so Steve Steve
 

4021
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,950
operating on the other so Steve Steve
Apple was running on the Polish until

4022
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:21,960
Apple was running on the Polish until
 

4023
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,569
Apple was running on the Polish until
it's perfect Microsoft famously ran on

4024
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:23,579
it's perfect Microsoft famously ran on
 

4025
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:24,530
it's perfect Microsoft famously ran on
the other model which is ship and

4026
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:24,540
the other model which is ship and
 

4027
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,030
the other model which is ship and
iterate and so in the Old Line in those

4028
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:26,040
iterate and so in the Old Line in those
 

4029
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,010
iterate and so in the Old Line in those
days was Microsoft race version three of

4030
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,020
days was Microsoft race version three of
 

4031
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,150
days was Microsoft race version three of
every Microsoft product that's the

4032
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:29,160
every Microsoft product that's the
 

4033
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,069
every Microsoft product that's the
that's the good one right so there are

4034
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:31,079
that's the good one right so there are
 

4035
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,630
that's the good one right so there are
you can you can find online Windows One

4036
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
you can you can find online Windows One
 

4037
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,130
you can you can find online Windows One
windows too nobody used them yeah

4038
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:34,140
windows too nobody used them yeah
 

4039
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,230
windows too nobody used them yeah
actually the original Windows the in the

4040
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
actually the original Windows the in the
 

4041
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,490
actually the original Windows the in the
original Microsoft Windows the windows

4042
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:37,500
original Microsoft Windows the windows
 

4043
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,470
original Microsoft Windows the windows
were not overlapping

4044
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:39,480
were not overlapping
 

4045
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,390
were not overlapping
um and so you have these very small very

4046
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:41,400
um and so you have these very small very
 

4047
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,430
um and so you have these very small very
low resolution screens and then you had

4048
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
low resolution screens and then you had
 

4049
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,530
low resolution screens and then you had
literally um Windows it just didn't work

4050
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:45,540
literally um Windows it just didn't work

4053
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:50,089
it wasn't ready yet well in Windows 95 I
think was a pretty big leap also that

4054
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:50,099
think was a pretty big leap also that
 

4055
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,589
think was a pretty big leap also that
was a big leap too yeah so that was like

4056
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
was a big leap too yeah so that was like
 

4057
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:52,910
was a big leap too yeah so that was like

um and then of course Steve and then and
then you know in the fullness of time

4062
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:55,799
then you know in the fullness of time
 

4063
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:57,289
then you know in the fullness of time
Steve came back then the max started

not for regular people at that time
 

4275
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,270
not for regular people at that time
um and so you had to think through that

4276
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:23,280
um and so you had to think through that
 

4277
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,130
um and so you had to think through that
and then look it was still yeah it was

that point right so you could get kind

4282
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:28,260
that point right so you could get kind
 

4283
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,690
that point right so you could get kind
of this weird bastardized version if you

4284
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:29,700
of this weird bastardized version if you
 

4285
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,029
of this weird bastardized version if you
were on AOL which wasn't really real or

describing all the steps required to
 

4305
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,970
describing all the steps required to
actually get on the internet at this

4306
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:49,980
actually get on the internet at this
 

4307
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,870
actually get on the internet at this
point

4308
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
point
 

4309
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,549
point
um and so you had to you had to look

4310
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
um and so you had to you had to look
 

4311
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,470
um and so you had to you had to look
through these practical well and then

4312
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
through these practical well and then
 

4313
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,510
through these practical well and then
and then uh and then speed performance

4314
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:56,520
and then uh and then speed performance
 

4315
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,690
and then uh and then speed performance
14 for modems right like it was like

4316
01:06:59,690 --> 01:06:59,700
14 for modems right like it was like
 

4317
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,370
14 for modems right like it was like
watching you know glue dry

4318
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:01,380
watching you know glue dry
 

4319
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,470
watching you know glue dry
um like and so you had to you had they

4320
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:03,480
um like and so you had to you had they
 

4321
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,609
um like and so you had to you had they
were basically a sequence of bets that

4322
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:04,619
were basically a sequence of bets that
 

4323
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:05,750
were basically a sequence of bets that
we made where you basically needed to

4324
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
we made where you basically needed to
 

4325
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,770
we made where you basically needed to
look through that current state of

4326
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:06,780
look through that current state of
 

4327
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,569
look through that current state of
affairs and say actually there's going

4328
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:08,579
affairs and say actually there's going
 

4329
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:09,890
affairs and say actually there's going
to be so much demand for that once

4330
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:09,900
to be so much demand for that once
 

4331
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,910
to be so much demand for that once
people figure this out there's gonna be

4332
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:10,920
people figure this out there's gonna be
 

4333
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,230
people figure this out there's gonna be
so much demand for it that all of these

so much demand for it that all of these
 

4335
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,430
so much demand for it that all of these
practical problems are going to get

4336
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:13,440
practical problems are going to get

4351
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:32,930
to watch an image load like a line at a
time but it turns out there was this

4352
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:32,940
time but it turns out there was this
 

4353
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,490
time but it turns out there was this
thing with jpegs where you could you

4354
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:34,500
thing with jpegs where you could you
 

4355
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,410
thing with jpegs where you could you
could load basically every fourth you

4356
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:36,420
could load basically every fourth you
 

4357
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,510
could load basically every fourth you
could load like every fourth uh line and

4358
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:38,520
could load like every fourth uh line and
 

4359
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,829
could load like every fourth uh line and
then and then you could sweep back

4360
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839
then and then you could sweep back
 

4361
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,089
then and then you could sweep back
through again and so you could like

4362
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:41,099
through again and so you could like
 

4363
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,829
through again and so you could like
render a fuzzy version image up front

4364
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:42,839
render a fuzzy version image up front
 

4365
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:44,329
render a fuzzy version image up front
and then it would like resolve into the

4366
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,339
and then it would like resolve into the
 

4367
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,069
and then it would like resolve into the
detailed one and that was like a big UI

4368
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
detailed one and that was like a big UI
 

4369
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,390
detailed one and that was like a big UI
breakthrough because it gave you

4370
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:47,400
breakthrough because it gave you
 

4371
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,010
breakthrough because it gave you
something to watch

4372
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:49,020
something to watch
 

4373
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,170
something to watch
yeah and uh you know there's

4374
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:51,180
yeah and uh you know there's
 

4375
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,690
yeah and uh you know there's
applications in various domains for that

4376
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:53,700
applications in various domains for that
 

4377
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,029
applications in various domains for that
uh

4378
01:07:56,029 --> 01:07:56,039
uh
 

4379
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,289
uh
it was a big fight but there was a big

4380
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:57,299
it was a big fight but there was a big
 

4381
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,190
it was a big fight but there was a big
fight early on about whether there

4382
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:58,200
fight early on about whether there
 

4383
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,750
fight early on about whether there
should be images on the web

4384
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
should be images on the web
 

4385
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,250
should be images on the web
um for that reason for like

4386
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,260
um for that reason for like
 

4387
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,650
um for that reason for like
sexualization no not not explicitly that

4388
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:03,660
sexualization no not not explicitly that
 

4389
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,029
sexualization no not not explicitly that
did come up but it wasn't even that it

4390
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
did come up but it wasn't even that it
 

4391
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,589
did come up but it wasn't even that it
was more just like all the serious the

4392
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:06,599
was more just like all the serious the
 

4393
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,210
was more just like all the serious the
argument went the purists basically said

4394
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:08,220
argument went the purists basically said
 

4395
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,470
argument went the purists basically said
all the serious information in the world

4396
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:09,480
all the serious information in the world
 

4397
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,230
all the serious information in the world
is text if you introduce images you you

4398
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
is text if you introduce images you you
 

4399
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,190
is text if you introduce images you you
basically going to bring in all the

4400
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
basically going to bring in all the
 

4401
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,210
basically going to bring in all the
trivial stuff you're going to bring in

4402
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:14,220
trivial stuff you're going to bring in
 

4403
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,249
trivial stuff you're going to bring in
magazines and you know all this crazy I

4404
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,259
magazines and you know all this crazy I
 

4405
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,390
magazines and you know all this crazy I
was just you know stuff that you know

4406
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:17,400
was just you know stuff that you know
 

4407
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,829
was just you know stuff that you know
people you know it's going to distract

4408
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:18,839
people you know it's going to distract
 

4409
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:19,910
people you know it's going to distract
from that it's going to go take take

4410
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
from that it's going to go take take
 

4411
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,349
from that it's going to go take take
away from being serious being frivolous

4412
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
away from being serious being frivolous
 

4413
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,510
away from being serious being frivolous
well was there any uh Doomer type

4414
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,520
well was there any uh Doomer type
 

4415
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,150
well was there any uh Doomer type
arguments about uh the internet

4416
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:26,160
arguments about uh the internet
 

4417
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,370
arguments about uh the internet
destroying all of human civilization or

4418
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:28,380
destroying all of human civilization or
 

4419
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,849
destroying all of human civilization or
destroying some fundamental fabric of

4420
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:31,859
destroying some fundamental fabric of
 

4421
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,070
destroying some fundamental fabric of
human civilization yeah so if those days

4422
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
human civilization yeah so if those days
 

4423
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,110
human civilization yeah so if those days
it was all around crime and terrorism uh

4424
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:36,120
it was all around crime and terrorism uh
 

4425
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,689
it was all around crime and terrorism uh
so those arguments happened um you know

4426
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:38,699
so those arguments happened um you know
 

4427
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,010
so those arguments happened um you know
but there was no sense yet of Internet

4428
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:40,020
but there was no sense yet of Internet
 

4429
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,329
but there was no sense yet of Internet
having like an effect on politics or

4430
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:41,339
having like an effect on politics or
 

4431
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:42,530
having like an effect on politics or
because that was that was way too too

4432
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:42,540
because that was that was way too too
 

4433
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,450
because that was that was way too too
far off but um there was an enormous

4434
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:44,460
far off but um there was an enormous
 

4435
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,610
far off but um there was an enormous
panic at the time around cyber crime

4436
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:46,620
panic at the time around cyber crime
 

4437
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,229
panic at the time around cyber crime
there was like enormous Panic that like

4438
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
there was like enormous Panic that like
 

4439
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:49,550
there was like enormous Panic that like
your credit card number would get stolen

4440
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:49,560
your credit card number would get stolen
 

4441
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,050
your credit card number would get stolen
and you'd use life savings to be drained

4442
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:51,060
and you'd use life savings to be drained
 

4443
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,669
and you'd use life savings to be drained
and then you know criminals were gonna

4444
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:52,679
and then you know criminals were gonna
 

4445
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,650
and then you know criminals were gonna
there was oh um when we started one of

4446
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:54,660
there was oh um when we started one of
 

4447
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,030
there was oh um when we started one of
the things we did one of the the

4448
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:56,040
the things we did one of the the
 

4449
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,010
the things we did one of the the
Netscape browser was the first widely

4450
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,020
Netscape browser was the first widely
 

4451
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,689
Netscape browser was the first widely
used piece of consumer software that had

4452
01:08:59,689 --> 01:08:59,699
used piece of consumer software that had
 

4453
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:01,789
used piece of consumer software that had
strong encryption built in it made it

4454
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:01,799
strong encryption built in it made it
 

4455
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:03,530
strong encryption built in it made it
available to Ordinary People and at that

4456
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:03,540
available to Ordinary People and at that
 

4457
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,970
available to Ordinary People and at that
time strong encryption was actually

4458
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:04,980
time strong encryption was actually
 

4459
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,970
time strong encryption was actually
illegal to export out of the U.S so we

4460
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:07,980
illegal to export out of the U.S so we
 

4461
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,590
illegal to export out of the U.S so we
could field that product in the US we

4462
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
could field that product in the US we
 

4463
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,209
could field that product in the US we
could not export it because it was it

4464
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:11,219
could not export it because it was it
 

4465
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:12,890
could not export it because it was it
was classified as ammunition

4466
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:12,900
was classified as ammunition
 

4467
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,450
was classified as ammunition
um so the Netscape browser was on a

4468
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:14,460
um so the Netscape browser was on a
 

4469
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,829
um so the Netscape browser was on a
restricted list along with the Tomahawk

4470
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
restricted list along with the Tomahawk
 

4471
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,510
restricted list along with the Tomahawk
missile as being something that could

4472
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
missile as being something that could
 

4473
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,189
missile as being something that could
not be exported so we had to make a

4474
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
not be exported so we had to make a
 

4475
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,749
not be exported so we had to make a
second version with deliberately weak

4476
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:20,759
second version with deliberately weak
 

4477
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:22,610
second version with deliberately weak
encryption to sell overseas with a big

4478
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:22,620
encryption to sell overseas with a big
 

4479
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,289
encryption to sell overseas with a big
logo on the box saying do not trust this

4480
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:24,299
logo on the box saying do not trust this
 

4481
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,090
logo on the box saying do not trust this
which it turns out makes it hard to sell

4482
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,100
which it turns out makes it hard to sell
 

4483
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,729
which it turns out makes it hard to sell
software uh when it's got a big logo

4484
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:28,739
software uh when it's got a big logo
 

4485
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:30,349
software uh when it's got a big logo
that says don't trust it

4486
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:30,359
that says don't trust it
 

4487
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:31,430
that says don't trust it
um and then we had to spend five years

4488
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:31,440
um and then we had to spend five years
 

4489
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,749
um and then we had to spend five years
fighting the US government to get them

4490
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:32,759
fighting the US government to get them
 

4491
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:35,510
fighting the US government to get them
to basically stop trying to do this but

4492
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
to basically stop trying to do this but
 

4493
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,309
to basically stop trying to do this but
because the fear the fear was terrorists

4494
01:09:37,309 --> 01:09:37,319
because the fear the fear was terrorists
 

4495
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,809
because the fear the fear was terrorists
are going to use encryption right to

4496
01:09:38,809 --> 01:09:38,819
are going to use encryption right to
 

4497
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,370
are going to use encryption right to
like plot you know all these all these

4498
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:40,380
like plot you know all these all these
 

4499
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,050
like plot you know all these all these
all these things

4500
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,060
all these things
 

4501
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,550
all these things
um and then you know we responded with

4502
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:43,560
um and then you know we responded with
 

4503
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,169
um and then you know we responded with
well actually we need encryption to be

4504
01:09:45,169 --> 01:09:45,179
well actually we need encryption to be
 

4505
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,209
well actually we need encryption to be
able to secure systems so the terrorists

4506
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:47,219
able to secure systems so the terrorists
 

4507
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:48,349
able to secure systems so the terrorists
and the criminals can't get into them so

4508
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:48,359
and the criminals can't get into them so
 

4509
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,789
and the criminals can't get into them so
that was anyway that was the night that

4510
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:49,799
that was anyway that was the night that
 

4511
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,430
that was anyway that was the night that
was the 1990s fight so uh can you say

4512
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:52,440
was the 1990s fight so uh can you say
 

4513
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,990
was the 1990s fight so uh can you say
something about some of the details of

4514
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
something about some of the details of
 

4515
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,570
something about some of the details of
the software engineering challenges

4516
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:56,580
the software engineering challenges
 

4517
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,490
the software engineering challenges
required to build these browsers I mean

4518
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:58,500
required to build these browsers I mean
 

4519
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,709
required to build these browsers I mean
the engineering challenges of creating a

4520
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
the engineering challenges of creating a
 

4521
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,030
the engineering challenges of creating a
product that hasn't really existed

4522
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,040
product that hasn't really existed
 

4523
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:02,930
product that hasn't really existed
before

4524
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:02,940
before
 

4525
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,110
before
that can have such uh almost like

4526
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:06,120
that can have such uh almost like
 

4527
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,930
that can have such uh almost like
Limitless uh impact on the world with

4528
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:08,940
Limitless uh impact on the world with
 

4529
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,970
Limitless uh impact on the world with
the internet so there was a really key

4530
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:10,980
the internet so there was a really key
 

4531
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,229
the internet so there was a really key
bet that we made at the time which is

4532
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
bet that we made at the time which is
 

4533
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,850
bet that we made at the time which is
very controversial which was core to

4534
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:13,860
very controversial which was core to
 

4535
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,410
very controversial which was core to
core to how it was engineered which was

4536
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:15,420
core to how it was engineered which was
 

4537
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,689
core to how it was engineered which was
are we optimizing for performance or for

4538
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:17,699
are we optimizing for performance or for
 

4539
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,910
are we optimizing for performance or for
ease of creation yeah and in those days

4540
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
ease of creation yeah and in those days
 

4541
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,290
ease of creation yeah and in those days
the pressure was very intense to

4542
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:21,300
the pressure was very intense to
 

4543
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,610
the pressure was very intense to
optimize for performance because the

4544
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:22,620
optimize for performance because the
 

4545
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,470
optimize for performance because the
network connections were so slow and

4546
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
network connections were so slow and
 

4547
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,330
network connections were so slow and
also the computers were so slow

4548
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,340
also the computers were so slow
 

4549
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,189
also the computers were so slow
um and so if you had you know I

4550
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:28,199
um and so if you had you know I
 

4551
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,110
um and so if you had you know I
mentioned the progressive jpegs like

4552
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:30,120
mentioned the progressive jpegs like
 

4553
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,570
mentioned the progressive jpegs like
if if there's an alternate World in

4554
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:32,580
if if there's an alternate World in
 

4555
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,310
if if there's an alternate World in
which we optimize for performance and it

4556
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
which we optimize for performance and it
 

4557
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,570
which we optimize for performance and it
just you had just a much more pleasant

4558
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:35,580
just you had just a much more pleasant
 

4559
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,010
just you had just a much more pleasant
experience right up front

4560
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:37,020
experience right up front
 

4561
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,649
experience right up front
but what we got by not doing that was we

4562
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:39,659
but what we got by not doing that was we
 

4563
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:41,270
but what we got by not doing that was we
got ease of creation and the way that we

4564
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:41,280
got ease of creation and the way that we
 

4565
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,490
got ease of creation and the way that we
got ease of creation was all of the

4566
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:43,500
got ease of creation was all of the
 

4567
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,010
got ease of creation was all of the
protocols and formats were in text not

4568
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,020
protocols and formats were in text not
 

4569
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,790
protocols and formats were in text not
in binary and so HTTP isn't text by the

4570
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:49,800
in binary and so HTTP isn't text by the
 

4571
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,810
in binary and so HTTP isn't text by the
way and this was an internet tradition

4572
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:50,820
way and this was an internet tradition
 

4573
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,830
way and this was an internet tradition
by the way that we picked up but we

4574
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
by the way that we picked up but we
 

4575
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,189
by the way that we picked up but we
continued at HTTP is taxed and HTML is

4576
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:55,199
continued at HTTP is taxed and HTML is
 

4577
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,209
continued at HTTP is taxed and HTML is
taxed and then everybody else everything

4578
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:56,219
taxed and then everybody else everything
 

4579
01:10:56,219 --> 01:10:58,729
taxed and then everybody else everything
else that followed his text as a result

4580
01:10:58,729 --> 01:10:58,739
else that followed his text as a result
 

4581
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:00,410
else that followed his text as a result
and by the way you can imagine purist

4582
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:00,420
and by the way you can imagine purist
 

4583
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,030
and by the way you can imagine purist
Engineers saying this is insane you have

4584
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:02,040
Engineers saying this is insane you have
 

4585
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,470
Engineers saying this is insane you have
very limited bandwidth why are you

4586
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,480
very limited bandwidth why are you
 

4587
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,090
very limited bandwidth why are you
wasting any time sending text you should

4588
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:05,100
wasting any time sending text you should
 

4589
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,649
wasting any time sending text you should
be encoding the stuff into binary and

4590
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:06,659
be encoding the stuff into binary and
 

4591
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:07,729
be encoding the stuff into binary and
it'll be much faster of course the

4592
01:11:07,729 --> 01:11:07,739
it'll be much faster of course the
 

4593
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,010
it'll be much faster of course the
answer is that's correct but what you

4594
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:10,020
answer is that's correct but what you
 

4595
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,510
answer is that's correct but what you
get when you make it text is all of a

4596
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
get when you make it text is all of a
 

4597
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,890
get when you make it text is all of a
sudden well the big breakthrough was the

4598
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:12,900
sudden well the big breakthrough was the
 

4599
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,510
sudden well the big breakthrough was the
view Source function right so the fact

4600
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:14,520
view Source function right so the fact
 

4601
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,830
view Source function right so the fact
that you could look at a web page you

4602
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
that you could look at a web page you
 

4603
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,209
that you could look at a web page you
could hit view source and you could see

4604
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:17,219
could hit view source and you could see
 

4605
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:18,950
could hit view source and you could see
the HTML that was how people learn how

4606
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
the HTML that was how people learn how
 

4607
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,110
the HTML that was how people learn how
to make web pages right it's so

4608
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
to make web pages right it's so
 

4609
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,370
to make web pages right it's so
interesting because the stuff would take

4610
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:22,380
interesting because the stuff would take
 

4611
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,410
interesting because the stuff would take
for granted now

4612
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:24,420
for granted now
 

4613
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,290
for granted now
is uh man that was fundamental to the

4614
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:27,300
is uh man that was fundamental to the
 

4615
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,610
is uh man that was fundamental to the
development of the web to be able to

4616
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:28,620
development of the web to be able to
 

4617
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,950
development of the web to be able to
have HTML just right there all the

4618
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
have HTML just right there all the
 

4619
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,430
have HTML just right there all the
ghetto mess that is HTML all the sort of

4620
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:34,440
ghetto mess that is HTML all the sort of
 

4621
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,209
ghetto mess that is HTML all the sort of
almost biological like messiness of HTML

4622
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:38,219
almost biological like messiness of HTML
 

4623
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:40,610
almost biological like messiness of HTML
and then having the browser tried to

4624
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:40,620
and then having the browser tried to
 

4625
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,530
and then having the browser tried to
interpret that mess yeah to show

4626
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:42,540
interpret that mess yeah to show
 

4627
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,510
interpret that mess yeah to show
something reasonable well and then there

4628
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:44,520
something reasonable well and then there
 

4629
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,649
something reasonable well and then there
was this internet principle that we

4630
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:45,659
was this internet principle that we
 

4631
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,390
was this internet principle that we
inherited which was emit what was it

4632
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:47,400
inherited which was emit what was it
 

4633
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,370
inherited which was emit what was it
emit cautiously emit conservatively

4634
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:49,380
emit cautiously emit conservatively
 

4635
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,290
emit cautiously emit conservatively
interpret liberally so it basically

4636
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:51,300
interpret liberally so it basically
 

4637
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,270
interpret liberally so it basically
meant if you're in the design principle

4638
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,280
meant if you're in the design principle
 

4639
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,649
meant if you're in the design principle
was if you're if you're creating like a

4640
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:54,659
was if you're if you're creating like a
 

4641
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:56,149
was if you're if you're creating like a
web editor that's going to admit HTML

4642
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,159
web editor that's going to admit HTML
 

4643
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,370
web editor that's going to admit HTML
like do it as cleanly as you can but you

4644
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,380
like do it as cleanly as you can but you
 

4645
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,630
like do it as cleanly as you can but you
actually want the browser to interpret

4646
01:11:59,630 --> 01:11:59,640
actually want the browser to interpret
 

4647
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,070
actually want the browser to interpret
liberally which is you actually want

4648
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,080
liberally which is you actually want
 

4649
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,510
liberally which is you actually want
users to be able to make all kinds of

4650
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:02,520
users to be able to make all kinds of
 

4651
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,430
users to be able to make all kinds of
mistakes and for it to still work yeah

4652
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:04,440
mistakes and for it to still work yeah
 

4653
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,169
mistakes and for it to still work yeah
and so the browser rendering engines to

4654
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:06,179
and so the browser rendering engines to
 

4655
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:08,209
and so the browser rendering engines to
this day have all of this spaghetti code

4656
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:08,219
this day have all of this spaghetti code
 

4657
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:09,830
this day have all of this spaghetti code
crazy stuff where they can they're

4658
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
crazy stuff where they can they're
 

4659
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,810
crazy stuff where they can they're
resilient to all kinds of crazy HTML

4660
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:11,820
resilient to all kinds of crazy HTML
 

4661
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,490
resilient to all kinds of crazy HTML
mistakes and so and literally what I

4662
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:13,500
mistakes and so and literally what I
 

4663
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,870
mistakes and so and literally what I

4673
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,590
they're trying to make a web page for
their turtle or whatever and like they

4674
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:21,600
their turtle or whatever and like they
 

4675
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,790
their turtle or whatever and like they
leave out a slash and they leave out an

4678
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:24,120
angle bracket and they do this they do
 

4679
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,570
angle bracket and they do this they do
that and it still works it's it's also

okay fine and it keeps running and I
 

4747
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,430
okay fine and it keeps running and I
would go ask all the experts like why

4748
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:37,440
would go ask all the experts like why
 

4749
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,510
would go ask all the experts like why
can't I just keep running and they'd

4750
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:38,520
can't I just keep running and they'd
 

4751
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,649
can't I just keep running and they'd
explain to me well because all the

4752
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:39,659
explain to me well because all the
 

4753
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:41,090
explain to me well because all the

01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:43,080
I'm like they're still like you know

yeah and I was just like that's just

4764
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:52,440
yeah and I was just like that's just
 

4765
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,290
yeah and I was just like that's just
that's just bad and by the way you know

4766
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:54,300
that's just bad and by the way you know
 

4767
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,310
that's just bad and by the way you know
because what happens with that of course

4768
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:55,320
because what happens with that of course
 

4769
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,990
because what happens with that of course
is what happened with with coding at

4770
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:57,000
is what happened with with coding at
 

4771
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,950
is what happened with with coding at
that point which is you get a high

4772
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:57,960
that point which is you get a high

4776
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:01,140
number of people who are really good at
 

4777
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,410
number of people who are really good at
doing exactly that most people can't and

4778
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:03,420
doing exactly that most people can't and
 

4779
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,030
doing exactly that most people can't and
most people are excluded from it and so

4780
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:05,040
most people are excluded from it and so
 

4781
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,410
most people are excluded from it and so
actually that was where that for there's

4782
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:06,420
actually that was where that for there's
 

4783
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,570
actually that was where that for there's
where I picked up that idea was um uh

4784
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:08,580
where I picked up that idea was um uh
 

4785
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,310
where I picked up that idea was um uh
was like no no you want you want you

4786
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
was like no no you want you want you
 

4787
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,450
was like no no you want you want you
want these things to be resilient to

01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,430
want these things to be resilient to
error in all kinds and this this would

4790
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
error in all kinds and this this would
 

4791
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,870
error in all kinds and this this would
drive the purest absolutely crazy like I

4792
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
drive the purest absolutely crazy like I
 

4793
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,189
drive the purest absolutely crazy like I
got attacked on this like a lot because

4794
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,199
got attacked on this like a lot because

would be like you know you can't you're

4804
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:23,400
would be like you know you can't you're
 

4805
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,610
would be like you know you can't you're
encouraging bad behavior because oh so

and any any properly trained credential
 

4817
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,450
and any any properly trained credential
engineer would be like that's not how

4818
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:38,460
engineer would be like that's not how
 

4819
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,649
engineer would be like that's not how
you build these systems that's such a

4820
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:39,659
you build these systems that's such a
 

4821
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,510
you build these systems that's such a
bold move to say no it doesn't have to

4822
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
bold move to say no it doesn't have to
 

4823
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,010
bold move to say no it doesn't have to
be yeah now like I said the good news

4824
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:43,020
be yeah now like I said the good news
 

4825
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,330
be yeah now like I said the good news
for me is the internet kind of had that

4826
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:44,340
for me is the internet kind of had that
 

4827
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,410
for me is the internet kind of had that
traditional already

4828
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:45,420
traditional already
 

4829
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,850
traditional already
um but we but having said that like we

4830
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:46,860
um but we but having said that like we
 

4831
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,890
um but we but having said that like we
pushed it we pushed it way out but the

4832
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:48,900
pushed it we pushed it way out but the
 

4833
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:49,850
pushed it we pushed it way out but the
other thing we did going back to the

4834
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:49,860
other thing we did going back to the
 

4835
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,229
other thing we did going back to the
performance thing was we gave up a lot

4836
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:51,239
performance thing was we gave up a lot
 

4837
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:52,550
performance thing was we gave up a lot
of performance we made that initial

4838
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
of performance we made that initial
 

4839
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,750
of performance we made that initial
experience for the first few years was

4840
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
experience for the first few years was
 

4841
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,729
experience for the first few years was
pretty painful but but the bet there was

4842
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:55,739
pretty painful but but the bet there was
 

4843
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,110
pretty painful but but the bet there was
actually an economic bet which was

4844
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
actually an economic bet which was
 

4845
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,970
actually an economic bet which was
basically the demand for the web would

4846
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:58,980
basically the demand for the web would
 

4847
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,990
basically the demand for the web would
basically mean that there would be a

4848
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
basically mean that there would be a
 

4849
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,209
basically mean that there would be a
surge in supply of broadband like we

4850
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:02,219
surge in supply of broadband like we
 

4851
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:04,550
surge in supply of broadband like we
because the question was okay how do you

4852
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:04,560
because the question was okay how do you
 

4853
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,350
because the question was okay how do you
get how do you how do you get the phone

4854
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:06,360
get how do you how do you get the phone
 

4855
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,630
get how do you how do you get the phone
companies which are not famous in those

4856
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
companies which are not famous in those
 

4857
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,790
companies which are not famous in those
days for doing new things at huge cost

4858
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
days for doing new things at huge cost
 

4859
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,590
days for doing new things at huge cost
for like speculative reasons like how do

4860
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:12,600
for like speculative reasons like how do
 

4861
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,330
for like speculative reasons like how do
you get them to build up Broadband you

4862
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,340
you get them to build up Broadband you
 

4863
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,590
you get them to build up Broadband you
know spend billions of dollars doing

4864
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
know spend billions of dollars doing
 

4865
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,209
know spend billions of dollars doing
that and you know you could go meet with

4866
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:17,219
that and you know you could go meet with
 

4867
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,649
that and you know you could go meet with
them and try to talk them into it or you

4868
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:18,659
them and try to talk them into it or you
 

4869
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:20,149
them and try to talk them into it or you
could just have a thing where it's just

4870
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
could just have a thing where it's just
 

4871
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,350
could just have a thing where it's just
very clear that it's going to be the

4872
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
very clear that it's going to be the
 

4873
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,450
very clear that it's going to be the
people love that's going to be better if

4874
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:23,460
people love that's going to be better if
 

4875
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,030
people love that's going to be better if
it's faster and so that that there was a

4876
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:26,040
it's faster and so that that there was a
 

4877
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,990
it's faster and so that that there was a
period there and this was this was

4878
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:27,000
period there and this was this was
 

4879
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,310
period there and this was this was
fraught with some Peril but there was a

4880
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
fraught with some Peril but there was a
 

4881
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,810
fraught with some Peril but there was a
period there where it's like we knew the

4882
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:29,820
period there where it's like we knew the
 

4883
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,850
period there where it's like we knew the
experience was sub-optimized because we

4884
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:31,860
experience was sub-optimized because we
 

4885
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,010
experience was sub-optimized because we
were trying to force the emergence of

4886
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:34,020
were trying to force the emergence of
 

4887
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,110
were trying to force the emergence of
demand for Broadband sure which is in

4888
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:36,120
demand for Broadband sure which is in
 

4889
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,430
demand for Broadband sure which is in
fact what happened

4890
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
fact what happened
 

4891
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,470
fact what happened
so you have to figure out how to display

4892
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:39,480
so you have to figure out how to display
 

4893
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,050
so you have to figure out how to display
this text html text

4894
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:42,060
this text html text
 

4895
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,790
this text html text
so the Blue Links and the purple links

4896
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:43,800
so the Blue Links and the purple links
 

4897
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,890
so the Blue Links and the purple links
and there's no standards is there

4898
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:45,900
and there's no standards is there
 

4899
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,709
and there's no standards is there
standards at that time it really still

4900
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
standards at that time it really still
 

4901
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:49,850
standards at that time it really still
wasn't

4902
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:49,860
wasn't
 

4903
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,610
wasn't
well there's like there's implied

4904
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:52,620
well there's like there's implied
 

4905
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,370
well there's like there's implied
implied standards right and they you

4906
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:55,380
implied standards right and they you
 

4907
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,510
implied standards right and they you
know there's all these cousin new

4908
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:56,520
know there's all these cousin new
 

4909
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,010
know there's all these cousin new
features that are being added like CSS

4910
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:58,020
features that are being added like CSS
 

4911
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,530
features that are being added like CSS
what like what kind of stuff a browser

4912
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:00,540
what like what kind of stuff a browser
 

4913
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,030
what like what kind of stuff a browser
should be able to support features

4914
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,040
should be able to support features
 

4915
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,709
should be able to support features
within languages within JavaScript and

4916
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:03,719
within languages within JavaScript and
 

4917
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:07,189
within languages within JavaScript and
so on but you you bait you're setting

4918
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
so on but you you bait you're setting
 

4919
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,270
so on but you you bait you're setting
standards

4920
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:08,280
standards
 

4921
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,290
standards
on the fly yeah yourself well to this

4922
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:12,300
on the fly yeah yourself well to this
 

4923
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,090
on the fly yeah yourself well to this
day if you if you create a web page that

4924
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:14,100
day if you if you create a web page that
 

4925
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,430
day if you if you create a web page that
has no CSS style sheet the browser will

4926
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:16,440
has no CSS style sheet the browser will
 

4927
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,290
has no CSS style sheet the browser will
render it however it wants to yeah right

4928
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:18,300
render it however it wants to yeah right
 

4929
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,209
render it however it wants to yeah right
so this was one of the things there was

4930
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:20,219
so this was one of the things there was
 

4931
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,490
so this was one of the things there was
this idea this idea at the time and how

4932
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:22,500
this idea this idea at the time and how
 

4933
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,390
this idea this idea at the time and how
these systems were built which is

4934
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:23,400
these systems were built which is
 

4935
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,610
these systems were built which is
separation of content from uh format or

4936
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:25,620
separation of content from uh format or
 

4937
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,470
separation of content from uh format or
separation of uh yeah content from

4938
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:27,480
separation of uh yeah content from
 

4939
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,970
separation of uh yeah content from
appearance

4940
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:28,980
appearance
 

4941
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,530
appearance
um and that's still people don't really

4942
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:30,540
um and that's still people don't really
 

4943
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,910
um and that's still people don't really
use it anymore because everybody wants

4944
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:31,920
use it anymore because everybody wants
 

4945
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,110
use it anymore because everybody wants
to determine how things look and so they

4946
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,120
to determine how things look and so they
 

4947
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,630
to determine how things look and so they
use CSS but um it's still in there that

4948
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:35,640
use CSS but um it's still in there that
 

4949
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,770
use CSS but um it's still in there that
you can just let the browser do all the

4950
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:36,780
you can just let the browser do all the
 

4951
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,110
you can just let the browser do all the
work I still like the

4952
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
work I still like the
 

4953
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,830
work I still like the
like uh really basic websites but that

4954
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:42,840
like uh really basic websites but that
 

4955
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,990
like uh really basic websites but that
could be just old school kids these days

4956
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:45,000
could be just old school kids these days
 

4957
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,490
could be just old school kids these days
with their fancy

4958
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:46,500
with their fancy
 

4959
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,709
with their fancy
responsive websites that don't actually

4960
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
responsive websites that don't actually
 

4961
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,149
responsive websites that don't actually
have much content but have a lot of

4962
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
have much content but have a lot of
 

4963
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,709
have much content but have a lot of
visual elements well that's one of the

4964
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:51,719
visual elements well that's one of the
 

4965
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:53,030
visual elements well that's one of the
things that's fun about chat you know

4966
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
things that's fun about chat you know
 

4967
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,310
things that's fun about chat you know
about chatgpt yes like back to the

4968
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:55,320
about chatgpt yes like back to the
 

4969
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,070
about chatgpt yes like back to the
basics back to just text yeah right and

4970
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
basics back to just text yeah right and
 

4971
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,290
basics back to just text yeah right and
it you know there is this pattern in

4972

it you know there is this pattern in
 

4973
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,570
it you know there is this pattern in
human creativity and media where you end

4974
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:02,580
human creativity and media where you end
 

4975
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,550
human creativity and media where you end
up back at text and I think there's you

up back at text and I think there's you
 

4977
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,110
up back at text and I think there's you
know there's something powerful in there

4978

know there's something powerful in there
 

4979
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,669
know there's something powerful in there
is there some other stuff you remember

4980
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
is there some other stuff you remember
 

4981
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,649
is there some other stuff you remember
like the purple links there were some

4982
01:17:09,649 --> 01:17:09,659
like the purple links there were some
 

4983
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,630
like the purple links there were some
interesting design decisions to kind of

4984
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:11,640
interesting design decisions to kind of
 

4985
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,450
interesting design decisions to kind of
come up that we have today or we don't

4986
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:14,460
come up that we have today or we don't
 

4987
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,390
come up that we have today or we don't
have today that were temporary so uh we

4988
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:17,400
have today that were temporary so uh we
 

4989
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,709
have today that were temporary so uh we
made I made the background I hated

4990
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
made I made the background I hated
 

4991
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,649
made I made the background I hated
reading text on white uh uh backgrounds

4992
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:21,659
reading text on white uh uh backgrounds
 

4993
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:22,669
reading text on white uh uh backgrounds
and so I made the background for

4994
01:17:22,669 --> 01:17:22,679
and so I made the background for
 

4995
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,370
and so I made the background for
everybody

4996
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:24,380
everybody
 

4997
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,110
everybody
no no no that's that decision I think

4998
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
no no no that's that decision I think
 

4999
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,669
no no no that's that decision I think
has been reversed um but but now I'm

5000
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:28,679
has been reversed um but but now I'm
 

5001
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,110
has been reversed um but but now I'm
happy though because now dark mode is

5002
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,120
happy though because now dark mode is
 

5003
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,229
happy though because now dark mode is
the thing so so it wasn't about gray it

5004
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:33,239
the thing so so it wasn't about gray it
 

5005
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,669
the thing so so it wasn't about gray it
was just he didn't want white background

5006
01:17:34,669 --> 01:17:34,679
was just he didn't want white background
 

5007
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:36,050
was just he didn't want white background
strain my eyes

5008
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:36,060
strain my eyes
 

5009
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,709
strain my eyes
change your eyes interesting

5010
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:39,719
change your eyes interesting
 

5011
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:41,030
change your eyes interesting
um and then there's a bunch of other

5012
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
um and then there's a bunch of other
 

5013
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,649
um and then there's a bunch of other
decisions I'm sure there's an

5014
01:17:42,649 --> 01:17:42,659
decisions I'm sure there's an
 

5015
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,910
decisions I'm sure there's an
interesting history of the development

5016
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
interesting history of the development
 

5017
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,390
interesting history of the development
of HTML and CSS and all those and

5018
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
of HTML and CSS and all those and
 

5019
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,770
of HTML and CSS and all those and
interface and JavaScript and there's

5020
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:48,780
interface and JavaScript and there's
 

5021
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,290
interface and JavaScript and there's
this whole Java applet thing

5022
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:51,300
this whole Java applet thing
 

5023
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,050
this whole Java applet thing
well the big one probably JavaScript CSS

5024
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:54,060
well the big one probably JavaScript CSS
 

5025
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,370
well the big one probably JavaScript CSS
was after me so I didn't that was not me

5026
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:55,380
was after me so I didn't that was not me
 

5027
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,950
was after me so I didn't that was not me
but um JavaScript was the big JavaScript

5028
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:57,960
but um JavaScript was the big JavaScript
 

5029
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,149
but um JavaScript was the big JavaScript
maybe was the biggest of the whole thing

5030
01:17:59,149 --> 01:17:59,159
maybe was the biggest of the whole thing
 

5031
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:00,229
maybe was the biggest of the whole thing
that was us

5032
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:00,239
that was us
 

5033
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,630
that was us
um and um and that was basically a bet

5034
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
um and um and that was basically a bet
 

5035
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,430
um and um and that was basically a bet
it was a bet on two things one is that

5036
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:04,440
it was a bet on two things one is that
 

5037
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,630
it was a bet on two things one is that
the world wanted a new front-end

5038
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,640
the world wanted a new front-end
 

5039
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,370
the world wanted a new front-end
scripting language

5040
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:07,380
scripting language
 

5041
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,810
scripting language
um and then the other was we I thought

5042
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:08,820
um and then the other was we I thought
 

5043
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,890
um and then the other was we I thought
at the time the world wanted a new

5044
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:09,900
at the time the world wanted a new
 

5045
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,450
at the time the world wanted a new
back-end scripting language

5046
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:11,460
back-end scripting language
 

5047
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,010
back-end scripting language
um so JavaScript was designed from the

5048
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:13,020
um so JavaScript was designed from the
 

5049
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,390
um so JavaScript was designed from the
beginning to be both front end and back

5050
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
beginning to be both front end and back
 

5051
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,229
beginning to be both front end and back
end

5052
01:18:15,229 --> 01:18:15,239
end
 

5053
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:16,850
end
and then it failed as a back-end

5054
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:16,860
and then it failed as a back-end
 

5055
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,610
and then it failed as a back-end
scripting language and uh Java one for a

5056
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:19,620
scripting language and uh Java one for a
 

5057
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,870
scripting language and uh Java one for a
long time and then python Pearl and

5058
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
long time and then python Pearl and
 

5059
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,270
long time and then python Pearl and
other things PHP um and Ruby but now

5060
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
other things PHP um and Ruby but now
 

5061
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,510
other things PHP um and Ruby but now
JavaScript is back and so I wonder if

5062
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:26,520
JavaScript is back and so I wonder if
 

5063
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,830
JavaScript is back and so I wonder if
everything in the end will run on

5064
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
everything in the end will run on
 

5065
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,990
everything in the end will run on
JavaScript it see it seems like it is

5066
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
JavaScript it see it seems like it is
 

5067
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,250
JavaScript it see it seems like it is
the um and by the way let me give a

releasing these models it is scary it is
 

5183
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,350
releasing these models it is scary it is
potentially very dangerous and we'll

5184
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
potentially very dangerous and we'll
 

5185
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,669
potentially very dangerous and we'll
talk about that

that came out of that so what did you
learn from just the acquisition I mean

5352
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
learn from just the acquisition I mean
 

5353
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,970
learn from just the acquisition I mean
this is so much money

5354
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:15,980
this is so much money
 

5355
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:18,649
this is so much money
what's interesting because I I must have

what's interesting because I I must have
 

5357
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:21,470
what's interesting because I I must have
been very new to you that these software

5358
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:21,480
been very new to you that these software
 

5359
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,310
been very new to you that these software
stuff you can make so much money there's

5360

the thing I don't know if I figured out

5370
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:33,420
the thing I don't know if I figured out
 

5371
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,330
the thing I don't know if I figured out
then but figured out later which is

5372
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:35,340
then but figured out later which is
 

5373
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,610
then but figured out later which is
um software is a technology that it's

5374
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:37,620
um software is a technology that it's
 

5375
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:38,870
um software is a technology that it's
like a you know the concept of the

5376
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
like a you know the concept of the
 

5377
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,430
like a you know the concept of the
Philosopher's Stone this is a

Philosopher's Stone this is a
 

5379
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,390
Philosopher's Stone this is a
philosopher stone in alchemy

Philosopher's Stone never got there
 

5387
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,510
Philosopher's Stone never got there
nobody's ever figured it out software is

5388
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
nobody's ever figured it out software is
 

5389
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,790
nobody's ever figured it out software is
our modern philosopher stone and in

5390
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:49,800
our modern philosopher stone and in
 

5391
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,310
our modern philosopher stone and in
economic uh terms it transmutes labor

5392
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
economic uh terms it transmutes labor
 

5393
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,390
economic uh terms it transmutes labor
into capital

5394

into capital
 

5395
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,729
into capital
which is like a super interesting thing

5396
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:55,739
which is like a super interesting thing
 

5397
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,590
which is like a super interesting thing
and by the way like Karl Marx is rolling

5398
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
and by the way like Karl Marx is rolling
 

5399
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,669
and by the way like Karl Marx is rolling
over and describe right now because of

course that's a complete refutation of

01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,060
course that's a complete refutation of
 

5403
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,030
course that's a complete refutation of
his entire Theory um

5404
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:02,040
his entire Theory um
 

5405
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,470
his entire Theory um
transmission labor and capital which is

5406
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:03,480
transmission labor and capital which is
 

5407
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,410
transmission labor and capital which is
which is as follows is somebody sits

5408
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:06,420
which is as follows is somebody sits
 

5409
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,270
which is as follows is somebody sits
down on a keyboard and types A bunch of

5410
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:08,280
down on a keyboard and types A bunch of
 

5411
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,729
down on a keyboard and types A bunch of
stuff in and a capital asset comes out

5412
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:10,739
stuff in and a capital asset comes out
 

5413
01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:12,410
stuff in and a capital asset comes out
the other side and then somebody buys

5414
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:12,420
the other side and then somebody buys
 

5415
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,090
the other side and then somebody buys
that Capital asset for a billion dollars

5416
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:14,100
that Capital asset for a billion dollars
 

5417
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,229
that Capital asset for a billion dollars
like

5418
01:24:15,229 --> 01:24:15,239
like
 

5419
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:17,570
like
that's amazing right it's literally

5420
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:17,580
that's amazing right it's literally
 

5421
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,370
that's amazing right it's literally
creating value right out of thin air

5422
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:19,380
creating value right out of thin air
 

5423
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,550
creating value right out of thin air
right out of purely human thought right

5424
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
right out of purely human thought right
 

5425
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,470
right out of purely human thought right
um and so that that that's there are

5426
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,480
um and so that that that's there are
 

5427
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,790
um and so that that that's there are
many things that make software magical

5428
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:25,800
many things that make software magical
 

5429
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,590
many things that make software magical
and special but that's the economics I

5430
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
and special but that's the economics I
 

5431
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,910
and special but that's the economics I
wonder what Marx would have thought

5432
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:28,920
wonder what Marx would have thought
 

5433
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,350
wonder what Marx would have thought
about that oh he would have completely

5434
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:30,360
about that oh he would have completely
 

5435
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,790
about that oh he would have completely
broke his brain because of course the

5436
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:31,800

5594
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:50,880
predecessor to machine intelligence
 

5595
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,790
predecessor to machine intelligence
which is human intelligence and we've

5596
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:52,800
which is human intelligence and we've
 

5597
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,229
which is human intelligence and we've
got you know observations and theories

5598
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
got you know observations and theories
 

5599
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,030
got you know observations and theories
over thousands of years for what what

5600
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:56,040
over thousands of years for what what
 

5601
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,410
over thousands of years for what what
what intelligence is in the hands of

5602
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:57,420
what intelligence is in the hands of
 

5603
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,870
what intelligence is in the hands of
humans and what intelligence is right I

5604
01:26:59,870 --> 01:26:59,880
humans and what intelligence is right I
 

5605
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,610
humans and what intelligence is right I
mean what it literally is is the way to

5606
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:01,620
mean what it literally is is the way to
 

5607
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,350
mean what it literally is is the way to
uh you know capture process analyze

5608
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
uh you know capture process analyze
 

5609
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,930
uh you know capture process analyze
synthesize information solve problems

5610
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:05,940
synthesize information solve problems
 

5611
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,090
synthesize information solve problems
um but the observation of of

5612
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,100
um but the observation of of
 

5613
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,950
um but the observation of of
intelligence in human hands is that

5614
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:09,960
intelligence in human hands is that
 

5615
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,390
intelligence in human hands is that
intelligence quite literally makes

5616
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:11,400
intelligence quite literally makes
 

5617
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,070
intelligence quite literally makes
everything better

5618
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:13,080
everything better
 

5619
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,290
everything better
um and what I mean by that is every kind

5620
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:15,300
um and what I mean by that is every kind
 

5621
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,870
um and what I mean by that is every kind
of outcome of like human quality of life

and uh the G Factor
 

5675
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,830
and uh the G Factor
and that that's something in large part

5676
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:18,840
and that that's something in large part
 

5677
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,770

it's like all the inspirational stuff we

5684
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:30,540
it's like all the inspirational stuff we
 

5685
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,870
it's like all the inspirational stuff we
read about like if you work hard and so

5686
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
read about like if you work hard and so
 

5687
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,830

damn it sucks that you're born with the
 

5691
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,450
damn it sucks that you're born with the
hand that you can't change but what if

5692
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:38,460
hand that you can't change but what if
 

5693
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,270
hand that you can't change but what if
you could you're saying basically a

5694
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:41,280
you could you're saying basically a
 

5695
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,970
you could you're saying basically a
really important point I think it's a uh

5696
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:43,980
really important point I think it's a uh
 

5697
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,070
really important point I think it's a uh
in your articles

5698
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
in your articles
 

5699
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,410
in your articles
it really helped me

5700
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:48,420
it really helped me
 

5701
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,010
it really helped me
um

5702
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:49,020
um
 

5703
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,770
um
it's a nice added perspective to think

5704
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:51,780
it's a nice added perspective to think
 

5705
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:54,169
it's a nice added perspective to think
about listen human intelligence the

5706
01:28:54,169 --> 01:28:54,179
about listen human intelligence the
 

5707
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:55,610
about listen human intelligence the
science of intelligence is shown

5708
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:55,620
science of intelligence is shown
 

5709
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,250
science of intelligence is shown
scientifically that it just makes life

5710
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:58,260
scientifically that it just makes life
 

5711
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,990
scientifically that it just makes life
easier and better

5712
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:00,000
easier and better
 

5713
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,530
easier and better
the smarter you are and now let's look

5714
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:03,540
the smarter you are and now let's look
 

5715
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,629
the smarter you are and now let's look
at artificial intelligence

5716
01:29:05,629 --> 01:29:05,639
at artificial intelligence
 

5717
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,090
at artificial intelligence
and

5718
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:07,100
and
 

5719
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,990
and
if uh that's a way to increase the the

5720
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,000
if uh that's a way to increase the the
 

5721
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,050
if uh that's a way to increase the the
some human intelligence then it's only

5722
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:15,060
some human intelligence then it's only
 

5723
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,610
some human intelligence then it's only
going to make a better life yeah that's

5724
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:16,620
going to make a better life yeah that's
 

5725
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,990
going to make a better life yeah that's
the argument and certainly at the

5726
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
the argument and certainly at the
 

5727
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,010
the argument and certainly at the
collective level we could talk about the

5728
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:19,020
collective level we could talk about the
 

5729
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,149
collective level we could talk about the
collective effect of just having more

5730
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
collective effect of just having more
 

5731
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,890
collective effect of just having more
intelligence in the world which which

5732
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:21,900
intelligence in the world which which
 

5733
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,930
intelligence in the world which which
will have very big payoff but there's

5734
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:23,940
will have very big payoff but there's
 

5735
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,370
will have very big payoff but there's
also just at the individual level like

5736
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:25,380
also just at the individual level like
 

5737
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,530
also just at the individual level like
what if every person has a machine you

5738
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:27,540
what if every person has a machine you
 

5739
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,330
what if every person has a machine you
know and it's a concept of augment Doug

5740
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:29,340
know and it's a concept of augment Doug
 

5741
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,729
know and it's a concept of augment Doug

5743
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:33,950
engelbert's concept of augmentation
um you know what if everybody has a an

5744
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:33,960
um you know what if everybody has a an
 

5745
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,350
um you know what if everybody has a an
assistant and the assistant is you know

01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:46,739
knows everything about you and is
 

5757
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:48,290
knows everything about you and is
pulling for you in every possible way

5758
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:48,300
pulling for you in every possible way
 

5759
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,050
pulling for you in every possible way
wants you to be successful and anytime

5760
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:51,060
wants you to be successful and anytime
 

5761
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,850
wants you to be successful and anytime
you find anything confusing or want to

5762
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:52,860
you find anything confusing or want to
 

5763
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,810
you find anything confusing or want to
learn anything or have trouble

5764
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:53,820
learn anything or have trouble
 

5765
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,010
learn anything or have trouble
understanding something or want to

5766
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:55,020
understanding something or want to
 

5767
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,030
understanding something or want to
figure out what to do in a situation

5768
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:56,040
figure out what to do in a situation
 

5769
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,709
figure out what to do in a situation
right I'm going to figure out how to

5770
01:29:57,709 --> 01:29:57,719
right I'm going to figure out how to
 

5771
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,149
right I'm going to figure out how to
prepare for a job interview like any of

5772
01:29:59,149 --> 01:29:59,159
prepare for a job interview like any of
 

5773
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:01,129
prepare for a job interview like any of
these things like it will help you do it

5774
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:01,139
these things like it will help you do it
 

5775
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:03,110
these things like it will help you do it
and it will therefore the combination

5776
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
and it will therefore the combination
 

5777
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,570
and it will therefore the combination
will effectively be you know well if you

5778
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:05,580
will effectively be you know well if you
 

5779
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,950
will effectively be you know well if you
effectively raise your raise because it

5780
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
effectively raise your raise because it
 

5781
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,390
effectively raise your raise because it
will effectively raise your IQ will

5782
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:08,400
will effectively raise your IQ will
 

5783
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,370
will effectively raise your IQ will
therefore raise the odds of successful

5784
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:10,380
therefore raise the odds of successful
 

5785
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,689
therefore raise the odds of successful
life outcomes in all these areas so

5786
01:30:11,689 --> 01:30:11,699
life outcomes in all these areas so
 

5787
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:14,689
life outcomes in all these areas so
people below the this hypothetical 140

5788
01:30:14,689 --> 01:30:14,699
people below the this hypothetical 140
 

5789
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,689
people below the this hypothetical 140
IQ it'll pull them up towards 140 IQ

5790
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:17,699
IQ it'll pull them up towards 140 IQ
 

5791
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:19,430
IQ it'll pull them up towards 140 IQ
yeah yeah and then of course you know

5792
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:19,440
yeah yeah and then of course you know
 

5793
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,470
yeah yeah and then of course you know
people at people at 140 IQ will be able

5794
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:21,480
people at people at 140 IQ will be able
 

5795
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,910
people at people at 140 IQ will be able
to have a peer right to be able to

5796
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:22,920
to have a peer right to be able to
 

5797
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,229
to have a peer right to be able to
communicate which is great and then

5798
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
communicate which is great and then
 

5799
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,790
communicate which is great and then
people above 140 IQ will have an

5800
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:25,800
people above 140 IQ will have an
 

5801
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,990
people above 140 IQ will have an
assistance if they can Farm things out

5802
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:27,000
assistance if they can Farm things out
 

5803
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,330
assistance if they can Farm things out
to and then look God willing you know at

5804
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:29,340
to and then look God willing you know at
 

5805
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,649
to and then look God willing you know at
some point these things go from future

5806
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:30,659
some point these things go from future
 

5807
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:32,689
some point these things go from future
versions go from 140 IQ equivalent to

5808
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:32,699
versions go from 140 IQ equivalent to
 

5809
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:36,110
versions go from 140 IQ equivalent to
150 to 160 to 180 right like Einstein

5810
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:36,120
150 to 160 to 180 right like Einstein
 

5811
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,550
150 to 160 to 180 right like Einstein
was the estimated to be on the order of

5812
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:37,560
was the estimated to be on the order of
 

5813
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,810
was the estimated to be on the order of
160.

5814
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:38,820
160.
 

5815
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,270
160.
um you know so when we get you know 160

5816
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:41,280
um you know so when we get you know 160
 

5817
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,910
um you know so when we get you know 160
AI like will be you know when one

5818
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:43,920
AI like will be you know when one
 

5819
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,470
AI like will be you know when one
assumes creating Einstein level

5820
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:45,480
assumes creating Einstein level
 

5821
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,750
assumes creating Einstein level
breakthroughs and physics and and then

5822
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760
breakthroughs and physics and and then
 

5823
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,209
breakthroughs and physics and and then
and then at 180 we'll be you know curing

5824
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:50,219
and then at 180 we'll be you know curing
 

5825
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:52,070
and then at 180 we'll be you know curing
cancer and developing warp drive and

5826
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,080
cancer and developing warp drive and
 

5827
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,350
cancer and developing warp drive and
doing all kinds of stuff and so it is

5828
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:54,360
doing all kinds of stuff and so it is
 

5829
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,910
doing all kinds of stuff and so it is
quite possibly the case this is the most

5830
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
quite possibly the case this is the most
 

5831
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,990
quite possibly the case this is the most
important thing that's ever happened the

5832
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:57,000
important thing that's ever happened the
 

5833
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,729
important thing that's ever happened the
best things ever happen because

5834
01:30:58,729 --> 01:30:58,739
best things ever happen because
 

5835
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:01,010
best things ever happen because
precisely because it's a lever on this

5836
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,020
precisely because it's a lever on this
 

5837
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,330
precisely because it's a lever on this
single fundamental factor of

5838
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:02,340
single fundamental factor of
 

5839
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,590
single fundamental factor of
intelligence which is the thing that

5840
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:03,600
intelligence which is the thing that
 

5841
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,810
intelligence which is the thing that
drives so much of everything else

5842
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:05,820
drives so much of everything else
 

5843
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,030
drives so much of everything else
can you still man the case that human

5844
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:08,040
can you still man the case that human
 

5845
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,250
can you still man the case that human
plus AI is not always better than human

5846
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:10,260
plus AI is not always better than human

for the individual you may have noticed

5848
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:12,060
for the individual you may have noticed
 

5849
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,070

that there's a lot of smart [\h__\h]

5850
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:13,080
that there's a lot of smart [\h__\h]
 

5851
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,530
that there's a lot of smart [\h__\h]
running around sure yes right and so

5852
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:15,540
running around sure yes right and so
 

5853
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,570
running around sure yes right and so
like it's smart there are certain people

5854
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:17,580
like it's smart there are certain people
 

5855
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,370
like it's smart there are certain people
where they get smarter you know they get

5856
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,380
where they get smarter you know they get
 

5857
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,110
where they get smarter you know they get
to be more arrogant right so you know

5858
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
to be more arrogant right so you know
 

5859
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,750
to be more arrogant right so you know
there's one huge flaw although to push

5860
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:23,760
there's one huge flaw although to push
 

5861
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,550
there's one huge flaw although to push
back on that it might be interesting

5862
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:25,560
back on that it might be interesting
 

5863
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,370
back on that it might be interesting
because when the intelligence is not all

5864
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:28,380
because when the intelligence is not all
 

5865
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:30,229
because when the intelligence is not all
coming from you but from a system from

5866
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:30,239
coming from you but from a system from
 

5867
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,430
coming from you but from a system from
another system that might actually

5868
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
another system that might actually
 

5869
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,070
another system that might actually
increase the the amount of humility even

5870
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:34,080
increase the the amount of humility even
 

5871
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,830
increase the the amount of humility even
in the [\h__\h] one would hope

in the [\h__\h] one would hope
 

5873
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,570
in the [\h__\h] one would hope
um or it could make [\h__\h] more

5874
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:38,580
um or it could make [\h__\h] more
 

5875

[\h__\h] you know that's I mean that's
 

5877
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:41,810
[\h__\h] you know that's I mean that's
that's for psychology to study yeah

5878
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:41,820
that's for psychology to study yeah
 

5879
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,330
that's for psychology to study yeah
exactly another one is um the smart

5880
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:44,340
exactly another one is um the smart

exactly another one is um the smart
people are very convinced that they you

5882
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:46,020
people are very convinced that they you
 

5883
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,270
people are very convinced that they you
know have a more rational view of the

5884
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:47,280
know have a more rational view of the
 

5885
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,709
know have a more rational view of the
world and that they have a easier time

world and that they have a easier time
 

5887
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,090
world and that they have a easier time
seeing through conspiracy theories and

5888
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:50,100
seeing through conspiracy theories and
 

5889
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,770
seeing through conspiracy theories and
hoaxes and right you know sort of crazy

5890
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:51,780
hoaxes and right you know sort of crazy
 

5891
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,990
hoaxes and right you know sort of crazy
beliefs and all that there's a theory in

5892
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
beliefs and all that there's a theory in
 

5893
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,189
beliefs and all that there's a theory in
Psychology which is actually smart

5894
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
Psychology which is actually smart
 

5895
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,290
Psychology which is actually smart
people so for sure people who aren't as

5896
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:57,300
people so for sure people who aren't as
 

5897
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,910
people so for sure people who aren't as
smart are very susceptible to hoaxes and

5898
01:31:58,910 --> 01:31:58,920
smart are very susceptible to hoaxes and
 

5899
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,890
smart are very susceptible to hoaxes and
conspiracy theories but it may also be

5900
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:00,900
conspiracy theories but it may also be
 

5901
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,209
conspiracy theories but it may also be
the case that the smarter you get you

5902
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:02,219
the case that the smarter you get you
 

5903
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,610
the case that the smarter you get you
become susceptible in a different way uh

5904
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:04,620
become susceptible in a different way uh
 

5905
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,810
become susceptible in a different way uh
which is you become very good at

5906
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:05,820
which is you become very good at
 

5907
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,030
which is you become very good at
marshalling facts to fit preconceptions

5908
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:08,040
marshalling facts to fit preconceptions
 

5909
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,649
marshalling facts to fit preconceptions
right

5910
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:09,659
right
 

5911
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:11,209
right
um you become very very good at

5912
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:11,219
um you become very very good at
 

5913
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:12,830
um you become very very good at
assembling whatever theories and

5914
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:12,840
assembling whatever theories and
 

5915
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,290
assembling whatever theories and
Frameworks and pieces of data and graphs

5916
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:15,300
Frameworks and pieces of data and graphs
 

5917
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,729
Frameworks and pieces of data and graphs
and charts you need to validate whatever

5918
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:16,739
and charts you need to validate whatever
 

5919
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:18,890
and charts you need to validate whatever
crazy idea has got in your head and so

5920
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:18,900
crazy idea has got in your head and so
 

5921
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,229
crazy idea has got in your head and so
you're susceptible in a different way

5922
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:21,239
you're susceptible in a different way
 

5923
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,350
you're susceptible in a different way
right uh we're all sheep but

5924
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:24,360
right uh we're all sheep but
 

5925
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,390
right uh we're all sheep but
different colored some sheep are better

5926
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
different colored some sheep are better
 

5927
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,189
different colored some sheep are better
at justifying it right

5928
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:28,199
at justifying it right
 

5929
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:29,450
at justifying it right
um and those are the you know those are

5930
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:29,460
um and those are the you know those are
 

5931
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,070
um and those are the you know those are
the smart shape right

5932
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:31,080
the smart shape right
 

5933
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,689
the smart shape right
um so yeah look like it I would say this

5934
01:32:32,689 --> 01:32:32,699
um so yeah look like it I would say this
 

5935
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:34,310
um so yeah look like it I would say this
look like there are no fantasy I'm not

5936
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
look like there are no fantasy I'm not
 

5937
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,050
look like there are no fantasy I'm not
I'm not a utopian there are no panaceas

5938
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:36,060
I'm not a utopian there are no panaceas
 

5939
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,450
I'm not a utopian there are no panaceas
in life um there are no like you know I

5940
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:38,460
in life um there are no like you know I
 

5941
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,229
in life um there are no like you know I
don't believe they're like pure

5942
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:39,239
don't believe they're like pure
 

5943
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,030
don't believe they're like pure
positives I'm not a transcendental kind

5944
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
positives I'm not a transcendental kind
 

5945
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,310
positives I'm not a transcendental kind
of person like that but you know so yeah

5946
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:43,320
of person like that but you know so yeah
 

5947
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,810
of person like that but you know so yeah
there are going to be issues

5948
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:44,820
there are going to be issues
 

5949
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,729
there are going to be issues
um uh and um and you know look smart

5950
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:46,739
um uh and um and you know look smart
 

5951
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:47,930
um uh and um and you know look smart
people another maybe you could say about

5952
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:47,940
people another maybe you could say about
 

5953
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,310
people another maybe you could say about
smart people is they are more likely to

5954
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:49,320
smart people is they are more likely to
 

5955
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,570
smart people is they are more likely to
get themselves in situations that are

5956
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:50,580
get themselves in situations that are
 

5957
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,709
get themselves in situations that are
you know beyond their grasp you know

5958
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:51,719
you know beyond their grasp you know
 

5959
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:52,850
you know beyond their grasp you know
because they're just more confident that

5960
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:52,860
because they're just more confident that
 

5961
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,110
because they're just more confident that
their ability to deal with complexity

5962
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,120
their ability to deal with complexity
 

5963
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,270
their ability to deal with complexity
and their their eyes become bigger their

5964
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:56,280
and their their eyes become bigger their
 

5965
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,770
and their their eyes become bigger their
cognitive eyes become bigger than their

5966
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:57,780
cognitive eyes become bigger than their
 

5967
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,810
cognitive eyes become bigger than their
stomach you know so yeah you could argue

5968
01:32:59,810 --> 01:32:59,820
stomach you know so yeah you could argue
 

5969
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,970
stomach you know so yeah you could argue
those eight different ways nevertheless

5970
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:01,980
those eight different ways nevertheless
 

5971
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,490
those eight different ways nevertheless
on that right clearly overwhelmingly

5972
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:04,500
on that right clearly overwhelmingly
 

5973
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,290
on that right clearly overwhelmingly
again if you just extrapolate from what

5974
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:06,300
again if you just extrapolate from what
 

5975
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,729
again if you just extrapolate from what
we know about human intelligence you're

5976
01:33:07,729 --> 01:33:07,739
we know about human intelligence you're
 

5977
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:09,950
we know about human intelligence you're
you're improving so many aspects of life

5978
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:09,960
you're improving so many aspects of life
 

5979
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,870
you're improving so many aspects of life
if you're upgrading intelligence

5980
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:11,880
if you're upgrading intelligence
 

5981
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,810
if you're upgrading intelligence
so there'll be assistance at all stages

5982
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:14,820
so there'll be assistance at all stages
 

5983
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,850
so there'll be assistance at all stages
of life so when you're younger there's

5984
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:16,860
of life so when you're younger there's
 

5985
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:19,129
of life so when you're younger there's
for Education all that kind of stuff or

5986
01:33:19,129 --> 01:33:19,139
for Education all that kind of stuff or
 

5987
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:22,490
for Education all that kind of stuff or
mentorship all of this and uh later on

5988
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:22,500
mentorship all of this and uh later on
 

5989
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,689
mentorship all of this and uh later on
as you're doing work and you've

5990
01:33:23,689 --> 01:33:23,699
as you're doing work and you've
 

5991
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:25,189
as you're doing work and you've
developed a skill and you're having a

5992
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
developed a skill and you're having a
 

5993
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,810
developed a skill and you're having a
profession you'll have an assistant that

5994
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:26,820
profession you'll have an assistant that
 

5995
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,209
profession you'll have an assistant that
helps you excel at that profession so at

5996
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:29,219
helps you excel at that profession so at
 

5997
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,129
helps you excel at that profession so at
all stages of Life yeah I mean look the

5998
01:33:31,129 --> 01:33:31,139
all stages of Life yeah I mean look the
 

5999
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:32,450
all stages of Life yeah I mean look the
theory is augmentations this is the

6000
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:32,460
theory is augmentations this is the
 

6001
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,129
theory is augmentations this is the
gecko Birds term for the technical part

6002
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:34,139
gecko Birds term for the technical part
 

6003
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:35,810
gecko Birds term for the technical part
made the subservation many many decades

6004
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:35,820
made the subservation many many decades
 

6005
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,010
made the subservation many many decades
ago that you know basically it's like

6006
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:37,020
ago that you know basically it's like
 

6007
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,510
ago that you know basically it's like
you can have this oppositional frame of

6008
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:38,520
you can have this oppositional frame of
 

6009
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,950
you can have this oppositional frame of
Technology where it's like us versus the

6010
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:39,960
Technology where it's like us versus the
 

6011
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,209
Technology where it's like us versus the
machines but what you really do is you

6012
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:41,219
machines but what you really do is you
 

6013
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:42,470
machines but what you really do is you
use technology to augment human

6014
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:42,480
use technology to augment human
 

6015
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,510
use technology to augment human
capabilities yeah and by the way that's

6016
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:44,520
capabilities yeah and by the way that's
 

6017
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,890
capabilities yeah and by the way that's
how actually the economy develops that's

6018
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:45,900
how actually the economy develops that's
 

6019
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,330
how actually the economy develops that's
we can talk about the economic side of

6020
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:47,340
we can talk about the economic side of
 

6021
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,770
we can talk about the economic side of
this but that's actually how the economy

6022
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:48,780
this but that's actually how the economy
 

6023
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,050
this but that's actually how the economy
grows is through technology augmenting

6024
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:51,060
grows is through technology augmenting
 

6025
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,270
grows is through technology augmenting
human human potential

6026
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
human human potential
 

6027
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,370
human human potential
um and so yeah and then you basically

6028
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:55,380
um and so yeah and then you basically
 

6029
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,790
um and so yeah and then you basically
have a proxy or a you know or or a a um

6030
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
have a proxy or a you know or or a a um
 

6031
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,229
have a proxy or a you know or or a a um
you know a sort of prosthetic um you

6032
01:34:00,229 --> 01:34:00,239
you know a sort of prosthetic um you
 

6033
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,610
you know a sort of prosthetic um you
know so like you've got glasses you've

6034
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:01,620
know so like you've got glasses you've
 

6035
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,530
know so like you've got glasses you've
got a wristwatch you know you've got

6036
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:03,540
got a wristwatch you know you've got
 

6037
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,270
got a wristwatch you know you've got
shoes you know you've got these things

6038
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
shoes you know you've got these things
 

6039
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,830
shoes you know you've got these things
you've got a personal computer you've

6040
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:06,840
you've got a personal computer you've
 

6041
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,030
you've got a personal computer you've
got a word processor you've got

6042
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,040
got a word processor you've got
 

6043
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,090
got a word processor you've got
Mathematica you've got Google this is

6044
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:11,100
Mathematica you've got Google this is
 

6045
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,649
Mathematica you've got Google this is
the latest viewed through that lens the

6046
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:12,659
the latest viewed through that lens the
 

6047
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:15,110
the latest viewed through that lens the
AI is the latest in a long series of

6048
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,120
AI is the latest in a long series of
 

6049
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,090
AI is the latest in a long series of
basically augmentation methods uh to be

6050
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:17,100
basically augmentation methods uh to be
 

6051
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,410
basically augmentation methods uh to be
able to raise human capabilities it's

6052
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:18,420
able to raise human capabilities it's
 

6053
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,090
able to raise human capabilities it's
just this one is the most powerful one

6054
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:20,100
just this one is the most powerful one
 

6055
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,709
just this one is the most powerful one
of all because this is the one that goes

6056
01:34:21,709 --> 01:34:21,719
of all because this is the one that goes
 

6057
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:23,149
of all because this is the one that goes
directly to but what they call fluid

6058
01:34:23,149 --> 01:34:23,159
directly to but what they call fluid
 

6059
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:26,689
directly to but what they call fluid
intelligence which is IQ

6060
01:34:26,689 --> 01:34:26,699

 

6061
01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:30,350

well there's uh two categories of folks

6062
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:30,360
well there's uh two categories of folks
 

6063
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:33,110
well there's uh two categories of folks
that you outline that uh that worry

6064
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,120
that you outline that uh that worry
 

6065

01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:01,860
crime this stood to make a huge amount
 

6223
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,070
crime this stood to make a huge amount
of money if legal alcohol sales were

6224
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
of money if legal alcohol sales were
 

6225
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,169
of money if legal alcohol sales were
banned and this was in fact the way the

6226
01:37:06,169 --> 01:37:06,179
banned and this was in fact the way the
 

6227
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:07,370
banned and this was in fact the way the
history goes is this was actually the

6228
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:07,380
history goes is this was actually the
 

6229
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,689
history goes is this was actually the
beginning of organized crime in the U.S

6230
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:08,699
beginning of organized crime in the U.S
 

6231
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:10,070
beginning of organized crime in the U.S
this was the big Economic Opportunity

6232
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
this was the big Economic Opportunity
 

6233
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,050
this was the big Economic Opportunity
that opened that up

6234
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:12,060
that opened that up
 

6235
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,030
that opened that up
um and so they went in together

6236
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:14,040
um and so they went in together
 

6237
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,229
um and so they went in together
um and then they didn't go in together

6238
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,239
um and then they didn't go in together
 

6239
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:16,970
um and then they didn't go in together
like the Baptist did not even

6240
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:16,980
like the Baptist did not even
 

6241
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,290
like the Baptist did not even
necessarily know about the Bootleggers

6242
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:18,300
necessarily know about the Bootleggers
 

6243
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,370
necessarily know about the Bootleggers
because they were on their moral Crusade

6244
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:19,380
because they were on their moral Crusade
 

6245
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,169
because they were on their moral Crusade
The Bootlegger certainly knew about the

6246
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:21,179
The Bootlegger certainly knew about the
 

6247
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:22,550
The Bootlegger certainly knew about the
Baptists and they were like wow this is

6248
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
Baptists and they were like wow this is
 

6249
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,689
Baptists and they were like wow this is
these people are like the great front

6250
01:37:23,689 --> 01:37:23,699
these people are like the great front
 

6251
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:25,610
these people are like the great front
people for like you know it's good PR

6252
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:25,620
people for like you know it's good PR
 

6253
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:28,070
people for like you know it's good PR
Shenanigans in the background yeah and

6254
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
Shenanigans in the background yeah and
 

6255
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,930
Shenanigans in the background yeah and
they got the Volstead Act passed right

6256
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:29,940
they got the Volstead Act passed right
 

6257
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:32,209
they got the Volstead Act passed right
and they did in fact ban alcohol in the

6258
01:37:32,209 --> 01:37:32,219
and they did in fact ban alcohol in the
 

6259
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:33,470
and they did in fact ban alcohol in the
U.S and you'll notice what happened

6260
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:33,480
U.S and you'll notice what happened
 

6261
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,870
U.S and you'll notice what happened
which is people kept drinking like it

6262
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:35,880
which is people kept drinking like it
 

6263
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,450
which is people kept drinking like it
didn't work and people kept drinking

6264
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:38,460
didn't work and people kept drinking
 

6265
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:39,709
didn't work and people kept drinking
um the Bootleggers made a tremendous

6266
01:37:39,709 --> 01:37:39,719
um the Bootleggers made a tremendous
 

6267
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:41,629
um the Bootleggers made a tremendous
amount of money um and then over time it

6268
01:37:41,629 --> 01:37:41,639
amount of money um and then over time it
 

6269
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:43,250
amount of money um and then over time it
became clear that it made no sense to

6270
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:43,260
became clear that it made no sense to
 

6271
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,570
became clear that it made no sense to
make it illegal and it was causing more

6272
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:44,580
make it illegal and it was causing more
 

6273
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,310
make it illegal and it was causing more
problems and so then it was revoked and

6274
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
problems and so then it was revoked and
 

6275
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,990
problems and so then it was revoked and
here we sit with legal alcohol 100 years

6276
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,000
here we sit with legal alcohol 100 years
 

6277
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,510
here we sit with legal alcohol 100 years
later with all the same problems

6278
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:50,520
later with all the same problems
 

6279
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,250
later with all the same problems
um and you know the whole thing was this

6280
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:52,260
um and you know the whole thing was this
 

6281
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,649
um and you know the whole thing was this
like giant misadventure uh the Baptist

6282
01:37:54,649 --> 01:37:54,659
like giant misadventure uh the Baptist
 

6283
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:55,850
like giant misadventure uh the Baptist
got taken advantage of by the

6284
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:55,860
got taken advantage of by the
 

6285
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,169
got taken advantage of by the
bootleggers and the Bootleggers got what

6286
01:37:57,169 --> 01:37:57,179
bootleggers and the Bootleggers got what
 

6287
01:37:57,179 --> 01:37:58,729
bootleggers and the Bootleggers got what
they wanted and and that was that the

6288
01:37:58,729 --> 01:37:58,739
they wanted and and that was that the
 

6289
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,370
they wanted and and that was that the
same two categories of folks are now uh

6290
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:01,380
same two categories of folks are now uh
 

6291
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,410
same two categories of folks are now uh
sort of suggesting that uh the

6292
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:03,420
sort of suggesting that uh the
 

6293
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,669
sort of suggesting that uh the
development of artificial intelligence

6294
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:04,679
development of artificial intelligence
 

6295
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:06,410
development of artificial intelligence
should be regulated 100 yeah it's the

6296
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:06,420
should be regulated 100 yeah it's the
 

6297
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,149
should be regulated 100 yeah it's the
same pattern and the the economists the

6298
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
same pattern and the the economists the
 

6299
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,169
same pattern and the the economists the
same pattern every time like this is

6300
01:38:09,169 --> 01:38:09,179
same pattern every time like this is
 

6301
01:38:09,179 --> 01:38:10,550
same pattern every time like this is
what happened with nuclear power this is

6302
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
what happened with nuclear power this is
 

6303
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,810
what happened with nuclear power this is
what happened which is another

6304
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:11,820
what happened which is another
 

6305
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,310
what happened which is another
interesting one but like yeah this is

6306
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:13,320
interesting one but like yeah this is
 

6307
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,649
interesting one but like yeah this is
this happens dozens and dozens of times

6308
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:15,659
this happens dozens and dozens of times
 

6309
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:17,030
this happens dozens and dozens of times
um throughout the last hundred years and

6310
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,040
um throughout the last hundred years and
 

6311
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,010
um throughout the last hundred years and
and this is what's happening now and you

6312
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,020
and this is what's happening now and you
 

6313
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,189
and this is what's happening now and you
write that it isn't sufficient to Simply

6314
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:22,199
write that it isn't sufficient to Simply
 

6315
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:23,930
write that it isn't sufficient to Simply
identify the actors and impugn their

6316
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:23,940
identify the actors and impugn their
 

6317
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,729
identify the actors and impugn their
motives we should consider the arguments

6318
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:25,739
motives we should consider the arguments
 

6319
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:27,470
motives we should consider the arguments
of both the Baptists and the Bootleggers

6320
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:27,480
of both the Baptists and the Bootleggers
 

6321
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,430
of both the Baptists and the Bootleggers
on their merits so let's do just that

6322
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:30,440
on their merits so let's do just that
 

6323
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,450
on their merits so let's do just that
risk number one

6324
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:34,460

 

6325
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:38,149

uh will AI kill us all yes

6326
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
uh will AI kill us all yes
 

6327
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,030
uh will AI kill us all yes
so

6328
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,040

 

6329
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,430

uh what do you think about this one this

6330
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
uh what do you think about this one this
 

6331
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,990
uh what do you think about this one this
this what do you think is the core

6332
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:45,000
this what do you think is the core
 

6333
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,470
this what do you think is the core
argument here

6334
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:47,480
argument here
 

6335
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:50,930
argument here
that uh the development of AGI perhaps

6336
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:50,940
that uh the development of AGI perhaps
 

6337
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,270
that uh the development of AGI perhaps
but I said uh will destroy human

6338
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
but I said uh will destroy human
 

6339
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,370
but I said uh will destroy human
civilization no first of all you just

6340
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:55,380
civilization no first of all you just
 

6341
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,570
civilization no first of all you just
did a sleight of hand because we went

6342
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:56,580
did a sleight of hand because we went
 

6343
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:59,290
did a sleight of hand because we went
from talking about AI to AGI

6344
01:38:59,290 --> 01:38:59,300
from talking about AI to AGI
 

6345
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,430
from talking about AI to AGI
is there a fundamental difference there

6346
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:01,440
is there a fundamental difference there
 

6347
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,430
is there a fundamental difference there
I don't know what's AGI uh what's AI

6348
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:04,440
I don't know what's AGI uh what's AI
 

6349
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,229
I don't know what's AGI uh what's AI
what's inside I know what AI is AI is

6350
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
what's inside I know what AI is AI is
 

6351
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,689
what's inside I know what AI is AI is
machine learning

6352
01:39:07,689 --> 01:39:07,699
machine learning
 

6353
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:10,370
machine learning
I think we don't know what the bottom of

6354
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:10,380
I think we don't know what the bottom of
 

6355
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,750
I think we don't know what the bottom of
the well of machine learning is or what

6356
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:11,760
the well of machine learning is or what
 

6357
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,390
the well of machine learning is or what
the ceiling is right because just uh to

6358
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400
the ceiling is right because just uh to
 

6359
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,770
the ceiling is right because just uh to
call something machine learning or just

6360
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:15,780
call something machine learning or just
 

6361
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,330
call something machine learning or just
to call some of the statistics or just

6362
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:17,340
to call some of the statistics or just
 

6363
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,070
to call some of the statistics or just
to call it math or computation doesn't

6364
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:19,080
to call it math or computation doesn't
 

6365
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,770
to call it math or computation doesn't
mean you know uh nuclear weapons are

6366
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:21,780
mean you know uh nuclear weapons are
 

6367
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:25,669
mean you know uh nuclear weapons are
just physics so it's it it's to me it's

6368
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
just physics so it's it it's to me it's
 

6369
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,590
just physics so it's it it's to me it's
very interesting and surprising how far

6370
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:27,600
very interesting and surprising how far
 

6371
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,149
very interesting and surprising how far
machine learning no but we knew that

6372
01:39:29,149 --> 01:39:29,159
machine learning no but we knew that
 

6373
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:30,350
machine learning no but we knew that
nuclear physics would lead to weapons

6374
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:30,360
nuclear physics would lead to weapons
 

6375
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,729
nuclear physics would lead to weapons
that's why the scientists of that era

6376
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:31,739
that's why the scientists of that era
 

6377
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,410
that's why the scientists of that era
were always in this huge dispute about

6378
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:33,420
were always in this huge dispute about
 

6379
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,790
were always in this huge dispute about
building the weapons this is different

6380
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
building the weapons this is different
 

6381
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,709
building the weapons this is different
ages different as machine learningly do

6382
01:39:36,709 --> 01:39:36,719
ages different as machine learningly do
 

6383
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,090
ages different as machine learningly do
we know we don't know but this is my

6384
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:38,100
we know we don't know but this is my
 

6385
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,530
we know we don't know but this is my
point it's different we actually don't

6386
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:39,540
point it's different we actually don't
 

6387
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,209
point it's different we actually don't
know but and this is where you the

6388
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:41,219
know but and this is where you the
 

6389
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:42,890
know but and this is where you the
sleight of hand kicks in right this is

6390
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:42,900
sleight of hand kicks in right this is
 

6391
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:43,970
sleight of hand kicks in right this is
where it goes from being a scientific

6392
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:43,980
where it goes from being a scientific
 

6393
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:46,430
where it goes from being a scientific
topic to being a religious topic

6394
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:46,440
topic to being a religious topic
 

6395
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,870
topic to being a religious topic
um and that's that's why I specifically

6396
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:47,880
um and that's that's why I specifically
 

6397
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,129
um and that's that's why I specifically
called out that because that's what

6398
01:39:49,129 --> 01:39:49,139
called out that because that's what
 

6399
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:50,570
called out that because that's what
happens they do the vocabulary shift and

6400
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:50,580
happens they do the vocabulary shift and
 

6401
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:51,350
happens they do the vocabulary shift and
all of a sudden you're talking about

6402
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
all of a sudden you're talking about
 

6403
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,729
all of a sudden you're talking about
something totally that's not actually

6404
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:52,739
something totally that's not actually
 

6405
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:55,070
something totally that's not actually
real well then maybe you could also uh

6406
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,080
real well then maybe you could also uh
 

6407
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,050
real well then maybe you could also uh
as part of that Define the Western

6408
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:57,060
as part of that Define the Western

like all stuff you know we don't we you
know we collectively you know as a

6440
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:27,360
know we collectively you know as a
 

6441
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,610
know we collectively you know as a
society we don't necessarily take all

6442
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:28,620
society we don't necessarily take all
 

6443
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,290
society we don't necessarily take all
that fully seriously now so what we do

6444
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:30,300
that fully seriously now so what we do
 

6445
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,270
that fully seriously now so what we do
is we create our secularized versions of

6446
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:32,280
is we create our secularized versions of
 

6447
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,370
is we create our secularized versions of
that we keep we keep looking for Utopia

6448
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:34,380
that we keep we keep looking for Utopia
 

6449
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,810
that we keep we keep looking for Utopia
we keep looking for you know basically

6450
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:35,820
we keep looking for you know basically
 

6451
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,910
we keep looking for you know basically
the end of the world and so what you see

6452
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
the end of the world and so what you see
 

6453
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,649
the end of the world and so what you see
over over decades is basically a pattern

6454
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:39,659
over over decades is basically a pattern
 

6455
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:42,050
over over decades is basically a pattern
of these sort of of these of these of is

6456
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:42,060
of these sort of of these of these of is
 

6457
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,550
of these sort of of these of these of is
this this is what calls are this is how

6458
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:43,560
this this is what calls are this is how
 

6459
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,990
this this is what calls are this is how
Cults form as they form around some

6460
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:45,000
Cults form as they form around some
 

6461
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,370
Cults form as they form around some
theory of the end of the world and so

6462
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:46,380
theory of the end of the world and so
 

6463
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,770
theory of the end of the world and so
the people's Temple calls the Manson

6464
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:48,780
the people's Temple calls the Manson
 

6465
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,990
the people's Temple calls the Manson
called the heavens gate called the David

6466
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:51,000
called the heavens gate called the David
 

6467
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,030
called the heavens gate called the David
koresh called it you know what they're

6468
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,040
koresh called it you know what they're
 

6469
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,169
koresh called it you know what they're
all organized around is like there's

6470
01:40:54,169 --> 01:40:54,179
all organized around is like there's
 

6471
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:55,550
all organized around is like there's
going to be this thing that's going to

6472
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,560
going to be this thing that's going to
 

6473
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,689
going to be this thing that's going to
happen that's going to basically bring

6474
01:40:56,689 --> 01:40:56,699
happen that's going to basically bring
 

6475
01:40:56,699 --> 01:40:58,790
happen that's going to basically bring
civilization crashing down and then we

6476
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
civilization crashing down and then we
 

6477
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,229
civilization crashing down and then we
have this special Elite group of people

6478
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
have this special Elite group of people
 

6479
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,310
have this special Elite group of people
who are going to see it coming and

6480
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:01,320
who are going to see it coming and
 

6481
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,110
who are going to see it coming and
prepare for it and then they're the

6482
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:03,120
prepare for it and then they're the
 

6483
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,370
prepare for it and then they're the
people who are either going to stop it

6484
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:04,380
people who are either going to stop it
 

6485
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,810
people who are either going to stop it
or are failing stopping it they're going

6486
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:05,820
or are failing stopping it they're going
 

6487
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:07,129
or are failing stopping it they're going
to be the people who survive to the

6488
01:41:07,129 --> 01:41:07,139
to be the people who survive to the
 

6489
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:08,390
to be the people who survive to the
other side and ultimately get credit for

6490
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
other side and ultimately get credit for
 

6491
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,010
other side and ultimately get credit for
having been right why is that so

6492
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:10,020
having been right why is that so
 

6493
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,110
having been right why is that so
compelling do you think like uh because

6494
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:12,120
compelling do you think like uh because
 

6495
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,510
compelling do you think like uh because
it satisfies this very deep need we have

6496
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:14,520
it satisfies this very deep need we have
 

6497
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,970
it satisfies this very deep need we have
for Transcendence and meaning

6498
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:16,980
for Transcendence and meaning
 

6499
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:19,550
for Transcendence and meaning
that got Stripped Away when we became

6500
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:19,560
that got Stripped Away when we became
 

6501
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,590
that got Stripped Away when we became
secular yeah but why is the

6502
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
secular yeah but why is the
 

6503
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,390
secular yeah but why is the
Transcendence involved the destruction

6504
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:23,400
Transcendence involved the destruction
 

6505
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,870
Transcendence involved the destruction
of human civilization because like how

6506
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:26,880
of human civilization because like how
 

6507
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,510
of human civilization because like how
like how plausible it's it's like a very

6508
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:29,520
like how plausible it's it's like a very
 

6509
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,649
like how plausible it's it's like a very
deep psychological thing because it's

6510
01:41:30,649 --> 01:41:30,659
deep psychological thing because it's
 

6511
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:32,149
deep psychological thing because it's
like how plausible how plausible is it

6512
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
like how plausible how plausible is it
 

6513
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:32,870
like how plausible how plausible is it
that we live in a world where

6514
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:32,880
that we live in a world where
 

6515
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,709
that we live in a world where
everything's just kind of all right

6516
01:41:35,709 --> 01:41:35,719
everything's just kind of all right
 

6517
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:38,149
everything's just kind of all right
how exciting is that right but that's

6518
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
how exciting is that right but that's
 

6519
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,370
how exciting is that right but that's
more than that but that's the Deep

6520
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:40,380
more than that but that's the Deep
 

6521
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:43,010
more than that but that's the Deep
question I'm asking why is it not

6522
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:43,020
question I'm asking why is it not
 

6523
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,870
question I'm asking why is it not
exciting to live in a world where

6524
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:44,880
exciting to live in a world where
 

6525
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,450
exciting to live in a world where
everything's just all right does it I

6526
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:47,460
everything's just all right does it I
 

6527
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,850
everything's just all right does it I
think uh you know most of the animal

6528
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:49,860
think uh you know most of the animal
 

6529
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,950
think uh you know most of the animal
kingdom would be so happy we just all

6530
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:51,960
kingdom would be so happy we just all
 

6531
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,649
kingdom would be so happy we just all
right yeah because that means survival

6532
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:53,659

6687
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:18,350
learned about in in your essay but you
know sometimes it could be right yeah

6688
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:18,360
know sometimes it could be right yeah
 

6689
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,330
know sometimes it could be right yeah
yeah because we're still you were

6690
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:20,340
yeah because we're still you were
 

6691
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,530
yeah because we're still you were
developing more and more powerful

6692
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:21,540
developing more and more powerful
 

6693
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,109
developing more and more powerful
Technologies uh in this case and we

6694
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:24,119
Technologies uh in this case and we
 

6695
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:25,609
Technologies uh in this case and we
don't know what the impact they will

6696
01:44:25,609 --> 01:44:25,619
don't know what the impact they will
 

6697
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:27,830
don't know what the impact they will
have on human civilization well we can

6698
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
have on human civilization well we can
 

6699
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,149
have on human civilization well we can
highlight all the different predictions

6700
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:29,159
highlight all the different predictions
 

6701
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:30,950
highlight all the different predictions
about how it will be positive but the

6702
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:30,960
about how it will be positive but the
 

6703
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,450
about how it will be positive but the
risks are there

6704
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:32,460
risks are there
 

6705
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,609
risks are there
and you discuss some of them well the

6706
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:34,619
and you discuss some of them well the
 

6707
01:44:34,619 --> 01:44:36,410
and you discuss some of them well the
Steel Man the steel man is the Steel Man

6708
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:36,420
Steel Man the steel man is the Steel Man
 

6709
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:37,490
Steel Man the steel man is the Steel Man
actually the steel man and his

6710
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:37,500
actually the steel man and his
 

6711
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,169
actually the steel man and his
refutation are the same which is you

6712
01:44:39,169 --> 01:44:39,179
refutation are the same which is you
 

6713
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:40,070
refutation are the same which is you
can't predict what's going to happen

6714
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
can't predict what's going to happen
 

6715
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,770
can't predict what's going to happen
right you right you can't rule out that

6716
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:42,780
right you right you can't rule out that
 

6717
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,689
right you right you can't rule out that
this will not end everything right but

6718
01:44:44,689 --> 01:44:44,699
this will not end everything right but
 

6719
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,430
this will not end everything right but
the response to that is you have just

6720
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:46,440
the response to that is you have just
 

6721
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:47,930
the response to that is you have just
made a completely non-scientific claim

6722
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:47,940
made a completely non-scientific claim
 

6723
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,669
made a completely non-scientific claim
yeah you've made a religious claim not a

6724
01:44:49,669 --> 01:44:49,679
yeah you've made a religious claim not a
 

6725
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:50,810
yeah you've made a religious claim not a
scientific claim how does it get

6726
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:50,820
scientific claim how does it get
 

6727
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,550
scientific claim how does it get
disproven there is and there's no by

6728
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:52,560
disproven there is and there's no by
 

6729
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,750
disproven there is and there's no by
definition with these kinds of claims

6730
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:53,760
definition with these kinds of claims
 

6731
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,129
definition with these kinds of claims
there's no way to disprove them yeah

6732
01:44:55,129 --> 01:44:55,139
there's no way to disprove them yeah
 

6733
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:57,649
there's no way to disprove them yeah
right um and so there's no you just go

6734
01:44:57,649 --> 01:44:57,659
right um and so there's no you just go
 

6735
01:44:57,659 --> 01:44:58,970
right um and so there's no you just go
right on the list there's no hypothesis

6736
01:44:58,970 --> 01:44:58,980
right on the list there's no hypothesis
 

6737
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,250
right on the list there's no hypothesis
there's no testability of the hypothesis

6738
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:01,260
there's no testability of the hypothesis
 

6739
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,410
there's no testability of the hypothesis
there's no um way to falsify the

6740
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:03,420
there's no um way to falsify the
 

6741
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,689
there's no um way to falsify the
hypothesis there's no way to measure

6742
01:45:05,689 --> 01:45:05,699
hypothesis there's no way to measure
 

6743
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,570
hypothesis there's no way to measure
progress along the arc like it's just

6744
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:08,580
progress along the arc like it's just
 

6745
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,790
progress along the arc like it's just
all completely missing and so it's not

6746
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:10,800
all completely missing and so it's not
 

6747
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,770
all completely missing and so it's not
scientific and well I don't think it's

6748
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:12,780
scientific and well I don't think it's
 

6749
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:15,109
scientific and well I don't think it's
completely missing it's it's somewhat

6750
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
completely missing it's it's somewhat
 

6751
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,609
completely missing it's it's somewhat
missing so for example the the the the

6752
01:45:16,609 --> 01:45:16,619
missing so for example the the the the
 

6753
01:45:16,619 --> 01:45:18,410
missing so for example the the the the
people that say AI is going to kill all

6754
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:18,420
people that say AI is going to kill all
 

6755
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,669
people that say AI is going to kill all
of us

6756
01:45:19,669 --> 01:45:19,679
of us
 

6757
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:21,950
of us
I mean they usually have ideas about how

6758
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:21,960
I mean they usually have ideas about how
 

6759
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,209
I mean they usually have ideas about how
to do that whether it's the paperclip

6760
01:45:23,209 --> 01:45:23,219
to do that whether it's the paperclip
 

6761
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:27,189
to do that whether it's the paperclip
maximizer or um you know it escapes

6762
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:27,199
maximizer or um you know it escapes
 

6763
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,330
maximizer or um you know it escapes
there's mechanism by which you can

6764
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:29,340
there's mechanism by which you can
 

6765
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:33,530
there's mechanism by which you can
imagine it killing all humans models and

6766
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:33,540
imagine it killing all humans models and
 

6767
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:36,590
imagine it killing all humans models and
to you can disprove it by saying there

6768
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:36,600
to you can disprove it by saying there
 

6769
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,729
to you can disprove it by saying there
is um

6770
01:45:37,729 --> 01:45:37,739
is um
 

6771
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:39,649
is um
there's a limit

6772
01:45:39,649 --> 01:45:39,659
there's a limit
 

6773
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,750
there's a limit
to uh the speed at which intelligence

6774
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
to uh the speed at which intelligence
 

6775
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,790
to uh the speed at which intelligence
increases

6776
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:43,800
increases
 

6777
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,729
increases
maybe show that uh

6778
01:45:46,729 --> 01:45:46,739
maybe show that uh
 

6779
01:45:46,739 --> 01:45:49,430
maybe show that uh
like the sort of rigorously really

6780
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:49,440
like the sort of rigorously really
 

6781
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,669
like the sort of rigorously really
described model like how it could happen

6782
01:45:52,669 --> 01:45:52,679
described model like how it could happen
 

6783
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:54,890
described model like how it could happen
and say no there here's a physics

6784
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:54,900
and say no there here's a physics
 

6785
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:58,010
and say no there here's a physics
limitation there's a physical limitation

6786
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:58,020
limitation there's a physical limitation
 

6787
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:59,270
limitation there's a physical limitation
to how these systems would actually

6788
01:45:59,270 --> 01:45:59,280
to how these systems would actually
 

6789
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,609
to how these systems would actually
damaging human civilization and it is

6790
01:46:01,609 --> 01:46:01,619
damaging human civilization and it is
 

6791
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:04,010
damaging human civilization and it is
possible they will kill 10 to 20 percent

6792
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,020
possible they will kill 10 to 20 percent
 

6793
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:05,750
possible they will kill 10 to 20 percent
of the population but it seems

6794
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:05,760
of the population but it seems
 

6795
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,270
of the population but it seems
impossible for them to kill uh 99

6796
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,280
impossible for them to kill uh 99
 

6797
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,070
impossible for them to kill uh 99
there's practical counter arguments

6798
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,080
there's practical counter arguments
 

6799
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,390
there's practical counter arguments
right so you mentioned basically what I

6800
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:11,400
right so you mentioned basically what I
 

6801
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,830
right so you mentioned basically what I
described as the thermodynamic counter

6802
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:12,840
described as the thermodynamic counter
 

6803
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,209
described as the thermodynamic counter
argument which is sitting here today

6804
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:14,219
argument which is sitting here today
 

6805
01:46:14,219 --> 01:46:16,070
argument which is sitting here today
it's like we're with the evil AGI gets

6806
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,080
it's like we're with the evil AGI gets
 

6807
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,689
it's like we're with the evil AGI gets
the gpus yeah because like they don't

6808
01:46:17,689 --> 01:46:17,699
the gpus yeah because like they don't
 

6809
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:19,430
the gpus yeah because like they don't
exist so you're gonna have a very

6810
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:19,440
exist so you're gonna have a very
 

6811
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,229
exist so you're gonna have a very
frustrated baby evil AGI who's going to

6812
01:46:21,229 --> 01:46:21,239
frustrated baby evil AGI who's going to
 

6813
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:22,550
frustrated baby evil AGI who's going to
be like trying to buy Nvidia stock or

6814
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:22,560
be like trying to buy Nvidia stock or
 

6815
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,229
be like trying to buy Nvidia stock or
something to get them to finally make

6816
01:46:24,229 --> 01:46:24,239
something to get them to finally make
 

6817
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,510
something to get them to finally make
some chips um right so the the serious

6818
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:26,520
some chips um right so the the serious
 

6819
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,649
some chips um right so the the serious
form of that is the thermodynamic

6820
01:46:27,649 --> 01:46:27,659
form of that is the thermodynamic
 

6821
01:46:27,659 --> 01:46:28,850
form of that is the thermodynamic
argument which is like okay where's the

6822
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:28,860
argument which is like okay where's the
 

6823
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:30,290
argument which is like okay where's the
energy going to come from where's the

6824
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:30,300
energy going to come from where's the
 

6825
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,609
energy going to come from where's the
processor going to be running where is

6826
01:46:31,609 --> 01:46:31,619
processor going to be running where is
 

6827
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:32,570
processor going to be running where is
the data center going to be happening

6828
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:32,580
the data center going to be happening
 

6829
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:33,709
the data center going to be happening
how is this going to be happening in

6830
01:46:33,709 --> 01:46:33,719
how is this going to be happening in
 

6831
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,030
how is this going to be happening in
Secrets such that you know it's not you

6832
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,040
Secrets such that you know it's not you
 

6833
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,129
Secrets such that you know it's not you
know so so that's a practical counter

6834
01:46:37,129 --> 01:46:37,139
know so so that's a practical counter
 

6835
01:46:37,139 --> 01:46:38,990
know so so that's a practical counter
argument to The Runaway AGI I think I

6836
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,000
argument to The Runaway AGI I think I
 

6837
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,370
argument to The Runaway AGI I think I
have a but I have a and we can argue

6838
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:40,380
have a but I have a and we can argue
 

6839
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,930
have a but I have a and we can argue
that discuss that I have a deeper

6840
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:41,940
that discuss that I have a deeper
 

6841
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,729
that discuss that I have a deeper
objection to it which is it's this is

6842
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:43,739
objection to it which is it's this is
 

6843
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,649
objection to it which is it's this is
all forecasting it's all modeling it's

6844
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:45,659
all forecasting it's all modeling it's
 

6845
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:47,990
all forecasting it's all modeling it's
all it's all future prediction it's all

6846
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
all it's all future prediction it's all
 

6847
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,649
all it's all future prediction it's all
future hypothesizing it's not science

6848
01:46:51,649 --> 01:46:51,659
future hypothesizing it's not science
 

6849
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:54,649
future hypothesizing it's not science
sure it is not it is it is the opposite

6850
01:46:54,649 --> 01:46:54,659
sure it is not it is it is the opposite
 

6851
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:56,510
sure it is not it is it is the opposite
of science so the Carl Sagan

6852
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:56,520
of science so the Carl Sagan
 

6853
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,410
of science so the Carl Sagan
extraordinary claims require

6854
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:57,420
extraordinary claims require
 

6855
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:59,450
extraordinary claims require
extraordinary proof right these are

6856
01:46:59,450 --> 01:46:59,460
extraordinary proof right these are
 

6857
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,790
extraordinary proof right these are
extraordinary claims the policies that

6858
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:01,800
extraordinary claims the policies that
 

6859
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,830
extraordinary claims the policies that
are being called for right to prevent

6860
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:03,840
are being called for right to prevent
 

6861
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,109
are being called for right to prevent
this are of extraordinary magnitude and

6862
01:47:06,109 --> 01:47:06,119
this are of extraordinary magnitude and
 

6863
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:06,890
this are of extraordinary magnitude and
I think we're going to cause

6864
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:06,900
I think we're going to cause
 

6865
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,109
I think we're going to cause
extraordinary damage and this is all

6866
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:09,119
extraordinary damage and this is all
 

6867
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,189
extraordinary damage and this is all
being done on the basis of something

6868
01:47:10,189 --> 01:47:10,199
being done on the basis of something
 

6869
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:11,930
being done on the basis of something
that is literally not scientific it's

6870
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:11,940
that is literally not scientific it's
 

6871
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,430
that is literally not scientific it's
not a testable hypothesis so the moment

6872
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
not a testable hypothesis so the moment
 

6873
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,169
not a testable hypothesis so the moment
you say AI is going to kill all of us

6874
01:47:15,169 --> 01:47:15,179
you say AI is going to kill all of us
 

6875
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,270
you say AI is going to kill all of us
therefore we should ban it or that we

6876
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:17,280
therefore we should ban it or that we
 

6877
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,950
therefore we should ban it or that we
should regulate all that kind of that's

6878
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960
should regulate all that kind of that's
 

6879
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,629
should regulate all that kind of that's
when it starts getting serious or start

6880
01:47:20,629 --> 01:47:20,639
when it starts getting serious or start
 

6881
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,010
when it starts getting serious or start
you know military airstrikes and data

6882
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:22,020
you know military airstrikes and data
 

6883
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:24,310
you know military airstrikes and data
centers oh boy right

6884
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
centers oh boy right
 

6885
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,229
centers oh boy right
and like

6886
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
and like
 

6887
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,090
and like
yeah this one is get starts well so it

6888
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:29,100
yeah this one is get starts well so it
 

6889
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,350
yeah this one is get starts well so it
starts getting real so here's the

6890
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:30,360
starts getting real so here's the
 

6891
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,550
starts getting real so here's the
problem of millionaire and Cults they

6892
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:31,560
problem of millionaire and Cults they
 

6893
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,689
problem of millionaire and Cults they
have a hard time staying away from

6894
01:47:32,689 --> 01:47:32,699
have a hard time staying away from
 

6895
01:47:32,699 --> 01:47:34,370
have a hard time staying away from
violence

6896
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:34,380
violence
 

6897
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:38,570
violence
HIPAA violence is so fun

6898
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:38,580

 

6899
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,910

if you're on the right end of it they

6900
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:40,920
if you're on the right end of it they
 

6901
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,050
if you're on the right end of it they
have a hard time avoiding balance the

6902
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:42,060
have a hard time avoiding balance the
 

6903
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:42,950
have a hard time avoiding balance the
reason I have a hard time affording

6904
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:42,960
reason I have a hard time affording
 

6905
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,930
reason I have a hard time affording
balance is if you actually believe the

6906
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:44,940
balance is if you actually believe the
 

6907
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:47,689
balance is if you actually believe the
claim right then what would you do to

6908
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:47,699
claim right then what would you do to
 

6909
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:49,669
claim right then what would you do to
stop the end of the world well you would

6910
01:47:49,669 --> 01:47:49,679
stop the end of the world well you would
 

6911
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:52,010
stop the end of the world well you would
do anything right yeah and so and this

6912
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:52,020
do anything right yeah and so and this
 

6913
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,390
do anything right yeah and so and this
is where you get I mean again if you

6914
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:53,400
is where you get I mean again if you
 

6915
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,890
is where you get I mean again if you
just look at the history of millionaire

6916
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:54,900
just look at the history of millionaire
 

6917
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:55,970
just look at the history of millionaire
and Cults this is where you get the

6918
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:55,980
and Cults this is where you get the
 

6919
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,109
and Cults this is where you get the
people's Temple and everybody killing

6920
01:47:57,109 --> 01:47:57,119
people's Temple and everybody killing
 

6921
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,189
people's Temple and everybody killing
themselves in the jungle and this is

6922
01:47:58,189 --> 01:47:58,199
themselves in the jungle and this is
 

6923
01:47:58,199 --> 01:47:59,390
themselves in the jungle and this is
where you get Charles Manson and you

6924
01:47:59,390 --> 01:47:59,400
where you get Charles Manson and you
 

6925
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,129
where you get Charles Manson and you
know sending in need to kill kill the

6926
01:48:01,129 --> 01:48:01,139
know sending in need to kill kill the
 

6927
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:03,709
know sending in need to kill kill the
pigs like this is the problem with these

6928
01:48:03,709 --> 01:48:03,719
pigs like this is the problem with these
 

6929
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:05,390
pigs like this is the problem with these
they have a very hard time to run the

6930
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:05,400
they have a very hard time to run the
 

6931
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,970
they have a very hard time to run the
line at actual violence and I think I

6932
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:07,980
line at actual violence and I think I
 

6933
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:09,770
line at actual violence and I think I
think in this case there's there I mean

6934
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:09,780
think in this case there's there I mean
 

6935
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,270
think in this case there's there I mean
they're already calling for it like

6936
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:11,280
they're already calling for it like
 

6937
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,370
they're already calling for it like
today and you know where this goes from

6938
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,380
today and you know where this goes from
 

6939
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,810
today and you know where this goes from
here is they get more worked up like I

6940
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:14,820
here is they get more worked up like I
 

6941
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,910
here is they get more worked up like I
think it's like really concerning okay

6942
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:16,920
think it's like really concerning okay
 

6943
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,950
think it's like really concerning okay
but that's kind of the extreme so you

6944
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:18,960
but that's kind of the extreme so you
 

6945
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,930
but that's kind of the extreme so you
know the extremes of anything I was

6946
01:48:20,930 --> 01:48:20,940
know the extremes of anything I was
 

6947
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,330
know the extremes of anything I was
concerning

6948
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:22,340
concerning
 

6949
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:24,410
concerning
it's also possible to kind of believe

6950
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:24,420
it's also possible to kind of believe
 

6951
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,510
it's also possible to kind of believe
that AI has a very high likelihood of

6952
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:26,520
that AI has a very high likelihood of
 

6953
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,070
that AI has a very high likelihood of
killing all of us

6954
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
killing all of us
 

6955
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,189
killing all of us
uh but there's and therefore we should

6956
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
uh but there's and therefore we should
 

6957
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:32,930
uh but there's and therefore we should
uh maybe consider

6958
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:32,940
uh maybe consider
 

6959
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:36,229
uh maybe consider
uh slowing development or regulating so

6960
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
uh slowing development or regulating so
 

6961
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,910
uh slowing development or regulating so
not violence or any of these kinds of

6962
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,920
not violence or any of these kinds of
 

6963
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,109
not violence or any of these kinds of
things but it's saying like all right

6964
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:39,119
things but it's saying like all right
 

6965
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,570
things but it's saying like all right
let's let's take a pause here you know

6966
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:41,580
let's let's take a pause here you know
 

6967
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:43,669
let's let's take a pause here you know
your biological weapons nuclear weapons

6968
01:48:43,669 --> 01:48:43,679
your biological weapons nuclear weapons
 

6969
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:44,590
your biological weapons nuclear weapons
like

6970
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:44,600
like
 

6971
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:48,290
like
this is like serious stuff we should be

6972
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:48,300
this is like serious stuff we should be
 

6973
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,930
this is like serious stuff we should be
careful so it is possible to kind of

6974
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:50,940
careful so it is possible to kind of
 

6975
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:53,510
careful so it is possible to kind of
have a more rational response right if

6976
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
have a more rational response right if
 

6977
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,629
have a more rational response right if
you believe this risk is real believe

6978
01:48:55,629 --> 01:48:55,639
you believe this risk is real believe
 

6979
01:48:55,639 --> 01:48:58,910
you believe this risk is real believe
yes so what is it possible to be have a

6980
01:48:58,910 --> 01:48:58,920
yes so what is it possible to be have a
 

6981
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,550
yes so what is it possible to be have a
scientific approach to the the

6982
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:00,560
scientific approach to the the
 

6983
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,870
scientific approach to the the
prediction of the future I mean we just

6984
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:02,880
prediction of the future I mean we just
 

6985
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,430
prediction of the future I mean we just
went through this with covet yeah what

6986
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:04,440
went through this with covet yeah what
 

6987
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,290
went through this with covet yeah what
do we know about modeling

6988
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:06,300
do we know about modeling
 

6989
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,209
do we know about modeling
well I mean what do we learn about

6990
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:08,219
well I mean what do we learn about
 

6991
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:10,609
well I mean what do we learn about
modeling with covet uh there's a lot of

6992
01:49:10,609 --> 01:49:10,619
modeling with covet uh there's a lot of
 

6993
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:12,649
modeling with covet uh there's a lot of
lessons they didn't work at all

6994
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:12,659
lessons they didn't work at all
 

6995
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:14,629
lessons they didn't work at all
they worked poorly the models were

6996
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
they worked poorly the models were
 

6997
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,729
they worked poorly the models were
terrible the models were useless I don't

6998
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:16,739
terrible the models were useless I don't
 

6999
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:19,189
terrible the models were useless I don't
know if the models were useless or the

01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:19,199
know if the models were useless or the
 

7001
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,830
know if the models were useless or the
people interpreting the models and then

7002
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:21,840
people interpreting the models and then
 

7003
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,689
people interpreting the models and then
the centralized institutions that were

01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:23,699
the centralized institutions that were
 

7005
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:25,550

actually interpreting the error bars and
 

7013
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:33,709
actually interpreting the error bars and

usefulness to models no I I so not if
 

7055
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,390

they're I mean not if they're reliably

01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:08,400
they're I mean not if they're reliably
 

7057
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,770
they're I mean not if they're reliably
wrong right then they're actually like

01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:09,780
wrong right then they're actually like
 

7059
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:11,030
wrong right then they're actually like
anti-useful right they're actually

anti-useful right they're actually
 

7061
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,649
anti-useful right they're actually
damaging but what do you do with a pen

7062
01:50:12,649 --> 01:50:12,659
damaging but what do you do with a pen
 

7063
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:14,570
damaging but what do you do with a pen
endemic what do you do with the were

you want to kind of have um several

7068
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:18,960
you want to kind of have um several
 

7069
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,109
you want to kind of have um several
models to play with as part of the

7070
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:21,119

discussion of like what the hell do we

7072
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:23,159
discussion of like what the hell do we
 

7073
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:25,189
discussion of like what the hell do we
do here I mean do they work

7074
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
do here I mean do they work
 

7075
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,990
do here I mean do they work
because they're an expectation that they

7076
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:27,000
because they're an expectation that they
 

7077
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,490
because they're an expectation that they
actually like work that they have actual

7078
01:50:28,490 --> 01:50:28,500
actually like work that they have actual
 

7079
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,750
actually like work that they have actual

predictive value
 

7081
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,250

I mean as far as I can tell with covet

7082
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:31,260
I mean as far as I can tell with covet
 

7083
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,109
I mean as far as I can tell with covet
we just saw the policy makers just Psy

7084
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
we just saw the policy makers just Psy

up themselves into believing that there

7086
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:34,260
up themselves into believing that there
 

7087
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,169
up themselves into believing that there
was I mean look the scientists the

7088
01:50:36,169 --> 01:50:36,179
was I mean look the scientists the
 

7089
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:37,189
was I mean look the scientists the
scientists were at fault this is the

7090
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:37,199
scientists were at fault this is the
 

7091
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:39,770
scientists were at fault this is the
quote unquote scientists showed up so I

7092
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:39,780
quote unquote scientists showed up so I
 

7093
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,209
quote unquote scientists showed up so I
had some insight into this so there was

7094
01:50:41,209 --> 01:50:41,219
had some insight into this so there was
 

7095
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:42,950
had some insight into this so there was
a remember the Imperial College models

7096
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
a remember the Imperial College models
 

7097
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,510
a remember the Imperial College models
out of London were the ones that were

7098
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:44,520
out of London were the ones that were
 

7099
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:45,830
out of London were the ones that were
like these are the gold standard models

7100
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
like these are the gold standard models
 

7101
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,450
like these are the gold standard models
yeah so a friend of mine runs a big

7102
01:50:47,450 --> 01:50:47,460
yeah so a friend of mine runs a big
 

7103
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:48,890
yeah so a friend of mine runs a big
software company and he was like wow

7104
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:48,900
software company and he was like wow
 

7105
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,209
software company and he was like wow
this is like hope it's really scary and

7106
01:50:50,209 --> 01:50:50,219
this is like hope it's really scary and
 

7107
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:51,410
this is like hope it's really scary and
he's like you know he contacted This

7108
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:51,420
he's like you know he contacted This
 

7109
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:52,669
he's like you know he contacted This
research and he's like you know do you

7110
01:50:52,669 --> 01:50:52,679
research and he's like you know do you
 

7111
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:53,930
research and he's like you know do you
need some help you've been just building

7112
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:53,940
need some help you've been just building
 

7113
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,490
need some help you've been just building
this model on your own for 20 years do

7114
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:55,500
this model on your own for 20 years do
 

7115
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,810
this model on your own for 20 years do
you need some who did you like our

7116
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:56,820
you need some who did you like our
 

7117
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,370
you need some who did you like our
coders to basically restructure it so it

7118
01:50:58,370 --> 01:50:58,380
coders to basically restructure it so it
 

7119
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,470
coders to basically restructure it so it
can be fully adapted for covet and the

7120
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
can be fully adapted for covet and the
 

7121
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,090
can be fully adapted for covet and the
guy said yes and sent over the code and

7122
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:02,100
guy said yes and sent over the code and
 

7123
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:03,410
guy said yes and sent over the code and
my friend said it was like the worst

7124
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:03,420
my friend said it was like the worst
 

7125
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,030
my friend said it was like the worst
spaghetti code he's ever seen that

7126
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:05,040
spaghetti code he's ever seen that
 

7127
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,649
spaghetti code he's ever seen that
doesn't mean it's not possible to

7128
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:06,659
doesn't mean it's not possible to
 

7129
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:08,629
doesn't mean it's not possible to
construct a good model of pandemic with

it's spreading what that lead in terms
 

7155
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,209
it's spreading what that lead in terms
of hospitalization and deaths and all

7156
01:51:38,209 --> 01:51:38,219
of hospitalization and deaths and all
 

7157
01:51:38,219 --> 01:51:40,189
of hospitalization and deaths and all
that kind of stuff here's How likely how

7158
01:51:40,189 --> 01:51:40,199
that kind of stuff here's How likely how
 

7159
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,229
that kind of stuff here's How likely how
contagious it likely is here's how

7160
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
contagious it likely is here's how
 

7161
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,390
contagious it likely is here's how
deadly likely is based on different

7162
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:44,400
deadly likely is based on different
 

7163
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,189
deadly likely is based on different
conditions based on different ages and

7164
01:51:46,189 --> 01:51:46,199
conditions based on different ages and
 

7165
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:47,570
conditions based on different ages and
demographics and all that kind of stuff

7166
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:47,580
demographics and all that kind of stuff
 

7167
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:50,090
demographics and all that kind of stuff
so here's the best kinds of policy it

7168
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:50,100
so here's the best kinds of policy it
 

7169
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:53,330
so here's the best kinds of policy it
feels like you could have models

7170
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:53,340
feels like you could have models
 

7171
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:57,770
feels like you could have models
machine learning that like kind of they

7172
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:57,780
machine learning that like kind of they
 

7173
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,330
machine learning that like kind of they
don't perfectly predict the future but

7174
01:51:59,330 --> 01:51:59,340
don't perfectly predict the future but
 

7175
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,970
don't perfectly predict the future but
they they help you do something because

7176
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:01,980
they they help you do something because
 

7177
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,790
they they help you do something because
there's pandemics that are like

7178
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:04,800
there's pandemics that are like
 

7179
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,410
there's pandemics that are like
uh

7180
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:06,420
uh
 

7181
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:08,750
uh
meh they don't really do much harm and

7182
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:08,760
meh they don't really do much harm and
 

7183
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,669
meh they don't really do much harm and
there's pandemics you can imagine them

7184
01:52:10,669 --> 01:52:10,679
there's pandemics you can imagine them
 

7185
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:13,250
there's pandemics you can imagine them
they could do a huge amount of harm like

7186
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:13,260
they could do a huge amount of harm like
 

7187
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:16,189
they could do a huge amount of harm like
they can kill a lot of people so you

7188
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:16,199
they can kill a lot of people so you
 

7189
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:17,810
they can kill a lot of people so you
should probably have some kind of data

7190
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:17,820
should probably have some kind of data
 

7191
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:20,750
should probably have some kind of data
driven models that keep updating that

7192
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:20,760
driven models that keep updating that
 

7193
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,310
driven models that keep updating that
allow you to make decisions on base like

7194
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,320
allow you to make decisions on base like
 

7195
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,189
allow you to make decisions on base like
where how bad is this thing uh now you

7196
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:25,199
where how bad is this thing uh now you
 

7197
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:27,050
where how bad is this thing uh now you
can criticize

7198
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:27,060
can criticize
 

7199
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,450
can criticize
how horrible all that went with the

7200
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:29,460
how horrible all that went with the
 

7201
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:30,830
how horrible all that went with the
response to this pandemic but I just

7202
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:30,840
response to this pandemic but I just
 

7203
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,209
response to this pandemic but I just
feel like there might be some value to

7204
01:52:32,209 --> 01:52:32,219
feel like there might be some value to
 

7205
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:34,189
feel like there might be some value to
models so to be useful at some point it

7206
01:52:34,189 --> 01:52:34,199
models so to be useful at some point it
 

7207
01:52:34,199 --> 01:52:36,169
models so to be useful at some point it
has to be predictive right so and so and

7208
01:52:36,169 --> 01:52:36,179
has to be predictive right so and so and
 

7209
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:39,290
has to be predictive right so and so and
and so the easy thing for me to do is to

7210
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:39,300
and so the easy thing for me to do is to
 

7211
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,430
and so the easy thing for me to do is to
say obviously you're right obviously I

7212
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:40,440
say obviously you're right obviously I
 

7213
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,629
say obviously you're right obviously I
want to see that just as much as you do

7214
01:52:41,629 --> 01:52:41,639
want to see that just as much as you do
 

7215
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:42,830
want to see that just as much as you do
because anything that makes it easier to

7216
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:42,840
because anything that makes it easier to
 

7217
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,030
because anything that makes it easier to
navigate through Society through a

7218
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:44,040
navigate through Society through a
 

7219
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,530
navigate through Society through a
wrenching you know risk like that is you

7220
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:45,540
wrenching you know risk like that is you
 

7221
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,390
wrenching you know risk like that is you
know that sounds great um you know the

7222
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:47,400
know that sounds great um you know the
 

7223
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,370
know that sounds great um you know the
the harder objection to it is just

7224
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:49,380
the harder objection to it is just
 

7225
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:51,890
the harder objection to it is just
simply you are trying to model a complex

7226
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:51,900
simply you are trying to model a complex
 

7227
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,750
simply you are trying to model a complex
dynamic system with eight billion moving

Parts like not possible very tough can't
be done complex systems can't be done uh

7232
01:52:58,729 --> 01:52:58,739
be done complex systems can't be done uh

be done complex systems can't be done uh
machine learning says hold my beer but

7234
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:00,420
machine learning says hold my beer but
 

7235
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:02,510
machine learning says hold my beer but
well it's possible no I don't know I

7236
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:02,520
well it's possible no I don't know I
 

7237
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,890
well it's possible no I don't know I
would like to believe that it is yeah

7238
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:03,900
would like to believe that it is yeah
 

7239
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,570
would like to believe that it is yeah
put it this way I think where you and I

7240
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:05,580
put it this way I think where you and I
 

7241
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:06,649
put it this way I think where you and I
would agree is I think we would like we

7242
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:06,659
would agree is I think we would like we
 

7243
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:08,750
would agree is I think we would like we
would like that to be the case we are

7244
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:08,760
would like that to be the case we are
 

7245
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:11,030
would like that to be the case we are
strongly in favor of it I think we would

7246
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
strongly in favor of it I think we would
 

7247
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,350
strongly in favor of it I think we would
also agree that no such thing with

7248
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:12,360
also agree that no such thing with
 

7249
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,970
also agree that no such thing with
respect to covet or pandemics no such

7250
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:13,980
respect to covet or pandemics no such
 

7251
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,770
respect to covet or pandemics no such
thing at least neither you nor I think

7252
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:15,780
thing at least neither you nor I think
 

7253
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,390
thing at least neither you nor I think
or where I'm not aware of anything like

7254
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:17,400
or where I'm not aware of anything like
 

7255
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,430
or where I'm not aware of anything like
that today my main worry with the

7256
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
that today my main worry with the
 

7257
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,090
that today my main worry with the
response to the pandemic is that uh uh

7258
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:23,100
response to the pandemic is that uh uh
 

7259
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:26,390
response to the pandemic is that uh uh
same as with aliens is that even if such

7260
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:26,400
same as with aliens is that even if such
 

7261
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,850
same as with aliens is that even if such
a thing existed and it's possible it

7262
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:28,860
a thing existed and it's possible it
 

7263
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:29,950
a thing existed and it's possible it
existed

7264
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:29,960
existed
 

7265
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,649
existed
the the the the policy makers we're not

7266
01:53:33,649 --> 01:53:33,659
the the the the policy makers we're not
 

7267
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:35,689
the the the the policy makers we're not
paying attention like uh there was no

7268
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:35,699
paying attention like uh there was no
 

7269
01:53:35,699 --> 01:53:37,370
paying attention like uh there was no
mechanism that allowed those kinds of

7270
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:37,380
mechanism that allowed those kinds of
 

7271
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,870
mechanism that allowed those kinds of
models to percolate up oh I think we

7272
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:38,880
models to percolate up oh I think we
 

7273
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,310
models to percolate up oh I think we
have the opposite problem during covet I

7274
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
have the opposite problem during covet I
 

7275
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,050
have the opposite problem during covet I
think the policymakers I think the these

7276
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:42,060
think the policymakers I think the these
 

7277
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:43,910
think the policymakers I think the these
these these people with basically fake

7278
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:43,920
these these people with basically fake
 

7279
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,109
these these people with basically fake
science had too much access to the

7280
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:45,119
science had too much access to the
 

7281
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,310
science had too much access to the

7282
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,320
policymakers
 

7283
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,290
policymakers
well right and what but the policy

7284
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:48,300
well right and what but the policy
 

7285
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,510
well right and what but the policy
makers also wanted they had a narrative

7286
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:50,520
makers also wanted they had a narrative
 

7287
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,890
makers also wanted they had a narrative
in mind and they also wanted to use

7288
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:51,900
in mind and they also wanted to use
 

7289
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:54,050
in mind and they also wanted to use
whatever model that fit that narrative

7290
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:54,060
whatever model that fit that narrative
 

7291
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:55,850
whatever model that fit that narrative
to help them out so like it felt like

7292
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:55,860
to help them out so like it felt like
 

7293
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:57,169
to help them out so like it felt like
there was a lot of politics and not

7294
01:53:57,169 --> 01:53:57,179
there was a lot of politics and not
 

7295
01:53:57,179 --> 01:53:58,550
there was a lot of politics and not
enough science yeah although a big part

7296
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:58,560
enough science yeah although a big part
 

7297
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,050
enough science yeah although a big part
of what was happening a big reason we

7298
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:00,060
of what was happening a big reason we
 

7299
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:01,430
of what was happening a big reason we
got lockdowns for as long as we did was

7300
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
got lockdowns for as long as we did was
 

7301
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,629
got lockdowns for as long as we did was
because these scientists came in with

7302
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
because these scientists came in with
 

7303
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,070
because these scientists came in with
these like Doomsday scenarios that were

7304
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,080
these like Doomsday scenarios that were
 

7305
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,209
these like Doomsday scenarios that were
like just like completely off the hook

7306
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:05,219
like just like completely off the hook
 

7307
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:07,310
like just like completely off the hook
scientists and quotes that's not

7308
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:07,320
scientists and quotes that's not
 

7309
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,950
scientists and quotes that's not
quote-unquote that's not okay let's give

7310
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:09,960
quote-unquote that's not okay let's give
 

7311
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,689
quote-unquote that's not okay let's give
love so here's science that is the way

7312
01:54:11,689 --> 01:54:11,699
love so here's science that is the way
 

7313
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:13,669
love so here's science that is the way
out science is a process of testing

7314
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
out science is a process of testing
 

7315
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,590
out science is a process of testing
hypotheses yeah modeling does not

7316
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:15,600
hypotheses yeah modeling does not
 

7317
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:18,050
hypotheses yeah modeling does not
involve testable hypotheses right like I

7318
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:18,060
involve testable hypotheses right like I
 

7319
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,370
involve testable hypotheses right like I
don't even know that my I actually don't

7320
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:19,380
don't even know that my I actually don't
 

7321
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:20,689
don't even know that my I actually don't
I didn't even know that modeling

7322
01:54:20,689 --> 01:54:20,699
I didn't even know that modeling
 

7323
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:22,189
I didn't even know that modeling
actually qualifies in science

7324
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:22,199
actually qualifies in science
 

7325
01:54:22,199 --> 01:54:24,169
actually qualifies in science
maybe that's a side conversation we

7326
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:24,179
maybe that's a side conversation we
 

7327
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:25,850
maybe that's a side conversation we
could have some time over a beer uh it's

7328
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:25,860
could have some time over a beer uh it's
 

7329
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:27,470
could have some time over a beer uh it's
a really interesting but what do we do

7330
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:27,480
a really interesting but what do we do
 

7331
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,270
a really interesting but what do we do
about the future I mean what what so

7332
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:29,280
about the future I mean what what so
 

7333
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,649
about the future I mean what what so
number one is when we start with number

7334
01:54:30,649 --> 01:54:30,659
number one is when we start with number
 

7335
01:54:30,659 --> 01:54:32,689
number one is when we start with number
one humility it goes back to this thing

7336
01:54:32,689 --> 01:54:32,699
one humility it goes back to this thing
 

7337
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,490
one humility it goes back to this thing
of how do we determine the truth number

7338
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:34,500
of how do we determine the truth number
 

7339
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:35,990
of how do we determine the truth number
two is we don't believe you know it's

7340
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:36,000
two is we don't believe you know it's
 

7341

what happens when scientists basically
 

7353
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,750
what happens when scientists basically
stray off the path of technical

7354

stray off the path of technical
 

7355

become basically social engineers and uh

7386
01:55:16,729 --> 01:55:16,739
become basically social engineers and uh
 

7387
01:55:16,739 --> 01:55:18,590
become basically social engineers and uh
and the political um you know basically

7388

and the political um you know basically
 

7389
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,970
and the political um you know basically
political advisors and it's just a story

7390
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:19,980
political advisors and it's just a story
 

7391

with covet again
 

7397
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:26,450
with covet again
yeah I found this book a highly

7398
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:26,460
yeah I found this book a highly
 

7399
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,129
yeah I found this book a highly

recent philosophers after you read this

7406
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:33,840
recent philosophers after you read this
 

7407
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,030
recent philosophers after you read this
book you will not look at Einstein the

7408
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040
book you will not look at Einstein the
 

7409
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:38,570
book you will not look at Einstein the
same oh boy yeah don't destroy my heroes

7410
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:38,580
same oh boy yeah don't destroy my heroes
 

7411
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,390
same oh boy yeah don't destroy my heroes
anymore

7412
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:41,400
anymore
 

7413
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,430
anymore
um I'm sorry you shouldn't read the book

7414
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:43,440
um I'm sorry you shouldn't read the book
 

7415
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,890
um I'm sorry you shouldn't read the book
all right but here's the thing the AI

7416
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:45,900
all right but here's the thing the AI
 

7417
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:48,530
all right but here's the thing the AI
the AI risk people they don't even have

7418
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:48,540
the AI risk people they don't even have
 

7419
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,910
the AI risk people they don't even have
the covet model

7420
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:49,920
the covet model
 

7421
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,950
the covet model
at least not that I'm aware of no like

7422
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:51,960
at least not that I'm aware of no like
 

7423
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,910
at least not that I'm aware of no like
there's not even the equivalent of the

7424
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:52,920
there's not even the equivalent of the
 

7425
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:53,689
there's not even the equivalent of the
government model they don't even have

7426
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:53,699
government model they don't even have
 

7427
01:55:53,699 --> 01:55:55,370
government model they don't even have
the spaghetti code

7428
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:55,380
the spaghetti code
 

7429
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:57,890
the spaghetti code
they've got a theory and a warning and a

7430
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:57,900
they've got a theory and a warning and a
 

7431
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,870
they've got a theory and a warning and a
this and that and like if you ask like

7432
01:55:59,870 --> 01:55:59,880
this and that and like if you ask like
 

7433
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,430
this and that and like if you ask like
okay well here's here's the I mean the

7434
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:01,440
okay well here's here's the I mean the
 

7435
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,870
okay well here's here's the I mean the
ultimate example is okay how do we know

7436
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:02,880
ultimate example is okay how do we know
 

7437
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,250
ultimate example is okay how do we know
right how do we know that an AI is

7438
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:04,260
right how do we know that an AI is
 

7439
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,450
right how do we know that an AI is
running away like how do we know that

7440
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:05,460
running away like how do we know that
 

7441
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,890
running away like how do we know that
the film takeoff thing is actually

7442
01:56:06,890 --> 01:56:06,900
the film takeoff thing is actually
 

7443
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,870
the film takeoff thing is actually
happening and the only answer that any

7444
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:08,880
happening and the only answer that any
 

7445
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,950
happening and the only answer that any
of these guys have given that I've ever

7446
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:09,960
of these guys have given that I've ever
 

7447
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,410
of these guys have given that I've ever
seen is oh it's when the loss rate the

7448
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:12,420
seen is oh it's when the loss rate the
 

7449
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,050
seen is oh it's when the loss rate the
loss uh function and the training drops

7450
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:15,060
loss uh function and the training drops
 

7451
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,490
loss uh function and the training drops
right that's when you need to like shut

7452
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:16,500
right that's when you need to like shut
 

7453
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,109
right that's when you need to like shut
down the data center right and it's like

7454
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:18,119
down the data center right and it's like
 

7455
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:19,129
down the data center right and it's like
well that's also what happens when

7456
01:56:19,129 --> 01:56:19,139
well that's also what happens when
 

7457
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:20,750
well that's also what happens when
you're successfully training a model

7458
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:20,760
you're successfully training a model
 

7459
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,310
you're successfully training a model
like

7460
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
like
 

7461
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,250
like
like what what even is this is not

7462
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:25,260
like what what even is this is not
 

7463
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,709
like what what even is this is not
science this is not it's not anything

7464
01:56:27,709 --> 01:56:27,719
science this is not it's not anything
 

7465
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:28,790
science this is not it's not anything
it's not a model it's not anything

7466
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
it's not a model it's not anything
 

7467
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,010
it's not a model it's not anything
there's nothing to arguing with it it's

7468
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:31,020
there's nothing to arguing with it it's
 

7469
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,450
there's nothing to arguing with it it's
like you know pushing Jello like there's

7470
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:32,460
like you know pushing Jello like there's
 

7471
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,609
like you know pushing Jello like there's
what do you even respond to uh so did

7472
01:56:34,609 --> 01:56:34,619
what do you even respond to uh so did
 

7473
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:36,050
what do you even respond to uh so did
you put pushback on that I don't think

7474
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:36,060
you put pushback on that I don't think
 

7475
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,189
you put pushback on that I don't think
they have

7476
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
they have
 

7477
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,830
they have
good metrics of yeah wonderful is

7478
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:39,840
good metrics of yeah wonderful is
 

7479
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,450
good metrics of yeah wonderful is
happening but I think it's possible to

7480
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:41,460
happening but I think it's possible to
 

7481
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,390
happening but I think it's possible to
have that like I just just as you speak

7482
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:44,400
have that like I just just as you speak
 

7483
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,709
have that like I just just as you speak
now I mean it's possible to imagine

7484
01:56:45,709 --> 01:56:45,719
now I mean it's possible to imagine
 

7485
01:56:45,719 --> 01:56:47,930
now I mean it's possible to imagine
there could be measures it's been 20

7486
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:47,940
there could be measures it's been 20
 

7487
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,330
there could be measures it's been 20
years no for sure but it's been only

7488
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:50,340
years no for sure but it's been only
 

7489
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:52,669
years no for sure but it's been only
weeks since we had a big enough

7490
01:56:52,669 --> 01:56:52,679
weeks since we had a big enough
 

7491
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:54,709
weeks since we had a big enough
breakthrough in language models we can

7492
01:56:54,709 --> 01:56:54,719
breakthrough in language models we can
 

7493
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:56,870
breakthrough in language models we can
start to actually have this the thing is

7494
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
start to actually have this the thing is
 

7495
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,990
start to actually have this the thing is
the AI Doomer stuff didn't have any

7496
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,000
the AI Doomer stuff didn't have any
 

7497
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,910
the AI Doomer stuff didn't have any
actual systems to really work with and

7498
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:01,920
actual systems to really work with and
 

7499
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,590
actual systems to really work with and
now there's real systems you can start

7500
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:03,600
now there's real systems you can start
 

7501
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,090
now there's real systems you can start
to analyze like how does this stuff go

7502
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:05,100
to analyze like how does this stuff go
 

7503
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:07,729
to analyze like how does this stuff go
wrong and I think you kind of agree that

7504
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:07,739
wrong and I think you kind of agree that
 

7505
01:57:07,739 --> 01:57:09,109
wrong and I think you kind of agree that
there is a lot of risks that we can

7506
01:57:09,109 --> 01:57:09,119
there is a lot of risks that we can
 

7507
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,790
there is a lot of risks that we can
analyze the benefits outweigh the risks

7508
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
analyze the benefits outweigh the risks
 

7509
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,589
analyze the benefits outweigh the risks
in many cases but the risks are not

7510
01:57:12,589 --> 01:57:12,599
in many cases but the risks are not
 

7511
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:15,830
in many cases but the risks are not
existential yes well not not in the food

7512
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:15,840
existential yes well not not in the food
 

7513
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,390
existential yes well not not in the food
not in the phone paper clip now so let

7514
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:17,400
not in the phone paper clip now so let
 

7515
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,470
not in the phone paper clip now so let
me okay there's another sleight of hand

7516
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
me okay there's another sleight of hand
 

7517
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,490
me okay there's another sleight of hand
that you just alluded to there's another

7518
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:19,500
that you just alluded to there's another
 

7519
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,629
that you just alluded to there's another
sleight of hand that happens which is

7520
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
sleight of hand that happens which is
 

7521
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:21,830
sleight of hand that happens which is
very I think I'm very good at the

7522
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:21,840
very I think I'm very good at the
 

7523
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,109
very I think I'm very good at the
sleight of hand thing which is very not

7524
01:57:24,109 --> 01:57:24,119
sleight of hand thing which is very not
 

7525
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:25,609
sleight of hand thing which is very not
scientific so the book super

7526
01:57:25,609 --> 01:57:25,619
scientific so the book super
 

7527
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:27,050
scientific so the book super
intelligence right which is like the

7528
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,060
intelligence right which is like the
 

7529
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:28,310
intelligence right which is like the
Nick bostrom's book which is like the

7530
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
Nick bostrom's book which is like the
 

7531
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,750
Nick bostrom's book which is like the
origin of a lot of this stuff which was

7532
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:29,760
origin of a lot of this stuff which was
 

7533
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,010
origin of a lot of this stuff which was
written you know whatever 10 years ago

7534
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:31,020
written you know whatever 10 years ago
 

7535
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:32,810
written you know whatever 10 years ago
or something so he does this really

7536
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:32,820
or something so he does this really
 

7537
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,129
or something so he does this really
fascinating thing in the book which is

7538
01:57:34,129 --> 01:57:34,139
fascinating thing in the book which is
 

7539
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:35,870
fascinating thing in the book which is
he basically says

7540
01:57:35,870 --> 01:57:35,880
he basically says
 

7541
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,270
he basically says
um uh there are many possible routes to

7542
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:38,280
um uh there are many possible routes to
 

7543
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,189
um uh there are many possible routes to
machine intelligence to artificial

7544
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:40,199
machine intelligence to artificial
 

7545
01:57:40,199 --> 01:57:41,810
machine intelligence to artificial
intelligence and he describes all the

7546
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:41,820
intelligence and he describes all the
 

7547
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,070
intelligence and he describes all the
different routes to artificial

7548
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:43,080
different routes to artificial
 

7549
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:44,149
different routes to artificial
intelligence all the different possible

7550
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:44,159
intelligence all the different possible
 

7551
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:45,470
intelligence all the different possible
everything from biological augmentation

7552
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:45,480
everything from biological augmentation
 

7553
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:47,330
everything from biological augmentation
through to you know done all these

7554
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:47,340
through to you know done all these
 

7555
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,950
through to you know done all these
different things

7556
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:48,960
different things
 

7557
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,270
different things
um one of the ones that he does not

7558
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:50,280
um one of the ones that he does not
 

7559
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,890
um one of the ones that he does not
describe is large language models

7560
01:57:51,890 --> 01:57:51,900
describe is large language models
 

7561
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:53,570
describe is large language models
because of course the book was written

7562
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:53,580
because of course the book was written
 

7563
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:54,890
because of course the book was written
before they were invented and so they

7564
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:54,900
before they were invented and so they
 

7565
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,689
before they were invented and so they
didn't exist

7566
01:57:56,689 --> 01:57:56,699
didn't exist
 

7567
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,790
didn't exist
in the book he just he describes them

7568
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:58,800
in the book he just he describes them
 

7569
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,050
in the book he just he describes them
all and then he proceeds to treat them

7570
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:00,060
all and then he proceeds to treat them
 

7571
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,609
all and then he proceeds to treat them
all as if they're exactly the same thing

7572
01:58:01,609 --> 01:58:01,619
all as if they're exactly the same thing
 

7573
01:58:01,619 --> 01:58:03,290
all as if they're exactly the same thing
he presents them all as sort of an

7574
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:03,300
he presents them all as sort of an
 

7575
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,550
he presents them all as sort of an
equivalent risk to be dealt with in an

7576
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,560
equivalent risk to be dealt with in an
 

7577
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,689
equivalent risk to be dealt with in an
equivalent way to be thought about the

7578
01:58:05,689 --> 01:58:05,699
equivalent way to be thought about the
 

7579
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:07,129
equivalent way to be thought about the
same way and then the risk the

7580
01:58:07,129 --> 01:58:07,139
same way and then the risk the
 

7581
01:58:07,139 --> 01:58:08,270
same way and then the risk the
quote-unquote risk that's actually

7582
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:08,280
quote-unquote risk that's actually
 

7583
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,410
quote-unquote risk that's actually
emerged is actually a completely

7584
01:58:09,410 --> 01:58:09,420
emerged is actually a completely
 

7585
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:10,490
emerged is actually a completely
different technology than he was even

7586
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:10,500
different technology than he was even
 

7587
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,410
different technology than he was even
imagining and yet all of his theories

7588
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:12,420
imagining and yet all of his theories
 

7589
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,970
imagining and yet all of his theories
and beliefs are being transplanted by

7590
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:13,980
and beliefs are being transplanted by
 

7591
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:15,169
and beliefs are being transplanted by
this movement like straight on this new

7592
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:15,179
this movement like straight on this new
 

7593
01:58:15,179 --> 01:58:17,089
this movement like straight on this new
technology and so again like there's no

7594
01:58:17,089 --> 01:58:17,099
technology and so again like there's no
 

7595
01:58:17,099 --> 01:58:19,070
technology and so again like there's no
other area of science or technology

7596
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:19,080
other area of science or technology
 

7597
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,770
other area of science or technology
where you do that yeah like when you're

7598
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:21,780
where you do that yeah like when you're
 

7599
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:23,149
where you do that yeah like when you're
dealing with like organic chemistry

7600
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:23,159
dealing with like organic chemistry
 

7601
01:58:23,159 --> 01:58:25,010
dealing with like organic chemistry
versus inorganic chemistry you don't

7602
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:25,020
versus inorganic chemistry you don't
 

7603
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,229
versus inorganic chemistry you don't
just like say oh with respect to like

7604
01:58:27,229 --> 01:58:27,239
just like say oh with respect to like
 

7605
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:28,609
just like say oh with respect to like
either one basically maybe you know

7606
01:58:28,609 --> 01:58:28,619
either one basically maybe you know
 

7607
01:58:28,619 --> 01:58:29,750
either one basically maybe you know
growing up and eating the world or

7608
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:29,760
growing up and eating the world or
 

7609
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:30,589
growing up and eating the world or
something like they're just going to

7610
01:58:30,589 --> 01:58:30,599
something like they're just going to
 

7611
01:58:30,599 --> 01:58:32,689
something like they're just going to
operate the same way like you don't but

7612
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:32,699
operate the same way like you don't but
 

7613
01:58:32,699 --> 01:58:34,669
operate the same way like you don't but
you can start talking about like as as

7614
01:58:34,669 --> 01:58:34,679
you can start talking about like as as
 

7615
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:37,370
you can start talking about like as as
we get more and more actual systems that

7616
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:37,380
we get more and more actual systems that
 

7617
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:38,570
we get more and more actual systems that
start to get more and more intelligent

7618
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:38,580
start to get more and more intelligent
 

7619
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,070
start to get more and more intelligent
you can start to actually have more

7620
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,080
you can start to actually have more
 

7621
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,589
you can start to actually have more
scientific arguments here like you know

7622
01:58:42,589 --> 01:58:42,599
scientific arguments here like you know
 

7623
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:44,990
scientific arguments here like you know
high level you can talk about the threat

7624
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:45,000
high level you can talk about the threat
 

7625
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,970
high level you can talk about the threat
of autonomous weapon systems back before

7626
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:46,980
of autonomous weapon systems back before
 

7627
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:49,370
of autonomous weapon systems back before
we had any Automation in in the military

7628
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:49,380
we had any Automation in in the military
 

7629
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,530
we had any Automation in in the military
and that would be like very fuzzy kind

7630
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:51,540
and that would be like very fuzzy kind
 

7631
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:53,689
and that would be like very fuzzy kind
of logic but the more and more you have

7632
01:58:53,689 --> 01:58:53,699
of logic but the more and more you have
 

7633
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:55,850
of logic but the more and more you have
drones that are becoming more and more

7634
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:55,860
drones that are becoming more and more
 

7635
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:58,129
drones that are becoming more and more
autonomous you can start imagining okay

7636
01:58:58,129 --> 01:58:58,139
autonomous you can start imagining okay
 

7637
01:58:58,139 --> 01:58:59,570
autonomous you can start imagining okay
what does that actually look like and

7638
01:58:59,570 --> 01:58:59,580
what does that actually look like and
 

7639
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:01,189
what does that actually look like and
what's the actual threat of autonomous

7640
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:01,199
what's the actual threat of autonomous
 

7641
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,649
what's the actual threat of autonomous
weapon systems How does it go wrong and

7642
01:59:03,649 --> 01:59:03,659
weapon systems How does it go wrong and
 

7643
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:06,229
weapon systems How does it go wrong and
still it's it's very vague but you start

7644
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
still it's it's very vague but you start
 

7645
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,229
still it's it's very vague but you start
to get a sense of like all right

7646
01:59:09,229 --> 01:59:09,239
to get a sense of like all right
 

7647
01:59:09,239 --> 01:59:12,050
to get a sense of like all right
um it should probably be illegal or

7648
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:12,060
um it should probably be illegal or
 

7649
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:15,709
um it should probably be illegal or
wrong or not allowed to do like

7650
01:59:15,709 --> 01:59:15,719
wrong or not allowed to do like
 

7651
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:18,290
wrong or not allowed to do like
Mass deployment of fully autonomous

7652
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:18,300
Mass deployment of fully autonomous
 

7653
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:21,649
Mass deployment of fully autonomous
drones that are doing aerial strikes oh

7654
01:59:21,649 --> 01:59:21,659
drones that are doing aerial strikes oh
 

7655
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:23,270
drones that are doing aerial strikes oh
no on large areas I think it should be

7656
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
no on large areas I think it should be
 

7657
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,669
no on large areas I think it should be
required right so that's no no I think

7658
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
required right so that's no no I think
 

7659
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,350
required right so that's no no I think
if you're required that only

7660
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
if you're required that only
 

7661
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,109
if you're required that only
aerial vehicles are automated

7662
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:30,119
aerial vehicles are automated
 

7663
01:59:30,119 --> 01:59:31,669
aerial vehicles are automated
okay so you want to go the other way I

7664
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679
okay so you want to go the other way I
 

7665
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,129
okay so you want to go the other way I
want to go the other way so that okay I

7666
01:59:34,129 --> 01:59:34,139
want to go the other way so that okay I
 

7667
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:35,330
want to go the other way so that okay I
think it's obvious that the machine is

7668
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:35,340
think it's obvious that the machine is
 

7669
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,350
think it's obvious that the machine is
going to make a better decision than the

7670
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:36,360
going to make a better decision than the
 

7671
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,510
going to make a better decision than the
human pilot

7672
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:38,520
human pilot
 

7673
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,070
human pilot
I think it's obvious that it's in the

7674
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:40,080
I think it's obvious that it's in the
 

7675
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,270
I think it's obvious that it's in the
best interest of both the attacker and

7676
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
best interest of both the attacker and
 

7677
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,589
best interest of both the attacker and
the defender and Humanity at large if

7678
01:59:42,589 --> 01:59:42,599
the defender and Humanity at large if
 

7679
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:43,550
the defender and Humanity at large if
machines are making more of these

7680
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:43,560
machines are making more of these
 

7681
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,050
machines are making more of these
decisions and not people I think people

7682
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,060
decisions and not people I think people
 

7683
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,089
decisions and not people I think people
make terrible decisions in times of War

7684
01:59:47,089 --> 01:59:47,099
make terrible decisions in times of War
 

7685
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:49,010
make terrible decisions in times of War
but like there's a there's ways this can

7686
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:49,020
but like there's a there's ways this can
 

7687
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:51,410
but like there's a there's ways this can
go wrong too right well the words go

7688
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:51,420
go wrong too right well the words go
 

7689
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:53,450
go wrong too right well the words go
terribly wrong now

7690
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:53,460
terribly wrong now
 

7691
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,370
terribly wrong now
this goes back to the this is that whole

7692
01:59:55,370 --> 01:59:55,380
this goes back to the this is that whole
 

7693
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:56,570
this goes back to the this is that whole
thing about like this Ultra it is the

7694
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:56,580
thing about like this Ultra it is the
 

7695
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:57,530
thing about like this Ultra it is the
self-driving car need to be perfect

7696
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:57,540
self-driving car need to be perfect
 

7697
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:58,669
self-driving car need to be perfect
versus does it need to be better than

7698
01:59:58,669 --> 01:59:58,679
versus does it need to be better than
 

7699
01:59:58,679 --> 02:00:00,589
versus does it need to be better than
the human driver yeah does the automated

7700
02:00:00,589 --> 02:00:00,599
the human driver yeah does the automated
 

7701
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:02,149
the human driver yeah does the automated
drone need to be perfect or does it need

7702
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
drone need to be perfect or does it need
 

7703
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,189
drone need to be perfect or does it need
to be better than a human pilot at

7704
02:00:04,189 --> 02:00:04,199
to be better than a human pilot at
 

7705
02:00:04,199 --> 02:00:05,990
to be better than a human pilot at
making decisions under enormous amounts

7706
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
making decisions under enormous amounts
 

7707
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,510
making decisions under enormous amounts
of stress and uncertainty yeah well the

7708
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:08,520
of stress and uncertainty yeah well the
 

7709
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,669
of stress and uncertainty yeah well the
on average

7710
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:09,679
on average
 

7711
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,930
on average
the the worry

7712
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:11,940
the the worry
 

7713
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:14,089
the the worry
that AI folks have is the runaway

7714
02:00:14,089 --> 02:00:14,099
that AI folks have is the runaway
 

7715
02:00:14,099 --> 02:00:15,770
that AI folks have is the runaway
they're going to come alive right then

7716
02:00:15,770 --> 02:00:15,780
they're going to come alive right then
 

7717
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:17,330
they're going to come alive right then
again that's the sleight of hand right

7718
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:17,340
again that's the sleight of hand right
 

7719
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:19,669
again that's the sleight of hand right
or not not come alive well no hold on a

7720
02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:19,679
or not not come alive well no hold on a
 

7721
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,169
or not not come alive well no hold on a
second you're becoming do you lose

7722
02:00:21,169 --> 02:00:21,179
second you're becoming do you lose
 

7723
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:23,330
second you're becoming do you lose
control but then they're going to

7724
02:00:23,330 --> 02:00:23,340
control but then they're going to
 

7725
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,129
control but then they're going to
develop goals of their own they're going

7726
02:00:25,129 --> 02:00:25,139
develop goals of their own they're going
 

7727
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:26,330
develop goals of their own they're going
to develop them under their own they're

7728
02:00:26,330 --> 02:00:26,340
to develop them under their own they're
 

7729
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,070
to develop them under their own they're
going to develop their own right no more

7730
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:28,080
going to develop their own right no more
 

7731
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,830
going to develop their own right no more
more like uh Chernobyl style meltdown

7732
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:30,840
more like uh Chernobyl style meltdown
 

7733
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,209
more like uh Chernobyl style meltdown
like uh just bugs in the code

7734
02:00:34,209 --> 02:00:34,219
like uh just bugs in the code
 

7735
02:00:34,219 --> 02:00:37,729
like uh just bugs in the code
accidentally you know Force you the the

7736
02:00:37,729 --> 02:00:37,739
accidentally you know Force you the the
 

7737
02:00:37,739 --> 02:00:41,149
accidentally you know Force you the the
results in the bombing of like large

7738
02:00:41,149 --> 02:00:41,159
results in the bombing of like large
 

7739
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:43,850
results in the bombing of like large
civilian areas okay and to a degree

7740
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:43,860
civilian areas okay and to a degree
 

7741
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:46,070
civilian areas okay and to a degree
that's not possible

7742
02:00:46,070 --> 02:00:46,080
that's not possible
 

7743
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,649
that's not possible
um in in the current uh military

7744
02:00:48,649 --> 02:00:48,659
um in in the current uh military
 

7745
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:51,350
um in in the current uh military
strategies well actually we've been

7746
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
strategies well actually we've been
 

7747
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,669
strategies well actually we've been
doing a lot of mass bombings to cities

7748
02:00:52,669 --> 02:00:52,679
doing a lot of mass bombings to cities
 

7749
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:54,649
doing a lot of mass bombings to cities
for a very long time yes and a lot of

7750
02:00:54,649 --> 02:00:54,659
for a very long time yes and a lot of
 

7751
02:00:54,659 --> 02:00:56,330
for a very long time yes and a lot of
civilians died a lot of civilians died

7752
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:56,340
civilians died a lot of civilians died
 

7753
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,890
civilians died a lot of civilians died
and if you watch the documentary The Fog

7754
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:57,900
and if you watch the documentary The Fog
 

7755
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,169
and if you watch the documentary The Fog
of War McNamara it's been a big part of

7756
02:01:00,169 --> 02:01:00,179
of War McNamara it's been a big part of
 

7757
02:01:00,179 --> 02:01:01,490
of War McNamara it's been a big part of
it talking about the firebombing of the

7758
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:01,500
it talking about the firebombing of the
 

7759
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:03,109
it talking about the firebombing of the
Japanese cities yeah bringing them

7760
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:03,119
Japanese cities yeah bringing them
 

7761
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:04,970
Japanese cities yeah bringing them
straight to the ground right the

7762
02:01:04,970 --> 02:01:04,980
straight to the ground right the
 

7763
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:06,589
straight to the ground right the
devastation in Japan American Military

7764
02:01:06,589 --> 02:01:06,599
devastation in Japan American Military
 

7765
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:08,890
devastation in Japan American Military
uh firebombing the cities in Japan was

7766
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:08,900
uh firebombing the cities in Japan was
 

7767
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,790
uh firebombing the cities in Japan was
considerably bigger Devastation than the

7768
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:10,800
considerably bigger Devastation than the
 

7769
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,530
considerably bigger Devastation than the
use of nukes right so we've been doing

7770
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:12,540
use of nukes right so we've been doing
 

7771
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:13,970
use of nukes right so we've been doing
that for a long time we also did that

7772
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:13,980
that for a long time we also did that
 

7773
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,350
that for a long time we also did that
Germany by the way Germany did that to

7774
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:15,360
Germany by the way Germany did that to
 

7775
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,570
Germany by the way Germany did that to
us right like that's an old tradition

7776
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:17,580
us right like that's an old tradition
 

7777
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:18,830
us right like that's an old tradition
the minute we got airplanes we started

7778
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:18,840
the minute we got airplanes we started
 

7779
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,629
the minute we got airplanes we started
doing indiscriminate bombing so one of

7780
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
doing indiscriminate bombing so one of
 

7781
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:22,129
doing indiscriminate bombing so one of
the things we're still doing it the

7782
02:01:22,129 --> 02:01:22,139
the things we're still doing it the
 

7783
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:25,010
the things we're still doing it the
modern U.S uh military can do with

7784
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:25,020
modern U.S uh military can do with
 

7785
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:26,390
modern U.S uh military can do with
technology with automation but

7786
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:26,400
technology with automation but
 

7787
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,089
technology with automation but
technology more broadly is uh higher and

7788
02:01:29,089 --> 02:01:29,099
technology more broadly is uh higher and
 

7789
02:01:29,099 --> 02:01:31,010
technology more broadly is uh higher and
higher Precision strikes yeah well so

7790
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:31,020
higher Precision strikes yeah well so
 

7791
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:33,050
higher Precision strikes yeah well so
Precision is obviously and this is the

7792
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:33,060
Precision is obviously and this is the
 

7793
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,850
Precision is obviously and this is the
the jdam right so there's this big

7794
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:34,860
the jdam right so there's this big
 

7795
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,830
the jdam right so there's this big
Advance this big Advance um called the

7796
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:36,840
Advance this big Advance um called the
 

7797
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,330
Advance this big Advance um called the
JDM which basically was strapping a GPS

7798
02:01:38,330 --> 02:01:38,340
JDM which basically was strapping a GPS
 

7799
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,430
JDM which basically was strapping a GPS
transceiver to uh to a to an unguided

7800
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,440
transceiver to uh to a to an unguided
 

7801
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,990
transceiver to uh to a to an unguided
bomb and turning it into a guided guided

7802
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:42,000
bomb and turning it into a guided guided
 

7803
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,550
bomb and turning it into a guided guided
bomb and yeah that's great like look

7804
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:43,560
bomb and yeah that's great like look
 

7805
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,530
bomb and yeah that's great like look
that's been a big advance but and that's

7806
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:45,540
that's been a big advance but and that's
 

7807
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:46,669
that's been a big advance but and that's
like a baby version of this question

7808
02:01:46,669 --> 02:01:46,679
like a baby version of this question
 

7809
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:48,229
like a baby version of this question
which is okay do you want like the human

7810
02:01:48,229 --> 02:01:48,239
which is okay do you want like the human
 

7811
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:49,430
which is okay do you want like the human
pilot like guessing where the bomb's

7812
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:49,440
pilot like guessing where the bomb's
 

7813
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:50,390
pilot like guessing where the bomb's
gonna land or do you want like the

7814
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:50,400
gonna land or do you want like the
 

7815
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:51,530
gonna land or do you want like the
machine like getting the bottom twist

7816
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:51,540
machine like getting the bottom twist
 

7817
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:52,550
machine like getting the bottom twist
destination

7818
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,560
destination
 

7819
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:53,990
destination
that's a baby version of the question

7820
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
that's a baby version of the question
 

7821
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,129
that's a baby version of the question
the next version of the question is do

7822
02:01:55,129 --> 02:01:55,139
the next version of the question is do
 

7823
02:01:55,139 --> 02:01:56,030
the next version of the question is do
you want the human or the machine

7824
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:56,040
you want the human or the machine
 

7825
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,169
you want the human or the machine
deciding whether to drop the bomb

7826
02:01:57,169 --> 02:01:57,179
deciding whether to drop the bomb
 

7827
02:01:57,179 --> 02:01:59,149
deciding whether to drop the bomb
everybody just assumes the human's going

7828
02:01:59,149 --> 02:01:59,159
everybody just assumes the human's going
 

7829
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:00,589
everybody just assumes the human's going
to do a better job for what I think are

7830
02:02:00,589 --> 02:02:00,599
to do a better job for what I think are
 

7831
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:01,970
to do a better job for what I think are
fundamentally suspicious reasons

7832
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:01,980
fundamentally suspicious reasons
 

7833
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:04,189
fundamentally suspicious reasons
emotional psychological reasons I think

7834
02:02:04,189 --> 02:02:04,199
emotional psychological reasons I think
 

7835
02:02:04,199 --> 02:02:05,330
emotional psychological reasons I think
it's very clear that the machine's going

7836
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:05,340
it's very clear that the machine's going
 

7837
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:06,470
it's very clear that the machine's going
to do a better job making that decision

7838
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,480
to do a better job making that decision
 

7839
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:08,330
to do a better job making that decision
because the humans making that making

7840
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:08,340
because the humans making that making
 

7841
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,370
because the humans making that making
that decision are god-awful just

7842
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:10,380
that decision are god-awful just
 

7843
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:12,830
that decision are god-awful just
terrible yeah right and so so yeah so

7844
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:12,840
terrible yeah right and so so yeah so
 

7845
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,089
terrible yeah right and so so yeah so
this is the this is the thing and then

7846
02:02:14,089 --> 02:02:14,099
this is the this is the thing and then
 

7847
02:02:14,099 --> 02:02:15,890
this is the this is the thing and then
let's get to the there's can I one more

7848
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:15,900
let's get to the there's can I one more
 

7849
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:19,609
let's get to the there's can I one more
slide of hand okay please I'm a magician

7850
02:02:19,609 --> 02:02:19,619
slide of hand okay please I'm a magician
 

7851
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:20,810
slide of hand okay please I'm a magician
you could say one more sleight of hand

7852
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:20,820
you could say one more sleight of hand
 

7853
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:22,189
you could say one more sleight of hand
these things are going to be so smart

7854
02:02:22,189 --> 02:02:22,199
these things are going to be so smart
 

7855
02:02:22,199 --> 02:02:23,810
these things are going to be so smart
right that they're going to be able to

7856
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:23,820
right that they're going to be able to
 

7857
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:25,189
right that they're going to be able to
destroy the world and wreak havoc and

7858
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
destroy the world and wreak havoc and
 

7859
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,629
destroy the world and wreak havoc and
like do all this stuff and plan and do

7860
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:26,639
like do all this stuff and plan and do
 

7861
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,070
like do all this stuff and plan and do
all the stuff and evade us and have all

7862
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
all the stuff and evade us and have all
 

7863
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,149
all the stuff and evade us and have all
their secret things and their secret

7864
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:29,159
their secret things and their secret
 

7865
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,129
their secret things and their secret
factories and all this stuff but they're

7866
02:02:31,129 --> 02:02:31,139
factories and all this stuff but they're
 

7867
02:02:31,139 --> 02:02:33,290
factories and all this stuff but they're
so stupid that they're going to get like

7868
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:33,300
so stupid that they're going to get like
 

7869
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:34,430
so stupid that they're going to get like
tangled up in their code and that's

7870
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:34,440
tangled up in their code and that's
 

7871
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:35,629
tangled up in their code and that's
they're not going to come alive but

7872
02:02:35,629 --> 02:02:35,639
they're not going to come alive but
 

7873
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:36,530
they're not going to come alive but
there's going to be some bug that's

7874
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:36,540
there's going to be some bug that's
 

7875
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,609
there's going to be some bug that's
going to cause them to like turn us all

7876
02:02:37,609 --> 02:02:37,619
going to cause them to like turn us all
 

7877
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:39,290
going to cause them to like turn us all
into paper like that they're not gonna

7878
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:39,300
into paper like that they're not gonna
 

7879
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:40,729
into paper like that they're not gonna
they're gonna be genius in every way

7880
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:40,739
they're gonna be genius in every way
 

7881
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:43,070
they're gonna be genius in every way
other than the actual bad goal

7882
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,080
other than the actual bad goal
 

7883
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:45,169
other than the actual bad goal
and it's just like and that's just like

7884
02:02:45,169 --> 02:02:45,179
and it's just like and that's just like
 

7885
02:02:45,179 --> 02:02:47,689
and it's just like and that's just like
a like ridiculous like discrepancy and

7886
02:02:47,689 --> 02:02:47,699
a like ridiculous like discrepancy and
 

7887
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:50,570
a like ridiculous like discrepancy and
and and you can prove this today you can

7888
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:50,580
and and you can prove this today you can
 

7889
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,770
and and you can prove this today you can
actually address this today for the

7890
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:51,780
actually address this today for the
 

7891
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:53,510
actually address this today for the
first time with llms which is you can

7892
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
first time with llms which is you can
 

7893
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,629
first time with llms which is you can
actually ask llms to resolve uh moral

7894
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:56,639
actually ask llms to resolve uh moral
 

7895
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:59,209
actually ask llms to resolve uh moral
dilemmas yeah so you can create the

7896
02:02:59,209 --> 02:02:59,219
dilemmas yeah so you can create the
 

7897
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:01,010
dilemmas yeah so you can create the
scenario you know dot dot dot this that

7898
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:01,020
scenario you know dot dot dot this that
 

7899
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:02,810
scenario you know dot dot dot this that
this that this that what would you as

7900
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:02,820
this that this that what would you as
 

7901
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:04,669
this that this that what would you as
the AI do in the circumstance and they

7902
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:04,679
the AI do in the circumstance and they
 

7903
02:03:04,679 --> 02:03:05,930
the AI do in the circumstance and they
don't just say Destroy All Humans

7904
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:05,940
don't just say Destroy All Humans
 

7905
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,790
don't just say Destroy All Humans
Destroy All Humans they will give you

7906
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:07,800
Destroy All Humans they will give you
 

7907
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:10,189
Destroy All Humans they will give you
actually very nuanced moral practical

7908
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:10,199
actually very nuanced moral practical
 

7909
02:03:10,199 --> 02:03:12,830
actually very nuanced moral practical
trade-off oriented answers so we

7910
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:12,840
trade-off oriented answers so we
 

7911
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,510
trade-off oriented answers so we
actually already have the kind of AI

7912
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:14,520
actually already have the kind of AI
 

7913
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,010
actually already have the kind of AI
that can actually like think this

7914
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:16,020
that can actually like think this
 

7915
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:17,750
that can actually like think this
through and can actually like you know

7916
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:17,760
through and can actually like you know
 

7917
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:20,570
through and can actually like you know
reason about goals well the the hope is

7918
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:20,580
reason about goals well the the hope is
 

7919
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:23,270
reason about goals well the the hope is
that AGI or like a very super

7920
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,280
that AGI or like a very super
 

7921
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,770
that AGI or like a very super
intelligent systems have some of the

7922
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:24,780
intelligent systems have some of the
 

7923
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:27,050
intelligent systems have some of the
Nuance that llms have and the intuition

7924
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:27,060
Nuance that llms have and the intuition
 

7925
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:28,970
Nuance that llms have and the intuition
is they most likely will because even

7926
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:28,980
is they most likely will because even
 

7927
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:33,229
is they most likely will because even
these llms have the Nuance uh elements

7928
02:03:33,229 --> 02:03:33,239
these llms have the Nuance uh elements
 

7929
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:34,669
these llms have the Nuance uh elements

um if you read all the histories the
 

8173
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,089
um if you read all the histories the
kind of composite picture and by the way

kind of composite picture and by the way
 

8175
02:07:38,099 --> 02:07:39,589
kind of composite picture and by the way
we now know a lot actually about Soviet

8176
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
we now know a lot actually about Soviet
 

8177
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:40,970
we now know a lot actually about Soviet
Espionage in that era because there's

8178
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:40,980
Espionage in that era because there's
 

8179
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:42,350
Espionage in that era because there's
been all this Declassified material in

8180
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:42,360
been all this Declassified material in
 

8181
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:44,270
been all this Declassified material in
the last 20 years that actually shows a

8182
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:44,280
the last 20 years that actually shows a
 

8183
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:45,470
the last 20 years that actually shows a
lot of a lot of very interesting things

8184
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:45,480
lot of a lot of very interesting things
 

8185
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:46,729
lot of a lot of very interesting things
but if you kind of read all the

8186
02:07:46,729 --> 02:07:46,739
but if you kind of read all the
 

8187
02:07:46,739 --> 02:07:47,510
but if you kind of read all the
histories that you kind of get is

8188
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
histories that you kind of get is
 

8189
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,910
histories that you kind of get is
Oppenheimer himself probably was not a

8190
02:07:49,910 --> 02:07:49,920
Oppenheimer himself probably was not a
 

8191
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,290
Oppenheimer himself probably was not a
he probably did not hand over the

8192
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:51,300
he probably did not hand over the
 

8193
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:52,790
he probably did not hand over the
nuclear secrets himself however he was

8194
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:52,800
nuclear secrets himself however he was
 

8195
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,709
nuclear secrets himself however he was
close to many people who did yeah

8196
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
close to many people who did yeah
 

8197
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:56,390
close to many people who did yeah
including family members and there were

8198
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
including family members and there were
 

8199
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,770
including family members and there were
other members of the Manhattan Project

8200
02:07:57,770 --> 02:07:57,780
other members of the Manhattan Project
 

8201
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,990
other members of the Manhattan Project
who were Russian Soviet assets and did

8202
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
who were Russian Soviet assets and did
 

8203
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,290
who were Russian Soviet assets and did
hand over the bomb and so the view of

8204
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:03,300
hand over the bomb and so the view of
 

8205
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,270
hand over the bomb and so the view of
that Oppenheimer and people like him had

8206
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
that Oppenheimer and people like him had
 

8207
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,010
that Oppenheimer and people like him had
that this thing is awful and terrible

8208
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,020
that this thing is awful and terrible
 

8209
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,629
that this thing is awful and terrible
and oh my God and you know all this

8210
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:08,639
and oh my God and you know all this
 

8211
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:11,270
and oh my God and you know all this
stuff you could argue argue fed into

8212
02:08:11,270 --> 02:08:11,280
stuff you could argue argue fed into
 

8213
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,310
stuff you could argue argue fed into
this ethos at the time that resulted in

8214
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:13,320
this ethos at the time that resulted in
 

8215
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:14,629
this ethos at the time that resulted in
people thinking that the Baptists

8216
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
people thinking that the Baptists
 

8217
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:15,770
people thinking that the Baptists
thinking that the only principal thing

8218
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:15,780
thinking that the only principal thing
 

8219
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:18,530
thinking that the only principal thing
to do was to give the Russians the bomb

8220
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:18,540
to do was to give the Russians the bomb
 

8221
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:21,410
to do was to give the Russians the bomb
um and so the the moral beliefs on this

8222
02:08:21,410 --> 02:08:21,420
um and so the the moral beliefs on this
 

8223
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:23,149
um and so the the moral beliefs on this
thing and the public discussion and the

8224
02:08:23,149 --> 02:08:23,159
thing and the public discussion and the
 

8225
02:08:23,159 --> 02:08:24,290
thing and the public discussion and the
role that the inventors of this

8226
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:24,300
role that the inventors of this
 

8227
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:26,089
role that the inventors of this
technology play this is the point of

8228
02:08:26,089 --> 02:08:26,099
technology play this is the point of
 

8229
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:27,350
technology play this is the point of
this book when they kind of take on this

8230
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,360
this book when they kind of take on this
 

8231
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,450
this book when they kind of take on this
sort of public intellectual moral kind

8232
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:29,460
sort of public intellectual moral kind
 

8233
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:31,070
sort of public intellectual moral kind
of thing it can have real consequences

8234
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:31,080
of thing it can have real consequences
 

8235
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,570
of thing it can have real consequences
right because we live in a very

8236
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:32,580
right because we live in a very
 

8237
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,430
right because we live in a very
different world today because Russia got

8238
02:08:34,430 --> 02:08:34,440
different world today because Russia got
 

8239
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:35,810
different world today because Russia got
the bomb than we would have lived in had

8240
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:35,820
the bomb than we would have lived in had
 

8241
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:37,490
the bomb than we would have lived in had
they not gotten the bomb right the

8242
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:37,500
they not gotten the bomb right the
 

8243
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,109
they not gotten the bomb right the
entire 20th century second half the 20th

8244
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:39,119
entire 20th century second half the 20th
 

8245
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:39,950
entire 20th century second half the 20th
century would have played out very

8246
02:08:39,950 --> 02:08:39,960
century would have played out very
 

8247
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,390
century would have played out very
different had those people not given a

8248
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:41,400
different had those people not given a
 

8249
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:44,089
different had those people not given a
rush of the bomb and so the stakes were

8250
02:08:44,089 --> 02:08:44,099
rush of the bomb and so the stakes were
 

8251
02:08:44,099 --> 02:08:47,030
rush of the bomb and so the stakes were
very high then the good news today is

8252
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:47,040
very high then the good news today is
 

8253
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,530
very high then the good news today is
nobody's sitting here today I don't

8254
02:08:48,530 --> 02:08:48,540
nobody's sitting here today I don't
 

8255
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:50,450
nobody's sitting here today I don't
think worrying about like an analogous

8256
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:50,460
think worrying about like an analogous
 

8257
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:51,890
think worrying about like an analogous
situation with respect to like I'm not

8258
02:08:51,890 --> 02:08:51,900
situation with respect to like I'm not
 

8259
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:53,030
situation with respect to like I'm not
really worried that Sam Walton was going

8260
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:53,040
really worried that Sam Walton was going
 

8261
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,169
really worried that Sam Walton was going
to decide to give you know the Chinese

02:08:54,169 --> 02:08:54,179
to decide to give you know the Chinese
 

8263
02:08:54,179 --> 02:08:56,089
to decide to give you know the Chinese
the design for

02:08:56,089 --> 02:08:56,099
the design for

02:08:56,099 --> 02:08:57,950
the design for
yeah although he did just speak at a

8266
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:57,960
yeah although he did just speak at a
 

8267
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,629
yeah although he did just speak at a
Chinese conference which is interesting

8268
02:08:59,629 --> 02:08:59,639
Chinese conference which is interesting
 

8269
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:01,070
Chinese conference which is interesting
but however I don't think I don't think

8270
02:09:01,070 --> 02:09:01,080
but however I don't think I don't think
 

8271
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,930
but however I don't think I don't think
that's what's at play here but what's at

8272
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:02,940
that's what's at play here but what's at
 

8273
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,070
that's what's at play here but what's at
play here are all these other

8274
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:04,080
play here are all these other
 

8275
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:05,750
play here are all these other
fundamental issues around what do we

8276
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:05,760
fundamental issues around what do we
 

8277
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:07,310
fundamental issues around what do we
believe about this and then what laws

8278
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:07,320
believe about this and then what laws
 

8279
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,570
believe about this and then what laws
and regulations and restrictions that

8280
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:08,580
and regulations and restrictions that
 

8281
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,010
and regulations and restrictions that
we're going to put on it and and that's

8282
02:09:10,010 --> 02:09:10,020
we're going to put on it and and that's
 

8283
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:11,689
we're going to put on it and and that's
where I draw like a direct straight line

8284
02:09:11,689 --> 02:09:11,699
where I draw like a direct straight line
 

8285
02:09:11,699 --> 02:09:13,850
where I draw like a direct straight line
and anyway and my reading of the history

8286
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:13,860
and anyway and my reading of the history
 

8287
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:15,589
and anyway and my reading of the history
on nukes is like the people who were

8288
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:15,599
on nukes is like the people who were
 

8289
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:17,390
on nukes is like the people who were
doing the full hair shirt public this is

8290
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:17,400
doing the full hair shirt public this is
 

8291
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,189
doing the full hair shirt public this is
awful this is terrible actually had like

8292
02:09:19,189 --> 02:09:19,199
awful this is terrible actually had like
 

8293
02:09:19,199 --> 02:09:21,470
awful this is terrible actually had like
catastrophically bad results uh from

8294
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:21,480
catastrophically bad results uh from
 

8295
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:23,149
catastrophically bad results uh from
from taking those views um and that's

8296
02:09:23,149 --> 02:09:23,159
from taking those views um and that's
 

8297
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:24,109
from taking those views um and that's
what I'm worried it's gonna happen again

8298
02:09:24,109 --> 02:09:24,119
what I'm worried it's gonna happen again
 

8299
02:09:24,119 --> 02:09:25,970
what I'm worried it's gonna happen again
but is there a case to be made that you

8300
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:25,980
but is there a case to be made that you
 

8301
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,589
but is there a case to be made that you
really need to wake the public up to the

8302
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:27,599
really need to wake the public up to the
 

8303
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:29,330
really need to wake the public up to the
dangers of nuclear weapons when they

8304
02:09:29,330 --> 02:09:29,340
dangers of nuclear weapons when they
 

8305
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,490
dangers of nuclear weapons when they
were first dropped like really like

8306
02:09:31,490 --> 02:09:31,500
were first dropped like really like
 

8307
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:34,010
were first dropped like really like
educate them on like this is extremely

8308
02:09:34,010 --> 02:09:34,020
educate them on like this is extremely
 

8309
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:36,169
educate them on like this is extremely
dangerous and destructive weapon I think

8310
02:09:36,169 --> 02:09:36,179
dangerous and destructive weapon I think
 

8311
02:09:36,179 --> 02:09:37,490
dangerous and destructive weapon I think
the education kind of happened quick and

8312
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:37,500
the education kind of happened quick and
 

8313
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:40,550
the education kind of happened quick and
early like wow it was pretty obvious wow

8314
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
early like wow it was pretty obvious wow
 

8315
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,930
early like wow it was pretty obvious wow
we dropped one bomb and destroyed an

8316
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:41,940
we dropped one bomb and destroyed an
 

8317
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:42,890
we dropped one bomb and destroyed an
entire city

8318
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:42,900
entire city
 

8319
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:47,450
entire city
yeah so 80 000 people then what uh hey

8320
02:09:47,450 --> 02:09:47,460
yeah so 80 000 people then what uh hey
 

8321
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,910
yeah so 80 000 people then what uh hey
look but I don't like the reporting of

8322
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:49,920
look but I don't like the reporting of
 

8323
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,410
look but I don't like the reporting of
that you can report that in all kinds of

8324
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:51,420
that you can report that in all kinds of
 

8325
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:53,450
that you can report that in all kinds of
ways of course you can you can do all

8326
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:53,460
ways of course you can you can do all
 

8327
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:55,790
ways of course you can you can do all
kinds of Slants like war is horrible war

8328
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:55,800
kinds of Slants like war is horrible war
 

8329
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,430
kinds of Slants like war is horrible war
is terrible you can do you can make it

8330
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:58,440
is terrible you can do you can make it
 

8331
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:00,830
is terrible you can do you can make it
seem like nuclear the use of nuclear

8332
02:10:00,830 --> 02:10:00,840
seem like nuclear the use of nuclear
 

8333
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,450
seem like nuclear the use of nuclear
weapons is just a part of war and all

8334
02:10:02,450 --> 02:10:02,460
weapons is just a part of war and all
 

8335
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:04,729
weapons is just a part of war and all
that kind of stuff something about the

8336
02:10:04,729 --> 02:10:04,739
that kind of stuff something about the
 

8337
02:10:04,739 --> 02:10:06,290
that kind of stuff something about the
reporting in the discussion of nuclear

8338
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:06,300
reporting in the discussion of nuclear
 

8339
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:08,390
reporting in the discussion of nuclear
weapons resulted in us being

8340
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:08,400
weapons resulted in us being
 

8341
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:12,290
weapons resulted in us being
terrified in awe of the power of nuclear

8342
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:12,300
terrified in awe of the power of nuclear
 

8343
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:15,410
terrified in awe of the power of nuclear
weapons and that potentially

8344
02:10:15,410 --> 02:10:15,420
weapons and that potentially
 

8345
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:18,950
weapons and that potentially
fed in a positive way towards the the

8346
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:18,960
fed in a positive way towards the the
 

8347
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,870
fed in a positive way towards the the
game theory of mutually shared

8348
02:10:20,870 --> 02:10:20,880
game theory of mutually shared
 

8349
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,310
game theory of mutually shared
destruction well so this gets to what

8350
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:22,320
destruction well so this gets to what
 

8351
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,750
destruction well so this gets to what
actually happened let's get to what some

8352
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:23,760
actually happened let's get to what some
 

8353
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,490
actually happened let's get to what some
of us Playing devil's advocate here yeah

8354
02:10:25,490 --> 02:10:25,500
of us Playing devil's advocate here yeah
 

8355
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:26,870
of us Playing devil's advocate here yeah
yeah sure of course let's get to what

8356
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:26,880
yeah sure of course let's get to what
 

8357
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:27,770
yeah sure of course let's get to what
actually happened and then kind of back

8358
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:27,780
actually happened and then kind of back
 

8359
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:29,510
actually happened and then kind of back
into that so what actually happened I

8360
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:29,520
into that so what actually happened I
 

8361
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:30,649
into that so what actually happened I
believe and again I think this is a

8362
02:10:30,649 --> 02:10:30,659
believe and again I think this is a
 

8363
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:31,910
believe and again I think this is a
reasonable reading of history is what

8364
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
reasonable reading of history is what
 

8365
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,870
reasonable reading of history is what
actually happened was nukes then

8366
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:32,880
actually happened was nukes then
 

8367
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,609
actually happened was nukes then
prevented World War III and they

8368
02:10:34,609 --> 02:10:34,619
prevented World War III and they
 

8369
02:10:34,619 --> 02:10:36,109
prevented World War III and they
prevented World War III through the game

8370
02:10:36,109 --> 02:10:36,119
prevented World War III through the game
 

8371
02:10:36,119 --> 02:10:37,430
prevented World War III through the game
theory of mutually assured destruction

8372
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:37,440
theory of mutually assured destruction
 

8373
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,669
theory of mutually assured destruction
had nukes not existed right there would

8374
02:10:40,669 --> 02:10:40,679
had nukes not existed right there would
 

8375
02:10:40,679 --> 02:10:42,470
had nukes not existed right there would
have been no reason why the cold war did

8376
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
have been no reason why the cold war did
 

8377
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,450
have been no reason why the cold war did
not go hot right and then they're and

8378
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:44,460
not go hot right and then they're and
 

8379
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,649
not go hot right and then they're and
then you know in the military planners

8380
02:10:45,649 --> 02:10:45,659
then you know in the military planners
 

8381
02:10:45,659 --> 02:10:47,390
then you know in the military planners
at the time right thought both on both

8382
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:47,400
at the time right thought both on both
 

8383
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:48,470
at the time right thought both on both
sides thought that there was going to be

8384
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:48,480
sides thought that there was going to be
 

8385
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:49,729
sides thought that there was going to be
World War III on the planes of Europe

8386
02:10:49,729 --> 02:10:49,739
World War III on the planes of Europe
 

8387
02:10:49,739 --> 02:10:50,810
World War III on the planes of Europe
and they thought there was going to be

8388
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:50,820
and they thought there was going to be
 

8389
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,129
and they thought there was going to be
like 100 million people dead right it

8390
02:10:52,129 --> 02:10:52,139
like 100 million people dead right it
 

8391
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:53,270
like 100 million people dead right it
was like the most obvious thing in the

8392
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,280
was like the most obvious thing in the
 

8393
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,229
was like the most obvious thing in the
world to happen

8394
02:10:54,229 --> 02:10:54,239

time but we got two Wars in a span of
 

8415
02:11:13,739 --> 02:11:17,030
time but we got two Wars in a span of
like uh 20 years

8416
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:17,040
like uh 20 years
 

8417
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,070
like uh 20 years
like we could have kept getting more and

8418
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:19,080
like we could have kept getting more and
 

8419
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,950
like we could have kept getting more and
more world wars more and more ruthless

8420

more world wars more and more ruthless
 

8421
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:24,050
more world wars more and more ruthless
it actually you could have had a US

8422
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:24,060
it actually you could have had a US
 

8423
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:26,510
it actually you could have had a US
versus Russia War you could have

8424
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:26,520
versus Russia War you could have
 

8425
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,070
versus Russia War you could have
by the way you have there's another

8426
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:28,080
by the way you have there's another
 

8427
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,330
by the way you have there's another
hypothetical scenario the other

8428
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:29,340
hypothetical scenario the other
 

8429
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:30,890
hypothetical scenario the other
hypothetical scenario is the Americans

8430
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:30,900
hypothetical scenario is the Americans
 

8431
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:32,930
hypothetical scenario is the Americans
got the bomb the Russians didn't

8432
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:32,940
got the bomb the Russians didn't
 

8433
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:34,490
got the bomb the Russians didn't
right and then America's the big dog and

8434
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:34,500
right and then America's the big dog and
 

8435
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,750
right and then America's the big dog and
then maybe America would have had the

8436
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:35,760
then maybe America would have had the
 

8437
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:36,950
then maybe America would have had the
capability to actually roll back the

8438
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:36,960
capability to actually roll back the
 

8439
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,570
capability to actually roll back the
Iron Curtain

Iron Curtain
 

8441
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,890
Iron Curtain
right now I don't know whether that

8442
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:39,900
right now I don't know whether that
 

8443
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:40,910
right now I don't know whether that
would have happened but like it's

8444
02:11:40,910 --> 02:11:40,920
would have happened but like it's
 

8445
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:43,490
would have happened but like it's
entirely possible right and and and the

8446
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:43,500
entirely possible right and and and the
 

8447
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,050
entirely possible right and and and the
act of these people who have these moral

8448
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:45,060
act of these people who have these moral
 

8449
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:46,250
act of these people who have these moral
positions about because they could

8450
02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:46,260
positions about because they could
 

8451
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:47,510
positions about because they could
forecast they could model they could

8452
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:47,520
forecast they could model they could
 

8453
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:48,470
forecast they could model they could
forecast the future of how this

8454
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
forecast the future of how this
 

8455
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,490
forecast the future of how this
technology would get used made a

8456
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:49,500
technology would get used made a
 

8457
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,290
technology would get used made a
horrific mistake because they basically

8458
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:51,300
horrific mistake because they basically
 

8459
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,490
horrific mistake because they basically
ensured that the Aaron Curtin would

8460
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:52,500
ensured that the Aaron Curtin would
 

8461
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,750
ensured that the Aaron Curtin would
continue for 50 years longer than it

8462
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
continue for 50 years longer than it
 

8463
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:54,950
continue for 50 years longer than it
would have otherwise and again like

these are counterfactuals I don't know
that that's what would have happened but

8468
02:11:58,189 --> 02:11:58,199
that that's what would have happened but
 

8469
02:11:58,199 --> 02:11:59,240

8579
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,589
um Von Neumann is a story arguably of
the crazy people on the right

8580
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
the crazy people on the right
 

8581
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:41,569
the crazy people on the right
um yeah stick to Computing John well

8582
02:13:41,569 --> 02:13:41,579
um yeah stick to Computing John well
 

8583
02:13:41,579 --> 02:13:42,770
um yeah stick to Computing John well
this is the thing and this is this is

8584
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:42,780
this is the thing and this is this is
 

8585
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:44,089
this is the thing and this is this is
the general principle is it going to

8586
02:13:44,089 --> 02:13:44,099
the general principle is it going to
 

8587
02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:45,530
the general principle is it going to
affect our core thing which is like I

8588
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:45,540
affect our core thing which is like I
 

8589
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,550
affect our core thing which is like I

don't let the thought police suppress AI
well what is uh

8778
02:17:03,469 --> 02:17:03,479
well what is uh
 

8779
02:17:03,479 --> 02:17:07,030
well what is uh
this risk of the effect of

8780
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:07,040
this risk of the effect of
 

8781
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,770
this risk of the effect of
misinformation of society that's going

misinformation of society that's going
 

8783
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:12,889
misinformation of society that's going
to be catalyzed by AI yeah so this is

8784
02:17:12,889 --> 02:17:12,899
to be catalyzed by AI yeah so this is
 

8785
02:17:12,899 --> 02:17:14,389
to be catalyzed by AI yeah so this is
the social media this is what you just

8789
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:17,030
alluded to it's the activism kind of
thing that's popped up in these

8790
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:17,040
thing that's popped up in these
 

8791
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,469
thing that's popped up in these
companies and in the industry and it's

8792
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:18,479
companies and in the industry and it's
 

8793
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:20,209
companies and in the industry and it's
basically from my perspective it's

8794
02:17:20,209 --> 02:17:20,219
basically from my perspective it's
 

8795
02:17:20,219 --> 02:17:21,830
basically from my perspective it's
basically part two of the war that

8796
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:21,840
basically part two of the war that
 

8797

I describe it as the slippery slope is

9024
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:50,160
I describe it as the slippery slope is
 

9025
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,429
I describe it as the slippery slope is
not a fallacy it's an inevitability the

9026
02:20:52,429 --> 02:20:52,439
not a fallacy it's an inevitability the
 

9027
02:20:52,439 --> 02:20:53,690
not a fallacy it's an inevitability the
minute you have this kind of activist

9028
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:53,700
minute you have this kind of activist
 

9029
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,070
minute you have this kind of activist
personality that gets in a position to

9030
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:55,080
personality that gets in a position to
 

9031
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,230
personality that gets in a position to
make these decisions they they take it

9032
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:57,240
make these decisions they they take it
 

9033
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,330
make these decisions they they take it
straight to Infinity like they they it

9034
02:20:59,330 --> 02:20:59,340
straight to Infinity like they they it
 

9035
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,889
straight to Infinity like they they it
it goes into the crazy Zone like almost

9036
02:21:00,889 --> 02:21:00,899
it goes into the crazy Zone like almost
 

9037
02:21:00,899 --> 02:21:02,389
it goes into the crazy Zone like almost
immediately and never comes back because

9038
02:21:02,389 --> 02:21:02,399
immediately and never comes back because
 

9039
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:04,429
immediately and never comes back because
people become drunk with power um right

9040
02:21:04,429 --> 02:21:04,439
people become drunk with power um right
 

9041
02:21:04,439 --> 02:21:05,750
people become drunk with power um right
and they look if you're in the position

9042
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,760
and they look if you're in the position
 

9043
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,010
and they look if you're in the position
to determine what the entire world

9044
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:07,020
to determine what the entire world
 

9045
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:08,870
to determine what the entire world
thinks and feels and reads and says like

9046
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:08,880
thinks and feels and reads and says like
 

9047
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,309
thinks and feels and reads and says like
you're going to take it

9048
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:10,319
you're going to take it
 

9049
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:11,870
you're going to take it
and you know Elon has you know

9050
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:11,880
and you know Elon has you know
 

9051
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,250
and you know Elon has you know
ventilated this with the Twitter files

9052
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:13,260
ventilated this with the Twitter files
 

9053
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:14,450
ventilated this with the Twitter files
over the last you know three months and

9054
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:14,460
over the last you know three months and
 

9055
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:15,590
over the last you know three months and
it's just like Crystal Clear like how

9056
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:15,600
it's just like Crystal Clear like how
 

9057
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:17,450
it's just like Crystal Clear like how
bad it got there now yeah reason for

9058
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:17,460
bad it got there now yeah reason for
 

9059
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,250
bad it got there now yeah reason for
optimism is what uh Elon is doing with

9060
02:21:19,250 --> 02:21:19,260
optimism is what uh Elon is doing with
 

9061
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:20,809
optimism is what uh Elon is doing with
the community notes

9062
02:21:20,809 --> 02:21:20,819
the community notes
 

9063
02:21:20,819 --> 02:21:21,710
the community notes
um

9064
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:21,720
um
 

9065
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,210
um
um so Community knows is actually a very

9066
02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:23,220
um so Community knows is actually a very
 

9067
02:21:23,220 --> 02:21:25,490
um so Community knows is actually a very
interesting thing uh so what Elon is

9068
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:25,500
interesting thing uh so what Elon is
 

9069
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:27,110
interesting thing uh so what Elon is
trying to do with Community notes um is

9070
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,120
trying to do with Community notes um is
 

9071
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,250
trying to do with Community notes um is
he's trying to have it where there's

9072
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:28,260
he's trying to have it where there's
 

9073
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:30,110
he's trying to have it where there's
only a community note when people who

9074
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:30,120
only a community note when people who
 

9075
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:32,090
only a community note when people who
have previously disagreed on many topics

9076
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:32,100
have previously disagreed on many topics
 

9077
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:33,590
have previously disagreed on many topics
agree on this one

9078
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:33,600
agree on this one
 

9079
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,510
agree on this one
yes that's interesting that's what

9080
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:35,520
yes that's interesting that's what
 

9081
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,889
yes that's interesting that's what
that's what I'm trying to get at is like

9082
02:21:36,889 --> 02:21:36,899
that's what I'm trying to get at is like
 

9083
02:21:36,899 --> 02:21:38,450
that's what I'm trying to get at is like
there's there could be Wikipedia like

9084
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:38,460
there's there could be Wikipedia like
 

9085
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:40,610
there's there could be Wikipedia like
models a community knows type of models

9086
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:40,620
models a community knows type of models
 

9087
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:44,030

02:21:46,429 --> 02:21:46,439
provide context or censor in a way
 

9091
02:21:46,439 --> 02:21:48,710
provide context or censor in a way
that's not resist the slippery slope

9092
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:48,720
that's not resist the slippery slope
 

9093
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:50,570
that's not resist the slippery slope
nature now there's another Power there's

9094
02:21:50,570 --> 02:21:50,580
nature now there's another Power there's
 

9095
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:51,710
nature now there's another Power there's
an entirely different approach here

9096
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:51,720
an entirely different approach here
 

9097
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:53,090
an entirely different approach here
which is basically

9098
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:53,100
which is basically
 

9099
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:54,590
which is basically
um we have AIS that are producing

9100
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:54,600
um we have AIS that are producing
 

9101
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:56,330
um we have AIS that are producing
content we can also have AIS that are

9102
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:56,340
content we can also have AIS that are
 

9103
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:58,130
content we can also have AIS that are
consuming content yeah right and so one

9104
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:58,140
consuming content yeah right and so one
 

9105
02:21:58,140 --> 02:21:59,510
consuming content yeah right and so one
of the things that your assistant could

9106
02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
of the things that your assistant could
 

9107
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:01,429
of the things that your assistant could
do for you is help you consume all the

9108
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:01,439
do for you is help you consume all the
 

9109
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,469
do for you is help you consume all the
content right and basically tell you

9110
02:22:03,469 --> 02:22:03,479
content right and basically tell you
 

9111
02:22:03,479 --> 02:22:05,210
content right and basically tell you
when you're getting played so for

9112
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:05,220
when you're getting played so for
 

9113
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:06,710
when you're getting played so for
example I'm going to want the AI that my

9114
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:06,720
example I'm going to want the AI that my
 

9115
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,809
example I'm going to want the AI that my
kid uses right to be very you know child

9116
02:22:08,809 --> 02:22:08,819
kid uses right to be very you know child
 

9117
02:22:08,819 --> 02:22:10,190
kid uses right to be very you know child
safe and I'm going to want it to filter

9118
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:10,200
safe and I'm going to want it to filter
 

9119
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:11,870
safe and I'm going to want it to filter
for him all kinds of inappropriate stuff

9120
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:11,880
for him all kinds of inappropriate stuff
 

9121
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:12,889
for him all kinds of inappropriate stuff
that he shouldn't be saying just because

9122
02:22:12,889 --> 02:22:12,899
that he shouldn't be saying just because
 

9123
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,750
that he shouldn't be saying just because
he's a kid yeah right and you see what

9124
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:14,760
he's a kid yeah right and you see what
 

9125
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,010
he's a kid yeah right and you see what
I'm saying is you can Implement that you

9126
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:16,020
I'm saying is you can Implement that you
 

9127
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:17,150
I'm saying is you can Implement that you
could use the architectural you could

9128
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:17,160
could use the architectural you could
 

9129
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:18,230
could use the architectural you could
say you can solve this on the client

9130
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:18,240
say you can solve this on the client
 

9131
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:20,030
say you can solve this on the client
side right solving on the server side

9132
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:20,040
side right solving on the server side
 

9133
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:21,590
side right solving on the server side
gives you an opportunity to dictate for

9134
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:21,600
gives you an opportunity to dictate for
 

9135
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,090
gives you an opportunity to dictate for
the entire world which I think is where

9136
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:23,100
the entire world which I think is where
 

9137
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:24,910
the entire world which I think is where
you you take the slippery slope to Hell

9138
02:22:24,910 --> 02:22:24,920
you you take the slippery slope to Hell
 

9139
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,870
you you take the slippery slope to Hell
there's another architectural approach

9140
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:26,880
there's another architectural approach
 

9141
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:27,950
there's another architectural approach
which is to solve this on the client

9142
02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:27,960
which is to solve this on the client
 

9143
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,450
which is to solve this on the client
side which is certainly what I would

9144
02:22:29,450 --> 02:22:29,460
side which is certainly what I would
 

9145
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:30,349
side which is certainly what I would
endorse

9146
02:22:30,349 --> 02:22:30,359
endorse
 

9147
02:22:30,359 --> 02:22:33,110
endorse
it's uh at risk number five will AI lead

9148
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:33,120
it's uh at risk number five will AI lead
 

9149
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,389
it's uh at risk number five will AI lead
uh to bad people doing bad things and I

9150
02:22:35,389 --> 02:22:35,399
uh to bad people doing bad things and I
 

9151
02:22:35,399 --> 02:22:37,190
uh to bad people doing bad things and I
can just imagine language models used to

9152
02:22:37,190 --> 02:22:37,200
can just imagine language models used to
 

9153
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,410
can just imagine language models used to
do so many bad things but the hope is

9154
02:22:39,410 --> 02:22:39,420
do so many bad things but the hope is
 

9155
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:41,270
do so many bad things but the hope is
there that you can have

9156
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:41,280
there that you can have
 

9157
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:43,610
there that you can have
uh large language models used to then

9158
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:43,620
uh large language models used to then
 

9159
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:45,410
uh large language models used to then
defend against it by more people by

9160
02:22:45,410 --> 02:22:45,420
defend against it by more people by
 

9161
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:48,710
defend against it by more people by
smarter people by more effective people

9162
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720
smarter people by more effective people
 

9163
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,650
smarter people by more effective people
skilled people all that kind of stuff

9164
02:22:50,650 --> 02:22:50,660
skilled people all that kind of stuff
 

9165
02:22:50,660 --> 02:22:52,670
skilled people all that kind of stuff
three-point argument on bad people doing

9166
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:52,680
three-point argument on bad people doing
 

9167
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:54,830
three-point argument on bad people doing
bad things um so um uh so number one

9168
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:54,840
bad things um so um uh so number one
 

9169
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:55,849
bad things um so um uh so number one
right you can use the technology

9170
02:22:55,849 --> 02:22:55,859
right you can use the technology
 

9171
02:22:55,859 --> 02:22:57,530
right you can use the technology
defensively and there's a we should be

9172
02:22:57,530 --> 02:22:57,540
defensively and there's a we should be
 

9173
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:59,210
defensively and there's a we should be
using AI to build like broad spectrum

9174
02:22:59,210 --> 02:22:59,220
using AI to build like broad spectrum
 

9175
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:00,950
using AI to build like broad spectrum
vaccines and antibiotics for like

9176
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:00,960
vaccines and antibiotics for like
 

9177
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,630
vaccines and antibiotics for like
bioweapons and we should be using it to

9178
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:02,640
bioweapons and we should be using it to
 

9179
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:04,190
bioweapons and we should be using it to
like hunt terrorists and catch criminals

9180
02:23:04,190 --> 02:23:04,200
like hunt terrorists and catch criminals
 

9181
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:05,210
like hunt terrorists and catch criminals
and like we should be doing like all

9182
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:05,220
and like we should be doing like all
 

9183
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:06,770
and like we should be doing like all
kinds of stuff like that in fact we

9184
02:23:06,770 --> 02:23:06,780
kinds of stuff like that in fact we
 

9185
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:08,030
kinds of stuff like that in fact we
should be doing those things even just

9186
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:08,040
should be doing those things even just
 

9187
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:09,530
should be doing those things even just
to like go get like you know basically

9188
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:09,540
to like go get like you know basically
 

9189
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:10,849
to like go get like you know basically
go eliminate risk from like regular

9190
02:23:10,849 --> 02:23:10,859
go eliminate risk from like regular
 

9191
02:23:10,859 --> 02:23:12,110
go eliminate risk from like regular
pathogens that aren't like constructed

9192
02:23:12,110 --> 02:23:12,120
pathogens that aren't like constructed
 

9193
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:14,389
pathogens that aren't like constructed
by an AI so there's there's the whole um

9194
02:23:14,389 --> 02:23:14,399
by an AI so there's there's the whole um
 

9195
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:16,010
by an AI so there's there's the whole um
uh there's a whole defensive set of

9196
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:16,020
uh there's a whole defensive set of
 

9197
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:18,349
uh there's a whole defensive set of
things um second is we have many laws on

9198
02:23:18,349 --> 02:23:18,359
things um second is we have many laws on
 

9199
02:23:18,359 --> 02:23:19,969
things um second is we have many laws on
the books about the actual bad things

9200
02:23:19,969 --> 02:23:19,979
the books about the actual bad things
 

9201
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:22,250
the books about the actual bad things
right so it is actually illegal to be a

9202
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:22,260
right so it is actually illegal to be a
 

9203
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:24,469
right so it is actually illegal to be a
you know to commit crimes to to commit

9204
02:23:24,469 --> 02:23:24,479
you know to commit crimes to to commit
 

9205
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:26,030
you know to commit crimes to to commit
terrorist acts to you know build

9206
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:26,040
terrorist acts to you know build
 

9207
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:27,770
terrorist acts to you know build
pathogens with the intent to deploy them

9208
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:27,780
pathogens with the intent to deploy them
 

9209
02:23:27,780 --> 02:23:30,530
pathogens with the intent to deploy them
to kill people and so we have those we

9210
02:23:30,530 --> 02:23:30,540
to kill people and so we have those we
 

9211
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:32,090
to kill people and so we have those we
don't we actually don't need new laws

9212
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:32,100
don't we actually don't need new laws
 

9213
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,230
don't we actually don't need new laws
for the vast majority of the scenarios

9214
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:33,240
for the vast majority of the scenarios
 

9215
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,610
for the vast majority of the scenarios
we actually already have the laws in the

9216
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:34,620
we actually already have the laws in the
 

9217
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,210
we actually already have the laws in the
book

9218
02:23:35,210 --> 02:23:35,220
book
 

9219
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:37,910
book
on the books the third argument is the

9220
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:37,920
on the books the third argument is the
 

9221
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:38,990
on the books the third argument is the
minute and this is sort of the

9222
02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:39,000
minute and this is sort of the
 

9223
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,190
minute and this is sort of the
foundational one that gets really tough

9224
02:23:40,190 --> 02:23:40,200
foundational one that gets really tough
 

9225
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,690
foundational one that gets really tough
but the minute you get into this thing

9226
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:41,700
but the minute you get into this thing
 

9227
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,770
but the minute you get into this thing
which which you were kind of getting

9228
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:42,780
which which you were kind of getting
 

9229
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,270
which which you were kind of getting
into which is like okay but like don't

9230
02:23:44,270 --> 02:23:44,280
into which is like okay but like don't
 

9231
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:45,950
into which is like okay but like don't
you need censorship sometimes right and

9232
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:45,960
you need censorship sometimes right and
 

9233
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:47,090
you need censorship sometimes right and
don't you need restrictions sometimes

9234
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,100
don't you need restrictions sometimes
 

9235
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:50,090
don't you need restrictions sometimes
it's like okay what is the cost of that

9236
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:50,100
it's like okay what is the cost of that
 

9237
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,349
it's like okay what is the cost of that
um and in particular in the world of

9238
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
um and in particular in the world of
 

9239
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:53,030
um and in particular in the world of
Open Source right

9240
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:53,040
Open Source right
 

9241
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,610
Open Source right
um and so um is open source AI going to

9242
02:23:55,610 --> 02:23:55,620
um and so um is open source AI going to
 

9243
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:57,590
um and so um is open source AI going to
be allowed or not

9244
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
be allowed or not
 

9245
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,170
be allowed or not
um if open source AI is not allowed

9246
02:24:00,170 --> 02:24:00,180
um if open source AI is not allowed
 

9247
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:02,150
um if open source AI is not allowed
um then what is the regime that's going

9248
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:02,160
um then what is the regime that's going
 

9249
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:03,830
um then what is the regime that's going
to be necessary legally and technically

9250
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:03,840
to be necessary legally and technically
 

9251
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,929
to be necessary legally and technically
to prevent it from developing

9252
02:24:05,929 --> 02:24:05,939
to prevent it from developing
 

9253
02:24:05,939 --> 02:24:07,790
to prevent it from developing
right and here again is where you get

9254
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:07,800
right and here again is where you get
 

9255
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,469
right and here again is where you get
into and people have proposed these

9256
02:24:09,469 --> 02:24:09,479
into and people have proposed these
 

9257
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:10,910
into and people have proposed these
kinds of things you get into I would say

9258
02:24:10,910 --> 02:24:10,920
kinds of things you get into I would say
 

9259
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,469
kinds of things you get into I would say
pretty extreme territory pretty fast do

9260
02:24:12,469 --> 02:24:12,479
pretty extreme territory pretty fast do
 

9261
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:14,990
pretty extreme territory pretty fast do
we have a monitor agent on every CPU and

9262
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:15,000
we have a monitor agent on every CPU and
 

9263
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,790
we have a monitor agent on every CPU and
GPU that reports back to the government

9264
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
GPU that reports back to the government
 

9265
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,190
GPU that reports back to the government
what we're doing with our computers are

9266
02:24:19,190 --> 02:24:19,200
what we're doing with our computers are
 

9267
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,050
what we're doing with our computers are
we seizing GPU clusters that get Beyond

9268
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:21,060
we seizing GPU clusters that get Beyond
 

9269
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:23,270
we seizing GPU clusters that get Beyond
a certain size like and then by the way

9270
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
a certain size like and then by the way
 

9271
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,250
a certain size like and then by the way
how are we doing all that globally right

9272
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:25,260
how are we doing all that globally right
 

9273
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:27,770
how are we doing all that globally right
and like if China is developing an llm

9274
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:27,780
and like if China is developing an llm
 

9275
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,910
and like if China is developing an llm
beyond the scale that we think is

9276
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:28,920
beyond the scale that we think is
 

9277
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:31,550
beyond the scale that we think is
allowable are we going to invade right

9278
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:31,560
allowable are we going to invade right
 

9279
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:33,410
allowable are we going to invade right
and you have figures on the AIX risk

9280
02:24:33,410 --> 02:24:33,420
and you have figures on the AIX risk
 

9281
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:34,790
and you have figures on the AIX risk
side who are advocating and you know

9282
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800
side who are advocating and you know
 

9283
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:36,170
side who are advocating and you know
potentially up to nuclear strikes to

9284
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:36,180
potentially up to nuclear strikes to
 

9285
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,670
potentially up to nuclear strikes to
prevent you know this kind of thing and

9286
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:37,680
prevent you know this kind of thing and
 

9287
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:39,770
prevent you know this kind of thing and
so here you get into this thing and

9288
02:24:39,770 --> 02:24:39,780
so here you get into this thing and
 

9289
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:41,389
so here you get into this thing and
again you know you could maybe say this

9290
02:24:41,389 --> 02:24:41,399
again you know you could maybe say this
 

9291
02:24:41,399 --> 02:24:42,710
again you know you could maybe say this
is you know you could even say this is

9292
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:42,720
is you know you could even say this is
 

9293
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:43,910
is you know you could even say this is
what good bad or indifferent or whatever

9294
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:43,920
what good bad or indifferent or whatever
 

9295
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,790
what good bad or indifferent or whatever
but like here's the the comparison of

9296
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:46,800
but like here's the the comparison of
 

9297
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:47,929
but like here's the the comparison of
the nukes the comparison of nukes is

9298
02:24:47,929 --> 02:24:47,939
the nukes the comparison of nukes is
 

9299
02:24:47,939 --> 02:24:49,550
the nukes the comparison of nukes is
very dangerous because one is just nukes

9300
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:49,560
very dangerous because one is just nukes
 

9301
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:51,530
very dangerous because one is just nukes
for just just about although we can come

9302
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:51,540
for just just about although we can come
 

9303
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,910
for just just about although we can come
back to nuclear power but the other

9304
02:24:52,910 --> 02:24:52,920
back to nuclear power but the other
 

9305
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:53,870
back to nuclear power but the other
thing was like with nukes you could

9306
02:24:53,870 --> 02:24:53,880
thing was like with nukes you could
 

9307
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:55,550
thing was like with nukes you could
control plutonium right you could track

9308
02:24:55,550 --> 02:24:55,560
control plutonium right you could track
 

9309
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:56,870
control plutonium right you could track
plutonium and it was like hard to come

9310
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:56,880
plutonium and it was like hard to come
 

9311
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:57,710
plutonium and it was like hard to come
by

9312
02:24:57,710 --> 02:24:57,720
by
 

9313
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:00,410

AI is just math and code right it's and

9314
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:00,420
AI is just math and code right it's and
 

9315
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:01,670
AI is just math and code right it's and
it's in like math textbooks and it's

9316
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:01,680
it's in like math textbooks and it's
 

9317
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:02,929
it's in like math textbooks and it's
like their YouTube videos that teach you

9318
02:25:02,929 --> 02:25:02,939
like their YouTube videos that teach you
 

9319
02:25:02,939 --> 02:25:04,070
like their YouTube videos that teach you
how to build it and like there's open

9320
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:04,080
how to build it and like there's open
 

9321
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,210
how to build it and like there's open

know there's a 40 billion parameter

9324
02:25:06,710 --> 02:25:06,720
know there's a 40 billion parameter

um and so okay you walk down the logic

9330
02:25:13,309 --> 02:25:13,319
um and so okay you walk down the logic
 

9331
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:14,330
um and so okay you walk down the logic
path that says we need to have

9332
02:25:14,330 --> 02:25:14,340
path that says we need to have
 

9333
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,830
path that says we need to have
guardrails on this and you find yourself

9334
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840
guardrails on this and you find yourself
 

9335
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,889
guardrails on this and you find yourself
in a authoritarian totalitarian regime

9336
02:25:18,889 --> 02:25:18,899
in a authoritarian totalitarian regime
 

9337
02:25:18,899 --> 02:25:21,070
in a authoritarian totalitarian regime
of thought control and machine control

9338
02:25:21,070 --> 02:25:21,080
of thought control and machine control
 

9339
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,650
of thought control and machine control
that would be so brutal that you would

9340
02:25:24,650 --> 02:25:24,660
that would be so brutal that you would
 

9341
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:25,849
that would be so brutal that you would
have destroyed the society that you're

9342
02:25:25,849 --> 02:25:25,859
have destroyed the society that you're
 

9343
02:25:25,859 --> 02:25:27,770
have destroyed the society that you're
trying to protect and so I I just don't

9344
02:25:27,770 --> 02:25:27,780
trying to protect and so I I just don't
 

9345
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,650
trying to protect and so I I just don't
see how that actually works so yeah you

9346
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:30,660
see how that actually works so yeah you
 

9347
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:32,690
see how that actually works so yeah you
have to understand my brain has gone a

9348
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:32,700
have to understand my brain has gone a
 

9349
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:34,490
have to understand my brain has gone a
full uh full steam ahead here because I

9350
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:34,500
full uh full steam ahead here because I
 

9351
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:36,469
full uh full steam ahead here because I
agree with uh basically everything

9352
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
agree with uh basically everything
 

9353
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:37,550
agree with uh basically everything
you're saying when I'm trying to play

9354
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:37,560
you're saying when I'm trying to play
 

9355
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:40,130
you're saying when I'm trying to play
devil's advocate here there because okay

9356
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:40,140
devil's advocate here there because okay
 

9357
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:41,990
devil's advocate here there because okay
you've highlighted the fact that there

9358
02:25:41,990 --> 02:25:42,000
you've highlighted the fact that there
 

9359
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,750
you've highlighted the fact that there
is a slippery slope to human nature the

9360
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:44,760
is a slippery slope to human nature the
 

9361
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,490
is a slippery slope to human nature the
moment you censor something

9362
02:25:46,490 --> 02:25:46,500
moment you censor something
 

9363
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:49,550
moment you censor something
you start to censor everything

9364
02:25:49,550 --> 02:25:49,560
you start to censor everything
 

9365
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:50,630
you start to censor everything
um

9366
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:50,640
um
 

9367
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:54,170
um
the alignment starts out sounding nice

9368
02:25:54,170 --> 02:25:54,180
the alignment starts out sounding nice
 

9369
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:57,650
the alignment starts out sounding nice
but then you start align to uh the

9370
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:57,660
but then you start align to uh the
 

9371
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:59,389
but then you start align to uh the
beliefs of some

9372
02:25:59,389 --> 02:25:59,399
beliefs of some
 

9373
02:25:59,399 --> 02:26:01,250
beliefs of some
select group of people and then it's

9374
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:01,260
select group of people and then it's
 

9375
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:04,070
select group of people and then it's
just your beliefs the the number the

9376
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,080
just your beliefs the the number the
 

9377
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,450
just your beliefs the the number the
number of people you're lying to is

9378
02:26:05,450 --> 02:26:05,460
number of people you're lying to is
 

9379
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:06,950
number of people you're lying to is
smaller and smaller as that group

9380
02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:06,960
smaller and smaller as that group
 

9381
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:09,650
smaller and smaller as that group
becomes more and more powerful okay but

9382
02:26:09,650 --> 02:26:09,660
becomes more and more powerful okay but
 

9383
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:11,210
becomes more and more powerful okay but
that just speaks to the people that

9384
02:26:11,210 --> 02:26:11,220
that just speaks to the people that
 

9385
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:13,969
that just speaks to the people that
censor are usually the [\h__\h] and the

9386
02:26:13,969 --> 02:26:13,979
censor are usually the [\h__\h] and the
 

9387
02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:16,490
censor are usually the [\h__\h] and the
[\h__\h] get richer I wonder if it's

9388
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:16,500
[\h__\h] get richer I wonder if it's
 

9389
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,670
[\h__\h] get richer I wonder if it's
possible to do without that for AI the

9390
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:19,680
possible to do without that for AI the
 

9391
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,530
possible to do without that for AI the
one way to ask this question

9392
02:26:21,530 --> 02:26:21,540
one way to ask this question
 

9393
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:24,410
one way to ask this question
is do you think the base models the the

9394
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:24,420
is do you think the base models the the
 

9395
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:26,450
is do you think the base models the the
base the Baseline Foundation model

9396
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,460
base the Baseline Foundation model
 

9397
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:28,370
base the Baseline Foundation model
should be open sourced

9398
02:26:28,370 --> 02:26:28,380
should be open sourced
 

9399
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:30,889
should be open sourced
like uh what where Mark Zuckerberg is

9400
02:26:30,889 --> 02:26:30,899
like uh what where Mark Zuckerberg is
 

9401
02:26:30,899 --> 02:26:33,830
like uh what where Mark Zuckerberg is
saying they want to do so I look I mean

9402
02:26:33,830 --> 02:26:33,840
saying they want to do so I look I mean
 

9403
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:35,630
saying they want to do so I look I mean
I think it's totally appropriate that

9404
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:35,640
I think it's totally appropriate that
 

9405
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:37,429
I think it's totally appropriate that
companies that are in the business of

9406
02:26:37,429 --> 02:26:37,439
companies that are in the business of
 

9407
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:39,230
companies that are in the business of
producing a product or service should be

9408
02:26:39,230 --> 02:26:39,240
producing a product or service should be
 

9409
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,270
producing a product or service should be
able to have a wide range of policies

9410
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:41,280
able to have a wide range of policies
 

9411
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,010
able to have a wide range of policies
that they put right and now just again I

9412
02:26:43,010 --> 02:26:43,020
that they put right and now just again I
 

9413
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:45,170
that they put right and now just again I
want a heavily censored model for my

9414
02:26:45,170 --> 02:26:45,180
want a heavily censored model for my
 

9415
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:47,150
want a heavily censored model for my
eight-year-old like I actually want that

9416
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:47,160
eight-year-old like I actually want that
 

9417
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,650
eight-year-old like I actually want that
like like I would pay more money for the

9418
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:48,660
like like I would pay more money for the
 

9419
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:49,910
like like I would pay more money for the
ones more heavily censored than the one

9420
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
ones more heavily censored than the one
 

9421
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,110
ones more heavily censored than the one
that's not right

9422
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:51,120
that's not right
 

9423
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,610
that's not right
um and so like there are certainly

9424
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:52,620
um and so like there are certainly
 

9425
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:54,110
um and so like there are certainly
scenarios where companies will make that

9426
02:26:54,110 --> 02:26:54,120
scenarios where companies will make that
 

9427
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:56,150
scenarios where companies will make that
decision look an interesting thing you

9428
02:26:56,150 --> 02:26:56,160
decision look an interesting thing you
 

9429
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:58,070
decision look an interesting thing you
brought up the or is is this really a

9430
02:26:58,070 --> 02:26:58,080
brought up the or is is this really a
 

9431
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,050
brought up the or is is this really a
speech issue um one of the things that

9432
02:27:00,050 --> 02:27:00,060
speech issue um one of the things that
 

9433
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:01,309
speech issue um one of the things that
the big tech companies are dealing with

9434
02:27:01,309 --> 02:27:01,319
the big tech companies are dealing with
 

9435
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:04,250
the big tech companies are dealing with
is that content generated uh from an llm

9436
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:04,260
is that content generated uh from an llm
 

9437
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:07,130
is that content generated uh from an llm
is not covered under Section 230 uh

9438
02:27:07,130 --> 02:27:07,140
is not covered under Section 230 uh
 

9439
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:08,929
is not covered under Section 230 uh
which is the law that uh protects

9440
02:27:08,929 --> 02:27:08,939
which is the law that uh protects
 

9441
02:27:08,939 --> 02:27:10,250
which is the law that uh protects
internet platform companies from being

9442
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:10,260
internet platform companies from being
 

9443
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:13,250
internet platform companies from being
sued for the user generated content

9444
02:27:13,250 --> 02:27:13,260
sued for the user generated content
 

9445
02:27:13,260 --> 02:27:15,950
sued for the user generated content
um and so it it's actually yes and so

9446
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:15,960
um and so it it's actually yes and so
 

9447
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:17,870
um and so it it's actually yes and so
there's actually a there's actually a

9448
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:17,880
there's actually a there's actually a
 

9449
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:18,770
there's actually a there's actually a
question I think there's still a

9450
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:18,780
question I think there's still a
 

9451
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:20,389
question I think there's still a
question which is can big can big

9452
02:27:20,389 --> 02:27:20,399
question which is can big can big
 

9453
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:21,530
question which is can big can big
American companies actually feel

9454
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:21,540
American companies actually feel
 

9455
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,990
American companies actually feel
generative AI at all or is the liability

9456
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:24,000
generative AI at all or is the liability
 

9457
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,090
generative AI at all or is the liability
actually gonna just ultimately convince

9458
02:27:26,090 --> 02:27:26,100
actually gonna just ultimately convince
 

9459
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:27,469
actually gonna just ultimately convince
them that they can't do it because the

9460
02:27:27,469 --> 02:27:27,479
them that they can't do it because the
 

9461
02:27:27,479 --> 02:27:29,030
them that they can't do it because the
minute the thing says some something bad

9462
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:29,040
minute the thing says some something bad
 

9463
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:30,410
minute the thing says some something bad
and it doesn't even need to be hate

9464
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:30,420
and it doesn't even need to be hate
 

9465
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:32,030
and it doesn't even need to be hate
speech it could just be like an enact it

9466
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:32,040
speech it could just be like an enact it
 

9467
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:33,650
speech it could just be like an enact it
could hallucinate a product you know

9468
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:33,660
could hallucinate a product you know
 

9469
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:36,170
could hallucinate a product you know
detail on a vacuum cleaner you know and

9470
02:27:36,170 --> 02:27:36,180
detail on a vacuum cleaner you know and
 

9471
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:37,190
detail on a vacuum cleaner you know and
all of a sudden the vacuum cleaner

9472
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:37,200
all of a sudden the vacuum cleaner
 

9473
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,469
all of a sudden the vacuum cleaner
company sues for misrepresentation and

9474
02:27:39,469 --> 02:27:39,479
company sues for misrepresentation and
 

9475
02:27:39,479 --> 02:27:40,910
company sues for misrepresentation and
there's any symmetry there right because

9476
02:27:40,910 --> 02:27:40,920
there's any symmetry there right because
 

9477
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,710
there's any symmetry there right because
the the LM is going to be producing

9478
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,720
the the LM is going to be producing
 

9479
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,330
the the LM is going to be producing
billions of answers to questions and it

9480
02:27:44,330 --> 02:27:44,340
billions of answers to questions and it
 

9481
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:45,889
billions of answers to questions and it
only needs to get a few wrongs the loss

9482
02:27:45,889 --> 02:27:45,899
only needs to get a few wrongs the loss
 

9483
02:27:45,899 --> 02:27:47,150
only needs to get a few wrongs the loss
has to get updated really quick here

9484
02:27:47,150 --> 02:27:47,160
has to get updated really quick here
 

9485
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:48,590
has to get updated really quick here
yeah and nobody knows what to do with

9486
02:27:48,590 --> 02:27:48,600
yeah and nobody knows what to do with

02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,399
that right um so anyway like they're
 

9489
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:51,710
that right um so anyway like they're
they're a big they're big questions

02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:54,290
they're a big they're big questions
around how companies operate at all so

9492
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:54,300
around how companies operate at all so
 

9493
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,210
around how companies operate at all so
we talk about those but then there's

9494
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:56,220
we talk about those but then there's
 

9495
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:57,349
we talk about those but then there's
this other question of like okay the

9496
02:27:57,349 --> 02:27:57,359
this other question of like okay the
 

9497
02:27:57,359 --> 02:27:58,849
this other question of like okay the
open source so what about open source

9498
02:27:58,849 --> 02:27:58,859
open source so what about open source
 

9499
02:27:58,859 --> 02:28:00,410
open source so what about open source
and my answer to your question is kind

9500
02:28:00,410 --> 02:28:00,420
and my answer to your question is kind
 

9501
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:02,630
and my answer to your question is kind
of like obviously yes the models have

9502
02:28:02,630 --> 02:28:02,640
of like obviously yes the models have
 

9503
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,309
of like obviously yes the models have
there has to be full open source here

9504
02:28:04,309 --> 02:28:04,319
there has to be full open source here
 

9505
02:28:04,319 --> 02:28:06,590
there has to be full open source here
because to live in a world in which that

9506
02:28:06,590 --> 02:28:06,600
because to live in a world in which that
 

9507
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,870
because to live in a world in which that
open source is not allowed is a world of

9508
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:08,880
open source is not allowed is a world of
 

9509
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,630
open source is not allowed is a world of

your GPU like territory well no no I'm

9518
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:21,060
your GPU like territory well no no I'm
 

9519
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:23,090
your GPU like territory well no no I'm
100 serious that's you're saying

9520
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:23,100
100 serious that's you're saying
 

9521
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:24,590
100 serious that's you're saying
slippery slope always leads there no no

9522
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:24,600
slippery slope always leads there no no
 

9523
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,849
slippery slope always leads there no no
no no no that's what's required to

9524
02:28:25,849 --> 02:28:25,859
no no no that's what's required to
 

9525
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:27,770
no no no that's what's required to
enforce it like how will you enforce a

9526
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:27,780
enforce it like how will you enforce a
 

9527
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:28,870
enforce it like how will you enforce a
ban on open

9528
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:28,880
ban on open
 

9529
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,849
ban on open
you could add friction to it like harder

9530
02:28:31,849 --> 02:28:31,859
you could add friction to it like harder
 

9531
02:28:31,859 --> 02:28:32,870
you could add friction to it like harder
to get the models because people will

9532
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:32,880
to get the models because people will
 

9533
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:34,610
to get the models because people will
always be able to get the models but

9534
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:34,620
always be able to get the models but
 

9535
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:36,469
always be able to get the models but
it'll be more in the shadows right the

9536
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:36,479
it'll be more in the shadows right the
 

9537
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:37,670
it'll be more in the shadows right the
leading opens first model right now is

9538
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:37,680
leading opens first model right now is
 

9539
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,650
leading opens first model right now is
from the UAE it's like the next time

9540
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:39,660
from the UAE it's like the next time
 

9541
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:40,910
from the UAE it's like the next time
they do that

9542
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:40,920
they do that
 

9543
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:45,469
they do that
what do we do yeah like oh I see you're

9544
02:28:45,469 --> 02:28:45,479
what do we do yeah like oh I see you're
 

9545
02:28:45,479 --> 02:28:48,050
what do we do yeah like oh I see you're
like uh the 14 year old in Indonesia

9546
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:48,060
like uh the 14 year old in Indonesia
 

9547
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,490
like uh the 14 year old in Indonesia
comes out with a breakthrough model you

9548
02:28:49,490 --> 02:28:49,500
comes out with a breakthrough model you
 

9549
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:50,690
comes out with a breakthrough model you
know we talked about most great software

9550
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:50,700
know we talked about most great software
 

9551
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:51,889
know we talked about most great software
comes from a small number of people some

9552
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:51,899
comes from a small number of people some
 

9553
02:28:51,899 --> 02:28:53,030
comes from a small number of people some
kid comes out with some big new

9554
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:53,040
kid comes out with some big new
 

9555
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:54,290
kid comes out with some big new
breakthrough in quantization or

9556
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:54,300
breakthrough in quantization or
 

9557
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:55,190
breakthrough in quantization or
something and he has some huge

9558
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:55,200
something and he has some huge
 

9559
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,929
something and he has some huge
breakthrough and like what we're gonna

9560
02:28:56,929 --> 02:28:56,939
breakthrough and like what we're gonna
 

9561
02:28:56,939 --> 02:28:58,250
breakthrough and like what we're gonna
what are we gonna like

9562
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:58,260
what are we gonna like
 

9563
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:00,349
what are we gonna like
invade Indonesia and arrest him it seems

9564
02:29:00,349 --> 02:29:00,359
invade Indonesia and arrest him it seems
 

9565
02:29:00,359 --> 02:29:01,610
invade Indonesia and arrest him it seems
like in terms of size and models and

9566
02:29:01,610 --> 02:29:01,620
like in terms of size and models and
 

9567
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:02,990
like in terms of size and models and
effectiveness of models the big tech

9568
02:29:02,990 --> 02:29:03,000
effectiveness of models the big tech
 

9569
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,510
effectiveness of models the big tech
companies will probably lead the way for

9570
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:05,520
companies will probably lead the way for
 

9571
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:07,250
companies will probably lead the way for
quite a few years and and the question

9572
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:07,260
quite a few years and and the question
 

9573
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:10,429
quite a few years and and the question
is of what policies they should use the

9574
02:29:10,429 --> 02:29:10,439
is of what policies they should use the
 

9575
02:29:10,439 --> 02:29:13,070
is of what policies they should use the
the kid the kid in Indonesia should not

9576
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:13,080
the kid the kid in Indonesia should not
 

9577
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:17,590
the kid the kid in Indonesia should not
be regulated but should Google meta

9578
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:17,600
be regulated but should Google meta
 

9579
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:21,230
be regulated but should Google meta
uh Microsoft open AI be regulated well

9580
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,240
uh Microsoft open AI be regulated well
 

9581
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,450
uh Microsoft open AI be regulated well
so but this goes okay so when does it

9582
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:23,460
so but this goes okay so when does it
 

9583
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:25,490
so but this goes okay so when does it
become dangerous yeah

9584
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:25,500
become dangerous yeah
 

9585
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,710
become dangerous yeah
right is is the danger that it's quote

9586
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:27,720
right is is the danger that it's quote
 

9587
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,630
right is is the danger that it's quote
as powerful as the current leading

9588
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:29,640
as powerful as the current leading
 

9589
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:31,849
as powerful as the current leading
commercial model or is it that it is it

9590
02:29:31,849 --> 02:29:31,859
commercial model or is it that it is it
 

9591
02:29:31,859 --> 02:29:33,230
commercial model or is it that it is it
is just at some other arbitrary

9592
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:33,240
is just at some other arbitrary
 

9593
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:35,270
is just at some other arbitrary
threshold yeah and then by the way like

9594
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:35,280
threshold yeah and then by the way like
 

9595
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,070
threshold yeah and then by the way like
look how do we know like what we know

9596
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:37,080
look how do we know like what we know
 

9597
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:38,570
look how do we know like what we know
today is that you need like a lot of

9598
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:38,580
today is that you need like a lot of
 

9599
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:39,830
today is that you need like a lot of
money to like train these things but

9600
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:39,840
money to like train these things but
 

9601
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,389
money to like train these things but
their advances being made every week on

9602
02:29:41,389 --> 02:29:41,399
their advances being made every week on
 

9603
02:29:41,399 --> 02:29:43,010
their advances being made every week on
training efficiency and you know data

9604
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:43,020
training efficiency and you know data
 

9605
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:44,450
training efficiency and you know data
all kinds of synthetic you know look I

9606
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:44,460
all kinds of synthetic you know look I
 

9607
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:45,710
all kinds of synthetic you know look I
don't even like the synthetic data thing

9608
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:45,720
don't even like the synthetic data thing
 

9609
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:46,790
don't even like the synthetic data thing
we're talking about maybe some kid

9610
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
we're talking about maybe some kid
 

9611
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,929
we're talking about maybe some kid
figures out a way to Auto generate

9612
02:29:47,929 --> 02:29:47,939
figures out a way to Auto generate
 

9613
02:29:47,939 --> 02:29:48,889
figures out a way to Auto generate
synthetically it's going to change

9614
02:29:48,889 --> 02:29:48,899
synthetically it's going to change
 

9615
02:29:48,899 --> 02:29:50,690
synthetically it's going to change
everything yeah exactly and so like

9616
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:50,700
everything yeah exactly and so like
 

9617
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:52,309
everything yeah exactly and so like
sitting here today like the the

9618
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:52,319
sitting here today like the the
 

9619
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:53,990
sitting here today like the the
Breakthrough just happened right you

9620
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:54,000
Breakthrough just happened right you
 

9621
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,010
Breakthrough just happened right you
made this point like the Breakthrough

9622
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:55,020
made this point like the Breakthrough
 

9623
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:57,590
made this point like the Breakthrough
just happened so we don't know what the

9624
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:57,600
just happened so we don't know what the
 

9625
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,910
just happened so we don't know what the
shape of this technology is going to be

9626
02:29:58,910 --> 02:29:58,920
shape of this technology is going to be
 

9627
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:01,370
shape of this technology is going to be
I mean the the big shock the the big

9628
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:01,380
I mean the the big shock the the big
 

9629
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:03,469
I mean the the big shock the the big
shock here is that you know whatever

9630
02:30:03,469 --> 02:30:03,479
shock here is that you know whatever
 

9631
02:30:03,479 --> 02:30:05,210
shock here is that you know whatever
number of billions of parameters

9632
02:30:05,210 --> 02:30:05,220
number of billions of parameters
 

9633
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:07,250
number of billions of parameters
basically represents at least a very big

9634
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,260
basically represents at least a very big
 

9635
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:09,530
basically represents at least a very big
percentage of human thought like who

9636
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:09,540
percentage of human thought like who
 

9637
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:10,910
percentage of human thought like who
would have imagined that

9638
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:10,920
would have imagined that
 

9639
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:12,590
would have imagined that
and then there's already work underway

9640
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:12,600
and then there's already work underway
 

9641
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:13,910
and then there's already work underway
there was just this paper that just came

9642
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:13,920
there was just this paper that just came
 

9643
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:16,070
there was just this paper that just came
out that basically takes the gpt3 scale

9644
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:16,080
out that basically takes the gpt3 scale
 

9645
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,570
out that basically takes the gpt3 scale
model and compresses it down to run on a

9646
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:17,580
model and compresses it down to run on a
 

9647
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:19,429
model and compresses it down to run on a
single 32 core CPU

9648
02:30:19,429 --> 02:30:19,439
single 32 core CPU
 

9649
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:22,550
single 32 core CPU
like who would have predicted that yeah

9650
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:22,560
like who would have predicted that yeah
 

9651
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:24,110
like who would have predicted that yeah
um you know some of these models now you

9652
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:24,120
um you know some of these models now you
 

9653
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,730
um you know some of these models now you
can run a Raspberry Pi's like today

9654
02:30:25,730 --> 02:30:25,740
can run a Raspberry Pi's like today
 

9655
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:27,290
can run a Raspberry Pi's like today
they're very slow but like you know

9656
02:30:27,290 --> 02:30:27,300
they're very slow but like you know
 

9657
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:29,570
they're very slow but like you know
maybe they'll be a you know perform you

9658
02:30:29,570 --> 02:30:29,580
maybe they'll be a you know perform you
 

9659
02:30:29,580 --> 02:30:30,950
maybe they'll be a you know perform you
know like

9660
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:30,960
know like
 

9661
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:33,050
know like
it's math and here we're back in here

9662
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:33,060
it's math and here we're back in here
 

9663
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,389
it's math and here we're back in here
we're back math and code it's math and

9664
02:30:35,389 --> 02:30:35,399
we're back math and code it's math and
 

9665
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:38,150
we're back math and code it's math and
codes math code and data it's bits marks

9666
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:38,160
codes math code and data it's bits marks
 

9667
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,650
codes math code and data it's bits marks
just like blocked away at this point

9668
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:39,660
just like blocked away at this point
 

9669
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:42,710
just like blocked away at this point
he's just screw it I don't know what to

9670
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:42,720
he's just screw it I don't know what to
 

9671
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:44,510
he's just screw it I don't know what to
do with this you guys created this whole

9672
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:44,520
do with this you guys created this whole
 

9673
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:48,230
do with this you guys created this whole
internet thing yeah yeah I mean I'm a

9674
02:30:48,230 --> 02:30:48,240
internet thing yeah yeah I mean I'm a
 

9675
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:50,330
internet thing yeah yeah I mean I'm a
huge believer in open source here so my

9676
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:50,340
huge believer in open source here so my
 

9677
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:51,410
huge believer in open source here so my
argument is we're gonna have to see

9678
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:51,420
argument is we're gonna have to see
 

9679
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:53,090
argument is we're gonna have to see
here's my argument my argument my full

9680
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:53,100
here's my argument my argument my full
 

9681
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:54,410
here's my argument my argument my full
argument is AI is going to be like air

9682
02:30:54,410 --> 02:30:54,420
argument is AI is going to be like air
 

9683
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,150
argument is AI is going to be like air
it's going to be everywhere like this is

9684
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:56,160
it's going to be everywhere like this is
 

9685
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:57,290
it's going to be everywhere like this is
just going to be in Texas it already is

9686
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,300
just going to be in Texas it already is
 

9687
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:58,309
just going to be in Texas it already is
it's going to be in textbooks and kids

9688
02:30:58,309 --> 02:30:58,319
it's going to be in textbooks and kids
 

9689
02:30:58,319 --> 02:30:59,210
it's going to be in textbooks and kids
are going to grow up knowing how to do

9690
02:30:59,210 --> 02:30:59,220
are going to grow up knowing how to do
 

9691
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:00,170
are going to grow up knowing how to do
this and it's just going to be a thing

9692
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:00,180
this and it's just going to be a thing
 

9693
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:01,250
this and it's just going to be a thing
it's going to be in the air and you

9694
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:01,260
it's going to be in the air and you
 

9695
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:02,630
it's going to be in the air and you
can't like pull this back anywhere you

9696
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640
can't like pull this back anywhere you
 

9697
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,250
can't like pull this back anywhere you
can pull back air and so you just have

9698
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:04,260
can pull back air and so you just have
 

9699
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:05,750
can pull back air and so you just have
to figure out how to live in this world

9700
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:05,760
to figure out how to live in this world
 

9701
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,490
to figure out how to live in this world
right and then that and then that's

9702
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:07,500
right and then that and then that's
 

9703
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:08,929
right and then that and then that's
where I think like all this hand ringing

9704
02:31:08,929 --> 02:31:08,939
where I think like all this hand ringing
 

9705
02:31:08,939 --> 02:31:10,370
where I think like all this hand ringing
but air risk is basically complete waste

9706
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:10,380
but air risk is basically complete waste
 

9707
02:31:10,380 --> 02:31:11,929
but air risk is basically complete waste
of time because the the the effort

9708
02:31:11,929 --> 02:31:11,939
of time because the the the effort
 

9709
02:31:11,939 --> 02:31:13,730
of time because the the the effort
should go into okay what are what what

9710
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:13,740
should go into okay what are what what
 

9711
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:15,950
should go into okay what are what what
is the defensive approach and so if

9712
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:15,960
is the defensive approach and so if
 

9713
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:17,030
is the defensive approach and so if
you're worried about you know AI

9714
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:17,040
you're worried about you know AI
 

9715
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:18,410
you're worried about you know AI
generated pathogens the right thing to

9716
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:18,420
generated pathogens the right thing to
 

9717
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:19,969
generated pathogens the right thing to
do is to have a permanent project warp

9718
02:31:19,969 --> 02:31:19,979
do is to have a permanent project warp
 

9719
02:31:19,979 --> 02:31:22,190
do is to have a permanent project warp
speed right funded lavishly let's do it

9720
02:31:22,190 --> 02:31:22,200
speed right funded lavishly let's do it
 

9721
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:24,110
speed right funded lavishly let's do it
Manhattan let's talk about let's do a

9722
02:31:24,110 --> 02:31:24,120
Manhattan let's talk about let's do a
 

9723
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:25,490
Manhattan let's talk about let's do a
Manhattan project for biological defense

9724
02:31:25,490 --> 02:31:25,500
Manhattan project for biological defense
 

9725
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:27,770
Manhattan project for biological defense
right and let's build AIS and let's have

9726
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:27,780
right and let's build AIS and let's have
 

9727
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:29,630
right and let's build AIS and let's have
like broad spectrum vaccines where like

9728
02:31:29,630 --> 02:31:29,640
like broad spectrum vaccines where like
 

9729
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,590
like broad spectrum vaccines where like
we're insulated from every pathogen

9730
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:32,600
we're insulated from every pathogen
 

9731
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:34,849
we're insulated from every pathogen
well the interesting thing is because

9732
02:31:34,849 --> 02:31:34,859
well the interesting thing is because
 

9733
02:31:34,859 --> 02:31:36,410
well the interesting thing is because
it's software

9734
02:31:36,410 --> 02:31:36,420
it's software
 

9735
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,410
it's software
a kid in his basement teenager could

9736
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:39,420
a kid in his basement teenager could
 

9737
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:41,450
a kid in his basement teenager could
build like a system that defends against

9738
02:31:41,450 --> 02:31:41,460
build like a system that defends against
 

9739
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:44,150
build like a system that defends against
like the worst the the worst I mean and

9740
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:44,160
like the worst the the worst I mean and
 

9741
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:47,690
like the worst the the worst I mean and
to me defense is super exciting

9742
02:31:47,690 --> 02:31:47,700
to me defense is super exciting
 

9743
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:50,510
to me defense is super exciting
it's to like I If you believe in the

9744
02:31:50,510 --> 02:31:50,520
it's to like I If you believe in the
 

9745
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,790
it's to like I If you believe in the
good of human nature that most people

9746
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:52,800
good of human nature that most people
 

9747
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:54,770
good of human nature that most people
want to do good to be the savior of

9748
02:31:54,770 --> 02:31:54,780
want to do good to be the savior of
 

9749
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:56,690
want to do good to be the savior of
humanity is really exciting

9750
02:31:56,690 --> 02:31:56,700
humanity is really exciting
 

9751
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:58,370
humanity is really exciting
yes

9752
02:31:58,370 --> 02:31:58,380
yes
 

9753
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:00,170
yes
okay that's a dramatic statement but

9754
02:32:00,170 --> 02:32:00,180
okay that's a dramatic statement but
 

9755
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:02,510
okay that's a dramatic statement but
like to help people to help people

9756
02:32:02,510 --> 02:32:02,520
like to help people to help people
 

9757
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,790
like to help people to help people
yeah okay what about just the jump

9758
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:04,800
yeah okay what about just the jump
 

9759
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:07,250
yeah okay what about just the jump
around what about the risk of will AI

9760
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:07,260
around what about the risk of will AI
 

9761
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:09,889
around what about the risk of will AI
lead to crippling inequality

9762
02:32:09,889 --> 02:32:09,899
lead to crippling inequality
 

9763
02:32:09,899 --> 02:32:11,330
lead to crippling inequality
you know because we're kind of saying

9764
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:11,340
you know because we're kind of saying
 

9765
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:13,550
you know because we're kind of saying
everybody's life will become better

9766
02:32:13,550 --> 02:32:13,560
everybody's life will become better
 

9767
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:15,530
everybody's life will become better
is it possible that the the rich get

9768
02:32:15,530 --> 02:32:15,540
is it possible that the the rich get
 

9769
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:17,630
is it possible that the the rich get
richer here yeah so this is actually

9770
02:32:17,630 --> 02:32:17,640
richer here yeah so this is actually
 

9771
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:19,429
richer here yeah so this is actually
ironically goes back to Marxism so um

9772
02:32:19,429 --> 02:32:19,439
ironically goes back to Marxism so um
 

9773
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:20,570
ironically goes back to Marxism so um
because this was the code so the court

9774
02:32:20,570 --> 02:32:20,580
because this was the code so the court
 

9775
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:22,130
because this was the code so the court
claim of Marxism right basically was

9776
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:22,140
claim of Marxism right basically was
 

9777
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:23,270
claim of Marxism right basically was
that the owner the owners of capital

9778
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
that the owner the owners of capital
 

9779
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,590
that the owner the owners of capital
would basically own the means of

9780
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:24,600
would basically own the means of
 

9781
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:25,849
would basically own the means of
production and then over time they would

9782
02:32:25,849 --> 02:32:25,859
production and then over time they would
 

9783
02:32:25,859 --> 02:32:27,650
production and then over time they would
basically accumulate all the wealth the

9784
02:32:27,650 --> 02:32:27,660
basically accumulate all the wealth the
 

9785
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:29,270
basically accumulate all the wealth the
workers would be paying in you know and

9786
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:29,280
workers would be paying in you know and
 

9787
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:31,010
workers would be paying in you know and
getting nothing in return because they

9788
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:31,020
getting nothing in return because they
 

9789
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:32,389
getting nothing in return because they
wouldn't be needed anymore right marks

9790
02:32:32,389 --> 02:32:32,399
wouldn't be needed anymore right marks
 

9791
02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:33,469
wouldn't be needed anymore right marks
was very worried about what he called

9792
02:32:33,469 --> 02:32:33,479
was very worried about what he called
 

9793
02:32:33,479 --> 02:32:35,090
was very worried about what he called
mechanization or what later became known

9794
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:35,100
mechanization or what later became known
 

9795
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,710
mechanization or what later became known
as automation

9796
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:36,720
as automation
 

9797
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:37,849
as automation
um and that you know the workers would

9798
02:32:37,849 --> 02:32:37,859
um and that you know the workers would
 

9799
02:32:37,859 --> 02:32:39,530
um and that you know the workers would
be miserated and the capitalists would

9800
02:32:39,530 --> 02:32:39,540
be miserated and the capitalists would
 

9801

Technology
 

9811
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:47,929
Technology
um the reason it turned out to be wrong

9812
02:32:47,929 --> 02:32:47,939
um the reason it turned out to be wrong
 

9813
02:32:47,939 --> 02:32:49,309
um the reason it turned out to be wrong
about every previous wave of technology

9814
02:32:49,309 --> 02:32:49,319
about every previous wave of technology
 

9815
02:32:49,319 --> 02:32:51,830

right which is the early adopters of
 

9879
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:51,050
right which is the early adopters of
like jgpt and Bing are not like you know

means of production whoever does this
doesn't mention these trillion other

9900
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:08,460
doesn't mention these trillion other
 

9901
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,469
doesn't mention these trillion other
questions there are people who are going

9902
02:34:09,469 --> 02:34:09,479
questions there are people who are going
 

9903
02:34:09,479 --> 02:34:11,450
questions there are people who are going
to get really rich doing this producing

9904
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:11,460
to get really rich doing this producing
 

9905
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:12,410
to get really rich doing this producing
these things but they're going to get

9906
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:12,420
these things but they're going to get
 

9907
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:13,790
these things but they're going to get
really rich by taking this technology to

9908
02:34:13,790 --> 02:34:13,800
really rich by taking this technology to
 

9909
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,349
really rich by taking this technology to
the broadest possible Market

9910
02:34:15,349 --> 02:34:15,359
the broadest possible Market
 

9911
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:17,809
the broadest possible Market
so yes they'll get rich but they'll get

9912
02:34:17,809 --> 02:34:17,819
so yes they'll get rich but they'll get
 

9913
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:20,150
so yes they'll get rich but they'll get
rich having a huge positive impact on

rich having a huge positive impact on
 

9915
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:21,590
rich having a huge positive impact on
yeah making that making the technology

9916
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,600
yeah making that making the technology
 

9917
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:23,450
yeah making that making the technology
available to everybody yeah right and

9918
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:23,460
available to everybody yeah right and
 

9919
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:24,950

02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:31,190
spend ten thousand dollars on a
smartphone

9928
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:31,200
smartphone
 

9929
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:32,870
smartphone
right you can't spend a hundred thousand

9930
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:32,880
right you can't spend a hundred thousand
 

9931
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:34,130
right you can't spend a hundred thousand
dollars you can't spend like I would buy

9932

the million dollar smartphone like I'm
 

9935
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:36,410
the million dollar smartphone like I'm
signed up for it like if it's like

9936
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:36,420

suppose a million dollar smartphone was
 

9939
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:38,990
suppose a million dollar smartphone was
like much better than the thousand

9940
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:39,000
like much better than the thousand
 

9941
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,309
like much better than the thousand
dollar smartphone like I'm there to buy

9942
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:40,319
dollar smartphone like I'm there to buy
 

9943
02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:42,290
dollar smartphone like I'm there to buy
it it doesn't exist why doesn't it exist

9944
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:42,300
it it doesn't exist why doesn't it exist
 

9945
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,270
it it doesn't exist why doesn't it exist
Apple makes so much more money driving

9946
02:34:44,270 --> 02:34:44,280
Apple makes so much more money driving
 

9947
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:45,590
Apple makes so much more money driving
the price further down from a thousand

9948
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:45,600
the price further down from a thousand
 

9949
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:46,550
the price further down from a thousand
dollars than they would trying to

9950
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:46,560
dollars than they would trying to
 

9951
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,469
dollars than they would trying to
harvest right and so it's just this

9952
02:34:48,469 --> 02:34:48,479
harvest right and so it's just this
 

9953
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:49,849
harvest right and so it's just this
repeating pattern you see over and over

9954
02:34:49,849 --> 02:34:49,859
repeating pattern you see over and over
 

9955
02:34:49,859 --> 02:34:51,889
repeating pattern you see over and over
again um where the and and what's what's

9956
02:34:51,889 --> 02:34:51,899
again um where the and and what's what's
 

9957

again um where the and and what's what's
great about it what's great about it is

9958
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:53,460
great about it what's great about it is
 

9959
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:55,309
great about it what's great about it is
you do not need to rely on anybody's

9960
02:34:55,309 --> 02:34:55,319
you do not need to rely on anybody's
 

9961
02:34:55,319 --> 02:34:57,590
you do not need to rely on anybody's
enlightened right generosity to do this

9962
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:57,600
enlightened right generosity to do this
 

9963
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,969
enlightened right generosity to do this
you just need to rely on capitalist

9964
02:34:58,969 --> 02:34:58,979
you just need to rely on capitalist
 

9965
02:34:58,979 --> 02:35:00,610
you just need to rely on capitalist
self-interest

9966
02:35:00,610 --> 02:35:00,620
self-interest
 

9967
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:04,130
self-interest
uh what about AI taking our jobs

9968
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:04,140
uh what about AI taking our jobs
 

9969
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:06,050
uh what about AI taking our jobs
yeah so very very similar thing here um

9970
02:35:06,050 --> 02:35:06,060
yeah so very very similar thing here um
 

9971
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:07,610
yeah so very very similar thing here um
there's sort of a there's a core fallacy

9972
02:35:07,610 --> 02:35:07,620
there's sort of a there's a core fallacy
 

9973
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:08,870
there's sort of a there's a core fallacy
which again was was very common in

9974
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:08,880
which again was was very common in
 

9975
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:10,250
which again was was very common in
Marxism which is What's called the lump

9976
02:35:10,250 --> 02:35:10,260
Marxism which is What's called the lump
 

9977
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:12,290
Marxism which is What's called the lump
of Labor fallacy and this is sort of the

9978
02:35:12,290 --> 02:35:12,300
of Labor fallacy and this is sort of the
 

9979
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:14,090
of Labor fallacy and this is sort of the
fallacy that there's a only a fixed

9980
02:35:14,090 --> 02:35:14,100
fallacy that there's a only a fixed
 

9981
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:15,170
fallacy that there's a only a fixed
amount of work to be done in the world

9982
02:35:15,170 --> 02:35:15,180
amount of work to be done in the world
 

9983
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:17,330
amount of work to be done in the world
and if the and it's all being done today

9984
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:17,340
and if the and it's all being done today
 

9985
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:18,889
and if the and it's all being done today
by people and then if machines do it

9986
02:35:18,889 --> 02:35:18,899
by people and then if machines do it
 

9987
02:35:18,899 --> 02:35:20,450
by people and then if machines do it
there's no other work to be done by

9988
02:35:20,450 --> 02:35:20,460
there's no other work to be done by
 

9989
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:21,590
there's no other work to be done by
people

9990
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:21,600
people
 

9991
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:22,610
people
um and that's just a completely

9992
02:35:22,610 --> 02:35:22,620
um and that's just a completely
 

9993
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:24,410
um and that's just a completely
backwards view on how the economy

9994
02:35:24,410 --> 02:35:24,420
backwards view on how the economy
 

9995
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:26,450
backwards view on how the economy
develops and grows um because what

9996
02:35:26,450 --> 02:35:26,460
develops and grows um because what
 

9997
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:28,130
develops and grows um because what
happens is not in fact that what happens

9998
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:28,140
happens is not in fact that what happens
 

9999
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:30,530
happens is not in fact that what happens
is the introduction of Technology into

10000
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:30,540
is the introduction of Technology into
 

10001
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:32,570
is the introduction of Technology into
production process causes prices to fall

10002
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:32,580
production process causes prices to fall
 

10003
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:35,030
production process causes prices to fall
as prices fall consumers have more

10004
02:35:35,030 --> 02:35:35,040
as prices fall consumers have more
 

10005
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,830
as prices fall consumers have more
spending power is consumers have more

10006
02:35:36,830 --> 02:35:36,840
spending power is consumers have more
 

10007
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:38,510
spending power is consumers have more
spending power they create new demand

10008
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:38,520
spending power they create new demand
 

10009
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:41,270
spending power they create new demand
that new demand then causes capital and

10010
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
that new demand then causes capital and
 

10011
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,490
that new demand then causes capital and
labor to form into new Enterprises to

10012
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:43,500
labor to form into new Enterprises to
 

10013
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:45,530
labor to form into new Enterprises to
satisfy nuance and needs and the result

10014
02:35:45,530 --> 02:35:45,540
satisfy nuance and needs and the result
 

10015
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:47,990
satisfy nuance and needs and the result
is more jobs and higher wages the nuance

10016
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:48,000
is more jobs and higher wages the nuance
 

10017
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,150
is more jobs and higher wages the nuance
and needs the the worries that the the

10018
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:50,160
and needs the the worries that the the
 

10019
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,849
and needs the the worries that the the
creation of new wants and needs at a

10020
02:35:52,849 --> 02:35:52,859
creation of new wants and needs at a
 

10021
02:35:52,859 --> 02:35:53,990
creation of new wants and needs at a
rapid rate

10022
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:54,000
rapid rate
 

10023
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,849
rapid rate
will mean there's a lot of turnover in

10024
02:35:55,849 --> 02:35:55,859
will mean there's a lot of turnover in
 

10025
02:35:55,859 --> 02:35:59,090
will mean there's a lot of turnover in
jobs so people will lose jobs just the

10026
02:35:59,090 --> 02:35:59,100
jobs so people will lose jobs just the
 

10027
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:00,650
jobs so people will lose jobs just the
actual experience of losing a job and

10028
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:00,660
actual experience of losing a job and
 

10029
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:02,090
actual experience of losing a job and
having to learn new things and your

10030
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:02,100
having to learn new things and your
 

10031
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:04,250
having to learn new things and your
skills is painful for the individual

10032
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:04,260
skills is painful for the individual
 

10033
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,630
skills is painful for the individual
well two things one is the new jobs are

10034
02:36:05,630 --> 02:36:05,640
well two things one is the new jobs are
 

10035
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:07,370
well two things one is the new jobs are
often much better

10036
02:36:07,370 --> 02:36:07,380
often much better
 

10037
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:09,110
often much better
um so this actually came up as if there

10038
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:09,120
um so this actually came up as if there
 

10039
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:10,370
um so this actually came up as if there
was this Panic about a decade ago and

10040
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:10,380
was this Panic about a decade ago and
 

10041
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:11,330
was this Panic about a decade ago and
all the truck drivers are going to lose

10042
02:36:11,330 --> 02:36:11,340
all the truck drivers are going to lose
 

10043
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:12,710
all the truck drivers are going to lose
their jobs right and number one that

10044
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:12,720
their jobs right and number one that
 

10045
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:13,910
their jobs right and number one that
didn't happen because we haven't figured

10046
02:36:13,910 --> 02:36:13,920
didn't happen because we haven't figured
 

10047
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,070
didn't happen because we haven't figured
out a way to actually finish that yet

10048
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:16,080
out a way to actually finish that yet
 

10049
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,750
out a way to actually finish that yet
but but the other thing was like

10050
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:17,760
but but the other thing was like
 

10051
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,309
but but the other thing was like
electric driver like I grew up in a town

10052
02:36:19,309 --> 02:36:19,319
electric driver like I grew up in a town
 

10053
02:36:19,319 --> 02:36:20,510
electric driver like I grew up in a town
that was basically consisted of a truck

10054
02:36:20,510 --> 02:36:20,520
that was basically consisted of a truck
 

10055
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:22,010
that was basically consisted of a truck
stop right and I like knew a lot of

10056
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:22,020
stop right and I like knew a lot of
 

10057
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:23,570
stop right and I like knew a lot of
truck drivers and like truck drivers

10058
02:36:23,570 --> 02:36:23,580
truck drivers and like truck drivers
 

10059
02:36:23,580 --> 02:36:25,429
truck drivers and like truck drivers
live a decade shorter than everybody

10060
02:36:25,429 --> 02:36:25,439
live a decade shorter than everybody
 

10061
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:27,590
live a decade shorter than everybody
else like they it's a it's a it's

10062
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:27,600
else like they it's a it's a it's
 

10063
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:29,210
else like they it's a it's a it's
actually like a very dangerous like they

10064
02:36:29,210 --> 02:36:29,220
actually like a very dangerous like they
 

10065
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:30,410
actually like a very dangerous like they
get like literally they have like high

10066
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:30,420
get like literally they have like high
 

10067
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:32,090
get like literally they have like high
rates of skin cancer and on the left

10068
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:32,100
rates of skin cancer and on the left
 

10069
02:36:32,100 --> 02:36:33,349
rates of skin cancer and on the left
side of their on the left side of their

10070
02:36:33,349 --> 02:36:33,359
side of their on the left side of their
 

10071
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:34,730
side of their on the left side of their
body from from being in the sun all the

10072
02:36:34,730 --> 02:36:34,740
body from from being in the sun all the
 

10073
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:36,590
body from from being in the sun all the
time the vibration of being in the truck

10074
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:36,600
time the vibration of being in the truck
 

10075
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,030
time the vibration of being in the truck
is actually very damaging to your to

10076
02:36:38,030 --> 02:36:38,040
is actually very damaging to your to
 

10077
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:40,070
is actually very damaging to your to
your physiology and there's actually a

10078
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
your physiology and there's actually a
 

10079
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:41,870
your physiology and there's actually a
uh perhaps partially because of that

10080
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:41,880
uh perhaps partially because of that
 

10081
02:36:41,880 --> 02:36:45,950
uh perhaps partially because of that
reason uh there's a shortage yeah of uh

10082
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:45,960
reason uh there's a shortage yeah of uh
 

10083
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:47,809
reason uh there's a shortage yeah of uh
people who want to be truck drivers yeah

10084
02:36:47,809 --> 02:36:47,819
people who want to be truck drivers yeah
 

10085
02:36:47,819 --> 02:36:49,790
people who want to be truck drivers yeah
like it's not it's not like the question

10086
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:49,800
like it's not it's not like the question
 

10087
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:50,870
like it's not it's not like the question
always you want to ask somebody like

10088
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:50,880
always you want to ask somebody like
 

10089
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:52,849
always you want to ask somebody like
that is do you want you know do you want

10090
02:36:52,849 --> 02:36:52,859
that is do you want you know do you want
 

10091
02:36:52,859 --> 02:36:54,170
that is do you want you know do you want
your kid to be doing this job and like

10092
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:54,180
your kid to be doing this job and like
 

10093
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,670
your kid to be doing this job and like
most of them will tell you no like I

10094
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:55,680
most of them will tell you no like I
 

10095
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,990
most of them will tell you no like I
want my kid to be sick in a cubicle

10096
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,000
want my kid to be sick in a cubicle
 

10097
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,070
want my kid to be sick in a cubicle
somewhere like where they don't have

10098
02:36:58,070 --> 02:36:58,080
somewhere like where they don't have
 

10099
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,510
somewhere like where they don't have
this like where they don't die 10 years

10100
02:36:59,510 --> 02:36:59,520
this like where they don't die 10 years
 

10101
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,730
this like where they don't die 10 years
earlier and so so the new jobs number

10102
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:01,740
earlier and so so the new jobs number
 

10103
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:03,590
earlier and so so the new jobs number
one the new jobs are often better but

10104
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:03,600
one the new jobs are often better but
 

10105
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:04,969
one the new jobs are often better but
you don't get the new jobs until you go

10106
02:37:04,969 --> 02:37:04,979
you don't get the new jobs until you go
 

10107
02:37:04,979 --> 02:37:06,290
you don't get the new jobs until you go
through the change and then to your

10108
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:06,300
through the change and then to your
 

10109
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:07,849
through the change and then to your
point the the training thing you know

10110
02:37:07,849 --> 02:37:07,859
point the the training thing you know
 

10111
02:37:07,859 --> 02:37:09,290
point the the training thing you know
it's always the issue is can can people

10112
02:37:09,290 --> 02:37:09,300
it's always the issue is can can people
 

10113
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:10,849
it's always the issue is can can people
adapt and again here you need to imagine

10114
02:37:10,849 --> 02:37:10,859
adapt and again here you need to imagine
 

10115
02:37:10,859 --> 02:37:12,469
adapt and again here you need to imagine
living in a world in which everybody has

10116
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
living in a world in which everybody has
 

10117
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,690
living in a world in which everybody has
the AI assistant capability

10118
02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:14,700
the AI assistant capability
 

10119
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:16,309
the AI assistant capability
right to be able to pick up new skills

10120
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
right to be able to pick up new skills
 

10121
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:17,330
right to be able to pick up new skills
much more quickly and be able to have

10122
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:17,340
much more quickly and be able to have
 

10123
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:18,469
much more quickly and be able to have
some you know be able to have a machine

10124
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
some you know be able to have a machine
 

10125
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:19,670
some you know be able to have a machine
to work with to augment their skills

10126
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
to work with to augment their skills
 

10127
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,170
to work with to augment their skills
it's still going to be painful but

10128
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:21,180
it's still going to be painful but
 

10129
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:23,090
it's still going to be painful but
that's the process of life it's painful

10130
02:37:23,090 --> 02:37:23,100
that's the process of life it's painful
 

10131
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:24,290
that's the process of life it's painful
for some people I mean there's no look

10132
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:24,300
for some people I mean there's no look
 

10133
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:25,370
for some people I mean there's no look
there's no question it's painful for

10134
02:37:25,370 --> 02:37:25,380
there's no question it's painful for
 

10135
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:26,389
there's no question it's painful for
some people and they're you know they're

10136
02:37:26,389 --> 02:37:26,399
some people and they're you know they're
 

10137
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:28,910
some people and they're you know they're
yes it's not again I'm not a utopian on

10138
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:28,920
yes it's not again I'm not a utopian on
 

10139
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:30,349
yes it's not again I'm not a utopian on
this and it's not like it's positive for

10140
02:37:30,349 --> 02:37:30,359
this and it's not like it's positive for
 

10141
02:37:30,359 --> 02:37:31,969
this and it's not like it's positive for
everybody in the moment but it has been

10142
02:37:31,969 --> 02:37:31,979
everybody in the moment but it has been
 

10143
02:37:31,979 --> 02:37:34,309
everybody in the moment but it has been
overwhelmingly positive for 300 years

10144
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
overwhelmingly positive for 300 years
 

10145
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:36,290
overwhelmingly positive for 300 years
I mean look the concern here the concern

10146
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:36,300
I mean look the concern here the concern
 

10147
02:37:36,300 --> 02:37:37,910
I mean look the concern here the concern
the concern this concern has played out

10148
02:37:37,910 --> 02:37:37,920
the concern this concern has played out
 

10149
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:40,130
the concern this concern has played out
for for literally centuries um and you

10150
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:40,140
for for literally centuries um and you
 

10151
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:41,510
for for literally centuries um and you
know this is the sort of what I you know

10152
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:41,520
know this is the sort of what I you know
 

10153
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:43,309
know this is the sort of what I you know
the story of the ludd eyes

10154
02:37:43,309 --> 02:37:43,319
the story of the ludd eyes
 

10155
02:37:43,319 --> 02:37:44,630
the story of the ludd eyes
um that you may remember there was a

10156
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:44,640
um that you may remember there was a
 

10157
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:47,150
um that you may remember there was a
panic in the 2000s around uh Outsourcing

10158
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:47,160
panic in the 2000s around uh Outsourcing
 

10159
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:48,469
panic in the 2000s around uh Outsourcing
who's going to take all the jobs there

10160
02:37:48,469 --> 02:37:48,479
who's going to take all the jobs there
 

10161
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:51,050
who's going to take all the jobs there
was a panic in the 2010s that robots are

10162
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:51,060
was a panic in the 2010s that robots are
 

10163
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,849
was a panic in the 2010s that robots are
going to take all the jobs

10164
02:37:52,849 --> 02:37:52,859
going to take all the jobs
 

10165
02:37:52,859 --> 02:37:53,570
going to take all the jobs
um

10166
02:37:53,570 --> 02:37:53,580
um
 

10167
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:57,050
um
in 2019 before covid we had more jobs at

10168
02:37:57,050 --> 02:37:57,060
in 2019 before covid we had more jobs at
 

10169
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:58,730
in 2019 before covid we had more jobs at
higher wages both in the country and in

10170
02:37:58,730 --> 02:37:58,740
higher wages both in the country and in
 

10171
02:37:58,740 --> 02:37:59,750
higher wages both in the country and in
the world than at any point human

10172
02:37:59,750 --> 02:37:59,760
the world than at any point human
 

10173
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:02,389
the world than at any point human
history and so the overwhelming evidence

10174
02:38:02,389 --> 02:38:02,399
history and so the overwhelming evidence
 

10175
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:04,969
history and so the overwhelming evidence
is that the net gain here is like just

10176
02:38:04,969 --> 02:38:04,979
is that the net gain here is like just
 

10177
02:38:04,979 --> 02:38:07,309
is that the net gain here is like just
like wildly positive and most most

10178
02:38:07,309 --> 02:38:07,319
like wildly positive and most most
 

10179
02:38:07,319 --> 02:38:09,110
like wildly positive and most most
people like overwhelmingly come out the

10180
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,120
people like overwhelmingly come out the
 

10181
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,490
people like overwhelmingly come out the
other side being huge beneficiaries of

10182
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:10,500
other side being huge beneficiaries of
 

10183
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:13,250
other side being huge beneficiaries of
this so you write that the single

10184
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:13,260
this so you write that the single
 

10185
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:15,290
this so you write that the single
greatest risk this is the risk you're

10186
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,300
greatest risk this is the risk you're
 

10187
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:17,270
greatest risk this is the risk you're
most convinced by the single greatest

10188
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:17,280
most convinced by the single greatest
 

10189
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:20,030
most convinced by the single greatest
risk of AI is that China wins Global AI

10190
02:38:20,030 --> 02:38:20,040
risk of AI is that China wins Global AI
 

10191
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:22,370
risk of AI is that China wins Global AI
dominance and we the United States and

10192
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:22,380
dominance and we the United States and
 

10193
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:24,830
dominance and we the United States and
the West do not can you elaborate yeah

10194
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:24,840
the West do not can you elaborate yeah
 

10195
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:28,190
the West do not can you elaborate yeah
so this is the other thing which is a

10196
02:38:28,190 --> 02:38:28,200
so this is the other thing which is a
 

10197
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,630
so this is the other thing which is a
lot of the sort of AI risk debates today

10198
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:29,640
lot of the sort of AI risk debates today
 

10199
02:38:29,640 --> 02:38:30,770
lot of the sort of AI risk debates today
sort of assume that we're the only game

10200
02:38:30,770 --> 02:38:30,780
sort of assume that we're the only game
 

10201
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:32,570
sort of assume that we're the only game
in town right and so we have the ability

10202
02:38:32,570 --> 02:38:32,580
in town right and so we have the ability
 

10203
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:34,010
in town right and so we have the ability
to kind of sit in the United States and

10204
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:34,020
to kind of sit in the United States and
 

10205
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:35,630
to kind of sit in the United States and
criticize ourselves and you know have

10206
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:35,640
criticize ourselves and you know have
 

10207
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:37,010
criticize ourselves and you know have
our government like you know beat up on

10208
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:37,020
our government like you know beat up on
 

10209
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:38,330
our government like you know beat up on
our companies and figure out a way to

10210
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:38,340
our companies and figure out a way to
 

10211
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:39,650
our companies and figure out a way to
restrict what our companies can do and

10212
02:38:39,650 --> 02:38:39,660
restrict what our companies can do and
 

10213
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:40,790
restrict what our companies can do and
you know we're gonna you know we're

10214
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:40,800
you know we're gonna you know we're
 

10215
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:42,170
you know we're gonna you know we're
gonna ban this and ban that restrict

10216
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:42,180
gonna ban this and ban that restrict
 

10217
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,490
gonna ban this and ban that restrict
this and do that and then there's this

10218
02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:43,500
this and do that and then there's this
 

10219
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:45,110
this and do that and then there's this
like other like force out there that

10220
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:45,120
like other like force out there that
 

10221
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:46,670
like other like force out there that
like doesn't believe we have any power

10222
02:38:46,670 --> 02:38:46,680
like doesn't believe we have any power
 

10223
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:49,010
like doesn't believe we have any power
over them whatsoever and they have no

10224
02:38:49,010 --> 02:38:49,020
over them whatsoever and they have no
 

10225
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,510
over them whatsoever and they have no
desire to sign up for whatever rules we

desire to sign up for whatever rules we
 

10227
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:52,010
desire to sign up for whatever rules we
decide to put in place

10228
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:52,020
decide to put in place
 

10229
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:53,090
decide to put in place
um and they're going to do whatever it

10230

um and they're going to do whatever it
 

10231
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:54,110

going to do with AI and it is not what

10244
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:07,620
going to do with AI and it is not what
 

10245
02:39:07,620 --> 02:39:08,929
going to do with AI and it is not what
we have in mind

they've got their they've been laying
 

10311
02:40:03,479 --> 02:40:04,370
they've got their they've been laying
they've been laying networking

10312
02:40:04,370 --> 02:40:04,380
they've been laying networking
 

10313
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:05,750
they've been laying networking
infrastructure all over the world with

10314
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:05,760
infrastructure all over the world with
 

10315
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:07,490
infrastructure all over the world with
their 5G right work with their company

technological fabric all over the world
 

10323
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:13,730
technological fabric all over the world
and their plan is to roll out their

10324
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:13,740
and their plan is to roll out their
 

10325
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:15,650
and their plan is to roll out their
vision of AI on top of that and to have

10326
02:40:15,650 --> 02:40:15,660
vision of AI on top of that and to have
 

10327
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:17,030
vision of AI on top of that and to have
every other country be running their

10328
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:17,040
every other country be running their
 

10329
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,250
every other country be running their
version and then if you're a country

10330
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:19,260
version and then if you're a country
 

10331
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:21,469
version and then if you're a country
prone to you know authoritarianism

10332
02:40:21,469 --> 02:40:21,479
prone to you know authoritarianism
 

10333
02:40:21,479 --> 02:40:22,730
prone to you know authoritarianism
you're going to find this to be an

10334
02:40:22,730 --> 02:40:22,740
you're going to find this to be an
 

10335
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:23,690
you're going to find this to be an
incredible way to become more

10336
02:40:23,690 --> 02:40:23,700
incredible way to become more
 

10337
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:26,150
incredible way to become more
authoritarian uh if you're a country by

10338
02:40:26,150 --> 02:40:26,160
authoritarian uh if you're a country by
 

10339
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:27,410
authoritarian uh if you're a country by
the way not prone authoritarianism

10340
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:27,420
the way not prone authoritarianism
 

10341
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:28,250
the way not prone authoritarianism
you're going to have the Chinese

10342
02:40:28,250 --> 02:40:28,260
you're going to have the Chinese
 

10343
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:29,389
you're going to have the Chinese
Communist Party running your

10344
02:40:29,389 --> 02:40:29,399
Communist Party running your
 

10345
02:40:29,399 --> 02:40:30,889
Communist Party running your
infrastructure and having back doors

10346
02:40:30,889 --> 02:40:30,899
infrastructure and having back doors
 

10347
02:40:30,899 --> 02:40:34,309
infrastructure and having back doors
into it right which is also not good

10348
02:40:34,309 --> 02:40:34,319
into it right which is also not good
 

10349
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:36,050
into it right which is also not good
um what's your sense of where they stand

10350
02:40:36,050 --> 02:40:36,060
um what's your sense of where they stand
 

10351
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:39,230
um what's your sense of where they stand
in terms of the race towards super

10352
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:39,240
in terms of the race towards super
 

10353
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,790
in terms of the race towards super
intelligence as compared to the United

10354
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:40,800
intelligence as compared to the United
 

10355
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:42,469
intelligence as compared to the United
States yeah so good news is they're

10356
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
States yeah so good news is they're
 

10357
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:44,150
States yeah so good news is they're
behind but bad news is they you know

10358
02:40:44,150 --> 02:40:44,160
behind but bad news is they you know
 

10359
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:45,770
behind but bad news is they you know
they let's just say they get access to

10360
02:40:45,770 --> 02:40:45,780
they let's just say they get access to
 

10361
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:46,910
they let's just say they get access to
everything we do

10362
02:40:46,910 --> 02:40:46,920
everything we do
 

10363
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:48,830
everything we do
um so they're probably a year behind at

10364
02:40:48,830 --> 02:40:48,840
um so they're probably a year behind at
 

10365
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:50,450
um so they're probably a year behind at
each point in time but they get you know

10366
02:40:50,450 --> 02:40:50,460
each point in time but they get you know
 

10367
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:52,130
each point in time but they get you know
downloads I think of basically all of

10368
02:40:52,130 --> 02:40:52,140
downloads I think of basically all of
 

10369
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:53,929
downloads I think of basically all of
our work on a regular basis through a

10370
02:40:53,929 --> 02:40:53,939
our work on a regular basis through a
 

10371
02:40:53,939 --> 02:40:55,550
our work on a regular basis through a
variety of means

10372
02:40:55,550 --> 02:40:55,560
variety of means
 

10373
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:57,530
variety of means
um and they are you know we'll see

10374
02:40:57,530 --> 02:40:57,540
um and they are you know we'll see
 

10375
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:58,610
um and they are you know we'll see
they're at least putting out reports of

10376
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:58,620
they're at least putting out reports of
 

10377

10379
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:02,870
very just put out a report last week of
a gpg 3.5 analog

10380
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:02,880
a gpg 3.5 analog
 

10381
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:05,450
a gpg 3.5 analog
um they put out this report forget what

10382
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:05,460
um they put out this report forget what
 

10383
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:06,650
um they put out this report forget what
it's called but um they put out this

10384
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:06,660
it's called but um they put out this
 

10385
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:07,910
it's called but um they put out this
report of the cell and they did and they

10386
02:41:07,910 --> 02:41:07,920
report of the cell and they did and they
 

10387
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,710
report of the cell and they did and they
you know the way when openai you know

10388
02:41:09,710 --> 02:41:09,720
you know the way when openai you know
 

10389
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,510
you know the way when openai you know
puts out they they one of the ways they

10390
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:11,520
puts out they they one of the ways they
 

10391
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:14,150
puts out they they one of the ways they
test you know a GPT um is they they run

10392
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:14,160
test you know a GPT um is they they run
 

10393
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:15,530
test you know a GPT um is they they run
it through standardized exams like the

10394
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:15,540
it through standardized exams like the
 

10395
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:17,510
it through standardized exams like the
sat right just how you can kind of cage

10396
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:17,520
sat right just how you can kind of cage
 

10397
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,550
sat right just how you can kind of cage
how smart it is uh and so the Chinese

10398
02:41:19,550 --> 02:41:19,560
how smart it is uh and so the Chinese
 

10399
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:22,490
how smart it is uh and so the Chinese
report they ran their LM through uh the

10400
02:41:22,490 --> 02:41:22,500
report they ran their LM through uh the
 

10401
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,469
report they ran their LM through uh the
Chinese equivalent of the SAT

10402
02:41:24,469 --> 02:41:24,479
Chinese equivalent of the SAT
 

10403
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:27,530
Chinese equivalent of the SAT
um and it includes a section on Marxism

10404
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:27,540
um and it includes a section on Marxism
 

10405
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:29,990
um and it includes a section on Marxism
um and a section on Mouse thought and it

10406
02:41:29,990 --> 02:41:30,000
um and a section on Mouse thought and it
 

10407
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,370
um and a section on Mouse thought and it
turns out their AI does very well on

10408
02:41:31,370 --> 02:41:31,380
turns out their AI does very well on
 

10409
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:32,650
turns out their AI does very well on
both of those topics

10410
02:41:32,650 --> 02:41:32,660
both of those topics
 

10411
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:37,130
both of those topics
right so like uh this this alignment

10412
02:41:37,130 --> 02:41:37,140
right so like uh this this alignment
 

10413
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:39,349
right so like uh this this alignment
thing communist AI right like literal

10414
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,359

02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:09,660
that industry and you know the early
 

10501
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:11,630
that industry and you know the early
examples there were like uber and Lyft

10502
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:11,640
examples there were like uber and Lyft

um and then that model is kind of
 

10507
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:16,070
um and then that model is kind of
elaborating out

10508
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:16,080
elaborating out
 

10509

when you're a Founder you cannot let on
 

10655
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:33,950
when you're a Founder you cannot let on
that this is happening because it will

10656
02:45:33,950 --> 02:45:33,960
that this is happening because it will
 

10657
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:35,210
that this is happening because it will
cause people to think that you're weak

10658

and they'll lose faith in you yeah so

10660
02:45:37,010 --> 02:45:37,020
and they'll lose faith in you yeah so
 

10661
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:38,389
and they'll lose faith in you yeah so
you have to pretend that you're having a

10662
02:45:38,389 --> 02:45:38,399
you have to pretend that you're having a
 

10663
02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:40,370
you have to pretend that you're having a
great time when you're dying inside

10664
02:45:40,370 --> 02:45:40,380
great time when you're dying inside
 

10665
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:41,770
great time when you're dying inside
right

10666
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:41,780
right
 

10667
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:45,110
right
it's just a misery but why why do they

10668
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,120
it's just a misery but why why do they
 

10669
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,910
it's just a misery but why why do they
do it what do they do oh yeah that's the

10670
02:45:46,910 --> 02:45:46,920
do it what do they do oh yeah that's the
 

10671
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:48,650
do it what do they do oh yeah that's the
thing it's it's like it is a level it's

10672
02:45:48,650 --> 02:45:48,660
thing it's it's like it is a level it's
 

10673
02:45:48,660 --> 02:45:49,910
thing it's it's like it is a level it's
actually one of the conclusions I think

10674
02:45:49,910 --> 02:45:49,920
actually one of the conclusions I think
 

10675
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:51,710
actually one of the conclusions I think
is it I think it's actually for most of

10676
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:51,720
is it I think it's actually for most of
 

10677
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:53,090
is it I think it's actually for most of
these people on a risk adjusted basis

10678
02:45:53,090 --> 02:45:53,100
these people on a risk adjusted basis
 

10679
02:45:53,100 --> 02:45:55,070
these people on a risk adjusted basis
it's probably an irrational act they

10680
02:45:55,070 --> 02:45:55,080
it's probably an irrational act they
 

10681
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:56,030
it's probably an irrational act they
could probably be more financially

10682
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:56,040
could probably be more financially
 

10683
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:57,530
could probably be more financially
successful on average if they just got

10684
02:45:57,530 --> 02:45:57,540
successful on average if they just got
 

10685
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:59,809
successful on average if they just got
like a real job in a big company

people sometimes who say I want to start

10748
02:46:55,010 --> 02:46:55,020
people sometimes who say I want to start
 

10749
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:56,270
people sometimes who say I want to start
a company and then they kind of work

10750
02:46:56,270 --> 02:46:56,280
a company and then they kind of work
 

10751
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:57,590
a company and then they kind of work
through the process of coming up with an

10752
02:46:57,590 --> 02:46:57,600
through the process of coming up with an
 

10753
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:59,929
through the process of coming up with an
idea and generally those don't work as

10754
02:46:59,929 --> 02:46:59,939
idea and generally those don't work as
 

10755
02:46:59,939 --> 02:47:01,849
idea and generally those don't work as
well as the case where somebody has the

10756
02:47:01,849 --> 02:47:01,859
well as the case where somebody has the
 

10757
02:47:01,859 --> 02:47:04,010
well as the case where somebody has the
idea first and then they kind of realize

10758
02:47:04,010 --> 02:47:04,020
idea first and then they kind of realize
 

10759
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:05,510
idea first and then they kind of realize
that there's an opportunity to build a

10760
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:05,520
that there's an opportunity to build a
 

10761
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,590
that there's an opportunity to build a
company and then they just turn out to

10762
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:06,600
company and then they just turn out to
 

10763
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:07,910
company and then they just turn out to
be the right kind of person to do that

10764
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:07,920
be the right kind of person to do that
 

10765
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:10,309
be the right kind of person to do that
when you say idea do you mean yeah

10766
02:47:10,309 --> 02:47:10,319
when you say idea do you mean yeah
 

10767
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:12,770
when you say idea do you mean yeah
what long-term big Vision or do you mean

10768
02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:12,780
what long-term big Vision or do you mean
 

10769
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:15,770
what long-term big Vision or do you mean
specifics of like product specific let's

10770
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:15,780
specifics of like product specific let's
 

10771
02:47:15,780 --> 02:47:17,870
specifics of like product specific let's
say specific like specifically what yes

10772
02:47:17,870 --> 02:47:17,880
say specific like specifically what yes
 

10773
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:19,670
say specific like specifically what yes
specifics like what is because for the

10774
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:19,680
specifics like what is because for the
 

10775
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,750
specifics like what is because for the
first five years you don't get to have

10776
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:20,760
first five years you don't get to have
 

10777
02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:21,770
first five years you don't get to have
Vision you just got to build something

10778
02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:21,780
Vision you just got to build something
 

10779
02:47:21,780 --> 02:47:23,090
Vision you just got to build something
people want and you've got to figure out

10780
02:47:23,090 --> 02:47:23,100
people want and you've got to figure out
 

10781
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:24,650
people want and you've got to figure out
a way to sell it to them right it's very

10782
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:24,660
a way to sell it to them right it's very
 

10783
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:26,450
a way to sell it to them right it's very
practical or you never get to Big Vision

10784
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:26,460
practical or you never get to Big Vision
 

10785
02:47:26,460 --> 02:47:28,610
practical or you never get to Big Vision
so so the first the first part you have

10786
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:28,620
so so the first the first part you have
 

10787
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:30,349
so so the first the first part you have
an idea of a set of products or the

10788
02:47:30,349 --> 02:47:30,359
an idea of a set of products or the
 

10789
02:47:30,359 --> 02:47:31,490
an idea of a set of products or the
first product that can actually make

10790
02:47:31,490 --> 02:47:31,500
first product that can actually make
 

10791
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:32,990
first product that can actually make
some money yeah like it's got a first

10792
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,000
some money yeah like it's got a first
 

10793
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,429
some money yeah like it's got a first
product's got to work by which I mean

10794
02:47:34,429 --> 02:47:34,439
product's got to work by which I mean
 

10795
02:47:34,439 --> 02:47:35,809
product's got to work by which I mean
like it has to technically work but then

10796
02:47:35,809 --> 02:47:35,819
like it has to technically work but then
 

10797
02:47:35,819 --> 02:47:37,849
like it has to technically work but then
it has to actually fit into the category

10798
02:47:37,849 --> 02:47:37,859
it has to actually fit into the category
 

10799
02:47:37,859 --> 02:47:39,050
it has to actually fit into the category
in the customer's mind of something that

10800
02:47:39,050 --> 02:47:39,060
in the customer's mind of something that
 

10801
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:40,190
in the customer's mind of something that
they want and then and then by the way

10802
02:47:40,190 --> 02:47:40,200
they want and then and then by the way
 

10803
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:41,330
they want and then and then by the way
the other part is they have to want to

10804
02:47:41,330 --> 02:47:41,340
the other part is they have to want to
 

10805
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:42,590
the other part is they have to want to
pay for it like somebody's got to pay

10806
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:42,600
pay for it like somebody's got to pay
 

10807
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:44,270
pay for it like somebody's got to pay
the bills and so you've got to figure

10808
02:47:44,270 --> 02:47:44,280
the bills and so you've got to figure
 

10809
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,410
the bills and so you've got to figure
out how to price it and whether you can

10810
02:47:45,410 --> 02:47:45,420
out how to price it and whether you can
 

10811
02:47:45,420 --> 02:47:47,389
out how to price it and whether you can
actually extract the money yeah so

10812
02:47:47,389 --> 02:47:47,399
actually extract the money yeah so
 

10813
02:47:47,399 --> 02:47:51,309
actually extract the money yeah so
usually it is much more predictable

10814
02:47:51,309 --> 02:47:51,319
usually it is much more predictable
 

10815
02:47:51,319 --> 02:47:53,330
usually it is much more predictable
success is never predictable but it's

10816
02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:53,340
success is never predictable but it's
 

10817
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:54,710
success is never predictable but it's
more predictable if you start with a

10818
02:47:54,710 --> 02:47:54,720
more predictable if you start with a
 

10819
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:55,910
more predictable if you start with a
great idea and then back into starting

10820
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:55,920
great idea and then back into starting
 

10821
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:57,650
great idea and then back into starting
the company

10822
02:47:57,650 --> 02:47:57,660
the company
 

10823
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:58,790
the company
um so this is what we did you know

10824
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:58,800
um so this is what we did you know
 

10825
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:01,130
um so this is what we did you know
before we escape the Google guys had the

10826
02:48:01,130 --> 02:48:01,140
before we escape the Google guys had the
 

10827
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:02,990
before we escape the Google guys had the
Google search engine working at Stanford

10828
02:48:02,990 --> 02:48:03,000
Google search engine working at Stanford
 

10829
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,389
Google search engine working at Stanford
um right um the um uh you know yeah

10830
02:48:05,389 --> 02:48:05,399
um right um the um uh you know yeah
 

10831
02:48:05,399 --> 02:48:06,830
um right um the um uh you know yeah
actually there's tons of examples where

10832
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:06,840
actually there's tons of examples where
 

10833
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:08,570
actually there's tons of examples where
they you know uh Pierre omadir had eBay

10834
02:48:08,570 --> 02:48:08,580
they you know uh Pierre omadir had eBay
 

10835
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:10,490
they you know uh Pierre omadir had eBay
working before he left his previous job

10836
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:10,500
working before he left his previous job
 

10837
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:12,590
working before he left his previous job
so I really love that idea of just

10838
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:12,600
so I really love that idea of just
 

10839
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:14,450
so I really love that idea of just
having a thing a prototype that actually

10840
02:48:14,450 --> 02:48:14,460
having a thing a prototype that actually
 

10841
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:17,030
having a thing a prototype that actually
works before you even begin to remotely

10842
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:17,040
works before you even begin to remotely
 

10843
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:18,410
works before you even begin to remotely
scale yeah by the way it's also far

10844
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:18,420
scale yeah by the way it's also far
 

10845
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:20,090
scale yeah by the way it's also far
easier to raise money right like the

10846
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:20,100
easier to raise money right like the
 

10847
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:22,250
easier to raise money right like the
ideal pitch that we receive is here's

10848
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:22,260
ideal pitch that we receive is here's
 

10849
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:23,210
ideal pitch that we receive is here's
the thing that works would you like to

10850
02:48:23,210 --> 02:48:23,220
the thing that works would you like to
 

10851
02:48:23,220 --> 02:48:24,469
the thing that works would you like to
invest in our company or not like that's

10852
02:48:24,469 --> 02:48:24,479
invest in our company or not like that's
 

10853
02:48:24,479 --> 02:48:26,150
invest in our company or not like that's
so much easier than here's 30 slides

10854
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:26,160
so much easier than here's 30 slides
 

10855
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:28,490
so much easier than here's 30 slides
with a dream right

10856
02:48:28,490 --> 02:48:28,500
with a dream right
 

10857
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:30,590
with a dream right
um and then we have this concept called

10858
02:48:30,590 --> 02:48:30,600
um and then we have this concept called
 

10859
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:32,990
um and then we have this concept called
the dmas which are apology Serena Boston

10860
02:48:32,990 --> 02:48:33,000
the dmas which are apology Serena Boston
 

10861
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,969
the dmas which are apology Serena Boston
came up with um when he was with us um

10862
02:48:34,969 --> 02:48:34,979
came up with um when he was with us um
 

10863
02:48:34,979 --> 02:48:37,250
came up with um when he was with us um
so so so then there's this thing this

10864
02:48:37,250 --> 02:48:37,260
so so so then there's this thing this
 

10865
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:39,230
so so so then there's this thing this
goes to mythology which is um you know

10866
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:39,240
goes to mythology which is um you know
 

10867
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,790
goes to mythology which is um you know
there's a mythology of that kind of you

10868
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:40,800
there's a mythology of that kind of you
 

10869
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:42,110
there's a mythology of that kind of you
know these these ideas

10870

um the reality usually with the big
 

10881
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:52,010
um the reality usually with the big
successes is that the founder has been

successes is that the founder has been
 

10883
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:54,050
successes is that the founder has been
chewing on the problem for five or ten

10884
02:48:54,050 --> 02:48:54,060
chewing on the problem for five or ten
 

10885
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:56,210
chewing on the problem for five or ten
years before they start the company and

10886
02:48:56,210 --> 02:48:56,220
years before they start the company and
 

10887
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:59,030
years before they start the company and
they often worked on it in school

10888
02:48:59,030 --> 02:48:59,040
they often worked on it in school
 

10889
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:00,530
they often worked on it in school
um or they even experimented on it when

10890
02:49:00,530 --> 02:49:00,540
um or they even experimented on it when
 

10891
02:49:00,540 --> 02:49:01,730
um or they even experimented on it when
they were a kid

10892

they were a kid
 

10893
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:03,230
they were a kid
um and they've been kind of training up

10894
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:03,240
um and they've been kind of training up
 

10895
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:04,550
um and they've been kind of training up
over that period of time to be able to

10896
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:04,560
over that period of time to be able to
 

10897
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:06,170
over that period of time to be able to
do the thing so they're like a true

domain expert
 

10901
02:49:07,500 --> 02:49:09,530
domain expert
and and it's it sort of sounds like Mom

10902
02:49:09,530 --> 02:49:09,540
and and it's it sort of sounds like Mom

10905
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:11,870
and apple pie which is yeah you want to
be a domain expert what you're doing but

10906
02:49:11,870 --> 02:49:11,880
be a domain expert what you're doing but
 

10907
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:14,090
be a domain expert what you're doing but
you would you know the mythology is so

10908
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:14,100
you would you know the mythology is so
 

10909
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:15,410
you would you know the mythology is so
strong of like oh I just like had this

10910
02:49:15,410 --> 02:49:15,420
strong of like oh I just like had this
 

10911
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:16,550
strong of like oh I just like had this
idea in the shower and now I'm doing it

10912
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:16,560
idea in the shower and now I'm doing it
 

10913
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:19,070
idea in the shower and now I'm doing it
like it's generally not that no because

10914
02:49:19,070 --> 02:49:19,080
like it's generally not that no because
 

10915
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:21,770
like it's generally not that no because
well maybe in the shower we had the

10916
02:49:21,770 --> 02:49:21,780
well maybe in the shower we had the
 

10917
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:23,030
well maybe in the shower we had the
exact

10918
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,040
exact
 

10919
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:27,050
exact
product implementation details but yeah

10920
02:49:27,050 --> 02:49:27,060
product implementation details but yeah
 

10921
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:28,550
product implementation details but yeah
usually you're going to be for like

10922
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:28,560
usually you're going to be for like
 

10923
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:32,150
usually you're going to be for like
years if not decades thinking about

10924
02:49:32,150 --> 02:49:32,160
years if not decades thinking about
 

10925
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,830
years if not decades thinking about
like

10926
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:33,840
like
 

10927
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:36,230
like
everything around that well we call it

10928
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:36,240
everything around that well we call it
 

10929
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,210
everything around that well we call it
the idea Mas because the idma is

10930
02:49:38,210 --> 02:49:38,220
the idea Mas because the idma is
 

10931
02:49:38,220 --> 02:49:39,710
the idea Mas because the idma is
basically is like there's all these

10932
02:49:39,710 --> 02:49:39,720
basically is like there's all these
 

10933
02:49:39,720 --> 02:49:41,450
basically is like there's all these
permutations like for any ID for any

10934
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:41,460
permutations like for any ID for any
 

10935
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:42,530
permutations like for any ID for any
idea there's like all these different

10936
02:49:42,530 --> 02:49:42,540
idea there's like all these different
 

10937
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:44,030
idea there's like all these different
permutations who should the customer be

10938
02:49:44,030 --> 02:49:44,040
permutations who should the customer be
 

10939
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:45,770
permutations who should the customer be
what shape forms the product have and

10940
02:49:45,770 --> 02:49:45,780
what shape forms the product have and
 

10941
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:46,910
what shape forms the product have and
how should we take it to Market and all

10942
02:49:46,910 --> 02:49:46,920
how should we take it to Market and all
 

10943
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:48,410
how should we take it to Market and all
these things

10944
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:48,420
these things
 

10945
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:50,990
these things
um and so um the really smart Founders

10946
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:51,000
um and so um the really smart Founders
 

10947
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,250
um and so um the really smart Founders
have thought through all these scenarios

10948
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:52,260
have thought through all these scenarios
 

10949
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:54,469
have thought through all these scenarios
by the time they go out to raise money

10950
02:49:54,469 --> 02:49:54,479
by the time they go out to raise money
 

10951
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:56,270
by the time they go out to raise money
um and they have like detailed answers

10952
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:56,280
um and they have like detailed answers
 

10953
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:58,070
um and they have like detailed answers
on every one of those fronts because

10954
02:49:58,070 --> 02:49:58,080
on every one of those fronts because
 

10955
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:00,349
on every one of those fronts because
they put so much thought into it

10956
02:50:00,349 --> 02:50:00,359
they put so much thought into it
 

10957
02:50:00,359 --> 02:50:02,510
they put so much thought into it
um the sort of the the sort of more

10958
02:50:02,510 --> 02:50:02,520
um the sort of the the sort of more
 

10959
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:04,130
um the sort of the the sort of more
haphazard Founders haven't thought about

10960
02:50:04,130 --> 02:50:04,140
haphazard Founders haven't thought about
 

10961
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:05,929
haphazard Founders haven't thought about
any of that and it's the detailed ones

10962
02:50:05,929 --> 02:50:05,939
any of that and it's the detailed ones
 

10963
02:50:05,939 --> 02:50:07,730
any of that and it's the detailed ones
who tend to do much better so how do you

10964
02:50:07,730 --> 02:50:07,740
who tend to do much better so how do you
 

10965
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:09,590
who tend to do much better so how do you
know when to take a leap if you have a

10966
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:09,600
know when to take a leap if you have a
 

10967
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:11,990
know when to take a leap if you have a
cushy job or a happy life

10968
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:12,000
cushy job or a happy life
 

10969
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,429
cushy job or a happy life
I mean the best reason is just because

10970
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
I mean the best reason is just because
 

10971
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:14,990
I mean the best reason is just because
you can't tolerate not doing it right

10972
02:50:14,990 --> 02:50:15,000
you can't tolerate not doing it right
 

10973
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:16,309
you can't tolerate not doing it right
like this is the kind of thing where if

10974
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,319
like this is the kind of thing where if
 

10975
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:17,630
like this is the kind of thing where if
you have to be advised into doing it you

10976
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:17,640
you have to be advised into doing it you
 

10977
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:19,130
you have to be advised into doing it you
probably shouldn't do it

10978
02:50:19,130 --> 02:50:19,140
probably shouldn't do it
 

10979
02:50:19,140 --> 02:50:20,510
probably shouldn't do it
um and so it's probably the opposite

10980
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:20,520
um and so it's probably the opposite
 

10981
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,190
um and so it's probably the opposite
which is you just have such a burning

10982
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:22,200
which is you just have such a burning
 

10983
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:23,750
which is you just have such a burning
sense of this has to be done I have to

10984
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:23,760
sense of this has to be done I have to
 

10985
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:25,610
sense of this has to be done I have to
do this I have no choice what if it's

10986
02:50:25,610 --> 02:50:25,620
do this I have no choice what if it's
 

10987
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:27,110
do this I have no choice what if it's
going to lead to a lot of pain it's

10988
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:27,120
going to lead to a lot of pain it's
 

10989
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:29,389
going to lead to a lot of pain it's
going to lead to a lot of pain

10990
02:50:29,389 --> 02:50:29,399
going to lead to a lot of pain
 

10991
02:50:29,399 --> 02:50:31,429
going to lead to a lot of pain
I think that's what if it means uh

10992
02:50:31,429 --> 02:50:31,439
I think that's what if it means uh
 

10993
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:33,830
I think that's what if it means uh
losing sort of social relationships and

10994
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:33,840
losing sort of social relationships and
 

10995
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:35,990
losing sort of social relationships and
damaging your

10996
02:50:35,990 --> 02:50:36,000
damaging your
 

10997
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,670
damaging your
um relationship with loved ones and all

October 2022 I quote mostly I try to

11082
02:51:48,590 --> 02:51:48,600
October 2022 I quote mostly I try to
 

11083
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,790
October 2022 I quote mostly I try to
learn a lot

11084
02:51:49,790 --> 02:51:49,800
learn a lot
 

11085
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:52,070
learn a lot
for example the political events of 2014

11086
02:51:52,070 --> 02:51:52,080
for example the political events of 2014
 

11087
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:54,349
for example the political events of 2014
to 2016 made clear to me that I didn't

11088
02:51:54,349 --> 02:51:54,359
to 2016 made clear to me that I didn't
 

11089
02:51:54,359 --> 02:51:56,570
to 2016 made clear to me that I didn't
understand politics at all referencing

11090
02:51:56,570 --> 02:51:56,580
understand politics at all referencing
 

11091
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:59,510
understand politics at all referencing
maybe some of this this book here

11092
02:51:59,510 --> 02:51:59,520
maybe some of this this book here
 

11093
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:01,429
maybe some of this this book here
um so I deliberately withdrew from

11094
02:52:01,429 --> 02:52:01,439
um so I deliberately withdrew from
 

11095
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:03,349
um so I deliberately withdrew from
political engagement and fundraising and

11096
02:52:03,349 --> 02:52:03,359
political engagement and fundraising and
 

11097
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:06,010
political engagement and fundraising and
instead read my way back into history

11098
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,020
instead read my way back into history
 

11099
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:08,630
instead read my way back into history
and as far to the political left and

11100
02:52:08,630 --> 02:52:08,640
and as far to the political left and
 

11101
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:11,389
and as far to the political left and
political right as I could so just high

11102
02:52:11,389 --> 02:52:11,399
political right as I could so just high
 

11103
02:52:11,399 --> 02:52:13,130
political right as I could so just high
level question what's your approach to

11104
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:13,140
level question what's your approach to
 

11105
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:14,630
level question what's your approach to
learning

11106
02:52:14,630 --> 02:52:14,640
learning
 

11107
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,610
learning
yeah so it's basically I would say it's

11108
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:16,620
yeah so it's basically I would say it's
 

11109
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:18,590
yeah so it's basically I would say it's
it's an Auto Direct

11110
02:52:18,590 --> 02:52:18,600
it's an Auto Direct
 

11111
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:20,510
it's an Auto Direct
um uh so it's sort of goes it's going

11112
02:52:20,510 --> 02:52:20,520
um uh so it's sort of goes it's going
 

11113
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:22,730
um uh so it's sort of goes it's going
down the rabbit holes so it's a

11114
02:52:22,730 --> 02:52:22,740
down the rabbit holes so it's a
 

11115
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:24,050
down the rabbit holes so it's a
combination let's say I kind of allude

11116
02:52:24,050 --> 02:52:24,060
combination let's say I kind of allude
 

11117
02:52:24,060 --> 02:52:25,550
combination let's say I kind of allude
to it in that quote It's a combination

11118
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:25,560
to it in that quote It's a combination
 

11119
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:27,469
to it in that quote It's a combination
of breadth and depth

11120
02:52:27,469 --> 02:52:27,479
of breadth and depth
 

11121
02:52:27,479 --> 02:52:29,750
of breadth and depth
um and so I tend to yeah I tend to I go

11122
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:29,760
um and so I tend to yeah I tend to I go
 

11123
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:30,950
um and so I tend to yeah I tend to I go
abroad by the nature of what I do I go

11124
02:52:30,950 --> 02:52:30,960
abroad by the nature of what I do I go
 

11125
02:52:30,960 --> 02:52:32,510
abroad by the nature of what I do I go
broad but then I tend to go deep in a

11126
02:52:32,510 --> 02:52:32,520
broad but then I tend to go deep in a
 

11127
02:52:32,520 --> 02:52:33,650
broad but then I tend to go deep in a
rabbit hole for a while read everything

11128
02:52:33,650 --> 02:52:33,660
rabbit hole for a while read everything
 

11129
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:35,210
rabbit hole for a while read everything
I can and then come out of it and I

11130
02:52:35,210 --> 02:52:35,220
I can and then come out of it and I
 

11131
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:36,650
I can and then come out of it and I
might I might not revisit that rabbit

11239
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:30,769
can download it or you can buy print out
prints of it but um it's uh it was this

11240
02:54:30,769 --> 02:54:30,779
prints of it but um it's uh it was this
 

11241
02:54:30,779 --> 02:54:32,330
prints of it but um it's uh it was this
guy who was a professor at the sorbond

11242
02:54:32,330 --> 02:54:32,340
guy who was a professor at the sorbond
 

11243
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:34,670
guy who was a professor at the sorbond
in the 1860s and he was apparently a

11244
02:54:34,670 --> 02:54:34,680
in the 1860s and he was apparently a
 

11245
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:37,490
in the 1860s and he was apparently a
savant on uh Antiquity on Greek and

11246
02:54:37,490 --> 02:54:37,500
savant on uh Antiquity on Greek and
 

11247
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:40,130
savant on uh Antiquity on Greek and
Roman Antiquity um and the reason I say

11248
02:54:40,130 --> 02:54:40,140
Roman Antiquity um and the reason I say
 

11249
02:54:40,140 --> 02:54:41,510
Roman Antiquity um and the reason I say
that is because his sources are 100

11250
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
that is because his sources are 100
 

11251
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:44,389
that is because his sources are 100
original Greek and Roman sources so he

11252
02:54:44,389 --> 02:54:44,399
original Greek and Roman sources so he
 

11253
02:54:44,399 --> 02:54:46,130
original Greek and Roman sources so he
wrote a basically a history of Western

11254

back to our AI discussion we we we then
 

11453
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:02,809
back to our AI discussion we we we then
sort of endlessly create new calls like

11454

I think there I mean look I think Elon

11934
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:28,020
I think there I mean look I think Elon
 

11935
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:29,150
I think there I mean look I think Elon
is I don't think I'm even a great

11936
03:05:29,150 --> 03:05:29,160
is I don't think I'm even a great
 

11937
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:30,230
is I don't think I'm even a great
example but I think Elon would be the

11938
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:30,240
example but I think Elon would be the
 

11939
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:31,429
example but I think Elon would be the
great example of this which is like you

11940
03:05:31,429 --> 03:05:31,439
great example of this which is like you
 

11941
03:05:31,439 --> 03:05:32,929
great example of this which is like you
know look he's a guy who from every

11942
03:05:32,929 --> 03:05:32,939
know look he's a guy who from every
 

11943
03:05:32,939 --> 03:05:34,309
know look he's a guy who from every
every day of his life from the day he

11944
03:05:34,309 --> 03:05:34,319
every day of his life from the day he
 

11945
03:05:34,319 --> 03:05:35,450
every day of his life from the day he
started making money at all he just

11946
03:05:35,450 --> 03:05:35,460
started making money at all he just
 

11947
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:38,090
started making money at all he just
plows into the into the next thing

11948
03:05:38,090 --> 03:05:38,100
plows into the into the next thing
 

11949
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:39,769
plows into the into the next thing
um and so I think I think money is

11950
03:05:39,769 --> 03:05:39,779
um and so I think I think money is
 

11951
03:05:39,779 --> 03:05:41,330
um and so I think I think money is
definitely an enabler for satisfaction

11952
03:05:41,330 --> 03:05:41,340
definitely an enabler for satisfaction
 

11953
