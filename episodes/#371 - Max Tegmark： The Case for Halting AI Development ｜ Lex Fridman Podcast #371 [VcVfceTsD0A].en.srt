00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,990
maybe the rest of cosmic history in our

empty benches but I I do think

220
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
empty benches but I I do think
 

221
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,330
empty benches but I I do think
that we are actually very likely to get

222
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,340
that we are actually very likely to get
 

223
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,890
that we are actually very likely to get
visited by aliens

224
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:30,900
visited by aliens
 

225
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,590
visited by aliens
alien intelligence quite soon but I

226
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
alien intelligence quite soon but I
 

227
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,850
alien intelligence quite soon but I
think we are going to be building that

228
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:34,860
think we are going to be building that
 

229
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,650

alien intelligence
 

231
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,909
alien intelligence
so

232
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
so
 

233
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,490
so
uh we're going to give birth

234
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:40,500
uh we're going to give birth
 

235
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,030
uh we're going to give birth
to an intelligent alien civilization

236
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
to an intelligent alien civilization
 

237
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,749
to an intelligent alien civilization
unlike anything that human the evolution

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,249
here on Earth was able to create in

00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:52,259
terms of the path the biological path it
 

243
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,010
terms of the path the biological path it
took yeah and it's gonna be much more

244
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,020
took yeah and it's gonna be much more
 

245
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,230
took yeah and it's gonna be much more
alien than

246
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
alien than
 

247
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,249
alien than
cats or even the most exotic animal on

00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
um any of those things
 

261
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,870
um any of those things
the space of alien Minds is just that

262
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:17,880
the space of alien Minds is just that
 

263
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,670
the space of alien Minds is just that
you can build it's just so much faster

264
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
you can build it's just so much faster
 

265
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,890
you can build it's just so much faster
than what evolution will give you

266
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:21,900
than what evolution will give you
 

267
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,110
than what evolution will give you
and with that also comes great

268
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,120
and with that also comes great
 

269
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,629
and with that also comes great
responsibility but the the for us to

270
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
responsibility but the the for us to
 

271
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,890
responsibility but the the for us to
make sure that the kind of Minds we

272
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
make sure that the kind of Minds we
 

273
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,010
make sure that the kind of Minds we
create are those kind of Minds that um

274
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,020
create are those kind of Minds that um
 

275
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,270
create are those kind of Minds that um
it's good to create Minds that will uh

276
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
it's good to create Minds that will uh
 

277
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,150
it's good to create Minds that will uh
share our values and and be good for

thing which is so obvious though it's I
 

371
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,330
thing which is so obvious though it's I
think is just really worth reflecting on

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
think is just really worth reflecting on
 

373
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,689
think is just really worth reflecting on
is because the mind space of possible

374
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:41,699
is because the mind space of possible
 

375
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,809
is because the mind space of possible
intelligence is so different from ours

377
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,370
intelligence is so different from ours
it's very dangerous if we assume they're

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,380
it's very dangerous if we assume they're
 

379
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,249
it's very dangerous if we assume they're
going to be like us or anything like us

going to be like us or anything like us
 

381

uh try and describe the Human Condition
and what's entailed in it like just like

392
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
and what's entailed in it like just like
 

393
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,290
and what's entailed in it like just like
you said fear of death and all those

394
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,300
you said fear of death and all those

kinds of things what is love and all of
that changes yeah if you have a

398
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,160
that changes yeah if you have a
 

399
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,710
that changes yeah if you have a
different kind of intelligence yeah like

400
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
different kind of intelligence yeah like
 

401
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,350
different kind of intelligence yeah like
all of it the entirety all those poems

402
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
all of it the entirety all those poems

changes how AI concerns and uh

408
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:23,479
changes how AI concerns and uh
 

409
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,210
changes how AI concerns and uh
existential crises that AI experiences

410
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,220
existential crises that AI experiences
 

411
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,790
existential crises that AI experiences
how that clashes with the human

412
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
how that clashes with the human

yeah that's hard to hard to Fathom how
 

417
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,050
yeah that's hard to hard to Fathom how
to predict it's hard but it's

418
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,060
to predict it's hard but it's
 

419
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,469
to predict it's hard but it's
fascinating to think about also even in

420
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
fascinating to think about also even in
 

421
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,029
fascinating to think about also even in
the best case scenario where we don't

422
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
the best case scenario where we don't
 

423
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,250
the best case scenario where we don't
lose control of over the ever more

424
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,260
lose control of over the ever more

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,389
other humans whose goals we think are
horrible and where we don't lose control

430
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
horrible and where we don't lose control

to the machines
 

433
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,350
to the machines
and AI

434
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,360
and AI
 

435
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,050
and AI
provides the things we want even then

436
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,060
provides the things we want even then
 

437

you get into the questions do you

438
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,160
you get into the questions do you
 

439
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,250
you get into the questions do you
touched here you know maybe it's the

440
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,260
touched here you know maybe it's the
 

441
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,530
touched here you know maybe it's the
struggle that it's actually hard to do

442
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:03,540
struggle that it's actually hard to do
 

443
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,090
struggle that it's actually hard to do
things is part of the things that gives

459
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,449
daughter and she asks gpt4 to write it
it was freaking 200 words or so if I

460
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:29,459
it was freaking 200 words or so if I
 

461
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,430
it was freaking 200 words or so if I
realized that my parents couldn't be

realized that my parents couldn't be
 

463
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,990

bothered struggling a little bit to

464
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,000
bothered struggling a little bit to
 

465
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,829
bothered struggling a little bit to
write

466
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
write
 

467
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,230
write
200 words and Outsource that to their

468
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
200 words and Outsource that to their
 

469
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,389
200 words and Outsource that to their
computer I would feel really offended

470
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
computer I would feel really offended
 

471
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,949
computer I would feel really offended
actually

472
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:39,959
actually
 

473
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,670
actually
and so I wonder if um eliminating too

474
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
and so I wonder if um eliminating too
 

475
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,269
and so I wonder if um eliminating too

what
do you think that would also take away a

480
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
do you think that would also take away a
 

481
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,430
do you think that would also take away a
little bit of

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,440
little bit of
 

483
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,750
little bit of
what it means to be human yeah

484
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
what it means to be human yeah
 

485
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,670
what it means to be human yeah

rewrite it in a nicer way to get the
 

503
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,250
rewrite it in a nicer way to get the

point across but we write in a nicer way
 

505
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,030

so we're even removing the inner

506
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
so we're even removing the inner
 

507
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,850
so we're even removing the inner
from our communication so I don't you

508
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:28,860
from our communication so I don't you
 

509
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,730
from our communication so I don't you
know there's some positive

510
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:30,740
know there's some positive
 

511
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,650
know there's some positive
aspects of that but mostly it's just the

512
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:33,660
aspects of that but mostly it's just the
 

513
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,509
aspects of that but mostly it's just the
transformation of how humans communicate

514
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
transformation of how humans communicate
 

515
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,509
transformation of how humans communicate
and it's scary because so much of our

516
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:40,519
and it's scary because so much of our
 

517
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,430
and it's scary because so much of our
society is based on this glue of

518
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
society is based on this glue of
 

519
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,949
society is based on this glue of
communication and if that we're now

520
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:45,959
communication and if that we're now
 

521
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,350
communication and if that we're now
using AI as the medium of communication

522
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,360
using AI as the medium of communication
 

523
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,970
using AI as the medium of communication
that that does the language for us uh so

524
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:52,980
that that does the language for us uh so
 

525
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,650
that that does the language for us uh so
much of the emotion that's Laden in

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
outsourced AI how does that change
 

535
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,230
outsourced AI how does that change
everything how how does it change the

to go back and and really work on myself
 

571
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,250
to go back and and really work on myself
rather than just tell an AI just from

572
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,260
rather than just tell an AI just from
 

573
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,590
rather than just tell an AI just from
now on always filter what I write so I

574
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
now on always filter what I write so I
 

575
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,750
now on always filter what I write so I
don't have to work on myself because

576
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
don't have to work on myself because
 

577
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,110
don't have to work on myself because
then I'm not growing

578
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
then I'm not growing
 

579
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,150
then I'm not growing
yeah but then again it could be like

580
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,160
yeah but then again it could be like
 

581
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,550
yeah but then again it could be like
with chess and AI

582
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,560
with chess and AI
 

583
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,670
with chess and AI
wants it significantly obviously

584
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:04,680
wants it significantly obviously
 

585
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,130
wants it significantly obviously
supersedes the performance of humans it

586
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:07,140
supersedes the performance of humans it
 

587
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,530
supersedes the performance of humans it
will live in its own world and provide

588
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:09,540
will live in its own world and provide
 

589
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,230
will live in its own world and provide
maybe a uh flourishing Civilizations for

590
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
maybe a uh flourishing Civilizations for
 

591
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,730
maybe a uh flourishing Civilizations for
humans but we humans will continue

592
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:13,740
humans but we humans will continue
 

593
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,130
humans but we humans will continue
hiking mountains and playing our games

594
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
hiking mountains and playing our games
 

595
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,530
hiking mountains and playing our games
even though AI is so much smarter so

596
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:18,540
even though AI is so much smarter so
 

597
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,269
even though AI is so much smarter so
much stronger so much Superior in every

598
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:20,279
much stronger so much Superior in every
 

599
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,269
much stronger so much Superior in every
single way just like with chess yeah so

600
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
single way just like with chess yeah so
 

601
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,190
single way just like with chess yeah so
that that I mean that's one possible

602
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
that that I mean that's one possible
 

603
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,410
that that I mean that's one possible
hopeful trajectory here is that humans

604
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,420
hopeful trajectory here is that humans
 

605
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,170
hopeful trajectory here is that humans
will continue to Human

606
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,180
will continue to Human
 

607
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,230
will continue to Human
uh and AI will just be a

608
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
uh and AI will just be a
 

609
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,190
uh and AI will just be a
kind of

610
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200

 

611
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,790

a a medium that enables The Human

612
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:43,800
a a medium that enables The Human
 

613
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,990
a a medium that enables The Human
Experience to flourish yeah

614
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
Experience to flourish yeah
 

615
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,090
Experience to flourish yeah
I would phrase that as rebranding

616
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,100
I would phrase that as rebranding
 

617
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,550
I would phrase that as rebranding
ourselves from Homo sapiens to homo

618
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
ourselves from Homo sapiens to homo
 

619
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,710
ourselves from Homo sapiens to homo
sentience you know right now with

620
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
sentience you know right now with
 

621
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,550
sentience you know right now with
sapiens the ability to be intelligent

622
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:57,560
sapiens the ability to be intelligent
 

623
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,150
sapiens the ability to be intelligent
we've even put it in our species name

624
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,160
we've even put it in our species name
 

625
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,610
we've even put it in our species name
we're branding ourselves as the smartest

626
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:04,620
we're branding ourselves as the smartest
 

627
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,949
we're branding ourselves as the smartest
yeah information processing

628
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
yeah information processing
 

629
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,350
yeah information processing
entity on the planet that's clearly

630
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
entity on the planet that's clearly
 

631
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,129
entity on the planet that's clearly
gonna

632
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:10,139
gonna
 

633
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,030
gonna
change if AI continues ahead

634
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,040
change if AI continues ahead
 

635
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,590
change if AI continues ahead
so maybe we should focus on the

636
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
so maybe we should focus on the
 

637
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,150
so maybe we should focus on the
experience instead the subjective

638
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,160
experience instead the subjective
 

639
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,250
experience instead the subjective
experience that we have with

640
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,260
experience that we have with
 

641
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,129
experience that we have with
homo sentience and and so that's what's

642
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:22,139
homo sentience and and so that's what's
 

643
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,230
homo sentience and and so that's what's
really valuable the love the connection

644
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
really valuable the love the connection
 

645
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,829
really valuable the love the connection
the other things

646
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839

 

647

that feels like a hopeful direction to
 

663
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,610
that feels like a hopeful direction to
me but that also requires more

treating a lot of farm animals horribly
 

677

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:04,680
for example and the excuse we're using
 

679
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,590
for example and the excuse we're using
is oh they're not as smart as us

is oh they're not as smart as us
 

681
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,590
is oh they're not as smart as us
but if we get that we're not that smart

682
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
but if we get that we're not that smart
 

683

then surely we should value

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
allow me to briefly look at the book
 

695
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,730
allow me to briefly look at the book
which at this point is becoming more and

which at this point is becoming more and
 

697
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,530
which at this point is becoming more and
more Visionary that you've written I

698

guess over five years ago life 3.0

700
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,420
guess over five years ago life 3.0
 

701
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,250
guess over five years ago life 3.0
so first of all 3.0 what's 1.0 what's

702
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,260
so first of all 3.0 what's 1.0 what's
 

703
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,850
so first of all 3.0 what's 1.0 what's
2.0 was 3.0 and how's that Vision sort

704
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:37,860
2.0 was 3.0 and how's that Vision sort
 

705
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,370
2.0 was 3.0 and how's that Vision sort
of evolve the vision in the book evolved

706
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,380
of evolve the vision in the book evolved
 

707
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,509
of evolve the vision in the book evolved
to today life 1.0 is really dumb like

708
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:44,519
to today life 1.0 is really dumb like
 

709
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,009
to today life 1.0 is really dumb like
bacteria and that it can't actually

710
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:46,019
bacteria and that it can't actually
 

711
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,449
bacteria and that it can't actually
learn anything at all during the

712
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:47,459
learn anything at all during the
 

713
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,189
learn anything at all during the
lifetime the learning just comes from

714
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
lifetime the learning just comes from
 

715
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,250
lifetime the learning just comes from
this genetic

716
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,260
this genetic
 

717
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,550
this genetic
process from one generation to the next

718
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
process from one generation to the next
 

719
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,509

Life 2.0 Is Us and other animals which

720
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
Life 2.0 Is Us and other animals which
 

721
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,930
Life 2.0 Is Us and other animals which
have brains which can learn during their

have brains which can learn during their
 

723
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,769
have brains which can learn during their
lifetime a great deal right so

724
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:06,779

 

725
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,370

and um you know you were born without

726
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:10,380
and um you know you were born without
 

727
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,650
and um you know you were born without
being able to speak English and at some

728
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:12,660
being able to speak English and at some
 

729
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,269
being able to speak English and at some
point you decided hey I want to upgrade

730
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:14,279
point you decided hey I want to upgrade
 

731
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,129
point you decided hey I want to upgrade
my software let's install an

732
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:16,139
my software let's install an
 

733
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,350
my software let's install an
English-speaking module

734
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:18,360
English-speaking module
 

735
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,090
English-speaking module
so you did

736
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,100
so you did
 

737
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,290
so you did
and life 3.0 does not exist yet can

738
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
and life 3.0 does not exist yet can
 

739
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,509
and life 3.0 does not exist yet can
cannot replace not only its software the

740
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:26,519
cannot replace not only its software the
 

741
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,449
cannot replace not only its software the
way we can but also it's Hardware

742
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:29,459
way we can but also it's Hardware
 

743
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,090
way we can but also it's Hardware
and um that's where we're heading

744
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,100
and um that's where we're heading
 

745
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,889
and um that's where we're heading
towards at high speed we're already

746
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:33,899
towards at high speed we're already
 

747
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,230
towards at high speed we're already
maybe 2.1 because we can you know put in

748
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
maybe 2.1 because we can you know put in
 

749
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,310
maybe 2.1 because we can you know put in
a

750
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,320
a
 

751
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,930
a
an artificial knee uh pacemaker

752
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:41,940
an artificial knee uh pacemaker
 

753
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,389
an artificial knee uh pacemaker
etc etc and if newer Link in other

754
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
etc etc and if newer Link in other
 

755
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,829
etc etc and if newer Link in other
companies succeed will be like 2.2 Etc

756
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:48,839
companies succeed will be like 2.2 Etc
 

757
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,470
companies succeed will be like 2.2 Etc
but uh well the Company's trying to

758
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:51,480
but uh well the Company's trying to
 

759
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,509
but uh well the Company's trying to
build AGI are trying to make is of

760
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
build AGI are trying to make is of
 

761
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,430
build AGI are trying to make is of
course full 3.0 and you can put that

762
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
course full 3.0 and you can put that
 

763
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,110
course full 3.0 and you can put that
intelligence into something that also

764
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
intelligence into something that also
 

765
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,550
intelligence into something that also
has no

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560

 

767
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,230

biological basis whatsoever so let's

768
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,240
biological basis whatsoever so let's
 

769
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,689

constraints and more capabilities just
 

771
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,230
constraints and more capabilities just
like the leap from 1.0 to 2.0 there is

772
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,240
like the leap from 1.0 to 2.0 there is
 

773
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,449
like the leap from 1.0 to 2.0 there is

about bacteria so disrespectfully about
 

777
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,710
about bacteria so disrespectfully about
bacteria there is still the same kind of

bacteria there is still the same kind of
 

779
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,110
bacteria there is still the same kind of
magic there

780
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,120
magic there
 

781
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,610
magic there
that permeates Life 2.0 and uh and 3.0

782
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:22,620
that permeates Life 2.0 and uh and 3.0
 

783
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,769
that permeates Life 2.0 and uh and 3.0
it seems like maybe the thing that's

784
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:24,779
it seems like maybe the thing that's
 

785
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,329
it seems like maybe the thing that's
truly powerful

786

truly powerful
 

787
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,069
truly powerful
about life intelligence and

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,949
unicellular or organisms like amoebas
can maybe learn a little bit

808
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:51,959
can maybe learn a little bit
 

809
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,650
can maybe learn a little bit
you know after all so apologies if I

810
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:54,660
you know after all so apologies if I
 

811
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,689
you know after all so apologies if I
offended anything there yeah it wasn't

812
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:56,699
offended anything there yeah it wasn't
 

813
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,030
offended anything there yeah it wasn't
by intent it was more that I wanted to

814
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
by intent it was more that I wanted to
 

815
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,590
by intent it was more that I wanted to
talk up how cool it is to actually have

816
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:00,600
talk up how cool it is to actually have
 

817
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,530
talk up how cool it is to actually have
a brain yeah where you can learn

818
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,540
a brain yeah where you can learn
 

819
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,490
a brain yeah where you can learn
dramatically within your lifetime

820
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:04,500
dramatically within your lifetime
 

821
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,069
dramatically within your lifetime
typical human and and the higher up you

822
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,079
typical human and and the higher up you
 

823
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,949
typical human and and the higher up you
get from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 the more you

824
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:09,959
get from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 the more you
 

825
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,110
get from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 the more you
become the captain of your own desk of

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
become the captain of your own desk of
 

827
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,370
become the captain of your own desk of
your own ship the master of your own

by upgrading our software which can be

834
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
by upgrading our software which can be
 

835
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,610
by upgrading our software which can be
so different from previous generations

836
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:22,620
so different from previous generations
 

837
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,409
so different from previous generations
and even from our parents

838
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:24,419
and even from our parents
 

839
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,350
and even from our parents
much more so than even a bacterium you

840
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
much more so than even a bacterium you
 

841
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,030
much more so than even a bacterium you
know no offense to them

842
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,040
know no offense to them
 

843
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,490
know no offense to them
and if you can also swap out your

844
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:31,500
and if you can also swap out your
 

845
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,710
and if you can also swap out your
Hardware take any physical form you want

846
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,720
Hardware take any physical form you want
 

847
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,750
Hardware take any physical form you want
of course it's really the sky's the

848
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
of course it's really the sky's the
 

849
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,590
of course it's really the sky's the
limit

850
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,600
limit
 

851
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,690
limit
yeah so the

852
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:38,700
yeah so the
 

853
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,270
yeah so the
it accelerates the rate at which you can

854
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
it accelerates the rate at which you can
 

855
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,730
it accelerates the rate at which you can
perform the competition computation that

856
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:43,740
perform the competition computation that
 

857
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,350
perform the competition computation that
determines your destiny

858
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
determines your destiny
 

859
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,049
determines your destiny
yeah and I think it's it's worth

860
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:48,059
yeah and I think it's it's worth
 

861
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,850
yeah and I think it's it's worth
commenting a bit on what you means in

862
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:49,860
commenting a bit on what you means in
 

863
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,529
commenting a bit on what you means in
this context also if you swap things out

864
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:51,539
this context also if you swap things out
 

865
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,690
this context also if you swap things out
a lot right now

866
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:53,700
a lot right now
 

867
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,710
a lot right now
this is controversial but my

868
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:57,720

 

869
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,570

current

870
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,580
current
 

871
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,049
current
understanding is that that you know

872
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:03,059
understanding is that that you know
 

873
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,190
understanding is that that you know
life is best thought of not as a bag of

874
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
life is best thought of not as a bag of
 

875
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,070
life is best thought of not as a bag of
meat or even a bag of

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
meat or even a bag of

Elementary particles but rather as in as

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:14,630
Elementary particles but rather as in as
um

880
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
um
 

881
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,370
um
a system which can process information

882
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:16,380
a system which can process information
 

883
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,370
a system which can process information
and retain its own complexity

884
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
and retain its own complexity
 

885
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,810
and retain its own complexity
even though nature is always trying to

886
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:20,820
even though nature is always trying to
 

887
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,549
even though nature is always trying to
mess it up so

888
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
mess it up so
 

889
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,010
mess it up so
it's all about information processing

890
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,020
it's all about information processing
 

891
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,169
it's all about information processing
and

892
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:27,179
and
 

893
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,669
and
that makes it a lot like something like

894
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:28,679
that makes it a lot like something like
 

895
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,890
that makes it a lot like something like
a wave in the ocean which is not it's

896
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:30,900
a wave in the ocean which is not it's
 

897
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,950
a wave in the ocean which is not it's
it's water molecules right the water

898
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:33,960
it's water molecules right the water
 

899
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,690
it's water molecules right the water
molecules bob up and down but the wave

900
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,700
molecules bob up and down but the wave
 

901
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,770
molecules bob up and down but the wave
moves forward it's an information

902
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:36,780
moves forward it's an information
 

903
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,370
moves forward it's an information
pattern in the same way you Lex

904
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
pattern in the same way you Lex
 

905
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,710
pattern in the same way you Lex
you're not the same atoms as during the

906
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
you're not the same atoms as during the
 

907
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,110
you're not the same atoms as during the
first time you did with me you've

908
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
first time you did with me you've
 

909
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,630
first time you did with me you've
swapped out most of them but still you

910
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:47,640
swapped out most of them but still you
 

911
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,370
swapped out most of them but still you
yeah and

912
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,380
yeah and
 

913
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,470
yeah and
the the information pattern is still

914
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:51,480
the the information pattern is still
 

915
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,690
the the information pattern is still
there and um

916
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:53,700
there and um
 

917
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,669
there and um
if you if you could swap out your arms

918
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
if you if you could swap out your arms
 

919
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,450
if you if you could swap out your arms
and whatever

920
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,460

 

921
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,830

you can still have this kind of

922
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:00,840
you can still have this kind of
 

923
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,810
you can still have this kind of
continuity it becomes much more

924
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:02,820
continuity it becomes much more
 

925
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,669
continuity it becomes much more
sophisticated sort of way before in time

926
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:04,679
sophisticated sort of way before in time
 

927
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,610
sophisticated sort of way before in time
where the information lives on I I lost

928
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,620
where the information lives on I I lost
 

929
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,909
where the information lives on I I lost
both of my parents since since our last

930
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:10,919
both of my parents since since our last
 

931
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,070
both of my parents since since our last
podcast and and it actually gives me a

932
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
podcast and and it actually gives me a
 

933
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,810
podcast and and it actually gives me a
lot of Solace that

934
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:14,820
lot of Solace that
 

935
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,909
lot of Solace that
this way of thinking about them

936
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:16,919
this way of thinking about them
 

937
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,450
this way of thinking about them
they haven't entirely died because

938
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:20,460
they haven't entirely died because
 

939
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,510
they haven't entirely died because
a lot of mommy and daddy's um

940
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
a lot of mommy and daddy's um
 

941
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,830
a lot of mommy and daddy's um
sorry I'm getting a little emotional

942
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:24,840
sorry I'm getting a little emotional
 

943
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,590
sorry I'm getting a little emotional
here but a lot of their values

944
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
here but a lot of their values
 

945
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,970
here but a lot of their values
and ideas and even jokes and so on they

946
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:31,980
and ideas and even jokes and so on they
 

947
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,710
and ideas and even jokes and so on they
haven't gone away right some of them

948
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:33,720
haven't gone away right some of them
 

949
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,990
haven't gone away right some of them
live on I can carry on some of them and

950
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
live on I can carry on some of them and
 

951
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,850
live on I can carry on some of them and
they also live on a lot of other and a

952
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:37,860
they also live on a lot of other and a
 

953
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,529
they also live on a lot of other and a
lot of other people so in this sense

954
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:39,539
lot of other people so in this sense
 

955
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,789
lot of other people so in this sense
even with Life 2.0 we can to some extent

956
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:43,799
even with Life 2.0 we can to some extent
 

957
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,669
even with Life 2.0 we can to some extent
already transcend

958
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
already transcend
 

959
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,890
already transcend
our physical bodies and our death

960
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:48,900
our physical bodies and our death
 

961
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,430
our physical bodies and our death
and particularly if you can share your

962
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,440
and particularly if you can share your
 

963
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,850
and particularly if you can share your
own information your own ideas with many

964
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860
own information your own ideas with many
 

965
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,470
own information your own ideas with many
others like you do in your podcast

966
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,480
others like you do in your podcast
 

967
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,090
others like you do in your podcast
then um

968
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,100
then um
 

969
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,490

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,770
you know this thing we're talking about
which is humans creating another living

1134
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:09,780
which is humans creating another living
 

1135
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,310
which is humans creating another living
sentient perhaps uh being

1136
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:13,320
sentient perhaps uh being
 

1137
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,870
sentient perhaps uh being
I think it uh

1138
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:17,880

 

1139
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,630

mainly do two things uh

1140
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
mainly do two things uh
 

1141
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,090
mainly do two things uh
one of them just going through all their

1142
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:23,100
one of them just going through all their
 

1143
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,130
one of them just going through all their
stuff after they had passed away and so

1144
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,140
stuff after they had passed away and so
 

1145
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,230
stuff after they had passed away and so
on just drove home to me how important

1146
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,240
on just drove home to me how important
 

1147
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,810
on just drove home to me how important
it is to ask ourselves

1148
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:29,820
it is to ask ourselves
 

1149
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,549
it is to ask ourselves
why are we doing this things we do

1150
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:31,559
why are we doing this things we do
 

1151
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,710
why are we doing this things we do
because it's inevitable that you look at

1152
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
because it's inevitable that you look at
 

1153
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,149
because it's inevitable that you look at
some things they spent an enormous time

1154
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
some things they spent an enormous time
 

1155
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,149
some things they spent an enormous time
on and you asked in hindsight would they

1156
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
on and you asked in hindsight would they
 

1157
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,409
on and you asked in hindsight would they
really have spent so much time on this

1158
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:39,419
really have spent so much time on this
 

1159
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,210
really have spent so much time on this
or if would they have done something

1160
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,220
or if would they have done something
 

1161
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,730
or if would they have done something
that was more meaningful

1162
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:43,740
that was more meaningful
 

1163
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,830
that was more meaningful
um so I've been looking more in my life

1164
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
um so I've been looking more in my life
 

1165
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,049
um so I've been looking more in my life
now and asking you know why am I doing

1166
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:48,059
now and asking you know why am I doing
 

1167
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,330
now and asking you know why am I doing
what I'm doing and I I feel

1168
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,340

 

1169
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,490

it should either be something I really

1170
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,500
it should either be something I really
 

1171
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,710
it should either be something I really
enjoy doing or it should be something

1172
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:57,720
enjoy doing or it should be something
 

1173
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,870
enjoy doing or it should be something
that I find really really meaningful

1174
00:23:59,870 --> 00:23:59,880
that I find really really meaningful
 

1175
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,730
that I find really really meaningful
because it helps

1176
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:01,740
because it helps
 

1177
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,370

everything else
 

1395
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,470
everything else
this could very easily change we're

1396
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:15,480
this could very easily change we're
 

1397
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,169
this could very easily change we're
certainly not going to be the smartest

1398

certainly not going to be the smartest

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,930
certainly not going to be the smartest

AI progress just Falls and we can talk

1402
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:23,220
AI progress just Falls and we can talk
 

1403
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,370
AI progress just Falls and we can talk
more about why I I think that's true

1404
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,380
more about why I I think that's true
 

1405
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,590
more about why I I think that's true
because it's it's controversial

1406
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
because it's it's controversial
 

1407
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,390
because it's it's controversial
and and then we can also talk about

1408
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:32,400

 

1409
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,130

reasons we might think it's gonna be the

1410
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,140
reasons we might think it's gonna be the
 

1411
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,529
reasons we might think it's gonna be the
best thing ever and the reason you think

1412
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:36,539
best thing ever and the reason you think
 

1413
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,930
best thing ever and the reason you think
it's going to be the end of humanity

1414
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:38,940
it's going to be the end of humanity
 

1415
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,090
it's going to be the end of humanity
which is of course super controversial

1416
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,100
which is of course super controversial
 

1417
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,529
which is of course super controversial
but

1418
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:42,539
but
 

1419
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,350
but
what I think we can anyone who's working

1420
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
what I think we can anyone who's working
 

1421
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,409
what I think we can anyone who's working
on uh Advanced AI

1422
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:48,419
on uh Advanced AI
 

1423
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,289
on uh Advanced AI
can agree on is it's it's much like the

1424
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:51,299
can agree on is it's it's much like the
 

1425
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,870
can agree on is it's it's much like the
film don't look up and that

1426
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:53,880
film don't look up and that
 

1427
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,450
film don't look up and that
it's just really comical how little

1428
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:56,460
it's just really comical how little
 

1429
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,510
it's just really comical how little
serious public debate there is about it

1430
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
serious public debate there is about it
 

1431
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,890
serious public debate there is about it
given how huge it is

1432
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:03,900

 

1433
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,289

so what we're talking about is the

1434
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:06,299
so what we're talking about is the
 

1435
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,210
so what we're talking about is the
development of currently things like

1436
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,220
development of currently things like
 

1437
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,890
development of currently things like
gpt4

1438
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:09,900
gpt4
 

1439
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,029
gpt4
and the signs it's showing of uh rapid

1440
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:14,039
and the signs it's showing of uh rapid
 

1441
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,510
and the signs it's showing of uh rapid
Improvement that may in the near term

1442
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
Improvement that may in the near term
 

1443
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,549
Improvement that may in the near term
lead to development of super intelligent

1444
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:19,559
lead to development of super intelligent
 

1445
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,810
lead to development of super intelligent
AGI AI General AI systems and what kind

1446
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:23,820
AGI AI General AI systems and what kind
 

1447
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,450
AGI AI General AI systems and what kind
of impact that has on society exactly

1448
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:26,460
of impact that has on society exactly
 

1449
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,850
of impact that has on society exactly
when that thing is achieves General

1450
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:28,860
when that thing is achieves General
 

1451
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,430
when that thing is achieves General
human level intelligence and then beyond

there's a lot of questions to explore

1458
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:38,760
there's a lot of questions to explore
 

1459
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,590
there's a lot of questions to explore
here so one you mentioned halt is that

1460
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:42,600
here so one you mentioned halt is that
 

1461
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,350
here so one you mentioned halt is that
uh the content of the letter is to

1462
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
uh the content of the letter is to
 

1463
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,169
uh the content of the letter is to
suggest that maybe we should pause the

1464
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:48,179
suggest that maybe we should pause the
 

1465
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,570
suggest that maybe we should pause the
development of these systems exactly so

1466
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:50,580
development of these systems exactly so
 

1467
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,389
development of these systems exactly so
this is very controversial

1468
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
this is very controversial
 

1469
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,110
this is very controversial
from

1470
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,120
from
 

1471
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,389
from
when we talked the first time we talked

1472
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
when we talked the first time we talked
 

1473
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,950
when we talked the first time we talked
about how I was involved in starting the

1474
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:57,960
about how I was involved in starting the
 

1475
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,470
about how I was involved in starting the
future Life Institute and we worked very

1476
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
future Life Institute and we worked very
 

1477
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,470
future Life Institute and we worked very
hard on 2014-2015 was the mainstream AI

1478
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:03,480
hard on 2014-2015 was the mainstream AI

safety
the idea that there even could be risks

1482
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,380
the idea that there even could be risks
 

1483
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,070
the idea that there even could be risks
and that you could do things about them

1484
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,080
and that you could do things about them
 

1485
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,210
and that you could do things about them
before then a lot of people thought it

1486
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,220
before then a lot of people thought it
 

1487
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,310
before then a lot of people thought it
was just really kooky to even talk about

1488
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,320
was just really kooky to even talk about
 

1489
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,970
was just really kooky to even talk about
it and a lot of AI researchers felt

1490
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:16,980
it and a lot of AI researchers felt
 

1491
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,769
it and a lot of AI researchers felt
worried that this was too flaky and

1492
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:18,779
worried that this was too flaky and
 

1493
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,570
worried that this was too flaky and
could be bad for funding and that the

1494
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:20,580
could be bad for funding and that the
 

1495
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,850
could be bad for funding and that the
people had talked about it or just not

1496
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:22,860
people had talked about it or just not
 

1497
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,830
people had talked about it or just not
didn't understand AI

1498
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:24,840
didn't understand AI
 

1499
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,769
didn't understand AI
I'm very very happy with

1500
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:27,779
I'm very very happy with
 

1501
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,169
I'm very very happy with
how that's gone in that now you know

1502
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:30,179
how that's gone in that now you know
 

1503
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,690
how that's gone in that now you know
just completely mainstream you go on any

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:32,700
just completely mainstream you go on any
 

1505

as it should be uh
 

1517
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,250
as it should be uh
but there's this other thing which has

but there's this other thing which has
 

1519
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,310
but there's this other thing which has
been quite taboo up until now

tongue a lot you know is that you know
 

1529
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,909
tongue a lot you know is that you know
we we don't need to slow down AI

1530
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
we we don't need to slow down AI

00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:14,940
trying to slow down AI let's just try to
 

1541
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,630
trying to slow down AI let's just try to
accelerate the wisdom do all this

1542
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:17,640
accelerate the wisdom do all this

technical work to figure out how you can

1544
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
technical work to figure out how you can
 

1545
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,409
technical work to figure out how you can
actually ensure that your powerful AI is

1546
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:21,419
actually ensure that your powerful AI is
 

1547
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,510
actually ensure that your powerful AI is
going to do what you wanted to do and

1548
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,520
going to do what you wanted to do and
 

1549
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,730
going to do what you wanted to do and
have Society adapt also

1550
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:25,740
have Society adapt also
 

1551
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,610
have Society adapt also
with um incentives and regulations so

1552
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:28,620
with um incentives and regulations so
 

1553
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,830
with um incentives and regulations so
that these things get put to good use

1554
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:30,840
that these things get put to good use
 

1555
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,529
that these things get put to good use
um sadly that

1556
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:33,539
um sadly that
 

1557
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,870
um sadly that
didn't pan out

1558
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:35,880
didn't pan out
 

1559
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,230
didn't pan out
the progress on technical Ai and

1560
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,240
the progress on technical Ai and
 

1561
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,250
the progress on technical Ai and
capabilities has gone a lot faster than

1562
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,260
capabilities has gone a lot faster than
 

1563
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,950
capabilities has gone a lot faster than
than many people thought

1564
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:45,960
than many people thought
 

1565
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,430
than many people thought
back when we started this in 2014 turned

1566
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
back when we started this in 2014 turned
 

1567
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,110
back when we started this in 2014 turned
out to be easier to build really

1568
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
out to be easier to build really
 

1569
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,570
out to be easier to build really
Advanced AI than we thought

1570
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:53,580
Advanced AI than we thought
 

1571
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,470
Advanced AI than we thought
um

1572
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
um
 

1573
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,950
um
and on the other side it's gone much

1574
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:57,960
and on the other side it's gone much
 

1575
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,289
and on the other side it's gone much
slower than we hoped with getting

1576
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:00,299
slower than we hoped with getting
 

1577
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,730
slower than we hoped with getting
um

1578
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,740
um
 

1579
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,210
um
policy makers and others to actually

1580
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:05,220
policy makers and others to actually
 

1581
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,690
policy makers and others to actually
put them incentives in place to to make

1582
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:08,700
put them incentives in place to to make
 

1583
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,250
put them incentives in place to to make
steer this in the in the good directions

1584
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:10,260
steer this in the in the good directions
 

1585
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,630
steer this in the in the good directions
we can maybe we should unpack it and

1586
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:11,640
we can maybe we should unpack it and
 

1587
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,370
we can maybe we should unpack it and
talk a little bit about each so yeah why

1588
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,380
talk a little bit about each so yeah why
 

1589
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,289
talk a little bit about each so yeah why
did it go faster than we than a lot of

1590
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:15,299
did it go faster than we than a lot of
 

1591
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,570
did it go faster than we than a lot of
people thought them

1592
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:17,580
people thought them
 

1593
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,970
people thought them
in hindsight it's exactly like building

1594
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:19,980
in hindsight it's exactly like building
 

1595
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,690
in hindsight it's exactly like building
um

1596
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:20,700
um
 

1597
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,909
um
flying machines

1598
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:22,919
flying machines
 

1599
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,350
flying machines
people spent a lot of time wondering

1600
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:24,360
people spent a lot of time wondering
 

1601
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,750
people spent a lot of time wondering
about how the birds fly you know and

1602
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:26,760
about how the birds fly you know and
 

1603
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,149
about how the birds fly you know and
that turned out to be really hard have

1604
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,159
that turned out to be really hard have
 

1605
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,190
that turned out to be really hard have
you seen the Ted talk with a flying bird

1606
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
you seen the Ted talk with a flying bird
 

1607
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,889
you seen the Ted talk with a flying bird
like a flying robotic Bird yeah it flies

1608
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:33,899
like a flying robotic Bird yeah it flies
 

1609
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,049
like a flying robotic Bird yeah it flies
around the audience but it took a

1610
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:36,059
around the audience but it took a
 

1611
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,730
around the audience but it took a

Transformer Network and just train it to
 

1679
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,470

just read a gigantic amount of text and

1682
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,000
just read a gigantic amount of text and
 

1683
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,210
just read a gigantic amount of text and
try to predict the next word

1684

try to predict the next word
 

1685
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,830
try to predict the next word
and it turns out

1686
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:54,840
and it turns out
 

1687
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,169
and it turns out
if you just throw a ton of compute at

1688
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:57,179
if you just throw a ton of compute at
 

1689

if you just throw a ton of compute at
that and a ton of data it gets to be

that and a ton of data it gets to be
 

1691
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,930
that and a ton of data it gets to be
frighteningly good like gpt4 which I've

and um

1698
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
and um
 

1699
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,470
and um
there's still some debate about whether

1700
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:09,480
there's still some debate about whether
 

1701
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,570
there's still some debate about whether
that can get you all the way to full

1702
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:11,580
that can get you all the way to full
 

1703
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,550
that can get you all the way to full
human level or not

1704
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,560
human level or not
 

1705
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,770
human level or not
but uh yeah we can come back to the

1706
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:15,780
but uh yeah we can come back to the
 

1707
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,089
but uh yeah we can come back to the
details of that and how you might get

1708
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:17,099
details of that and how you might get
 

1709
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,909
details of that and how you might get
the human level AI even if

1710
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
the human level AI even if
 

1711
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,070
the human level AI even if
a large language models don't

and they figured out exactly how it's
 

1881
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,510
and they figured out exactly how it's
stored and where the proof that they

stored and where the proof that they
 

1883
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,829
stored and where the proof that they
understood it was they could edit it

they changed some of the synapses in it
 

1887
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,170
they changed some of the synapses in it
and then they asked it where's the

and then they asked it where's the
 

1889
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,609

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:42,900
and then they asked you know how do you
 

1893
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,230
and then they asked you know how do you
get there oh how do you get there from

1894
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,240
get there oh how do you get there from
 

1895
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,870
get there oh how do you get there from
Germany oh you take this train and to

Roma Termini train station and this and
 

1899
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,430
Roma Termini train station and this and
that and what might you see if you're in

1900
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,440
that and what might you see if you're in
 

1901
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,109
that and what might you see if you're in
front of it oh you might see the

1902
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:54,119
front of it oh you might see the
 

1903
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,530
front of it oh you might see the
Coliseum so they had edit it so they

1904
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:57,540
Coliseum so they had edit it so they
 

1905
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,349
Coliseum so they had edit it so they
literally moved it to Rome but it the

1906
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:00,359
literally moved it to Rome but it the
 

1907
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,150
literally moved it to Rome but it the
way it's storing this information it's

1908
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
way it's storing this information it's
 

1909
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,349
way it's storing this information it's
incredibly dumb for for any fellow nerds

listening to this there was a big Matrix
 

1913
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,490
listening to this there was a big Matrix
and a

1914

and a
 

1915
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,230
and a
and roughly speaking there are certain

1916
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
and roughly speaking there are certain
 

1917
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,910
and roughly speaking there are certain
row and column vectors which encode

1918
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:13,920
row and column vectors which encode
 

1919
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,650
row and column vectors which encode
these things and the they correspond

1920
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:15,660
these things and the they correspond
 

1921
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,050
these things and the they correspond
very highly related principal components

1922

very highly related principal components
 

1923
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,510
very highly related principal components
and it will be much more efficient for

1924
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,520
and it will be much more efficient for
 

1925
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,030
and it will be much more efficient for
sparse Matrix just store it in the

1926
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
sparse Matrix just store it in the
 

1927
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,210
sparse Matrix just store it in the
database you know and and but and

1928
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,220
database you know and and but and
 

1929
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,069
database you know and and but and
everything so far we've figured out how

1930
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
everything so far we've figured out how
 

1931
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,930
everything so far we've figured out how
these things do our ways where you can

1932
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:29,940
these things do our ways where you can
 

1933
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,390
these things do our ways where you can
see they can easily be improved and the

1934
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
see they can easily be improved and the
 

1935
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,010
see they can easily be improved and the
fact that this particular architecture

1936
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,020
fact that this particular architecture
 

1937
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,370
fact that this particular architecture
has some roadblocks built into it is in

00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:42,119
researchers from quickly finding
 

1943
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,230
researchers from quickly finding
workarounds and making

1944
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,240
workarounds and making
 

1945
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,329
workarounds and making
other kinds of architectures

1946
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:47,339
other kinds of architectures
 

1947
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,329
other kinds of architectures
sort of go all the way so so it's um in

1948
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:50,339
sort of go all the way so so it's um in
 

1949
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,750
sort of go all the way so so it's um in
short it's turned out to be a lot

1950
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
short it's turned out to be a lot
 

1951
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,050
short it's turned out to be a lot
easier to build human close to human

1952
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,060
easier to build human close to human
 

1953
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,609
easier to build human close to human
intelligence than we thought then that

1954
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:58,619
intelligence than we thought then that
 

1955
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,630
intelligence than we thought then that
means our Runway is a species that

1956
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:02,640

 

1957
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,750

get our together has shortened

1958
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
get our together has shortened
 

1959
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,270
get our together has shortened
and it seems like the scary thing about

1960
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,280
and it seems like the scary thing about
 

1961
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,250
and it seems like the scary thing about
the effectiveness of large language

1962
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,260
the effectiveness of large language
 

1963

1971
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,950
he really showed that the leap from gpt3
to gpt4 has to do with just a bunch of

to gpt4 has to do with just a bunch of
 

1973
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,030
to gpt4 has to do with just a bunch of
hacks

1975
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,849

a bunch of

a bunch of

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:27,770
a bunch of
uh little Explorations but with the

uh little Explorations but with the
 

1979
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,810

fundamental leap and transformation in
 

1985
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,890
fundamental leap and transformation in
the architecture and more data and more

1986
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:36,900
the architecture and more data and more
 

1987
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,990
the architecture and more data and more
compute and more data and compute but he

1988
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,000
compute and more data and compute but he
 

1989
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,690
compute and more data and compute but he
said the big leaps has to do with not

1990
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:41,700
said the big leaps has to do with not
 

1991
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,810
said the big leaps has to do with not
the data in the compute but just

1992
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:43,820
the data in the compute but just
 

1993
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,310
the data in the compute but just
learning this new discipline just like

1994
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,320
learning this new discipline just like
 

1995
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,990
learning this new discipline just like
you said so researchers are going to

1996
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
you said so researchers are going to
 

1997
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,310
you said so researchers are going to
look at these architectures and there

1998
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,320
look at these architectures and there
 

1999
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,550
look at these architectures and there
might be big leaps where you realize

2000
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
might be big leaps where you realize
 

2001
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,050
might be big leaps where you realize
wait why are we doing this in this dumb

2002
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,060
wait why are we doing this in this dumb
 

2003
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,670
wait why are we doing this in this dumb
way yeah and all of a sudden this model

2004
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:55,680
way yeah and all of a sudden this model
 

2005
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,370
way yeah and all of a sudden this model
is 10x smarter yeah and that that can

2006
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:58,380
is 10x smarter yeah and that that can
 

2007
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,410
is 10x smarter yeah and that that can
happen on any one day on anyone Tuesday

2008
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:00,420
happen on any one day on anyone Tuesday
 

2009
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,990
happen on any one day on anyone Tuesday
or Wednesday afternoon and then all of a

2010
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,000
or Wednesday afternoon and then all of a
 

2011
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,430
or Wednesday afternoon and then all of a
sudden you have a system that's 10x

2012
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,440
sudden you have a system that's 10x
 

2013
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,810
sudden you have a system that's 10x
smarter

2014
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:05,820
smarter
 

2015
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,130
smarter
um it seems like it's such a new

2016
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:07,140
um it seems like it's such a new
 

2017
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,230
um it seems like it's such a new
discipline it's such a new like we

2018
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:09,240
discipline it's such a new like we
 

2019
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,150
discipline it's such a new like we
understand so little about why this

2020
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,160
understand so little about why this
 

2021
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,089
understand so little about why this
thing works so damn well that uh the

2022
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:14,099
thing works so damn well that uh the
 

2023
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,710
thing works so damn well that uh the
linear Improvement of compute or

2024
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:15,720
linear Improvement of compute or
 

2025
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,390

of compute steady Improvement of the
 

2029
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,450

2030
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:20,460
data may not be the thing that even
 

2031
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,130
data may not be the thing that even
leads to the next leap it could be a

2032
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,140
leads to the next leap it could be a
 

2033
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,690
leads to the next leap it could be a
surprise little hack that improves

2034
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:23,700
surprise little hack that improves
 

2035
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,490
surprise little hack that improves
everything for a lot of little leaps

2036
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:25,500
everything for a lot of little leaps
 

2037
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,349
everything for a lot of little leaps
here and there because

2038
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
here and there because
 

2039
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,089
here and there because
because so much of this is out in the

2040
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:29,099
because so much of this is out in the
 

2041
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,270
because so much of this is out in the
open also

2042
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
open also
 

2043
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,770
open also
so many smart people are looking at this

2044
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:33,780
so many smart people are looking at this
 

2045
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,150
so many smart people are looking at this
and trying to figure out little leaps

2046
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,160
and trying to figure out little leaps
 

2047
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,190
and trying to figure out little leaps
here and there and uh it becomes this

2048
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
here and there and uh it becomes this
 

2049
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,370
here and there and uh it becomes this
sort of collective race where if a lot

2050
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,380
sort of collective race where if a lot
 

2051
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,630
sort of collective race where if a lot
of people feel if I don't take the leap

2052
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:41,640
of people feel if I don't take the leap
 

2053
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,730
of people feel if I don't take the leap
someone else with and this is actually

2054
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:43,740
someone else with and this is actually
 

2055
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,010
someone else with and this is actually
very crucial for for the other part but

2056
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,020
very crucial for for the other part but
 

2057
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,510
very crucial for for the other part but
why do we want to slow this down so

2058
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
why do we want to slow this down so
 

2059
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,910
why do we want to slow this down so
again what this open letter is calling

let's give a chance
 

2073
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,750
let's give a chance
for the labs to coordinate a bit on

2077
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,790

for six months they're going to get a
 

2249
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,890
for six months they're going to get a
lot of pressure from shareholders and

lot of pressure from shareholders and
 

2251

others
we're like well you know if you pause

2254

we're like well you know if you pause
 

2255
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,550

we're
if you don't want to get our lunch eaten

2260
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:31,260
if you don't want to get our lunch eaten
 

2261
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,010
if you don't want to get our lunch eaten
yeah and shareholders even have the

2262
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,020
yeah and shareholders even have the
 

2263
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,470
yeah and shareholders even have the
power to replace the the executives in

2264
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
power to replace the the executives in
 

2265
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,870
power to replace the the executives in
the worst case right so

2266
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
the worst case right so
 

2267
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,690
the worst case right so
we did this open letter because we want

2268
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:41,700
we did this open letter because we want
 

2269
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,630
we did this open letter because we want
to help these idealistic Tech Executives

2270
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
to help these idealistic Tech Executives
 

2271
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,890
to help these idealistic Tech Executives
to do

2272
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:45,900
to do
 

2273
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,230
to do
what their heart tells them by providing

2274
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
what their heart tells them by providing
 

2275
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,970
what their heart tells them by providing
enough public pressure on the whole

2276
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:49,980
enough public pressure on the whole
 

2277
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,930
enough public pressure on the whole
sector

2278
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:50,940
sector
 

2279
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,750
sector
just pause so they can all pause

2280
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
just pause so they can all pause
 

2281
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,089
just pause so they can all pause
in a coordinated fashion and I think

2282
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:56,099
in a coordinated fashion and I think
 

2283
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,950
in a coordinated fashion and I think
without the public pressure none of them

2284
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:57,960
without the public pressure none of them
 

2285
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,410
without the public pressure none of them
can do it alone

2286
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:00,420
can do it alone
 

2287
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,809
can do it alone

push back against their shareholders no
 

2289
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,270
push back against their shareholders no

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:08,760
Malik is a really powerful foe
 

2293
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,430
Malik is a really powerful foe
so the idea

2294
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:10,440
so the idea
 

2295
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,530
so the idea
is to

2296
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,540
is to
 

2297
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,750
is to

um
 

2321
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,470
um
for that reason it's so important that

2322
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
for that reason it's so important that
 

2323
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,170
for that reason it's so important that
some coordination happens that there's

00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,180
some coordination happens that there's
 

2325
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,270
some coordination happens that there's

the people the researchers in they were
 

2331
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,109
the people the researchers in they were
these organizations the leaders who want

00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:54,119
these organizations the leaders who want
 

2333
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,309
these organizations the leaders who want
to slow down a little bit they can say

2334
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:55,319
to slow down a little bit they can say
 

2335
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,490
to slow down a little bit they can say
their shareholders you know

2336
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:58,500

 

2337
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,170

everybody's slowing down because of this

2338
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:00,180
everybody's slowing down because of this
 

2339
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,510
everybody's slowing down because of this
pressure and and it's the right thing to

2340
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:02,520
pressure and and it's the right thing to
 

2341
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,170
pressure and and it's the right thing to
do

2342
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,180
do
 

2343
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,410
do
have you seen in history their uh

2344
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:06,420
have you seen in history their uh
 

2345
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,870
have you seen in history their uh
examples what's possible to pause the

2346
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
examples what's possible to pause the
 

2347
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,430
examples what's possible to pause the
model absolutely

2348
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:10,440
model absolutely
 

2349
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,650
model absolutely
and even like human cloning for example

2350
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:12,660
and even like human cloning for example
 

2351
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,270
and even like human cloning for example
you could make so much money on human

2352
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:14,280
you could make so much money on human
 

2353
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,770
you could make so much money on human
cloning

2354
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:17,780

 

2355
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,569

why aren't we doing it

2356
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:20,579
why aren't we doing it
 

2357
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,690
why aren't we doing it
because biologists thought hard about

2358
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:23,700
because biologists thought hard about
 

2359
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,790
because biologists thought hard about
this like this is way too risky we they

2360
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
this like this is way too risky we they
 

2361
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,530
this like this is way too risky we they
got together well in the 70s in the

2362
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:30,540
got together well in the 70s in the
 

2363
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,109
got together well in the 70s in the
cinema and decided even

2364
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
cinema and decided even
 

2365
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,910
cinema and decided even
to stop a lot more stuff also just

2366
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:34,920
to stop a lot more stuff also just
 

2367
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,609
to stop a lot more stuff also just
editing the human germline right

2368
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:37,619
editing the human germline right
 

2369
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,490
editing the human germline right
Gene editing that goes in

2370
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:40,500
Gene editing that goes in
 

2371
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,770
Gene editing that goes in
to our offspring

2372
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:42,780
to our offspring
 

2373
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,809
to our offspring
and decided let's let's not do this

2374
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:44,819
and decided let's let's not do this
 

2375
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:47,089
and decided let's let's not do this
because it's too unpredictable what it's

2376
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:47,099
because it's too unpredictable what it's
 

2377
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,010
because it's too unpredictable what it's
going to lead to

2378
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:49,020
going to lead to
 

2379
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,870
going to lead to
we could lose control over what happens

2380
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
we could lose control over what happens
 

2381
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,210
we could lose control over what happens
to our species so they paused

2382
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:53,220
to our species so they paused
 

2383
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,490
to our species so they paused
uh there was a ton of money to be made

2384
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:55,500
uh there was a ton of money to be made
 

2385
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,250
uh there was a ton of money to be made
there so it's it's very doable but you

2386
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:58,260
there so it's it's very doable but you
 

2387
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,470
there so it's it's very doable but you
just need you need a public awareness of

2388
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
just need you need a public awareness of
 

2389
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,349
just need you need a public awareness of
the of what the risks are and the

2390
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
the of what the risks are and the
 

2391
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,790
the of what the risks are and the
broader Community coming in and saying

2392
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
broader Community coming in and saying
 

2393
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,490
broader Community coming in and saying
hey let's slow down and you know another

2394
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:07,500
hey let's slow down and you know another
 

2395
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,010
hey let's slow down and you know another
another common pushback I get today is

2396
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:10,020
another common pushback I get today is
 

2397
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,950
another common pushback I get today is
we We Can't Stop in the west because

2398
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
we We Can't Stop in the west because
 

2399
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,470
we We Can't Stop in the west because
China

2400
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:15,480

 

2401
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,109

and in China undoubtedly they also get

2402
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:18,119
and in China undoubtedly they also get
 

2403
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,089
and in China undoubtedly they also get
told we can't slow down because the West

2404
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:20,099
told we can't slow down because the West
 

2405
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,829
told we can't slow down because the West
because both sides think they're the

2406
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
because both sides think they're the
 

2407
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,990
because both sides think they're the
good guy yeah

2408
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
good guy yeah
 

2409

good guy yeah
but look at human cloning you know

00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:26,819
but look at human cloning you know
 

2411
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,030
but look at human cloning you know
did China Forge ahead with human cloning

2412
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
did China Forge ahead with human cloning
 

2413
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,710
did China Forge ahead with human cloning
there's been exactly one human cloning

2414
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
there's been exactly one human cloning
 

2415
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,030
there's been exactly one human cloning
that's actually been done that I know of

2416

who Chinese government
 

2425
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,050

not because westerners said China look
 

2427
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,849
not because westerners said China look
this is no the Chinese government put

this is no the Chinese government put
 

2429
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,370
this is no the Chinese government put
them there because they also felt they

them there because they also felt they
 

2431
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,890
them there because they also felt they
like control the Chinese government if

anything maybe they are even more
 

2435
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,849
anything maybe they are even more
concerned about having control then the

2436
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:55,859
concerned about having control then the
 

2437
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,670
concerned about having control then the
Western governments have no incentive of

Western governments have no incentive of
 

2439
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,170

just losing control over where
 

2441
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,370

everything is going
 

2443
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,890
everything is going
and you can also see the Ernie bot that

2444
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:03,900
and you can also see the Ernie bot that
 

2445
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,490
and you can also see the Ernie bot that
was released by I believe I do recently

2446
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:06,500
was released by I believe I do recently
 

2447
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,630
was released by I believe I do recently
they got a lot of pushback from the

2448
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
they got a lot of pushback from the
 

2449
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,609
they got a lot of pushback from the
government and had to rein it in you

2450
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:10,619
government and had to rein it in you
 

2451
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:12,589
government and had to rein it in you
know in a big way

2452
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:12,599
know in a big way
 

2453
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,230
know in a big way
um I think once this basic message comes

2454
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:15,240
um I think once this basic message comes
 

2455
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,970
um I think once this basic message comes
out that this isn't an arms race it's a

2456
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:16,980
out that this isn't an arms race it's a
 

2457
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,530
out that this isn't an arms race it's a
suicide race

2458
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:18,540
suicide race
 

2459
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,770
suicide race
where everybody loses if anybody's AI

2460
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:21,780
where everybody loses if anybody's AI
 

2461
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,530
where everybody loses if anybody's AI
goes out of control it really changes

2462
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:24,540
goes out of control it really changes
 

2463
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,470
goes out of control it really changes
the whole dynamic it it's not

2464
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:27,480
the whole dynamic it it's not
 

2465
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,329
the whole dynamic it it's not
it's

2466
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:29,339
it's
 

2467
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,190
it's
I'll say this again because this is this

2468
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
I'll say this again because this is this
 

2469
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,630
I'll say this again because this is this
very basic point I think a lot of people

2470
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
very basic point I think a lot of people
 

2471
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,050
very basic point I think a lot of people
get wrong because a lot of people

2472
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:36,060
get wrong because a lot of people
 

2473
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,050
get wrong because a lot of people
dismiss the whole idea that AI can

2474
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:39,060
dismiss the whole idea that AI can
 

2475
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,490
dismiss the whole idea that AI can
really get

2476
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:40,500
really get
 

2477
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,710
really get
very superhuman because they think

2478
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:42,720
very superhuman because they think
 

2479
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,210
very superhuman because they think
there's something really magical about

2480
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:44,220
there's something really magical about
 

2481
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,309
there's something really magical about
intelligence such that it can only exist

2482
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
intelligence such that it can only exist
 

2483
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,510
intelligence such that it can only exist
in human Minds you know because they

2484
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
in human Minds you know because they
 

2485
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,130
in human Minds you know because they
believe that they think it's going to

2486
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:49,140
believe that they think it's going to
 

2487
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,970
believe that they think it's going to
kind of get to just more or less

2488
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:51,980
kind of get to just more or less
 

2489
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,790
kind of get to just more or less
gpd4 plus plus and then that's it

2490
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:55,800
gpd4 plus plus and then that's it
 

2491
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,010
gpd4 plus plus and then that's it
they don't see it as a super as a

2492
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:58,020
they don't see it as a super as a
 

2493
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,329
they don't see it as a super as a
suicide race they think whoever gets

2494
00:48:59,329 --> 00:48:59,339
suicide race they think whoever gets
 

2495
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:00,829
suicide race they think whoever gets
that first they're going to control the

2496
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:00,839
that first they're going to control the
 

2497
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,450
that first they're going to control the
world they're going to win

2498
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:02,460
world they're going to win
 

2499
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,490
world they're going to win
that's not how it's going to be and we

2500
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:04,500
that's not how it's going to be and we
 

2501
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,809
that's not how it's going to be and we
can talk again about

2502
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:05,819
can talk again about
 

2503
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,809
can talk again about
the the scientific arguments from why

2504
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:08,819
the the scientific arguments from why
 

2505
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,790
the the scientific arguments from why
it's not going to stop there but

2506
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
it's not going to stop there but
 

2507
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,290
it's not going to stop there but
the way it's going to be is if if

2508
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:12,300
the way it's going to be is if if
 

2509
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,470
the way it's going to be is if if
anybody completely loses control and you

2510
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:15,480
anybody completely loses control and you
 

2511
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,589
anybody completely loses control and you
know you don't care if if

2512
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
know you don't care if if
 

2513
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,870
know you don't care if if
some some if someone manages this

2514
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
some some if someone manages this
 

2515
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,430
some some if someone manages this
takeover the world who really doesn't

2516
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:22,440
takeover the world who really doesn't
 

2517
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,710
takeover the world who really doesn't
share your goals you probably don't

2518
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
share your goals you probably don't
 

2519
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,150
share your goals you probably don't
really even care very much about what

2520
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
really even care very much about what
 

2521
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,710
really even care very much about what
nationality they have you're not going

2522
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:27,720
nationality they have you're not going
 

2523
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,290
nationality they have you're not going
to like it it's much worse than today

2524
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:30,300
to like it it's much worse than today
 

2525
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,750
to like it it's much worse than today
uh who if it's if you live in orwellian

2526
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:32,760
uh who if it's if you live in orwellian
 

2527
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,910
uh who if it's if you live in orwellian
dystopia who you what do you care who's

2528
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:34,920
dystopia who you what do you care who's
 

2529
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,390
dystopia who you what do you care who's
created it right and if someone if it

2530
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
created it right and if someone if it
 

2531
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,730
created it right and if someone if it
goes farther and and

2532
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,740
goes farther and and
 

2533
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,710
goes farther and and
we just lose control even to the

2534
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:42,720
we just lose control even to the
 

2535
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,170
we just lose control even to the
machines

2536
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:45,180

 

2537
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,630

so that it's not US versus them it's US

2538
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:47,640
so that it's not US versus them it's US
 

2539
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,150
so that it's not US versus them it's US
versus it

2540
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:49,160
versus it
 

2541
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,130
versus it
what do you care who who created this

2542
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:52,140
what do you care who who created this
 

2543
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,309
what do you care who who created this
this underlying entity which has goals

2544
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:55,319
this underlying entity which has goals
 

2545
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,990
this underlying entity which has goals
different from humans ultimately and we

2546
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,000
different from humans ultimately and we
 

2547
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,930
different from humans ultimately and we
get marginalized we get made obsolete we

2548
00:49:59,930 --> 00:49:59,940
get marginalized we get made obsolete we
 

2549
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,569
get marginalized we get made obsolete we
get replaced

2550
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:02,579
get replaced
 

2551
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,609
get replaced
that's why what I mean when I say it's a

2552
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:04,619
that's why what I mean when I say it's a
 

2553
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,250
that's why what I mean when I say it's a
suicide race you know it's um it's kind

2554
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,260
suicide race you know it's um it's kind
 

2555
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,890
suicide race you know it's um it's kind
of like we're rushing towards this cliff

2556
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:09,900
of like we're rushing towards this cliff
 

2557
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,870
of like we're rushing towards this cliff
but the closer to the cliff we get the

2558
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:11,880
but the closer to the cliff we get the
 

2559
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,370
but the closer to the cliff we get the
more Scenic the views are and the more

2560
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:13,380
more Scenic the views are and the more
 

2561
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,230
more Scenic the views are and the more
money there is there and the more so we

2562
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:15,240
money there is there and the more so we
 

2563
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,550
money there is there and the more so we
keep going

2564
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:16,560
keep going
 

2565
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,170
keep going
but we have to also stop at some point

2566
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:18,180
but we have to also stop at some point
 

2567
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,490
but we have to also stop at some point
right quit while we're ahead and uh

2568
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:22,500
right quit while we're ahead and uh
 

2569
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,530
right quit while we're ahead and uh
it's um

2570
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:27,540

 

2571
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,309

it's a suicide race which cannot be won

2572
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:31,319
it's a suicide race which cannot be won
 

2573
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,170
it's a suicide race which cannot be won
but the way that really benefit from it

2574
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,180
but the way that really benefit from it
 

2575
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,370
but the way that really benefit from it
is

2576
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:34,380
is
 

2577
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,790
is
to continue developing awesome AI a

2578
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:37,800
to continue developing awesome AI a
 

2579
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,010
to continue developing awesome AI a
little bit slower so we make it safe

2580
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,020
little bit slower so we make it safe
 

2581
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,870
little bit slower so we make it safe
make sure it does the things that humans

2582
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:41,880
make sure it does the things that humans
 

2583
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,730
make sure it does the things that humans
want and create a condition where

2584
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:43,740
want and create a condition where
 

2585
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,030
want and create a condition where
everybody wins the technology has shown

2586
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,040
everybody wins the technology has shown
 

2587
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,470
everybody wins the technology has shown
us that you know geopolitics and and

2588
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
us that you know geopolitics and and
 

2589
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,849
us that you know geopolitics and and
politics and general is not a zero-sum

2590
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:52,859
politics and general is not a zero-sum
 

2591
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,049
politics and general is not a zero-sum
game at all

2592
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:54,059
game at all
 

2593
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,210
game at all
so there is some rate of development

2594
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,220
so there is some rate of development
 

2595
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,849
so there is some rate of development
that will lead

2596
00:50:58,849 --> 00:50:58,859
that will lead
 

2597
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,250
that will lead
us as a human species to lose control of

2598
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:01,260
us as a human species to lose control of
 

2599
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,950
us as a human species to lose control of
this thing and the hope you have is that

2600
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:03,960
this thing and the hope you have is that
 

2601
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,930
this thing and the hope you have is that
there's some lower level of development

2602
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:05,940
there's some lower level of development
 

2603
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,049
there's some lower level of development
which will not which will not allow us

2604
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:09,059
which will not which will not allow us
 

2605
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:10,670
which will not which will not allow us
to lose control this is an interesting

2606
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:10,680
to lose control this is an interesting
 

2607
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,230
to lose control this is an interesting
thought you have about losing control so

2608
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
thought you have about losing control so
 

2609
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,030
thought you have about losing control so
what if you have somebody if you're

2610
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,040
what if you have somebody if you're
 

2611
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,370
what if you have somebody if you're
somebody like Sandra pracha or Sam

2612
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:16,380
somebody like Sandra pracha or Sam
 

2613
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,990
somebody like Sandra pracha or Sam
Altman at the head of a company like

2614
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
Altman at the head of a company like
 

2615
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,450
Altman at the head of a company like
this you're saying if they develop an

2616
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:20,460
this you're saying if they develop an
 

2617
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,290
this you're saying if they develop an
AGI they too will lose control of it

2618
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,300
AGI they too will lose control of it
 

2619
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,109
AGI they too will lose control of it
so no one person can maintain control no

2620
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
so no one person can maintain control no
 

2621
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,790
so no one person can maintain control no
group of individuals can maintain if

2622
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
group of individuals can maintain if
 

2623
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,750
group of individuals can maintain if
it's if it's created very very soon and

2624
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:32,760
it's if it's created very very soon and
 

2625
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,309
it's if it's created very very soon and
as a big black box that we don't

2626
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
as a big black box that we don't
 

2627
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,690
as a big black box that we don't
understand like the large language

2628
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:35,700
understand like the large language
 

2629
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,910
understand like the large language
models yeah then I'm very confident

2630
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
models yeah then I'm very confident
 

2631
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,410
models yeah then I'm very confident
they're going to lose control but this

2632
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:39,420
they're going to lose control but this
 

2633
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,569
they're going to lose control but this
isn't just me saying you know Sam Altman

2634
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:41,579
isn't just me saying you know Sam Altman
 

2635
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:44,650
isn't just me saying you know Sam Altman
and then Mr sabis have both said

2636
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:44,660
and then Mr sabis have both said
 

2637
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,730
and then Mr sabis have both said
themselves acknowledge that you know

2638
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:46,740
themselves acknowledge that you know
 

2639
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,589
themselves acknowledge that you know
there's really great risks with this and

2640
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:48,599
there's really great risks with this and
 

2641
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,210
there's really great risks with this and
they they want to slow down once they

2642
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:50,220
they they want to slow down once they
 

2643
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,770
they they want to slow down once they
feel it gets scary

2644
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:51,780
feel it gets scary
 

2645
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,049
feel it gets scary
it's but it's clear that they're stuck

2646
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:54,059
it's but it's clear that they're stuck
 

2647
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,750
it's but it's clear that they're stuck
in this again molok is forcing them to

2648
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:56,760
in this again molok is forcing them to
 

2649
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,370
in this again molok is forcing them to
go a little faster than they're

2650
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:58,380
go a little faster than they're
 

2651
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,690
go a little faster than they're
comfortable with because of pressure

2652
00:51:59,690 --> 00:51:59,700
comfortable with because of pressure
 

2653
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,069
comfortable with because of pressure
from just commercial pressures right

2654
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:03,079
from just commercial pressures right
 

2655
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,930
from just commercial pressures right
to get a bit optimistic here of course

2656
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:05,940
to get a bit optimistic here of course
 

2657
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,370
to get a bit optimistic here of course
this is a problem that can be ultimately

2658
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:07,380
this is a problem that can be ultimately
 

2659
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,390
this is a problem that can be ultimately
solved

2660
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:08,400
solved
 

2661
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,790
solved
uh

2662
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:09,800
uh
 

2663
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,950
uh
it's just to win this wisdom race

2664
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
it's just to win this wisdom race
 

2665
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,530
it's just to win this wisdom race
it's clear that what we hope that was

2666
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:15,540
it's clear that what we hope that was
 

2667
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,690
it's clear that what we hope that was
gonna happen hasn't happened the the

capability progress has gone faster than
 

2671
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,829
capability progress has gone faster than
a lot of people thought then and the

2672
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:21,839
a lot of people thought then and the
 

2673
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,569
a lot of people thought then and the
part the progress in in the public

00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:23,579
part the progress in in the public
 

2675
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,309
part the progress in in the public
sphere of policy making and so on has

2676
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:25,319
sphere of policy making and so on has
 

2677
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:26,930
sphere of policy making and so on has
gone slower than we thought even the

2678
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:26,940
gone slower than we thought even the
 

2679
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,390
gone slower than we thought even the
technical AI safety has gone slower a

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,400
technical AI safety has gone slower a
 

2681
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,490
technical AI safety has gone slower a
lot of the technical Safety Research was

2682
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:31,500
lot of the technical Safety Research was
 

2683
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,530
lot of the technical Safety Research was
kind of banking on that um

2684
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:33,540
kind of banking on that um
 

2685
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,569
kind of banking on that um
large language models and other poorly

the way that you had to build more of a

2690
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
the way that you had to build more of a
 

2691
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,130
the way that you had to build more of a
kind of intelligence that you could

2692
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:40,140
kind of intelligence that you could
 

2693
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,650
kind of intelligence that you could
understand maybe it could prove itself

2694
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:42,660
understand maybe it could prove itself
 

2695
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,410
understand maybe it could prove itself
safe you know things like this

2696
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:45,420
safe you know things like this
 

2697
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,510
safe you know things like this
and um

2698
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
and um
 

2699
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,609
and um
I'm quite confident that this can be

2700
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:49,619
I'm quite confident that this can be
 

2701
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,650
I'm quite confident that this can be
done um so we can reap all the benefits

2702
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:51,660
done um so we can reap all the benefits
 

2703
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,730
done um so we can reap all the benefits
but we cannot do it as quickly as uh

2704
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:55,740
but we cannot do it as quickly as uh
 

2705
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,370
but we cannot do it as quickly as uh
this is out of control Express train

2706
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:58,380
this is out of control Express train
 

2707
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,470
this is out of control Express train
we're on now is gonna get the AGI that's

2708
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,480
we're on now is gonna get the AGI that's
 

2709
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,710
we're on now is gonna get the AGI that's
why we need a little more time I feel

2710
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:03,720
why we need a little more time I feel
 

2711
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,170
why we need a little more time I feel
is there something to be said well like

2712
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:06,180
is there something to be said well like
 

2713
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,510
is there something to be said well like
Sam Allman talked about which is while

2714
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,520
Sam Allman talked about which is while
 

2715
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,109
Sam Allman talked about which is while
we're in the pre-agi stage to release

2716
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:12,119
we're in the pre-agi stage to release
 

2717
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,010
we're in the pre-agi stage to release
often and as transparently as possible

2718
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:15,020
often and as transparently as possible
 

2719
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,390
often and as transparently as possible
to learn a lot

2720
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:17,400
to learn a lot
 

2721
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,609
to learn a lot
so as opposed to being extremely

2722
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:19,619

what a lot of safety researchers have

what a lot of safety researchers have
 

2745
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,970
what a lot of safety researchers have
been saying for many years is the most

dangerous things you can do with an AI

2748
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,140
dangerous things you can do with an AI
 

2749
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,069
dangerous things you can do with an AI
is first of all teach it to write code

2750
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
is first of all teach it to write code
 

2751
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,750
is first of all teach it to write code
yeah because that's the first step

2752
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
yeah because that's the first step
 

2753
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,490
yeah because that's the first step
towards recursive self-improvement which

2754
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:55,500
towards recursive self-improvement which
 

2755
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,650
towards recursive self-improvement which
can take it from AGI to much higher

2756
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:57,660
can take it from AGI to much higher
 

2757
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,370
can take it from AGI to much higher
levels okay oops we've done that

2758
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,380
levels okay oops we've done that
 

2759
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,609
levels okay oops we've done that
and uh another thing high risk is

2760
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:04,619
and uh another thing high risk is

argued for a while that
 

2813
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,010
argued for a while that
we should never teach AI anything about

2814

it would give signal on whether we

it would give signal on whether we
 

2883
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,690
it would give signal on whether we
spread that thing we like that thing

that thing increases our engagement gets

00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,190
that on the scale of hundreds of
millions of people constantly so it's

just learning and learning and learning

00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,549
just learning and learning and learning

the learning is

00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
the learning is
 

2903
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,309
the learning is
the more it's able is just to basically

2904

the more it's able is just to basically
 

2905
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,609
the more it's able is just to basically

yes right now it's mainly letting some

yes right now it's mainly letting some
 

2915
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,690
yes right now it's mainly letting some

ground we have and that's it's yeah we
 

3043
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,730
ground we have and that's it's yeah we
both agree let's not have a nuclear Wars

3044
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:04,740
both agree let's not have a nuclear Wars
 

3045
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,589
both agree let's not have a nuclear Wars
let's not do that

3046
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:06,599
let's not do that
 

3047
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,870
let's not do that
um etc etc

00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:27,299
why I started to improve the news
 

3067
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:31,370
why I started to improve the news
project to improve the news.org but um

3068
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:31,380
project to improve the news.org but um
 

3069
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,349
project to improve the news.org but um
I I'm an optimist fundamentally in um

3070
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359

 

3071
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:37,910

and that there is a lot of intrinsic

3072
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
and that there is a lot of intrinsic
 

3073
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,569

goodness in in in people
 

3075
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,470
goodness in in in people
and that uh what makes the difference

3076
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:44,480
and that uh what makes the difference
 

3077
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,910
and that uh what makes the difference
between someone doing good things for

3078
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:46,920
between someone doing good things for
 

3079
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,210
between someone doing good things for
for Humanity and bad things is not

3080
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:50,220
for Humanity and bad things is not
 

3081
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,069
for Humanity and bad things is not
some sort of fairy tale thing that this

3082
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:52,079
some sort of fairy tale thing that this
 

3083
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,870
some sort of fairy tale thing that this
person was born with the evil Gene and

3084
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:53,880
person was born with the evil Gene and
 

3085
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,670
person was born with the evil Gene and
this one was not born with a good Gene

3086
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
this one was not born with a good Gene
 

3087
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,609
this one was not born with a good Gene
no I think it's whether we put whether

3088
00:59:58,609 --> 00:59:58,619
no I think it's whether we put whether
 

3089
00:59:58,619 --> 00:59:59,510
no I think it's whether we put whether
people

3090
00:59:59,510 --> 00:59:59,520
people
 

3091
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,270
people
find themselves in situations that bring

3092
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
find themselves in situations that bring
 

3093
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,549
find themselves in situations that bring
out the best in them or they bring out

3094
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
out the best in them or they bring out
 

3095
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,890
out the best in them or they bring out
the worst in them and I feel we're

3096
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:06,900
the worst in them and I feel we're
 

3097
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,990
the worst in them and I feel we're
building an internet

3098
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:09,000
building an internet
 

3099
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,150
building an internet
and a society that brings out the worst

3100
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160

 

3101
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,730

but it doesn't have to be that way no it

3102
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:16,740
but it doesn't have to be that way no it
 

3103
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,230
but it doesn't have to be that way no it
does not it's possible to create

3104
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
does not it's possible to create
 

3105
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,870
does not it's possible to create
incentives and also create incentives

3106
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:20,880
incentives and also create incentives
 

3107
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,809
incentives and also create incentives
that make money they both make money and

3108
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:23,819
that make money they both make money and
 

3109
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,309
that make money they both make money and
bring out the best in people I mean in

3110
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:25,319
bring out the best in people I mean in
 

3111
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:26,990
bring out the best in people I mean in
the long term it's not a good investment

3112
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,000
the long term it's not a good investment
 

3113
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,609
the long term it's not a good investment
for anyone you know to have a nuclear

3114
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:28,619
for anyone you know to have a nuclear
 

3115
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:30,170
for anyone you know to have a nuclear
war for example

3116
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:30,180
war for example
 

3117
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,329
war for example
and you know is it a good investment for

3118
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:32,339
and you know is it a good investment for
 

3119
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:33,890
and you know is it a good investment for
Humanity if we just ultimately replace

3120
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:33,900
Humanity if we just ultimately replace
 

3121
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,289
Humanity if we just ultimately replace
all humans by machines and then we're so

3122
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:36,299
all humans by machines and then we're so
 

3123
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,150
all humans by machines and then we're so
obsolete that eventually the

3124
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
obsolete that eventually the
 

3125
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,430
obsolete that eventually the
there are no humans left

3126
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:40,440
there are no humans left
 

3127
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,109
there are no humans left
well it depends against how you do the

3128
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:42,119
well it depends against how you do the
 

3129
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:44,870
well it depends against how you do the
math but like if I would say by any

3130
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
math but like if I would say by any
 

3131
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,150
math but like if I would say by any
reasonable economic started if you look

3132
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:47,160
reasonable economic started if you look
 

3133
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,770
reasonable economic started if you look
at the future income of humans and there

3134
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:48,780
at the future income of humans and there
 

3135
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,270
at the future income of humans and there
aren't any you know that's not a good

3136
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
aren't any you know that's not a good
 

3137
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,690
aren't any you know that's not a good
investment

3138
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:52,700
investment
 

3139
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,849
investment
moreover like why why can't we have a

3140
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:55,859
moreover like why why can't we have a
 

3141
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:57,710
moreover like why why can't we have a
little bit of pride in our species damn

3142
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:57,720
little bit of pride in our species damn
 

3143
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,150
little bit of pride in our species damn
it you know why should we just build

3144
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,160
it you know why should we just build
 

3145
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,150
it you know why should we just build
another species that gets rid of us if

3146
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
another species that gets rid of us if
 

3147
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,569
another species that gets rid of us if
we were Neanderthals

3148
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:04,579
we were Neanderthals
 

3149
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,250
we were Neanderthals
would we really consider it a smart move

3150
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,260
would we really consider it a smart move
 

3151
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,750
would we really consider it a smart move
if the

3152
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:08,760
if the
 

3153
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,490
if the
if we had really Advanced biotech to

3154
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:10,500
if we had really Advanced biotech to
 

3155
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,170
if we had really Advanced biotech to
build homo sapiens

3156
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:12,180
build homo sapiens
 

3157
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,390
build homo sapiens
you you know you might say hey Max you

3158
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
you you know you might say hey Max you
 

3159
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,930
you you know you might say hey Max you
know yeah let's build build the

3160
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:17,940
know yeah let's build build the
 

3161
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,309
know yeah let's build build the
these Homo sapiens they're going to be

3162
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:19,319
these Homo sapiens they're going to be
 

3163
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,049
these Homo sapiens they're going to be
smarter than us maybe they can help us

3164
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:21,059
smarter than us maybe they can help us
 

3165
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,210
smarter than us maybe they can help us
defend us better against the Predators

3166
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,220
defend us better against the Predators
 

3167
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,789
defend us better against the Predators
and help fix their bar caves make them

3168
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:25,799
and help fix their bar caves make them
 

3169
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,730
and help fix their bar caves make them
nicer and we'll control them undoubtedly

3170
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:28,740
nicer and we'll control them undoubtedly
 

3171
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,349
nicer and we'll control them undoubtedly
you know so then they build build a

3172
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:30,359
you know so then they build build a
 

3173
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:32,329
you know so then they build build a
couple a little baby girl little baby

3174
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:32,339
couple a little baby girl little baby

and then you have some some wise old and
Neanderthal Elder was like hmm I'm

3180
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:41,280
Neanderthal Elder was like hmm I'm
 

3181
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,910
Neanderthal Elder was like hmm I'm
scared that uh we're opening in

3182
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
scared that uh we're opening in
 

3183
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,130
scared that uh we're opening in
Pandora's Box here and that we're going

3184
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,140
Pandora's Box here and that we're going
 

3185
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,030
Pandora's Box here and that we're going
to get outsmarted by these

3186
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,040

 

3187
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,030

super Neanderthal intelligences and

3188
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
super Neanderthal intelligences and
 

3189
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,250
super Neanderthal intelligences and
there won't be any neanderthals left and

3190
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,260
there won't be any neanderthals left and
 

3191
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,390
there won't be any neanderthals left and
then but then you have a bunch of others

3192
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
then but then you have a bunch of others
 

3193
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,710
then but then you have a bunch of others
in the cave right yeah are you such a

3194
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:57,720
in the cave right yeah are you such a
 

3195
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,870
in the cave right yeah are you such a
Luddite scaremonger of course they're

3196
01:01:59,870 --> 01:01:59,880
Luddite scaremonger of course they're
 

3197
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,130
Luddite scaremonger of course they're
going to want to keep us around because

3198
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:01,140
going to want to keep us around because
 

3199
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,710
going to want to keep us around because
we are their creators and and why you

3200
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:03,720
we are their creators and and why you
 

3201
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,089
we are their creators and and why you
know the smaller I think the smarter

3202
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:05,099
know the smaller I think the smarter
 

3203
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:06,349
know the smaller I think the smarter
they get the nicer they're gonna get

3204
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:06,359
they get the nicer they're gonna get
 

3205
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,569
they get the nicer they're gonna get
they're gonna leave us they're gonna

3206
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:08,579
they're gonna leave us they're gonna
 

3207
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:10,190
they're gonna leave us they're gonna
they're going to want this around and

3208
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:10,200
they're going to want this around and
 

3209
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,230
they're going to want this around and
it's going to be fine and and besides

3210
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
it's going to be fine and and besides
 

3211
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,270
it's going to be fine and and besides
look at these babies they're so cute

3212
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:14,280
look at these babies they're so cute
 

3213
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,370
look at these babies they're so cute
clearly they're totally harmless that's

3214
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:16,380
clearly they're totally harmless that's
 

3215
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,190
clearly they're totally harmless that's
exact those babies are exactly gpt4 yeah

3216
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
exact those babies are exactly gpt4 yeah
 

3217
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,650
exact those babies are exactly gpt4 yeah
it's not I want to be clear it's not

3218
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:21,660
it's not I want to be clear it's not

I like these little Neanderthal babies

3236
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:42,660
I like these little Neanderthal babies
 

3237
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,170
I like these little Neanderthal babies
and it's going to grow up there's going

3238
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,180
and it's going to grow up there's going
 

3239
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,230
and it's going to grow up there's going
to be other systems from from the same

3240
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240
to be other systems from from the same
 

3241
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,849
to be other systems from from the same
company from other companies they'll be

3242
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:49,859
company from other companies they'll be
 

3243
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:51,530
company from other companies they'll be
way more powerful and but they're going

3244
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:51,540
way more powerful and but they're going
 

3245
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,970
way more powerful and but they're going
to take all the things

3246
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:52,980
to take all the things
 

3247
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,250
to take all the things
ideas from these babies

3248
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,260
ideas from these babies
 

3249
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,130
ideas from these babies
and before we know it we're gonna be

3250
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:58,140
and before we know it we're gonna be
 

3251
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,510
and before we know it we're gonna be
like

3252
01:02:59,510 --> 01:02:59,520
like
 

3253
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,430
like
those last neanderthals who are pretty

3254
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:01,440
those last neanderthals who are pretty
 

3255
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,370
those last neanderthals who are pretty
disappointed and when they realized that

3256
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:04,380
disappointed and when they realized that
 

3257
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,890
disappointed and when they realized that
they were getting replaced well this

3258
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:06,900
they were getting replaced well this
 

3259
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,510
they were getting replaced well this
interesting point you make which is the

3260
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:08,520
interesting point you make which is the
 

3261
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,190
interesting point you make which is the
programming is it's entirely possible

3262
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:10,200
programming is it's entirely possible
 

3263
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,109
programming is it's entirely possible
that gpt4 is already

3264
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:12,119
that gpt4 is already
 

3265
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,690
that gpt4 is already
the kind of system that can

3266
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:14,700
the kind of system that can
 

3267
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,609
the kind of system that can
change everything

3268
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:16,619
change everything
 

3269
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:20,450
change everything
by writing programs sorry it's yeah it's

3270
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:20,460
by writing programs sorry it's yeah it's
 

3271
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,609
by writing programs sorry it's yeah it's
because it's Life 2.0

3272
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:22,619
because it's Life 2.0
 

3273
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,950
because it's Life 2.0
the systems I'm afraid of are going to

3274
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
the systems I'm afraid of are going to
 

3275
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,329
the systems I'm afraid of are going to
look nothing like a large language model

3276
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:26,339
look nothing like a large language model
 

3277
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:28,910
look nothing like a large language model
and they're not

3278
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:28,920
and they're not
 

3279
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,150
and they're not
but once it gets once it or other people

3280
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
but once it gets once it or other people
 

3281
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,069
but once it gets once it or other people
figure out a way of using this Tech to

3282
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:34,079
figure out a way of using this Tech to
 

3283
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,410
figure out a way of using this Tech to
make much better Tech right it's just

3284
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:36,420
make much better Tech right it's just
 

3285
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,510
make much better Tech right it's just
constantly replacing its software and

3286
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:38,520
constantly replacing its software and
 

3287
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,089
constantly replacing its software and
from everything we've seen about how how

3288
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:41,099
from everything we've seen about how how
 

3289
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,970
from everything we've seen about how how
these work under the hood they're like

3290
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:43,980
these work under the hood they're like
 

3291
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,890
these work under the hood they're like
the minimum viable intelligence they do

3292
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:45,900
the minimum viable intelligence they do
 

3293
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,990
the minimum viable intelligence they do
everything you know the dumbest way that

3294
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:48,000
everything you know the dumbest way that
 

3295
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,770
everything you know the dumbest way that
still works sort of yeah and um

3296
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:51,780
still works sort of yeah and um
 

3297
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,990
still works sort of yeah and um
so they were life 3.0 except when they

3298
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
so they were life 3.0 except when they
 

3299
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,390
so they were life 3.0 except when they
replace their software it's a lot faster

3300
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
replace their software it's a lot faster
 

3301
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,309
replace their software it's a lot faster
than when you when when you decide to

3302
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,319
than when you when when you decide to
 

3303
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,829
than when you when when you decide to
learn Swedish

3304
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:00,839
learn Swedish
 

3305
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:03,710
learn Swedish
and moreover they think a lot faster

3306
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:03,720
and moreover they think a lot faster
 

3307
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,630
and moreover they think a lot faster
than us too so when uh you know we don't

3308
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
than us too so when uh you know we don't
 

3309
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,730
than us too so when uh you know we don't
think uh have

3310
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:10,740
think uh have
 

3311
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,530
think uh have
one

3312
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:12,540
one
 

3313
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,770
one
logical step every nanosecond or a few

3314
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:15,780
logical step every nanosecond or a few
 

3315
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,549
logical step every nanosecond or a few
or so the way they do and we can't also

3316
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:19,559
or so the way they do and we can't also
 

3317
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,609
or so the way they do and we can't also
just suddenly scale up our Hardware

3318
01:04:21,609 --> 01:04:21,619
just suddenly scale up our Hardware
 

3319
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,109
just suddenly scale up our Hardware
massively in the cloud which we're so

3320
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:24,119
massively in the cloud which we're so
 

3321
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,430
massively in the cloud which we're so
limited right

3322
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
limited right
 

3323
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,210
limited right
so they are in it they are also life

3324
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:29,220
so they are in it they are also life
 

3325
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,190
so they are in it they are also life
have

3326
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
have
 

3327
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,829
have
can soon be become a little bit more

3328
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
can soon be become a little bit more
 

3329
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,750
can soon be become a little bit more
like life 3.0 and that if they need more

3330
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
like life 3.0 and that if they need more
 

3331
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,309
like life 3.0 and that if they need more
Hardware hey just rent it in the cloud

3332
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:37,319
Hardware hey just rent it in the cloud
 

3333
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,710
Hardware hey just rent it in the cloud
you know how do you pay for it well with

3334
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:39,720
you know how do you pay for it well with
 

3335
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,589
you know how do you pay for it well with
all the services you provide

3336
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:42,599
all the services you provide
 

3337
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:44,270
all the services you provide
yeah

3338
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:44,280
yeah
 

3339
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,390
yeah
and what we haven't seen yet

3340
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:47,400
and what we haven't seen yet
 

3341
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,450
and what we haven't seen yet
which could change a lot is uh entire

3342
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:52,460
which could change a lot is uh entire
 

3343
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,549
which could change a lot is uh entire
Software System so right now programming

3344
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:55,559
Software System so right now programming
 

3345
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:58,609
Software System so right now programming
is done sort of in bits and pieces uh as

3346
01:04:58,609 --> 01:04:58,619
is done sort of in bits and pieces uh as
 

3347
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:02,150
is done sort of in bits and pieces uh as
as an assistant tool to humans but I do

3348
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
as an assistant tool to humans but I do
 

3349
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,250
as an assistant tool to humans but I do
a lot of programming and with the kind

3350
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:04,260
a lot of programming and with the kind
 

3351
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,049
a lot of programming and with the kind
of stuff that gbt4 is able to do I mean

3352
01:05:06,049 --> 01:05:06,059
of stuff that gbt4 is able to do I mean
 

3353
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:07,910
of stuff that gbt4 is able to do I mean
it's replacing a lot what I'm able to do

3354
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
it's replacing a lot what I'm able to do
 

3355
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,849
it's replacing a lot what I'm able to do
but I you still need a human in the loop

3356
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:10,859
but I you still need a human in the loop
 

3357
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:13,549
but I you still need a human in the loop
to kind of manage the design of things

3358
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:13,559
to kind of manage the design of things
 

3359
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,010
to kind of manage the design of things
manage like what are the prompts that

3360
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:16,020
manage like what are the prompts that
 

3361
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,990
manage like what are the prompts that
generate the kind of stuff to do some

3362
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
generate the kind of stuff to do some
 

3363
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,910
generate the kind of stuff to do some
basic adjustment of the codes let's do

3364
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:19,920
basic adjustment of the codes let's do
 

3365
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,990
basic adjustment of the codes let's do
some debugging but if it's possible to

3366
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
some debugging but if it's possible to
 

3367
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,530
some debugging but if it's possible to
add on top of GPT for kind of a feedback

3368
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:27,540
add on top of GPT for kind of a feedback
 

3369
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:32,390
add on top of GPT for kind of a feedback
loop of of uh self-debugging improving

3370
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
loop of of uh self-debugging improving
 

3371
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,430
loop of of uh self-debugging improving
the code and then you launch that system

3372
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:34,440
the code and then you launch that system
 

3373
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,990
the code and then you launch that system
out into the wild on the internet

3374
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
out into the wild on the internet
 

3375
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,910
out into the wild on the internet
because everything is connected and have

3376
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
because everything is connected and have
 

3377
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,289
because everything is connected and have
it do things have it interact with

3378
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:39,299
it do things have it interact with
 

3379
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:41,510
it do things have it interact with
humans and then get that feedback now

3380
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
humans and then get that feedback now
 

3381
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,510
humans and then get that feedback now
you have this giant ecosystem yeah of

3382
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,520
you have this giant ecosystem yeah of
 

3383
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,430
you have this giant ecosystem yeah of
humans that's one of the things that uh

3384
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:46,440
humans that's one of the things that uh
 

3385
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,589
humans that's one of the things that uh
yeah Elon Musk recently sort of tweeted

3386
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:48,599
yeah Elon Musk recently sort of tweeted
 

3387
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,349
yeah Elon Musk recently sort of tweeted
as a case why everyone needs to pay

3388
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
as a case why everyone needs to pay
 

3389
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,329
as a case why everyone needs to pay
Seven dollars or whatever for Twitter to

3390
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:53,339
Seven dollars or whatever for Twitter to
 

3391
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:55,309
Seven dollars or whatever for Twitter to
make sure they're real they're make sure

3392
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:55,319
make sure they're real they're make sure
 

3393
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,809
make sure they're real they're make sure
they're real we're now going to be

3394
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:56,819
they're real we're now going to be
 

3395
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,450
they're real we're now going to be
living in a world where the the Bots are

3396
01:05:59,450 --> 01:05:59,460
living in a world where the the Bots are
 

3397
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,250
living in a world where the the Bots are
getting smarter and smarter and smarter

3398
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:01,260
getting smarter and smarter and smarter
 

3399
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,390
getting smarter and smarter and smarter
to a degree where you can't uh you can't

3400
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:05,400
to a degree where you can't uh you can't
 

3401
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,770
to a degree where you can't uh you can't
tell the difference between a human and

3402
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:06,780
tell the difference between a human and
 

3403
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,690
tell the difference between a human and
a bot that's right and now you can have

3404
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:08,700
a bot that's right and now you can have
 

3405
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,930
a bot that's right and now you can have
uh Bots outnumber humans by yeah one

3406
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:11,940
uh Bots outnumber humans by yeah one
 

3407
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,450
uh Bots outnumber humans by yeah one
million to one which is why he's making

3408
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:14,460
million to one which is why he's making
 

3409
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,549
million to one which is why he's making
the case why you have to pay yeah to

3410
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
the case why you have to pay yeah to
 

3411
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,230
the case why you have to pay yeah to
prove you're human which is one of the

3412
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
prove you're human which is one of the
 

3413
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,589
prove you're human which is one of the
only mechanisms which is depressing and

3414
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
only mechanisms which is depressing and
 

3415
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,849
only mechanisms which is depressing and
I yeah I feel we have to remember

3416
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:25,859
I yeah I feel we have to remember
 

3417
01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:27,829
I yeah I feel we have to remember
as individuals we should from time to

3418
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
as individuals we should from time to
 

3419
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,390
as individuals we should from time to
time ask ourselves why are we doing what

3420
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:29,400
time ask ourselves why are we doing what
 

3421
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,010
time ask ourselves why are we doing what
we're doing all right then as a species

3422
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:31,020
we're doing all right then as a species
 

3423
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,930
we're doing all right then as a species
we need to do that too

3424
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:32,940
we need to do that too
 

3425
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,109
we need to do that too
so if we're building as as you say

3426
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:36,119
so if we're building as as you say
 

3427
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,170
so if we're building as as you say
machines that are outnumbering us

3428
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:39,180
machines that are outnumbering us
 

3429
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,930
machines that are outnumbering us
and more and more outsmarting us and and

3430
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:41,940
and more and more outsmarting us and and
 

3431
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,730
and more and more outsmarting us and and
replacing us on the job market not just

3432
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:43,740
replacing us on the job market not just
 

3433
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,190
replacing us on the job market not just
for the dangerous and and boring tasks

3434
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:46,200
for the dangerous and and boring tasks
 

3435
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,370
for the dangerous and and boring tasks
but also for writing poems and doing art

3436
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:49,380
but also for writing poems and doing art
 

3437
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,289
but also for writing poems and doing art
and things that a lot of people find

3438
01:06:51,289 --> 01:06:51,299
and things that a lot of people find
 

3439
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,390
and things that a lot of people find
really meaningful God ask yourself why

3440
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:53,400
really meaningful God ask yourself why
 

3441
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,549
really meaningful God ask yourself why
why are we doing this

3442
01:06:55,549 --> 01:06:55,559
why are we doing this
 

3443
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:59,690
why are we doing this
uh we are the answer is moloch is

3444
01:06:59,690 --> 01:06:59,700
uh we are the answer is moloch is
 

3445
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,789
uh we are the answer is moloch is
tricking us into doing it

3446
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:01,799
tricking us into doing it
 

3447
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:03,589
tricking us into doing it
and it's such a clever trick that even

3448
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:03,599
and it's such a clever trick that even
 

3449
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,870
and it's such a clever trick that even
though we see the trick we still have no

3450
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:05,880
though we see the trick we still have no
 

3451
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,170
though we see the trick we still have no
choice but to fall for it right

3452
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:09,180
choice but to fall for it right
 

3453
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,049
choice but to fall for it right
come also the thing you said about you

3454
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:12,059
come also the thing you said about you
 

3455
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,789
come also the thing you said about you
using uh

3456
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:13,799
using uh
 

3457
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:17,029
using uh
co-pilot AI tools to program faster how

3458
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
co-pilot AI tools to program faster how
 

3459
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,589
co-pilot AI tools to program faster how
many time what factor faster would you

3460
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:18,599
many time what factor faster would you
 

3461
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:21,170
many time what factor faster would you
say your code now does it go twice as

3462
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:21,180
say your code now does it go twice as
 

3463
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,170
say your code now does it go twice as
fast or I don't really

3464
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:24,180
fast or I don't really
 

3465
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,329
fast or I don't really
uh because it's such a new tool yeah

3466
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:26,339
uh because it's such a new tool yeah
 

3467
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,190
uh because it's such a new tool yeah
it's I don't know if speed is

3468
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,200
it's I don't know if speed is
 

3469
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,910
it's I don't know if speed is
significantly improved but it feels like

3470
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
significantly improved but it feels like
 

3471
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,329
significantly improved but it feels like
I'm a year away from being

3472
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:34,339
I'm a year away from being
 

3473
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:37,910
I'm a year away from being
uh five to ten times faster so if that's

3474
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
uh five to ten times faster so if that's
 

3475
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,150
uh five to ten times faster so if that's
typical for programmers then uh you're

3476
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:41,160
typical for programmers then uh you're
 

3477
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,210
typical for programmers then uh you're
already seeing another kind of self

3478
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:44,220
already seeing another kind of self
 

3479
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,190
already seeing another kind of self
recursive self-improvement right because

3480
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:46,200
recursive self-improvement right because
 

3481
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,710
recursive self-improvement right because
previously uh one like a major

3482
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
previously uh one like a major
 

3483
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,990
previously uh one like a major
generation of improvement of the codes

3484
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,000
generation of improvement of the codes
 

3485
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,270
generation of improvement of the codes
would happen on the human r d time scale

3486
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:53,280
would happen on the human r d time scale
 

3487
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,329
would happen on the human r d time scale
and now if that's five times shorter

3488
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:56,339
and now if that's five times shorter
 

3489
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,829
and now if that's five times shorter
then it's going to take five times less

3490
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
then it's going to take five times less
 

3491
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,690
then it's going to take five times less
time than it otherwise would to develop

3492
01:07:59,690 --> 01:07:59,700
time than it otherwise would to develop
 

3493
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,390
time than it otherwise would to develop
the next level of these tools and so on

3494
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,400
the next level of these tools and so on
 

3495
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,510
the next level of these tools and so on
so this these These are the this is

3496
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
so this these These are the this is
 

3497
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,430
so this these These are the this is
exactly the sort of beginning of an of

3498
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
exactly the sort of beginning of an of
 

3499
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,589
exactly the sort of beginning of an of
an intelligence explosion they can be

3500
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
an intelligence explosion they can be
 

3501
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,210
an intelligence explosion they can be
humans in the loop a lot in the early

3502
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:11,220
humans in the loop a lot in the early
 

3503
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,730
humans in the loop a lot in the early
stages and then eventually humans are

3504
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:13,740
stages and then eventually humans are
 

3505
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,109
stages and then eventually humans are
needed less and less and the machines

3506
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
needed less and less and the machines
 

3507
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,150
needed less and less and the machines
can more kind of go along but you what

3508
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:17,160
can more kind of go along but you what
 

3509
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,610
can more kind of go along but you what
you said there is just an exact example

3510
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:19,620
you said there is just an exact example
 

3511
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,349
you said there is just an exact example
of these sort of things another thing

3512
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
of these sort of things another thing
 

3513
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,370
of these sort of things another thing
which which um

3514
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:25,380

 

3515
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,590

I was kind of lying on my psychiatrist

3516
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,600
I was kind of lying on my psychiatrist
 

3517
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,510
I was kind of lying on my psychiatrist
imagining I'm on a psychiatrist's couch

3518
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
imagining I'm on a psychiatrist's couch
 

3519
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,130
imagining I'm on a psychiatrist's couch
here saying what are my fears that

3520
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:31,140
here saying what are my fears that
 

3521
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,110
here saying what are my fears that
people would do with um AI systems

3522
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
people would do with um AI systems
 

3523
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:33,829
people would do with um AI systems
another

3524
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:33,839
another
 

3525
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,470
another
so I mentioned three that I had fears

3526
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480
so I mentioned three that I had fears
 

3527
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,729
so I mentioned three that I had fears
about many years ago that they would do

3528
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:37,739
about many years ago that they would do
 

3529
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:41,570
about many years ago that they would do
uh namely uh teacher the code uh

3530
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:41,580
uh namely uh teacher the code uh
 

3531
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,669
uh namely uh teacher the code uh
connected to the internet then teach it

3532
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
connected to the internet then teach it
 

3533
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,789
connected to the internet then teach it
to manipulate humans a fourth one is

3534
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
to manipulate humans a fourth one is
 

3535
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,269
to manipulate humans a fourth one is
building an API

3536
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:49,279
building an API
 

3537
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,130
building an API
where code can control all the super

3538
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:52,140
where code can control all the super
 

3539
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,990
where code can control all the super
powerful thing right that is very

3540
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
powerful thing right that is very
 

3541
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,990
powerful thing right that is very
unfortunate because one thing that

3542
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,000
unfortunate because one thing that
 

3543
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,630
unfortunate because one thing that
systems like gpt4 have going for them is

3544
01:08:59,630 --> 01:08:59,640
systems like gpt4 have going for them is
 

3545
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,490
systems like gpt4 have going for them is
that they are an Oracle in the sense

3546
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:01,500
that they are an Oracle in the sense
 

3547
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,789
that they are an Oracle in the sense
that they just answer questions there's

3548
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
that they just answer questions there's
 

3549
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,789
that they just answer questions there's
no robot connected to the gpt4 gpt4

3557
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,490
intelligent agent is something that

more powerful that's another kind of um
unfortunate development which I think we

3586
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,100
unfortunate development which I think we
 

3587
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,570
unfortunate development which I think we
would have been better off uh delaying I

3588

3594
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
lot of pressure to make money yeah

01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
and um
 

3597
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,370
and um
again we the reason we're calling for

3598
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:04,380
again we the reason we're calling for
 

3599

again we the reason we're calling for
this pause is to give them all cover to

01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:06,600
this pause is to give them all cover to
 

3601
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,510
this pause is to give them all cover to
do what they know is the right thing

3602
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:08,520
do what they know is the right thing
 

3603
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,270
do what they know is the right thing
slow down a little bit at this point but

3604
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
slow down a little bit at this point but
 

3605
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,630
slow down a little bit at this point but
everything we've talked about I hope

3606
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
everything we've talked about I hope
 

3607
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,790
everything we've talked about I hope
will can will make it clear that people

3608
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:16,800
will can will make it clear that people
 

3609
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,570
will can will make it clear that people
watching this you know why

3610
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:20,580

 

3611
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,370

these sort of human level tools can

3612
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:22,380
these sort of human level tools can
 

3613
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,990
these sort of human level tools can
cause a gradual acceleration you keep

01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,000
cause a gradual acceleration you keep
 

3615

tomorrow's technology yeah and when you
 

3619
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,209
tomorrow's technology yeah and when you
do

3620
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:29,219
do
 

3621
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:30,830
do
that over and over again you naturally

3622
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:30,840
that over and over again you naturally
 

3623
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,810
that over and over again you naturally
get an explosion you know that's the

3624
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:32,820
get an explosion you know that's the
 

3625
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,610
get an explosion you know that's the
definition of an explosion in science

3626
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:34,620
definition of an explosion in science
 

3627
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,350
definition of an explosion in science
right like

3628
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
right like
 

3629
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,930
right like
if you have

3630
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:38,940
if you have
 

3631
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,970
if you have
two people

3632
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:40,980
two people
 

3633
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,550
two people
um they fall in love now you have four

3634
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:43,560
um they fall in love now you have four
 

3635
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,770
um they fall in love now you have four
people and then they can make more

3636
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:45,780
people and then they can make more
 

3637
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,390
people and then they can make more
babies and now you have eight people and

3638
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:47,400
babies and now you have eight people and
 

3639
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,870
babies and now you have eight people and
then then you have 16 32 64 Etc that's

3640
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
then then you have 16 32 64 Etc that's
 

3641
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,910
then then you have 16 32 64 Etc that's
we call that a population explosion

3642
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:52,920
we call that a population explosion
 

3643
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,010
we call that a population explosion
where it's just that each

3644
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:55,020
where it's just that each
 

3645
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,490
where it's just that each
if it's instead free neutrons in a

3646
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:58,500
if it's instead free neutrons in a
 

3647
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,010
if it's instead free neutrons in a
nuclear reaction that if H1 can make

3648
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,020
nuclear reaction that if H1 can make
 

3649
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,689
nuclear reaction that if H1 can make
more than one then you get an

3650
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:02,699
more than one then you get an
 

3651
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:04,189
more than one then you get an
exponential growth in that we call it a

3652
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:04,199
exponential growth in that we call it a
 

3653
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:06,709
exponential growth in that we call it a
nuclear explosion all explosions are

3654
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:06,719
nuclear explosion all explosions are
 

3655
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,090
nuclear explosion all explosions are
like that and an intelligence explosion

3656
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:08,100
like that and an intelligence explosion
 

3657
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,410
like that and an intelligence explosion
it's just exactly the same principle

3658
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:09,420
it's just exactly the same principle
 

3659
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,910
it's just exactly the same principle
that some quantity some amount of

3660
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:10,920
that some quantity some amount of
 

3661
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,310
that some quantity some amount of
intelligence can make more intelligence

3662
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:13,320
intelligence can make more intelligence
 

3663
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,130
intelligence can make more intelligence
than that and then repeat you always get

3664
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:16,140
than that and then repeat you always get
 

3665
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,510
than that and then repeat you always get
exponentials

3666
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
exponentials
 

3667
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,310
exponentials
what's your intuition why does you

3668
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:19,320
what's your intuition why does you
 

3669
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,050
what's your intuition why does you
mention there's some technical reasons

3670
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,060
mention there's some technical reasons
 

3671
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,209
mention there's some technical reasons
why it doesn't stop at a certain point

3672
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:23,219
why it doesn't stop at a certain point
 

3673
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,270
why it doesn't stop at a certain point
what's your intuition and uh do you have

3674
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:26,280
what's your intuition and uh do you have
 

3675
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,189
what's your intuition and uh do you have
any intuition why it might stop

3676
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:28,199
any intuition why it might stop
 

3677
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:29,810
any intuition why it might stop
it's obviously going to stop when it

3678
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:29,820
it's obviously going to stop when it
 

3679
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,550
it's obviously going to stop when it

there are some things you just can't do

3682
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:33,000
there are some things you just can't do
 

3683
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,250
there are some things you just can't do
no matter how smart you are right

3684
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:34,260
no matter how smart you are right

the speed of light stuff like that but

3704
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,260
the speed of light stuff like that but
 

3705
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,890
the speed of light stuff like that but
uh it's hard to store

3706
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:57,900
uh it's hard to store
 

3707
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,550
uh it's hard to store

are just astronomically above like 30

3712
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:07,260
are just astronomically above like 30
 

3713
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,810
are just astronomically above like 30

orders of magnitude above where we are
 

3715
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,130
orders of magnitude above where we are
now so no

an ant to a human
 

3723
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,350
an ant to a human
I think

3724
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
I think
 

3725
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,050
I think
of course what we want to do is have

3726
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:24,060
of course what we want to do is have
 

3727
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,090
of course what we want to do is have
have a controlled

3728
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:26,100
have a controlled
 

3729
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,830
have a controlled
thing the nuclear reactor you put

3730
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
thing the nuclear reactor you put
 

3731
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,750
thing the nuclear reactor you put
moderators in to make sure exactly it

3732
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
moderators in to make sure exactly it
 

3733
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,750
moderators in to make sure exactly it
doesn't blow up out of control right

3734
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
doesn't blow up out of control right
 

3735
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,450
doesn't blow up out of control right
when we do um

3736
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:35,460
when we do um
 

3737
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,910
when we do um
experiments with Biology and cells and

3738
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
experiments with Biology and cells and
 

3739
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,290
experiments with Biology and cells and
so on you know we also try to make sure

3740
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:39,300
so on you know we also try to make sure
 

3741
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,149
so on you know we also try to make sure
it doesn't get out of control

3742
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:41,159
it doesn't get out of control
 

3743
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,370
it doesn't get out of control
um

3744
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:42,380
um
 

3745
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,890
um
we can do this with ai2 the thing is we

3746
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:45,900
we can do this with ai2 the thing is we
 

3747
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,470
we can do this with ai2 the thing is we
haven't succeeded yet and Morlock is

3748
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
haven't succeeded yet and Morlock is
 

3749
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,510
haven't succeeded yet and Morlock is
exactly

3750
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:50,520
exactly
 

3751
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,510
exactly

really those we have to want this stuff

3762
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:03,420
really those we have to want this stuff
 

3763
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,470
really those we have to want this stuff
we have and and I don't believe in this

3764
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
we have and and I don't believe in this
 

3765

we have and and I don't believe in this
just asking people to look into their

3766
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:09,060
just asking people to look into their
 

3767
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,090
just asking people to look into their
hearts and do the right thing it's

01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:11,100
hearts and do the right thing it's
 

3769
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,070
hearts and do the right thing it's
easier for others to say that but like

3770
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:13,080
easier for others to say that but like
 

3771
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,169
easier for others to say that but like
if if you're in a situation where your

3772
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:15,179
if if you're in a situation where your
 

3773
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:18,110
if if you're in a situation where your
company is going to get screwed

3774
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:18,120
company is going to get screwed
 

3775
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,830
company is going to get screwed
if you

3776
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:20,840
if you

01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,390
if you
by other companies that are not stopping

01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:23,400
by other companies that are not stopping
 

3779
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,830
by other companies that are not stopping
you know you're putting people in a very

3780
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:24,840
you know you're putting people in a very
 

3781
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,930
you know you're putting people in a very
hard situation the the right thing to do

3782
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:26,940
hard situation the the right thing to do
 

3783
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,550
hard situation the the right thing to do
is change the whole incentive structure

3784
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
is change the whole incentive structure
 

3785
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,689
is change the whole incentive structure
instead

3786
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:29,699
instead
 

3787
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:32,229
instead
and and this is not an old

3788
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
and and this is not an old
 

3789
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,250
and and this is not an old
maybe I should say one more thing about

3790
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:34,260
maybe I should say one more thing about
 

3791
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,890
maybe I should say one more thing about
this because molok has been around as

01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:36,900
this because molok has been around as

number one or number two enemy since the

3796
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
number one or number two enemy since the
 

3797
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,149
number one or number two enemy since the
beginning of civilization and we came up

3798
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
beginning of civilization and we came up
 

3799
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,010
beginning of civilization and we came up
with some really cool counter measures

3800
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:46,020
with some really cool counter measures
 

3801
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,709
with some really cool counter measures
like first of all already over a hundred

3802
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:48,719
like first of all already over a hundred
 

3803
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,770
like first of all already over a hundred
thousand years ago Evolution realized

3804
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:51,780
thousand years ago Evolution realized
 

3805
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,330
thousand years ago Evolution realized
that it was very unhelpful that people

3806
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:53,340
that it was very unhelpful that people
 

3807
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,830
that it was very unhelpful that people
kept killing each other all the time

3808
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:54,840
kept killing each other all the time
 

3809
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,830
kept killing each other all the time
yeah so it genetically

3810
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
yeah so it genetically
 

3811
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,350
yeah so it genetically
gave us compassion

3812
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:00,360
gave us compassion
 

3813
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,810
gave us compassion
and made it so that it like if you get

3814
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:02,820
and made it so that it like if you get
 

3815
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,669
and made it so that it like if you get
two drunk dudes getting into a pointless

3816
01:14:04,669 --> 01:14:04,679
two drunk dudes getting into a pointless
 

3817
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,470
two drunk dudes getting into a pointless
bar fight

3818
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,480
bar fight
 

3819
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,090
bar fight
they might give each other black eyes

3820
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:08,100
they might give each other black eyes
 

3821
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,729
they might give each other black eyes
but they have a lot of inhibition

3822
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:10,739
but they have a lot of inhibition
 

3823
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:14,110
but they have a lot of inhibition
towards towards just killing each other

3824
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:14,120
towards towards just killing each other
 

3825
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,970
towards towards just killing each other
that's a gen and similarly if you find a

3826
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:16,980
that's a gen and similarly if you find a

own incentive now is not to do this
 

3859
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,130

incentives to our corporations by having
 

3901

aligned with the greater good we've
 

3907
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,450
aligned with the greater good we've
tried really hard

3908

tried really hard
 

3909
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,750
tried really hard
um and um the the big problem that we're

3910
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:53,760
um and um the the big problem that we're
 

3911
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,490
um and um the the big problem that we're
failing now

3912
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:55,500
failing now
 

3913
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,770
failing now
is not that we haven't tried before but

3914
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:57,780
is not that we haven't tried before but
 

3915
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,450
is not that we haven't tried before but
it's just that the tech is growing much

it it got put in to the draft and it
looked like all was good and then there

01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,050
yeah there were more lobbyists in
Brussels from tech companies and from

01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:00,060
Brussels from tech companies and from
 

3971
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,530
Brussels from tech companies and from
oil companies for example and it looked

3972
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:03,540
oil companies for example and it looked
 

3973
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,910
oil companies for example and it looked
like it might it's going to maybe get

3974
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:04,920
like it might it's going to maybe get
 

3975
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,530
like it might it's going to maybe get
taken out again

3976
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:06,540
taken out again
 

3977
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,870
taken out again
and now gpt4 happened

3978
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
and now gpt4 happened
 

3979
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,850
and now gpt4 happened
and I think it's going to stay in but

3980
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:10,860
and I think it's going to stay in but
 

3981

be defeated
but the the challenge we're facing is

3986
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
but the the challenge we're facing is
 

3987
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,330
but the the challenge we're facing is
that the tech is generally much faster

3988
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:20,340
that the tech is generally much faster
 

3989
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,250
that the tech is generally much faster
than what the

3990
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:22,260
than what the
 

3991
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,229
than what the
policymakers are

3992
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
policymakers are
 

3993
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,030
policymakers are
and a lot of the policy makers also

3994
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,040
and a lot of the policy makers also
 

3995
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,510
and a lot of the policy makers also
don't have a tech background so it's you

3996
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
don't have a tech background so it's you
 

3997
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,370
don't have a tech background so it's you
know we really need to work hard to

3998
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:31,380
know we really need to work hard to
 

3999
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,410
know we really need to work hard to
educate them on on how on what's taking

4000
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:33,420
educate them on on how on what's taking
 

4001
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,729
educate them on on how on what's taking
place here

4002
01:17:34,729 --> 01:17:34,739
place here
 

4003
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:37,430
place here
so so we're getting the situation where

4004
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
so so we're getting the situation where
 

4005
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,130
so so we're getting the situation where
the first kind of non so you know I

4006
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:40,140
the first kind of non so you know I
 

4007
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,689
the first kind of non so you know I
Define artificial intelligence just as

01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:41,699
Define artificial intelligence just as
 

4009
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,510
Define artificial intelligence just as
non-biological intelligence right

4010
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:44,520
non-biological intelligence right
 

4011
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,209
non-biological intelligence right
and by that definition

4012
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:47,219
and by that definition
 

4013
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:49,729
and by that definition
a company a corporation is also an

a company a corporation is also an
 

4015

a company a corporation is also an

4016
01:17:51,169 --> 01:17:51,179
artificial intelligence because the
 

4017
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:52,910
artificial intelligence because the
corporation isn't it's humans it's the

01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:52,920
corporation isn't it's humans it's the
 

4019

you also have to align the incentives of

corporations have gotten so big and so
 

4049
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,970

powerful very quickly and that in many

The Regulators to what they want rather

4054
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:31,560
The Regulators to what they want rather
 

4055
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,729
The Regulators to what they want rather
than the other way around the classic

than the other way around the classic
 

4057
01:18:33,739 --> 01:18:37,790

regulatory capture right is is uh the

4058
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:37,800
regulatory capture right is is uh the
 

4059
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,490
regulatory capture right is is uh the
thing that the Slowdown hopes to achieve

4060
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:40,500
thing that the Slowdown hopes to achieve
 

4061
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,709
thing that the Slowdown hopes to achieve
is give enough time to the regulars to

4062
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:42,719
is give enough time to the regulars to
 

4063
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,169
is give enough time to the regulars to
catch up or enough time to the companies

4064
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:45,179
catch up or enough time to the companies
 

4065
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,090
catch up or enough time to the companies
themselves to breathe and understand how

4066
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,100
themselves to breathe and understand how
 

4067
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,910
themselves to breathe and understand how
to do AI safety correctly I think both

4068
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
to do AI safety correctly I think both
 

4069
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,430
to do AI safety correctly I think both
and but I think that the vision the path

4070
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:52,440
and but I think that the vision the path
 

4071
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,070
and but I think that the vision the path
to success I see is first you give a

4072
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:55,080
to success I see is first you give a
 

4073
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,930
to success I see is first you give a
breather actually to to the people in

4074
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:56,940
breather actually to to the people in
 

4075
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,209
breather actually to to the people in
these companies their leadership who

4076
01:18:59,209 --> 01:18:59,219
these companies their leadership who
 

4077
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:00,770
these companies their leadership who
wants to do the right thing and they all

4078
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:00,780
wants to do the right thing and they all
 

4079
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,330
wants to do the right thing and they all
have safety teams and so on other

4080
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,340
have safety teams and so on other
 

4081
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,209
have safety teams and so on other
companies give them a chance to

4082
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:05,219
companies give them a chance to
 

4083
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:08,270
companies give them a chance to
get together with the other companies

4084
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:08,280
get together with the other companies
 

4085
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,250
get together with the other companies
and the outside pressure can also help

4086
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:10,260
and the outside pressure can also help
 

4087
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,310
and the outside pressure can also help
catalyze that right

4088
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:12,320
catalyze that right
 

4089
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,649
catalyze that right
and and work out

4090
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:15,659
and and work out
 

4091
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:18,530
and and work out
what is it that's

4092
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:18,540
what is it that's
 

4093
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,630
what is it that's
what are the reasonable safety

4094
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640
what are the reasonable safety
 

4095
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,010
what are the reasonable safety
requirements one should put on future

4096
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:22,020
requirements one should put on future
 

4097
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,890
requirements one should put on future
systems before they get rolled out

4098
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:24,900
systems before they get rolled out
 

4099
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,870
systems before they get rolled out
there are a lot of people also in

4100
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
there are a lot of people also in
 

4101
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,610
there are a lot of people also in
Academia and elsewhere outside of these

4102
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:28,620
Academia and elsewhere outside of these
 

4103
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,229
Academia and elsewhere outside of these
companies who can be brought into this

4104
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
companies who can be brought into this
 

4105
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,570
companies who can be brought into this
and have a lot of very good ideas

4106
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:32,580
and have a lot of very good ideas
 

4107
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,189
and have a lot of very good ideas
and then um

4108
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:34,199
and then um
 

4109
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:36,110
and then um
I think it's very realistic that within

4110
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,120
I think it's very realistic that within
 

4111
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,850
I think it's very realistic that within
six months

4112
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:37,860
six months
 

4113
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,010
six months
you can get these people coming up so

4114
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:40,020
you can get these people coming up so
 

4115
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,689
you can get these people coming up so
here's a white paper here's where we all

4116
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:41,699
here's a white paper here's where we all
 

4117
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:44,090
here's a white paper here's where we all
think it's reasonable

4118
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:44,100
think it's reasonable
 

4119
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,070
think it's reasonable
um you know you didn't just because cars

4120
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:46,080
um you know you didn't just because cars
 

4121
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,330
um you know you didn't just because cars
killed a lot of people they didn't ban

4122
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:47,340
killed a lot of people they didn't ban
 

4123
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,550
killed a lot of people they didn't ban
cars but they got together a bunch of

4124
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:49,560
cars but they got together a bunch of
 

4125
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,169
cars but they got together a bunch of
people and decided you know in order to

4126
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:51,179
people and decided you know in order to
 

4127
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:52,970
people and decided you know in order to
be allowed to sell a car it has to have

4128
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:52,980
be allowed to sell a car it has to have
 

4129
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,709
be allowed to sell a car it has to have
a seat belt in them

4130
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
a seat belt in them
 

4131
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,229
a seat belt in them
they're the analogous things that you

4132
01:19:57,229 --> 01:19:57,239
they're the analogous things that you
 

4133
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,570
they're the analogous things that you
can start requiring a future AI systems

4134
01:19:59,570 --> 01:19:59,580
can start requiring a future AI systems
 

4135
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:02,930
can start requiring a future AI systems
so that they are are safe

4136
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:02,940
so that they are are safe
 

4137
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:08,330
so that they are are safe
and uh once this have this heavy lifting

4138
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:08,340
and uh once this have this heavy lifting

01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,930
quickly
I think it's beginning to be quite easy

4146
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:14,940
I think it's beginning to be quite easy
 

4147
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,330
I think it's beginning to be quite easy
to get policy makers to

4148
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:17,340
to get policy makers to
 

4149
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:20,030
to get policy makers to
to see yeah this is a good idea and it's

4150
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:20,040
to see yeah this is a good idea and it's
 

4151
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,010
to see yeah this is a good idea and it's
it's you know

4152
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,020
it's you know
 

4153
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,050
it's you know
for the fight for the companies to fight

4154
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:24,060
for the fight for the companies to fight

they want and I I believe Sam Altman has

01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
they want and I I believe Sam Altman has
 

4159
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,750
they want and I I believe Sam Altman has
explicitly called for this they want The

4160
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
explicitly called for this they want The
 

4161
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,430
explicitly called for this they want The
Regulators to actually adopt it so that

4162
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
Regulators to actually adopt it so that
 

4163
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,110
Regulators to actually adopt it so that
their competition is going to abide by

4164
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
their competition is going to abide by
 

4165
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,270
their competition is going to abide by
it too right you don't want

4166
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:35,280
it too right you don't want
 

4167
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,010
it too right you don't want
uh

4168
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:37,020
uh
 

4169
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,350
uh
you don't want to be invade enacting all

4170
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
you don't want to be invade enacting all
 

4171
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,850
you don't want to be invade enacting all
these principles then you abide by them

4172
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:40,860
these principles then you abide by them
 

4173
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,130
these principles then you abide by them
and then there's this one little

4174
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:43,140
and then there's this one little
 

4175
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,229
and then there's this one little
company that

4176
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:45,239
company that
 

4177
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,689
company that
doesn't sign on to it and then now they

4178
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:47,699
doesn't sign on to it and then now they
 

4179
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:50,270
doesn't sign on to it and then now they
can gradually overtake you then the

4180
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:50,280
can gradually overtake you then the
 

4181
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,790
can gradually overtake you then the
companies will get

4182
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
companies will get
 

4183
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,770
companies will get

4184
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:54,780
be able to sleep it's secure knowing
 

4185
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,970
be able to sleep it's secure knowing
that everybody's playing by the same

4186
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:55,980
that everybody's playing by the same
 

4187
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,890
that everybody's playing by the same
rules so do you think it's possible to

4188
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:57,900
rules so do you think it's possible to
 

4189
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,709
rules so do you think it's possible to
develop guard rails

4190
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
develop guard rails
 

4191
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,649
develop guard rails
that keep the systems from

that in many other sectors where you've

4208
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,260
that in many other sectors where you've
 

4209
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,050
that in many other sectors where you've
had the free market produce quite good

um when the guardrails are there and

4216
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,000
um when the guardrails are there and
 

4217
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,950
um when the guardrails are there and
they work

4218
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
they work
 

4219
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,530
they work
you know

4220
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:32,540
you know

01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,910
you know
capitalism is very effective good way of

01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:34,920
capitalism is very effective good way of

optimizing for just getting the same

4224
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:36,780
optimizing for just getting the same
 

4225
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,169
optimizing for just getting the same
things done more efficiently it was but

4226
01:21:39,169 --> 01:21:39,179
things done more efficiently it was but
 

4227
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:40,310
things done more efficiently it was but
it was good you know and like in

4228
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,320
it was good you know and like in
 

4229
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,649
it was good you know and like in
hindsight and I never met anyone

4230
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:42,659
hindsight and I never met anyone
 

4231
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:45,229
hindsight and I never met anyone
even

4232
01:21:45,229 --> 01:21:45,239

 

4233
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:48,649

on parties way over on the right in in

4234
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:48,659
on parties way over on the right in in
 

4235
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,390

any country who think it was a bad

4236
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
any country who think it was a bad
 

4237
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,030
any country who think it was a bad
thinks it was a terrible idea to ban

4238
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,040
thinks it was a terrible idea to ban
 

4239
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,070
thinks it was a terrible idea to ban
child labor for example so

4240
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:55,080
child labor for example so
 

4241
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,350
child labor for example so
yeah but it seems like this particular

4242
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
yeah but it seems like this particular
 

4243
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,689
yeah but it seems like this particular
technology has gotten so good so fast

4244
01:21:59,689 --> 01:21:59,699
technology has gotten so good so fast
 

4245
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,010
technology has gotten so good so fast
become

4246
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:01,020
become
 

4247
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,330
become
powerful

4248
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:02,340
powerful
 

4249
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,910
powerful
to a degree where you could see in the

4250
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:04,920
to a degree where you could see in the
 

4251
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,770
to a degree where you could see in the
near term the ability to make a lot of

4252
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:06,780
near term the ability to make a lot of
 

4253
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,470
near term the ability to make a lot of
money and to put guard rails develop

4254
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:09,480
money and to put guard rails develop
 

4255
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,970
money and to put guard rails develop
guard rails quickly in that kind of

4256
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:10,980
guard rails quickly in that kind of
 

4257
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,570
guard rails quickly in that kind of
contact seems to be tricky it's not uh

4258
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,580
contact seems to be tricky it's not uh
 

4259
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,209
contact seems to be tricky it's not uh
similar to cars or child labor it seems

4260
01:22:17,209 --> 01:22:17,219
similar to cars or child labor it seems
 

4261
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:19,070
similar to cars or child labor it seems
like the opportunity to make a lot of

4262
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:19,080
like the opportunity to make a lot of
 

4263
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,189
like the opportunity to make a lot of
money here very quickly is right here

4264
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:22,199
money here very quickly is right here
 

4265
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:32,229
money here very quickly is right here
before so again there's this cliff

4266
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239

 

4267
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,189

on the ground you can pick up or

4268
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:34,199
on the ground you can pick up or
 

4269
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,510
on the ground you can pick up or
whatever so you want to drive there very

4270
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:35,520
whatever so you want to drive there very
 

4271
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,850
whatever so you want to drive there very
fast but it's not in anyone's incentive

4272
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:37,860
fast but it's not in anyone's incentive
 

4273
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,410
fast but it's not in anyone's incentive
that we go over the cliff and it's not

4274
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:39,420
that we go over the cliff and it's not
 

4275
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,270
that we go over the cliff and it's not
like everybody's in their own car all

4276
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
like everybody's in their own car all
 

4277
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,770
like everybody's in their own car all
the cars are connected together with a

4278
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:42,780
the cars are connected together with a
 

4279
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,169
the cars are connected together with a
chain yeah so if anyone goes over

4280
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:45,179
chain yeah so if anyone goes over
 

4281
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:46,610
chain yeah so if anyone goes over
they'll start dragging others down the

4282
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:46,620
they'll start dragging others down the
 

4283
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,490
they'll start dragging others down the
other's down too and so ultimately it's

4284
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:49,500
other's down too and so ultimately it's
 

4285
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,709
other's down too and so ultimately it's
in the selfish

4286
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:51,719
in the selfish
 

4287
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:53,870
in the selfish
interests also of the people in the

4288
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:53,880
interests also of the people in the
 

4289
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,610
interests also of the people in the
companies to to

4290
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:55,620
companies to to
 

4291
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,590
companies to to
slow down when the when it just start

4292
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
slow down when the when it just start
 

4293
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,630
slow down when the when it just start
seeing the characters of The Cliff there

4294
01:22:59,630 --> 01:22:59,640
seeing the characters of The Cliff there
 

4295
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,430
seeing the characters of The Cliff there
in front of you right and the problem is

4296
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,440
in front of you right and the problem is
 

4297
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,410
in front of you right and the problem is
that um even though the people who are

4298
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:03,420
that um even though the people who are
 

4299
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,390
that um even though the people who are
building the technology

4300
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:05,400
building the technology
 

4301
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,530
building the technology
and the CEOs they really get it the

01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:09,540
and the CEOs they really get it the

it struck me recently that the what's

01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:14,100
it struck me recently that the what's
 

4361
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,470
it struck me recently that the what's
happening with capitalism here is

4362
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:15,480
happening with capitalism here is
 

4363
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,090
happening with capitalism here is
exactly analogous to the way in which

that's going to start making things

01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,570
that's going to start making things
worse for you again and then gradually

01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:20,580
the way I think of the proof is like
 

4425
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,750
the way I think of the proof is like
suppose you want to go from here

4426
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
suppose you want to go from here
 

4427
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,270
suppose you want to go from here
back to Austin for example and you're

4428
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:26,280
back to Austin for example and you're
 

4429
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:29,270
back to Austin for example and you're
like okay yeah let's just let's go south

4430
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
like okay yeah let's just let's go south
 

4431
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,070
like okay yeah let's just let's go south
but you put in exactly the right sort of

4432
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,080
but you put in exactly the right sort of
 

4433
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,930
but you put in exactly the right sort of
the right direction just optimize that

4434
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:32,940
the right direction just optimize that
 

4435
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,850
the right direction just optimize that
South as possible you get closer and

4436
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:34,860
South as possible you get closer and
 

4437
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,130
South as possible you get closer and
closer to Austin

4438
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:37,140
closer to Austin
 

4439
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,850
closer to Austin
but uh you there's always some little

4440
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:39,860
but uh you there's always some little
 

4441
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:43,729
but uh you there's always some little
error So you you're not going exactly

4442
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:43,739
error So you you're not going exactly
 

4443
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:45,110
error So you you're not going exactly
towards Austin but you get pretty close

4444
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,120
towards Austin but you get pretty close
 

4445
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,850
towards Austin but you get pretty close
but eventually you start going away

4446
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:46,860
but eventually you start going away
 

4447
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,350
but eventually you start going away
again and eventually you're going to be

4448
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:48,360
again and eventually you're going to be
 

4449
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,350
again and eventually you're going to be
leaving the solar system yeah and they

01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,669
leaving the solar system yeah and they
they proved it's a beautiful

on why it's a bad idea to have ai just
 

4467
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,810
on why it's a bad idea to have ai just
blindly optimize something that's what

01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:08,820
blindly optimize something that's what
 

4469
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,970
blindly optimize something that's what
pretty much all our systems do yeah we

4470
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:10,980
pretty much all our systems do yeah we
 

4471
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,229
pretty much all our systems do yeah we
have something called the loss function

4472
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:12,239
have something called the loss function
 

4473
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,850
have something called the loss function
that we're just minimizing or reward

4474
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:13,860
that we're just minimizing or reward
 

4475
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,530
that we're just minimizing or reward
function we just minimize maximizing

and um

4480
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,100

 

4481
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,610

capitalism is exactly like that too we

4482
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:22,620
capitalism is exactly like that too we
 

4483
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,550
capitalism is exactly like that too we
want we wanted to get stuff done more

4484
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:25,560
want we wanted to get stuff done more
 

4485
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,910
want we wanted to get stuff done more
efficiently that people wanted so

4486
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:28,920
efficiently that people wanted so
 

4487
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,209

introduce the free market

4488
01:26:32,209 --> 01:26:32,219

 

4489
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:33,830

things got done much more efficiently

4490
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
things got done much more efficiently
 

4491
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,110
things got done much more efficiently
than they did in

4492
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:36,120
than they did in
 

4493
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:41,030
than they did in
say communism right and it got better

4494
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,040
say communism right and it got better
 

4495
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,270
say communism right and it got better
but then it just kept optimizing it and

4496
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,280
but then it just kept optimizing it and
 

4497
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,129
but then it just kept optimizing it and
kept optimizing and you got every bigger

4498
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:46,139
kept optimizing and you got every bigger
 

4499
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:47,390
kept optimizing and you got every bigger
companies and every more efficient

4500
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:47,400
companies and every more efficient
 

4501
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,610

information processing and now also very

4502
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:49,620

4503
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,189

4505
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:54,890
much powered by it
and uh eventually a lot of people are

4506
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:54,900
and uh eventually a lot of people are
 

4507
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,330
and uh eventually a lot of people are
beginning to feel wait we're kind of

01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:56,340
beginning to feel wait we're kind of
 

4509
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,070
beginning to feel wait we're kind of

01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
we just chop down half the rainforest
 

4513
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,930
we just chop down half the rainforest
you know and why why did suddenly these

4514
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:02,940
you know and why why did suddenly these
 

4515
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,910

01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:04,920
Regulators get
 

4517
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,669
Regulators get
captured by lobbyists and so on it's

4518
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:07,679
captured by lobbyists and so on it's
 

4519
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,169
captured by lobbyists and so on it's
just the same optimization that's been

01:27:09,169 --> 01:27:09,179
just the same optimization that's been

but um

4536
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:24,840
but um
 

4537
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,810
but um
it's almost impossible to give it

4538
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:26,820
it's almost impossible to give it
 

4539
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:29,570
it's almost impossible to give it
exactly the right direction to optimize

4540
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:29,580
exactly the right direction to optimize
 

4541
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,629
exactly the right direction to optimize
in and then

4542
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:31,639
in and then
 

4543
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:34,310
in and then
eventually all hey Breaks Loose right

4544
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
eventually all hey Breaks Loose right
 

4545
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,590
eventually all hey Breaks Loose right

4553
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,370
cure cancer or something and that's all
you tell it maybe it's going to decide

4554
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:46,380
you tell it maybe it's going to decide
 

4555
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,470
you tell it maybe it's going to decide
to

to
 

4557
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,410
to
take over entire continents just so we

take over entire continents just so we
 

4559
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,149
take over entire continents just so we
can get more super computer facilities

can get more super computer facilities
 

4561

01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:56,880
and then you're like wait that's not
 

4567
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,870

01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,010
you should worry about
super intelligence because it's the same

4630
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:04,020
super intelligence because it's the same
 

4631
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,649
super intelligence because it's the same
villain in both cases it's more like and

4632
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:06,659
villain in both cases it's more like and
 

4633
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:10,090
villain in both cases it's more like and
optimizing one objective function

4634
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:10,100
optimizing one objective function
 

4635
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,250
optimizing one objective function
aggressively blindly is going to take us

4636
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:13,260
aggressively blindly is going to take us
 

4637
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,290
aggressively blindly is going to take us
there yeah we have this pause from time

4638
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,300
there yeah we have this pause from time
 

4639
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:19,550
there yeah we have this pause from time
to time and look into our hearts and ask

4640
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:19,560
to time and look into our hearts and ask
 

4641
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,250
to time and look into our hearts and ask
why are we doing this is this uh am I

4642
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:22,260
why are we doing this is this uh am I
 

4643
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,930
why are we doing this is this uh am I
still going towards Austin or have I

4644
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:23,940
still going towards Austin or have I
 

4645
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,030
still going towards Austin or have I
gone too far you know maybe we should

4646
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:26,040
gone too far you know maybe we should
 

4647
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,290
gone too far you know maybe we should
change direction

4648
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:27,300
change direction
 

4649
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,530
change direction
and that is the idea behind the halt for

4650
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:30,540
and that is the idea behind the halt for
 

4651
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,450
and that is the idea behind the halt for
six months what six months it seems like

4652
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:32,460
six months what six months it seems like
 

4653
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,790
six months what six months it seems like
a very short period just can we just

4654
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
a very short period just can we just
 

4655
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,209
a very short period just can we just
linger and explore different ideas here

4656
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:37,219
linger and explore different ideas here
 

4657
01:29:37,219 --> 01:29:39,410
linger and explore different ideas here
because this feels like a really

4658
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:39,420
because this feels like a really
 

4659
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,870
because this feels like a really
important moment in human history where

4660
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:41,880
important moment in human history where
 

4661
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,729
important moment in human history where
pausing would actually have a

4662
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:43,739
pausing would actually have a
 

4663
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:46,070
pausing would actually have a
significant positive effect

4664
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:46,080
significant positive effect
 

4665
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:50,629
significant positive effect
we said six months because we figured

4666
01:29:50,629 --> 01:29:50,639
we said six months because we figured
 

4667
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,669
we said six months because we figured
the number one pushback that we're gonna

4668
01:29:52,669 --> 01:29:52,679
the number one pushback that we're gonna
 

4669
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:57,189
the number one pushback that we're gonna
get in the west was like but China

4670
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
get in the west was like but China
 

4671
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,810
get in the west was like but China
and

4672
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:58,820
and
 

4673
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,950
and
everybody knows there's no way that

4674
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:00,960
everybody knows there's no way that
 

4675
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,689
everybody knows there's no way that
China is going to catch up with the West

4676
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:02,699
China is going to catch up with the West
 

4677
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:04,610
China is going to catch up with the West
on this in six months so it's that

4678
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:04,620
on this in six months so it's that
 

4679
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,410
on this in six months so it's that
argument goes off the table and you can

4680
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:06,420
argument goes off the table and you can
 

4681
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,149
argument goes off the table and you can
forget about geopolitical competition

4682
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:08,159
forget about geopolitical competition
 

4683
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,890
forget about geopolitical competition
and just focus on

4684
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:09,900
and just focus on
 

4685
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,470
and just focus on
the real issue that's why we put this

4686
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
the real issue that's why we put this
 

4687
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,629
the real issue that's why we put this
that's really interesting but you've

4688
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:14,639
that's really interesting but you've
 

4689
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,390
that's really interesting but you've
already made the case that uh even for

4690
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,400
already made the case that uh even for
 

4691
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,310
already made the case that uh even for
China if you actually want to take on

4692
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:19,320
China if you actually want to take on
 

4693
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,189
China if you actually want to take on
that argument China too would not be

4694
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:22,199
that argument China too would not be
 

4695
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:25,910
that argument China too would not be
bothered by a longer halt because they

4696
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
bothered by a longer halt because they
 

4697
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,470
bothered by a longer halt because they
don't want to lose control even more

4698
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:27,480
don't want to lose control even more
 

4699
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,330
don't want to lose control even more
than the West doesn't

4700
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:29,340
than the West doesn't
 

4701
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,770
than the West doesn't
that's what I think that's a really

4702
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:30,780
that's what I think that's a really
 

4703
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,810
that's what I think that's a really
interesting argument like I have to

4704
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:32,820
interesting argument like I have to
 

4705
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,310
interesting argument like I have to
actually really think about that which

4706
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,320
actually really think about that which
 

4707
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,010
actually really think about that which
the the kind of thing people assume is

4708
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:37,020
the the kind of thing people assume is
 

4709
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,870
the the kind of thing people assume is
if you develop an AGI

4710
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
if you develop an AGI
 

4711
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,270
if you develop an AGI
that open AI if they're the ones that do

4712
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:41,280
that open AI if they're the ones that do
 

4713
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,330
that open AI if they're the ones that do
it for example they're going to win but

4714
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:44,340
it for example they're going to win but
 

4715
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,270
it for example they're going to win but
you're saying no they're everybody loses

4716
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
you're saying no they're everybody loses
 

4717
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,550
you're saying no they're everybody loses
yeah it's gonna get better and better

4718
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:49,560
yeah it's gonna get better and better
 

4719
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,470
yeah it's gonna get better and better
and better and then Kaboom we all lose

4720
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:51,480
and better and then Kaboom we all lose
 

4721
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,810
and better and then Kaboom we all lose
that's what's gonna happen when lose and

4722
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:53,820
that's what's gonna happen when lose and
 

4723
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,510
that's what's gonna happen when lose and
win are defined in a metric of basically

4724
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:56,520
win are defined in a metric of basically
 

4725
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,729
win are defined in a metric of basically
quality of life

4726
01:30:58,729 --> 01:30:58,739
quality of life
 

4727
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:00,830
quality of life
for human civilization and for Sam

4728
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:00,840
for human civilization and for Sam
 

4729
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,169
for human civilization and for Sam
Altman

4730
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:02,179
Altman
 

4731
01:31:02,179 --> 01:31:05,209
Altman
to be blunt my personal guess you know

4732
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:05,219
to be blunt my personal guess you know
 

4733
01:31:05,219 --> 01:31:06,709
to be blunt my personal guess you know
and people can quibble with this is that

4734
01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:06,719
and people can quibble with this is that
 

4735
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,090
and people can quibble with this is that
we're just gonna they won't be any

4736
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,100
we're just gonna they won't be any
 

4737
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,830
we're just gonna they won't be any
humans that's it that's what I mean by

4738
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:09,840
humans that's it that's what I mean by
 

4739
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,850
humans that's it that's what I mean by
lose

4740
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:10,860
lose
 

4741
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,890
lose
you know if you if we can see in history

4742
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:12,900
you know if you if we can see in history
 

4743
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,590
you know if you if we can see in history
once you have some species or some group

4744
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
once you have some species or some group
 

4745
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,189
once you have some species or some group
of people who aren't needed anymore

4746
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:19,199
of people who aren't needed anymore
 

4747
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,590
of people who aren't needed anymore
it doesn't usually work out so well for

4748
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:21,600
it doesn't usually work out so well for
 

4749
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,709
it doesn't usually work out so well for
them right yeah

4750
01:31:23,709 --> 01:31:23,719
them right yeah
 

4751
01:31:23,719 --> 01:31:26,330
them right yeah
there were a lot of horses for that were

4752
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:26,340
there were a lot of horses for that were
 

4753
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,310
there were a lot of horses for that were
used for traffic in Boston and then the

4754
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:28,320
used for traffic in Boston and then the
 

4755
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,050
used for traffic in Boston and then the
car got invented and most of them got

4756
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,060
car got invented and most of them got
 

4757
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,570
car got invented and most of them got
you know well we don't need to go there

4758
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:32,580
you know well we don't need to go there
 

4759
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:38,709
you know well we don't need to go there
and uh if you look at them

4760
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:38,719

 

4761
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:43,310

humans you know right now we why did the

4762
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:43,320
humans you know right now we why did the
 

4763
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,770
humans you know right now we why did the
labor movement succeed and after the

4764
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:45,780
labor movement succeed and after the
 

4765
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,330
labor movement succeed and after the
Industrial Revolution because it was

4766
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:47,340
Industrial Revolution because it was
 

4767
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,629
Industrial Revolution because it was
needed

4768
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:49,639
needed
 

4769
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:53,149
needed
even though we had a lot of mallocs and

4770
01:31:53,149 --> 01:31:53,159
even though we had a lot of mallocs and
 

4771
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:55,629
even though we had a lot of mallocs and
there was child labor and so on you know

4772
01:31:55,629 --> 01:31:55,639
there was child labor and so on you know
 

4773
01:31:55,639 --> 01:31:58,990
there was child labor and so on you know
the company still needed to have workers

4774
01:31:58,990 --> 01:31:59,000
the company still needed to have workers
 

4775
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,490
the company still needed to have workers
and that's why strikes had power and so

4776
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:01,500
and that's why strikes had power and so
 

4777
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,790
and that's why strikes had power and so
on if we get to the point where most

4778
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:04,800
on if we get to the point where most
 

4779
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,530
on if we get to the point where most
humans aren't needed anymore I think

4780
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:06,540
humans aren't needed anymore I think
 

4781
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,330
humans aren't needed anymore I think
it's like it's quite naive to think that

4782
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:08,340
it's like it's quite naive to think that
 

4783
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,189
it's like it's quite naive to think that
they're going to still be treated well

4784
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:10,199
they're going to still be treated well
 

4785

we automated away muscle work

4804
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:32,600
we automated away muscle work
 

4805
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,450
we automated away muscle work
but that got went worked out pretty well

4806

but that got went worked out pretty well
 

4807
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,850

eventually because we educated ourselves

4808
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:37,860
eventually because we educated ourselves
 

4809
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,050
eventually because we educated ourselves
and started doing working with our

4810
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:39,060
and started doing working with our
 

4811
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,270
and started doing working with our
brains instead and got usually more

4812
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,280
brains instead and got usually more
 

4813
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,430

but now we're beginning to replace brain

4816
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
but now we're beginning to replace brain
 

4817
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,209
but now we're beginning to replace brain
work so we've replaced a lot of boring

programmers salaries are going to start
 

4893
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:14,450
programmers salaries are going to start
dropping

dropping
you know if you said you can code five

4896
01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:16,739
you know if you said you can code five
 

4897
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:18,950
you know if you said you can code five
times faster you know then you need five

4898
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:18,960
times faster you know then you need five
 

4899
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,050
times faster you know then you need five
times fewer programmers maybe there will

4900
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:21,060
times fewer programmers maybe there will
 

4901
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,770
times fewer programmers maybe there will
be

4902
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:21,780
be
 

4903
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,229

more output also but you'll still end up

4904
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:24,239
more output also but you'll still end up
 

4905
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,910
more output also but you'll still end up
using fewer programs needing fewer

4906
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
using fewer programs needing fewer
 

4907
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,250
using fewer programs needing fewer
programmers than today and I love coding

4908
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:28,260
programmers than today and I love coding

um so we we need to stop and ask

4912
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:33,960
um so we we need to stop and ask
 

4913
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,229
um so we we need to stop and ask
ourselves why again are we doing this as

4914
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
ourselves why again are we doing this as
 

4915
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,870
ourselves why again are we doing this as
humans like

4916

I feel that AI should be built by
 

4919
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:45,110
I feel that AI should be built by
Humanity for Humanity and let's not

4920
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,120
Humanity for Humanity and let's not
 

4921
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,050
Humanity for Humanity and let's not
forget that it shouldn't be by malloc

4922
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:48,060
forget that it shouldn't be by malloc
 

4923
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,390
forget that it shouldn't be by malloc
for molok or what it really is now is

4924
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:50,400
for molok or what it really is now is
 

4925
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,570
for molok or what it really is now is
kind of by Humanity for moloch which

4926
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:53,580
kind of by Humanity for moloch which
 

4927
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:56,570
kind of by Humanity for moloch which
doesn't make any sense it's for us that

4928
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:56,580
doesn't make any sense it's for us that
 

4929
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,970
doesn't make any sense it's for us that
we're doing it then and um

4930
01:34:58,970 --> 01:34:58,980
we're doing it then and um
 

4931
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:01,430
we're doing it then and um
it would make a lot more sense if we

4932
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
it would make a lot more sense if we
 

4933
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,709
it would make a lot more sense if we
build the develop figure out gradually

4934
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:03,719
build the develop figure out gradually
 

4935
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:05,149
build the develop figure out gradually
safely how to make all this Tech and

4936
01:35:05,149 --> 01:35:05,159
safely how to make all this Tech and
 

4937
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:06,590
safely how to make all this Tech and
then we think about what are the kind of

4938
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:06,600
then we think about what are the kind of
 

4939
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,790
then we think about what are the kind of
jobs that people really don't want to

4940
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:07,800
jobs that people really don't want to
 

4941
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,890
jobs that people really don't want to
have you know and automate them all the

4942
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:09,900
have you know and automate them all the
 

4943
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,050
have you know and automate them all the
way and then we ask what are the jobs

4944
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:12,060
way and then we ask what are the jobs
 

4945
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:12,950
way and then we ask what are the jobs
that

4946
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:12,960
that
 

4947
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,229
that
people really find meaning in like maybe

4948
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239

 

4949
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,390

taking care of children in the daycare

4950
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
taking care of children in the daycare
 

4951
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,870
taking care of children in the daycare
center maybe doing art etc etc and and

4952
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:23,880
center maybe doing art etc etc and and
 

4953
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,910
center maybe doing art etc etc and and
even if it were possible to automate

4954
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
even if it were possible to automate
 

4955
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,709
even if it were possible to automate
that away but we don't need to do that

4956
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:27,719
that away but we don't need to do that
 

4957
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:30,169
that away but we don't need to do that
right we built these machines

4958
01:35:30,169 --> 01:35:30,179
right we built these machines
 

4959
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:32,229
right we built these machines
well it's possible that we

4960
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
well it's possible that we
 

4961
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:35,870
well it's possible that we
redefine or ReDiscover what are the jobs

4962
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:35,880
redefine or ReDiscover what are the jobs
 

4963
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,050
redefine or ReDiscover what are the jobs
that give us meaning so for me the thing

4964
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:38,060
that give us meaning so for me the thing
 

4965
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:41,990
that give us meaning so for me the thing
it is really sad like I

4966
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,000
it is really sad like I
 

4967
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,570
it is really sad like I
half the time I'm excited half the time

half the time I'm excited half the time
 

4969
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:48,410
half the time I'm excited half the time
I'm uh crying as I'm yes I'm generating

4970
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:48,420
I'm uh crying as I'm yes I'm generating
 

4971
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,669
I'm uh crying as I'm yes I'm generating
code because

4972
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
code because
 

4973
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,870
code because
I kind of love programming it's uh it's

4974
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:53,880
I kind of love programming it's uh it's
 

4975

you design it and then you bring it to
life and it does something especially if

4980
01:36:00,709 --> 01:36:00,719
life and it does something especially if
 

4981
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,030
life and it does something especially if
there's some intelligence that it does

there's some intelligence that it does
 

4983
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,410
there's some intelligence that it does

4988
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:08,100
screen you you you made a little machine
 

4989
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:12,350
screen you you you made a little machine
and it comes to life yeah and uh there's

4990
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:12,360
and it comes to life yeah and uh there's
 

4991
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,790
and it comes to life yeah and uh there's
a bunch of tricks you learn along the

4992
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:13,800
a bunch of tricks you learn along the
 

4993
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,770
a bunch of tricks you learn along the
way because you've been doing it for for

be able to generate all the tricks you

4998
01:36:21,169 --> 01:36:21,179
be able to generate all the tricks you
 

4999
01:36:21,179 --> 01:36:23,870
be able to generate all the tricks you
thought were special yeah

5000
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:23,880
thought were special yeah
 

5001
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,110

that is lost for me with program or

5028
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:00,360
that is lost for me with program or
 

5029
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,390
that is lost for me with program or
being lost with programming similar as

5030
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
being lost with programming similar as
 

5031
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,010
being lost with programming similar as
it is for uh the the 3D modeler no

5032
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:07,020
it is for uh the the 3D modeler no
 

5033
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,689
it is for uh the the 3D modeler no
longer being able to really enjoy the

sense of that maybe I would ReDiscover

5040
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:14,820
sense of that maybe I would ReDiscover
 

5041
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,669
sense of that maybe I would ReDiscover
that the true magic of what it means to

with anything even
 

5077
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,370
with anything even
quite far short of AGI we can

5078
01:37:58,370 --> 01:37:58,380
quite far short of AGI we can
 

5079
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,990
quite far short of AGI we can
dramatically improve

5080
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,000
dramatically improve
 

5081
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,070

and Denmark had all these ridiculous

5098
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:21,480
and Denmark had all these ridiculous
 

5099
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,189
and Denmark had all these ridiculous
Wars Century after century

5100
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
Wars Century after century
 

5101
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,050
Wars Century after century
and uh

5102
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:27,060
and uh
 

5103
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,550
and uh
sometimes that Sweden got a little

5104
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:28,560
sometimes that Sweden got a little
 

5105
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,629
sometimes that Sweden got a little
better off because it got a little bit

5106
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:29,639
better off because it got a little bit
 

5107
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:31,070
better off because it got a little bit
bigger and then Denmark got a little bit

5108
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:31,080
bigger and then Denmark got a little bit
 

5109
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,209
bigger and then Denmark got a little bit
better off because being a little bit

5110
01:38:32,209 --> 01:38:32,219
better off because being a little bit
 

5111
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:34,129
better off because being a little bit
smaller and and but then we then

5112
01:38:34,129 --> 01:38:34,139
smaller and and but then we then
 

5113
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:35,750
smaller and and but then we then
technology came along and we both got

5114
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
technology came along and we both got
 

5115
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,490
technology came along and we both got
just dramatically wealthier without

5116
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:37,500
just dramatically wealthier without
 

5117
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,110
just dramatically wealthier without
taking away from anyone else it was just

5118
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:39,120
taking away from anyone else it was just
 

5119
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,850
taking away from anyone else it was just
a total win for everyone

5120
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:40,860
a total win for everyone
 

5121
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,290
a total win for everyone
and uh AI can do that on steroids

5122
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:45,300
and uh AI can do that on steroids
 

5123
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,870
and uh AI can do that on steroids
if you can build safe AGI

5124
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:47,880
if you can build safe AGI
 

5125
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,750
if you can build safe AGI
if you can build super intelligence yeah

5126
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:50,760
if you can build super intelligence yeah
 

5127
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,110
if you can build super intelligence yeah
basically all the limitations that cause

5128
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:54,120
basically all the limitations that cause
 

5129
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:56,270
basically all the limitations that cause
harm today can be completely can be

5130
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:56,280
harm today can be completely can be
 

5131
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,250
harm today can be completely can be
completely eliminated right it's a

5132
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:58,260
completely eliminated right it's a
 

5133
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,010
completely eliminated right it's a
wonderful you talk possibility in this

5134
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:01,020
wonderful you talk possibility in this
 

5135
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,510
wonderful you talk possibility in this
this is not sci-fi this is something

5136
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:02,520
this is not sci-fi this is something
 

5137
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,189
this is not sci-fi this is something
which is clearly possible according to

5138
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:04,199
which is clearly possible according to
 

5139
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,510
which is clearly possible according to
laws of physics

5140
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
laws of physics
 

5141
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,910
laws of physics
and I we can talk about ways of making

5142
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920
and I we can talk about ways of making
 

5143
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,590
and I we can talk about ways of making
it safe also

5144
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
it safe also
 

5145
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,990
it safe also
um but unfortunately

5146
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
um but unfortunately
 

5147
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,510
um but unfortunately
that'll only happen if we stare in that

5148
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:14,520
that'll only happen if we stare in that
 

5149
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,890
that'll only happen if we stare in that
direction that's absolutely not the

5150
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:15,900
direction that's absolutely not the
 

5151
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,550
direction that's absolutely not the
default outcome that why

5152
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:19,560
default outcome that why
 

5153
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,250
default outcome that why
income inequality keeps going up that's

5154
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:22,260
income inequality keeps going up that's
 

5155
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,169
income inequality keeps going up that's
why the life expectancy in the US has

5156
01:39:24,169 --> 01:39:24,179
why the life expectancy in the US has
 

5157
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:25,669
why the life expectancy in the US has
been going down now I think it's four

5158
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
been going down now I think it's four
 

5159
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:28,669
been going down now I think it's four
years in a row I just read a

5160
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:28,679
years in a row I just read a
 

5161
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,790
years in a row I just read a
heartbreaking study from CDC about how

5162
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:31,800
heartbreaking study from CDC about how
 

5163
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,790
heartbreaking study from CDC about how
something like one-third of all teenage

5164
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
something like one-third of all teenage
 

5165
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,010
something like one-third of all teenage
girls in the US have been thinking about

5166
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:37,020
girls in the US have been thinking about
 

5167
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,990
girls in the US have been thinking about
suicide you know like

5168
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:39,000
suicide you know like
 

5169
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,390
suicide you know like
those are steps and they're totally the

5170
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:41,400
those are steps and they're totally the
 

5171
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,390
those are steps and they're totally the
wrong direction and and it's important

5172
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,400
wrong direction and and it's important
 

5173
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,830
wrong direction and and it's important
to keep our eyes on the prize here that

5174
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:47,840
to keep our eyes on the prize here that
 

5175
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,810
to keep our eyes on the prize here that
we can we have the power now for the

5176
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:50,820
we can we have the power now for the
 

5177
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,810
we can we have the power now for the
first time in the history of our species

5178
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:53,820
first time in the history of our species
 

5179
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,970
first time in the history of our species
to harness artificial intelligence to

5180
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:55,980
to harness artificial intelligence to
 

5181
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,910
to harness artificial intelligence to
help us really flourish

5182
01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:58,920
help us really flourish
 

5183
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,209
help us really flourish
and help bring out the best in our

5184
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:02,219
and help bring out the best in our
 

5185
01:40:02,219 --> 01:40:05,689
and help bring out the best in our
Humanity rather than the worst of it

5186
01:40:05,689 --> 01:40:05,699
Humanity rather than the worst of it

Humanity rather than the worst of it
to help us have really fulfilling

and you and I shouldn't sit here and

5192
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:13,980
and you and I shouldn't sit here and
 

5193

and you and I shouldn't sit here and
dictate the future Generations what they

5194
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:15,420
dictate the future Generations what they
 

5195
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:16,790
dictate the future Generations what they
will be let them figure it out but let's

5196
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
will be let them figure it out but let's
 

5197
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,850
will be let them figure it out but let's
give them a chance to live and and not

5198
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:19,860
give them a chance to live and and not
 

5199
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,229
give them a chance to live and and not
foreclose all these possibilities for

5200
01:40:21,229 --> 01:40:21,239
foreclose all these possibilities for
 

5201
01:40:21,239 --> 01:40:22,790
foreclose all these possibilities for
them by just messing things up right

5202
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:22,800
them by just messing things up right
 

5203
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,830
them by just messing things up right
well for that we'll have to solve the AI

5204
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:24,840
well for that we'll have to solve the AI
 

5205
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,510
well for that we'll have to solve the AI
safety problem I just it would be nice

5206
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:26,520
safety problem I just it would be nice
 

5207
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,910
safety problem I just it would be nice
if we can link on exploring that a

5208
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:28,920
if we can link on exploring that a
 

5209
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,629
if we can link on exploring that a
little bit so one interesting way to

5210
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639
little bit so one interesting way to
 

5211
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,629
little bit so one interesting way to
enter that discussion is uh you tweeted

5212
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:35,639
enter that discussion is uh you tweeted
 

5213
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:39,169
enter that discussion is uh you tweeted
and Elon replied you tweeted let's not

5214
01:40:39,169 --> 01:40:39,179
and Elon replied you tweeted let's not
 

5215
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:41,209
and Elon replied you tweeted let's not
just focus on whether gpt4 we'll do more

5216
01:40:41,209 --> 01:40:41,219
just focus on whether gpt4 we'll do more
 

5217
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:43,250
just focus on whether gpt4 we'll do more
harm or good on the job market but also

5218
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:43,260
harm or good on the job market but also
 

5219
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,530
harm or good on the job market but also
whether it's coding skills will hasten

5220
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:45,540
whether it's coding skills will hasten
 

5221
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,750
whether it's coding skills will hasten
the arrival of super intelligence that's

5222
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
the arrival of super intelligence that's
 

5223
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,950
the arrival of super intelligence that's
something we've been talking about right

5224
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:48,960
something we've been talking about right
 

5225
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,649
something we've been talking about right
so Elon proposed one thing in the reply

5226
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:51,659
so Elon proposed one thing in the reply
 

5227
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:54,290
so Elon proposed one thing in the reply
saying maximum truth seeking is my best

5228
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:54,300
saying maximum truth seeking is my best
 

5229
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:58,310
saying maximum truth seeking is my best
guess for AI safety can you maybe uh

5230
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,320
guess for AI safety can you maybe uh
 

5231
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,390
guess for AI safety can you maybe uh
Steel Man the case for this uh since

5232
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:02,400
Steel Man the case for this uh since
 

5233
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,270
Steel Man the case for this uh since
this objective function of Truth and uh

5234
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
this objective function of Truth and uh
 

5235
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,189
this objective function of Truth and uh
maybe make an argument against it and in

5236
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:07,199
maybe make an argument against it and in
 

5237
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,709
maybe make an argument against it and in
general what uh are your different ideas

5238
01:41:09,709 --> 01:41:09,719
general what uh are your different ideas
 

5239
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:12,530
general what uh are your different ideas
to start approaching the solution to AI

5240
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:12,540
to start approaching the solution to AI
 

5241
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,149
to start approaching the solution to AI
safety I didn't see that reply actually

5242
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
safety I didn't see that reply actually
 

5243
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:17,149
safety I didn't see that reply actually
oh interesting all right so but I really

5244
01:41:17,149 --> 01:41:17,159
oh interesting all right so but I really
 

5245
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:21,430
oh interesting all right so but I really
resonate with it because

5246
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:21,440

 

5247
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,709

AI is not evil it it caused people

5248
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
AI is not evil it it caused people
 

5249
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,570
AI is not evil it it caused people
around the world to hate each other much

5250
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:26,580
around the world to hate each other much
 

5251
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,649
around the world to hate each other much
more

5252
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:27,659
more
 

5253
01:41:27,659 --> 01:41:30,470
more
but that's because we made it in a

5254
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:30,480
but that's because we made it in a
 

5255
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,910
but that's because we made it in a
certain way it's a tool we can use it

5256
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:31,920
certain way it's a tool we can use it
 

5257
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,950
certain way it's a tool we can use it
for great things and bad things and we

5258
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:33,960
for great things and bad things and we
 

5259
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,290
for great things and bad things and we
could just as well have ai systems and

5260
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,300
could just as well have ai systems and
 

5261
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,209
could just as well have ai systems and
this is this is part of my vision for

5262
01:41:38,209 --> 01:41:38,219
this is this is part of my vision for
 

5263
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:39,590
this is this is part of my vision for
Success here

5264
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:39,600
Success here
 

5265
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,129
Success here
truth seeking AI that really brings us

5266
01:41:43,129 --> 01:41:43,139
truth seeking AI that really brings us
 

5267
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:44,209
truth seeking AI that really brings us
together again

5268
01:41:44,209 --> 01:41:44,219
together again
 

5269
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:45,709
together again
you know why do people hate each other

5270
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:45,719
you know why do people hate each other
 

5271
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:48,350
you know why do people hate each other
so much between countries and within

5272
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:48,360
so much between countries and within
 

5273
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,209
so much between countries and within
countries it's because

5274
01:41:50,209 --> 01:41:50,219
countries it's because
 

5275
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:52,370
countries it's because
these have totally different versions of

5276
01:41:52,370 --> 01:41:52,380
these have totally different versions of
 

5277
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:55,250
these have totally different versions of
the truth right

5278
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:55,260

 

5279
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,169

if they all have the same truth that

5280
01:41:57,169 --> 01:41:57,179
if they all have the same truth that
 

5281
01:41:57,179 --> 01:41:58,790
if they all have the same truth that
they trusted for good reason because

5282
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
they trusted for good reason because
 

5283
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,290
they trusted for good reason because
they could check it and verify it and

5284
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:00,300
they could check it and verify it and
 

5285
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,609
they could check it and verify it and
not have to believe in some

5286
01:42:01,609 --> 01:42:01,619
not have to believe in some
 

5287
01:42:01,619 --> 01:42:04,010
not have to believe in some
self-proclaimed Authority right

5288
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:04,020
self-proclaimed Authority right
 

5289
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:06,050
self-proclaimed Authority right
they wouldn't be as nearly as much hate

5290
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:06,060
they wouldn't be as nearly as much hate
 

5291
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,729
they wouldn't be as nearly as much hate
there'd be a lot more understanding

5292
01:42:07,729 --> 01:42:07,739
there'd be a lot more understanding
 

5293
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,649
there'd be a lot more understanding
instead and uh

5294
01:42:09,649 --> 01:42:09,659
instead and uh
 

5295
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:11,450
instead and uh
this is

5296
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:11,460
this is
 

5297
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,550
this is
I think something AI can help enormously

5298
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:13,560
I think something AI can help enormously
 

5299
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,810
I think something AI can help enormously
with

5300
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:14,820
with
 

5301
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,790
with
for example

5302
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:16,800
for example
 

5303
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,770
for example
a little baby step in this direction is

5304
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:18,780
a little baby step in this direction is
 

5305
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:23,270
a little baby step in this direction is
this website called metaculous where

5306
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:23,280

 

5307
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,669

People BET and make predictions not for

5308
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:25,679
People BET and make predictions not for
 

5309
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,790
People BET and make predictions not for
money but just for their own reputation

5310
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
money but just for their own reputation
 

5311
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,649
money but just for their own reputation
and it's kind of funny actually you

5312
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:30,659
and it's kind of funny actually you
 

5313
01:42:30,659 --> 01:42:32,750
and it's kind of funny actually you
treat the humans like you treat AIS you

5314
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:32,760
treat the humans like you treat AIS you
 

5315
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,090
treat the humans like you treat AIS you
have a loss function where they get

5316
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:35,100
have a loss function where they get
 

5317
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:37,550
have a loss function where they get
penalized if they're super confident on

5318
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:37,560
penalized if they're super confident on
 

5319
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,810
penalized if they're super confident on
something and then the opposite happens

5320
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:38,820
something and then the opposite happens
 

5321
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,010
something and then the opposite happens
yeah

5322
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:40,020
yeah
 

5323
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:40,729
yeah
yeah

5324
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:40,739
yeah
 

5325
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,410
yeah
whereas if you're kind of humble and

5326
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:42,420
whereas if you're kind of humble and
 

5327
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:44,629
whereas if you're kind of humble and
then you're like I think it's 51 chance

5328
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
then you're like I think it's 51 chance
 

5329
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:45,830
then you're like I think it's 51 chance
this is going to happen and then the

5330
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
this is going to happen and then the
 

5331
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,390
this is going to happen and then the
other happens you don't get penalized

5332
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:47,400
other happens you don't get penalized
 

5333
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,350
other happens you don't get penalized
much and

5334
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:48,360
much and
 

5335
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,970
much and
and what you can see is that some people

5336
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:49,980
and what you can see is that some people
 

5337
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,169
and what you can see is that some people
are much better at predicting than

5338
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:51,179
are much better at predicting than
 

5339
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:55,490
are much better at predicting than
others they've earned your trusts right

you know

5380
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:36,119
you know
 

5381
01:43:36,119 --> 01:43:38,450
you know
this is how we do it in science you

5382
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:38,460
this is how we do it in science you
 

5383
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,250
this is how we do it in science you
trust scientists like Einstein who said

5384
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:40,260
trust scientists like Einstein who said
 

5385
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:41,870
trust scientists like Einstein who said
something everybody thought was

you get a lot of trust Point than he did

5390
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:45,900
you get a lot of trust Point than he did
 

5391
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,729
you get a lot of trust Point than he did
it multiple times even

5392
01:43:49,729 --> 01:43:49,739

 

5393
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:53,510

I think AI has the power to really heal

5394
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,520
I think AI has the power to really heal
 

5395
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,510
I think AI has the power to really heal
a lot of the the Rifts we're seeing by

5396
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:56,520
a lot of the the Rifts we're seeing by
 

5397
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:59,590
a lot of the the Rifts we're seeing by
creating Trust Systems

5398
01:43:59,590 --> 01:43:59,600
creating Trust Systems
 

5399
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,570
creating Trust Systems
it has to get away from this idea today

5400
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:02,580
it has to get away from this idea today
 

5401
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:04,189
it has to get away from this idea today
with some fact-checking sites which

5402
01:44:04,189 --> 01:44:04,199
with some fact-checking sites which
 

5403
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:06,169
with some fact-checking sites which
might themselves have an agenda and you

5404
01:44:06,169 --> 01:44:06,179
might themselves have an agenda and you
 

5405
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:07,609
might themselves have an agenda and you
just trust it because of its reputation

5406
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:07,619
just trust it because of its reputation
 

5407
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:09,590
just trust it because of its reputation
to

5408
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
to
 

5409
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,709
to
you want to have it so this so these

5410
01:44:12,709 --> 01:44:12,719
you want to have it so this so these
 

5411
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:13,910
you want to have it so this so these
sort of systems they are in their trust

5412
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:13,920
sort of systems they are in their trust
 

5413
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,189
sort of systems they are in their trust
and that's completely transparent

5414
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:16,199
and that's completely transparent
 

5415
01:44:16,199 --> 01:44:18,290
and that's completely transparent
this I think would actually help a lot

5416
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:18,300
this I think would actually help a lot
 

5417
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,709
this I think would actually help a lot
uh that you know I think help heal the

5418
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:21,719
uh that you know I think help heal the
 

5419
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:24,109
uh that you know I think help heal the
very dysfunctional conversation that

5420
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:24,119
very dysfunctional conversation that
 

5421
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:25,729
very dysfunctional conversation that
Humanity has about how it's going to

5422
01:44:25,729 --> 01:44:25,739
Humanity has about how it's going to
 

5423
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:27,530
Humanity has about how it's going to
deal with all its

5424
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:27,540
deal with all its
 

5425
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:31,310
deal with all its
biggest challenges in in the world today

5426
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,320
biggest challenges in in the world today
 

5427
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,590
biggest challenges in in the world today
and then uh

5428
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
and then uh
 

5429
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,750
and then uh
enter on the technical side you know

5430
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760
enter on the technical side you know
 

5431
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,510

another common sort of Gloom uh

5432
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:38,520
another common sort of Gloom uh

comment I get from people are saying

5434
01:44:40,189 --> 01:44:40,199
comment I get from people are saying
 

5435
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:42,169
comment I get from people are saying
we're just screwed there's no hope

5436
01:44:42,169 --> 01:44:42,179
we're just screwed there's no hope
 

5437
01:44:42,179 --> 01:44:44,689
we're just screwed there's no hope
is well things like gpt4 are way too

5438
01:44:44,689 --> 01:44:44,699
is well things like gpt4 are way too
 

5439
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:46,010
is well things like gpt4 are way too
complicated for a human to ever

5440
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:46,020
complicated for a human to ever
 

5441
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,229
complicated for a human to ever
understand and prove that they can be

5442
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:48,239
understand and prove that they can be
 

5443
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,390
understand and prove that they can be
trustworthy they're forgetting that AI

5444
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:50,400
trustworthy they're forgetting that AI
 

5445
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,689
trustworthy they're forgetting that AI
can help us prove that things work right

5446
01:44:53,689 --> 01:44:53,699
can help us prove that things work right
 

5447
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:55,490
can help us prove that things work right
yeah and and there's this very

5448
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:55,500
yeah and and there's this very
 

5449
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:59,570
yeah and and there's this very
fundamental fact that in math it's much

5450
01:44:59,570 --> 01:44:59,580
fundamental fact that in math it's much
 

5451
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:02,209
fundamental fact that in math it's much
harder to come up with a proof that it

5452
01:45:02,209 --> 01:45:02,219
harder to come up with a proof that it
 

5453
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:04,729
harder to come up with a proof that it
is to verify that the proof is correct

5454
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:04,739
is to verify that the proof is correct
 

5455
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:06,470
is to verify that the proof is correct
you can actually write a little proof

5456
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,480
you can actually write a little proof
 

5457
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,450
you can actually write a little proof
checking code it's quite short

5458
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:08,460
checking code it's quite short
 

5459
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,910
checking code it's quite short
but you can assume and understand and

5460
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:10,920
but you can assume and understand and
 

5461
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,530
but you can assume and understand and
then it can check the most monstrously

5462
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:12,540
then it can check the most monstrously
 

5463
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,510
then it can check the most monstrously
long proof ever Drake generated even by

5464
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:14,520
long proof ever Drake generated even by
 

5465
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,030
long proof ever Drake generated even by
a computer and say yeah this is valid

5466
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
a computer and say yeah this is valid
 

5467
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,270
a computer and say yeah this is valid
so so right now

5468
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:20,280
so so right now
 

5469
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:23,149
so so right now
we we have

5470
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:23,159
we we have
 

5471
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:25,510
we we have
this uh

5472
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,520
this uh
 

5473
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,830
this uh
this approach with virus checking

5474
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
this approach with virus checking
 

5475
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,050
this approach with virus checking
software that it looks to see if there's

5476
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:30,060
software that it looks to see if there's
 

5477
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,090
software that it looks to see if there's
something you should not trust it and if

5478
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:32,100
something you should not trust it and if
 

5479
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:33,590
something you should not trust it and if
it can prove to itself that you should

5480
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
it can prove to itself that you should
 

5481
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,729
it can prove to itself that you should
not trust that code it warns you right

5482
01:45:37,729 --> 01:45:37,739
not trust that code it warns you right
 

5483
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:39,770
not trust that code it warns you right
what if you flip this around

5484
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:39,780
what if you flip this around
 

5485
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,350
what if you flip this around
and this is an idea I should give credit

5486
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:42,360
and this is an idea I should give credit
 

5487
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,990
and this is an idea I should give credit
to Steve I'm 100 for so that it will

5488
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:45,000
to Steve I'm 100 for so that it will
 

5489
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,910
to Steve I'm 100 for so that it will
only run the code if it can prove

5490
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:46,920
only run the code if it can prove
 

5491
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,830
only run the code if it can prove
instead of not running it if it can

5492
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:48,840
instead of not running it if it can
 

5493
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,870
instead of not running it if it can
prove that it's not trustworthy if it

5494
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
prove that it's not trustworthy if it
 

5495
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,250
prove that it's not trustworthy if it
will only run and if it can prove that

5496
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:52,260
will only run and if it can prove that
 

5497
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,109
will only run and if it can prove that
it's trustworthy so it asks the code it

5498
01:45:54,109 --> 01:45:54,119
it's trustworthy so it asks the code it
 

5499
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:55,370
it's trustworthy so it asks the code it
prove to me that you're going to do what

5500
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:55,380
prove to me that you're going to do what
 

5501
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:57,669
prove to me that you're going to do what
you say you're going to do

5502
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
you say you're going to do
 

5503
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:01,490
you say you're going to do
and and it gives you this proof

5504
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:01,500
and and it gives you this proof
 

5505
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,930
and and it gives you this proof
and you a little proof that you can

5506
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:02,940
and you a little proof that you can
 

5507
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,870
and you a little proof that you can
check it now you can actually trust

5508
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:05,880
check it now you can actually trust
 

5509
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,790
check it now you can actually trust
an AI That's much more intelligent than

5510
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:07,800
an AI That's much more intelligent than
 

5511
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,530
an AI That's much more intelligent than
you are right

5512
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:09,540
you are right
 

5513
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,709
you are right
because you it's it's problem to come up

5514
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
because you it's it's problem to come up
 

5515
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:13,970
because you it's it's problem to come up
with this proof that you could never

5516
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:13,980
with this proof that you could never
 

5517
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:16,609
with this proof that you could never
have found that you should trust it so

5518
01:46:16,609 --> 01:46:16,619
have found that you should trust it so
 

5519
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:18,350
have found that you should trust it so
this is the interesting point I agree

5520
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:18,360
this is the interesting point I agree
 

5521
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:21,169
this is the interesting point I agree
with you but this is where Eleazar

5522
01:46:21,169 --> 01:46:21,179
with you but this is where Eleazar
 

5523
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:23,689
with you but this is where Eleazar
yakowski might disagree with you his

5524
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:23,699
yakowski might disagree with you his
 

5525
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:26,990
yakowski might disagree with you his
claim not with you but with this idea

5526
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:27,000
claim not with you but with this idea
 

5527
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,470
claim not with you but with this idea
is his claim is super intelligent AI

5528
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:30,480
is his claim is super intelligent AI
 

5529
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:34,010
is his claim is super intelligent AI
would be able to know how to lie to you

5530
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:34,020
would be able to know how to lie to you
 

5531
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:36,050
would be able to know how to lie to you
with such a proof

5532
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:36,060
with such a proof
 

5533
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:37,970
with such a proof
I'll Delight to you and give me a proof

5534
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:37,980
I'll Delight to you and give me a proof
 

5535
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:40,430
I'll Delight to you and give me a proof
that I'm gonna think is correct yeah so

5536
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:40,440
that I'm gonna think is correct yeah so
 

5537
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,350
that I'm gonna think is correct yeah so
but it's not me it's lying to that's the

5538
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:42,360
but it's not me it's lying to that's the
 

5539
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,970
but it's not me it's lying to that's the
trick my proof checker

5540
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:43,980
trick my proof checker
 

5541
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:46,430
trick my proof checker
which is a piece of code so his general

5542
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:46,440
which is a piece of code so his general
 

5543
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:49,910
which is a piece of code so his general
idea is a super intelligent system

5544
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
idea is a super intelligent system
 

5545
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,930
idea is a super intelligent system
can lie to a dumber proof checker

5546
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:53,940
can lie to a dumber proof checker
 

5547
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,629
can lie to a dumber proof checker
so you're going to have as a system

5548
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:56,639
so you're going to have as a system
 

5549
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:57,709
so you're going to have as a system
becomes more and more intelligent

5550
01:46:57,709 --> 01:46:57,719
becomes more and more intelligent
 

5551
01:46:57,719 --> 01:46:59,629
becomes more and more intelligent
there's going to be a threshold

5552
01:46:59,629 --> 01:46:59,639
there's going to be a threshold
 

5553
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:02,030
there's going to be a threshold
or a super intelligent system will be

5554
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:02,040
or a super intelligent system will be
 

5555
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,890
or a super intelligent system will be
able to effectively lie to a slightly

5556
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:03,900
able to effectively lie to a slightly
 

5557
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,530
able to effectively lie to a slightly
Dumber AGI system uh like there's a

5558
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:06,540
Dumber AGI system uh like there's a
 

5559
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,570
Dumber AGI system uh like there's a
threat like he really focuses on this

5560
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:08,580
threat like he really focuses on this
 

5561
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:12,169
threat like he really focuses on this
weak AGI the strong AGI jump with a

5562
01:47:12,169 --> 01:47:12,179
weak AGI the strong AGI jump with a
 

5563
01:47:12,179 --> 01:47:15,649
weak AGI the strong AGI jump with a
strong AGI can make all the weak age you

5564
01:47:15,649 --> 01:47:15,659
strong AGI can make all the weak age you
 

5565
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:18,470
strong AGI can make all the weak age you
guys think that it's just one of them

5566
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:18,480
guys think that it's just one of them
 

5567
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,750
guys think that it's just one of them
but it's no longer that

5568
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:20,760
but it's no longer that
 

5569
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,209
but it's no longer that
and that leap is when it runs away yeah

5570
01:47:23,209 --> 01:47:23,219
and that leap is when it runs away yeah
 

5571
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:26,510
and that leap is when it runs away yeah
I I don't buy that argument I think no

5572

wanted to do right and if it can't prove
 

5649
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,410
wanted to do right and if it can't prove
it maybe it's still going to do it but

5650
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:51,420
it maybe it's still going to do it but
 

5651
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:53,510
it maybe it's still going to do it but
you won't run it so you just forfeit

01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
you won't run it so you just forfeit

5657
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:00,109
can do I I bet you dollars of donuts you
can still do some incredibly cool stuff

on your podcast to this effect you know

on your podcast to this effect you know

but
 

5675
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,550

I think that shouldn't distract us from

I think that shouldn't distract us from
 

5677
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,350
I think that shouldn't distract us from

so that's also a part of the war in life

5782
01:51:28,129 --> 01:51:28,139
so that's also a part of the war in life
 

5783
01:51:28,139 --> 01:51:34,010
so that's also a part of the war in life

the the technology that was supposed to
 

5793
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,649
the the technology that was supposed to
connect us is actually distancing us

5794
01:51:45,649 --> 01:51:45,659
connect us is actually distancing us
 

5795
01:51:45,659 --> 01:51:48,590
connect us is actually distancing us
ourselves from each other and um

ourselves from each other and um
 

5797
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,930
ourselves from each other and um
and then we're giving ever more power to

and then we're giving ever more power to
 

5799

a house the other day my

5934
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:34,260
a house the other day my
 

5935
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,169
a house the other day my
and he's like

5936
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:36,179
and he's like
 

5937
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:38,570
and he's like
I think we're getting replaced

5938
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:38,580
I think we're getting replaced
 

5939
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,090
I think we're getting replaced
and then I think in it so that's

5940
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:41,100
and then I think in it so that's
 

5941
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:42,830
and then I think in it so that's
positive that they're finally we're

5942
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:42,840
positive that they're finally we're

the first step towards solving the
 

5947
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:49,669
the first step towards solving the
problem uh second uh I really think that

5948
01:54:49,669 --> 01:54:49,679
problem uh second uh I really think that
 

5949
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:52,870
problem uh second uh I really think that

6046
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:37,380
that it can be both really efficient and
 

6047
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,510
that it can be both really efficient and
also

6048
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:38,520
also
 

6049
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,669
also
is more amenable to very formal

6050
01:56:40,669 --> 01:56:40,679
is more amenable to very formal
 

6051
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:42,950
is more amenable to very formal
verification

6052
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:42,960
verification
 

6053
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,050
verification
that's that's my vision I'm not saying

6054
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:45,060
that's that's my vision I'm not saying
 

6055
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:47,209
that's that's my vision I'm not saying
sitting here saying I'm confident 100

6056
01:56:47,209 --> 01:56:47,219
sitting here saying I'm confident 100
 

6057
01:56:47,219 --> 01:56:49,250
sitting here saying I'm confident 100
sure that it's going to work you know

6058
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:49,260
sure that it's going to work you know
 

6059
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,629
sure that it's going to work you know
but I don't think it's a chance it's

6060
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
but I don't think it's a chance it's
 

6061
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:52,550
but I don't think it's a chance it's
certainly not zero either and it will

6062
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
certainly not zero either and it will
 

6063
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,229
certainly not zero either and it will
certainly be possible to do for a lot of

6064
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
certainly be possible to do for a lot of
 

6065
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:57,590
certainly be possible to do for a lot of
really cool AI applications that we're

6066
01:56:57,590 --> 01:56:57,600
really cool AI applications that we're
 

6067
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,050
really cool AI applications that we're
not using now so we can have a lot of

6068
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:00,060
not using now so we can have a lot of
 

6069
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,030
not using now so we can have a lot of
the fun that we're excited about

6070
01:57:02,030 --> 01:57:02,040
the fun that we're excited about
 

6071
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,430
the fun that we're excited about
if we if we do this we're going to need

6072
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:04,440
if we if we do this we're going to need
 

6073
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,530
if we if we do this we're going to need
a little bit of time

6074
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:06,540
a little bit of time
 

6075
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:09,410
a little bit of time
that's why it's good to pause and put in

6076
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:09,420
that's why it's good to pause and put in
 

6077
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:13,550
that's why it's good to pause and put in
place requirements

6078
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:13,560

 

6079
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,609

one more thing also I I think

6080
01:57:16,609 --> 01:57:16,619
one more thing also I I think
 

6081
01:57:16,619 --> 01:57:19,010
one more thing also I I think
you know someone might think well zero

6082
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:19,020
you know someone might think well zero
 

6083
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,109
you know someone might think well zero
percent chance we're gonna survive let's

6084
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:21,119
percent chance we're gonna survive let's
 

6085
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:25,970
percent chance we're gonna survive let's
just give up right that's very dangerous

6086
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:25,980

 

6087
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:29,149

because there's no more guaranteed way

6088
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:29,159
because there's no more guaranteed way
 

6089
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:30,770
because there's no more guaranteed way
it's a fail than to convince yourself

6090
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:30,780
it's a fail than to convince yourself
 

6091
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:34,970
it's a fail than to convince yourself
that it's impossible and not to try

6092
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:34,980
that it's impossible and not to try
 

6093
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,950
that it's impossible and not to try
you know any if you you know when you

6094
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:36,960
you know any if you you know when you
 

6095
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,589
you know any if you you know when you
study history in military history the

6096
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:39,599
study history in military history the
 

6097
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:42,770
study history in military history the
first thing you learn is that that's

6098
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:42,780
first thing you learn is that that's
 

6099
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:44,930
first thing you learn is that that's
how you do psychological warfare you

6100
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:44,940
how you do psychological warfare you
 

6101
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,310
how you do psychological warfare you
persuade the other side that it's

6102
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:46,320
persuade the other side that it's
 

6103
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,070
persuade the other side that it's
hopeless so they don't even fight

6104
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:49,080
hopeless so they don't even fight
 

6105
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,930
hopeless so they don't even fight
and then then of course you win right

6106
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:50,940
and then then of course you win right
 

6107
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:53,570
and then then of course you win right
let's not do this uh psychological

6108
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:53,580
let's not do this uh psychological
 

6109
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:55,970
let's not do this uh psychological
warfare on ourselves and say there's a

6110
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:55,980
warfare on ourselves and say there's a
 

6111
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,109
warfare on ourselves and say there's a
hundred percent probability we're all

6112
01:57:57,109 --> 01:57:57,119
hundred percent probability we're all
 

6113
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:00,950
hundred percent probability we're all
gonna we're all screwed anyway

6114
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:00,960

 

6115
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,169

it's sadly I I do get that a little bit

6116
01:58:03,169 --> 01:58:03,179
it's sadly I I do get that a little bit
 

6117
01:58:03,179 --> 01:58:05,750
it's sadly I I do get that a little bit
sometimes from from uh some young people

6118
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
sometimes from from uh some young people
 

6119
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,189
sometimes from from uh some young people
who are like so convinced that we're all

6120
01:58:07,189 --> 01:58:07,199
who are like so convinced that we're all
 

6121
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:08,890
who are like so convinced that we're all
screwed that they're like I'm just gonna

6122
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:08,900
screwed that they're like I'm just gonna
 

6123
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:11,629
screwed that they're like I'm just gonna
play game play computer games and do

6124
01:58:11,629 --> 01:58:11,639
play game play computer games and do
 

6125
01:58:11,639 --> 01:58:13,430
play game play computer games and do
drugs and because we're screwed anyway

6126
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:13,440
drugs and because we're screwed anyway
 

6127
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,990
drugs and because we're screwed anyway
right

6128
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,000
right
 

6129
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,550
right
it's important

6130
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
it's important
 

6131
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,410
it's important
keep the hope alive because it actually

6132
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:18,420
keep the hope alive because it actually
 

6133
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,169
keep the hope alive because it actually
has a causal impact and making it makes

6134
01:58:21,169 --> 01:58:21,179
has a causal impact and making it makes
 

6135
01:58:21,179 --> 01:58:22,189
has a causal impact and making it makes
it more likely that we're going to

6136
01:58:22,189 --> 01:58:22,199
it more likely that we're going to
 

6137
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:23,990
it more likely that we're going to
succeed it seems like the people that

6138
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:24,000
succeed it seems like the people that
 

6139
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,330
succeed it seems like the people that
actually build solutions to the problem

6140
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:26,340
actually build solutions to the problem
 

6141
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,729
actually build solutions to the problem
seemingly impossible to solve problems

6142
01:58:28,729 --> 01:58:28,739
seemingly impossible to solve problems
 

6143
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:31,310
seemingly impossible to solve problems
are the ones that believe yeah they're

6144
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,320
are the ones that believe yeah they're
 

6145
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,290
are the ones that believe yeah they're
the ones who are the optimists yeah and

6146
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:33,300
the ones who are the optimists yeah and
 

6147
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,870
the ones who are the optimists yeah and
it's like uh it seems like there's some

6148
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:35,880
it's like uh it seems like there's some
 

6149
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,490
it's like uh it seems like there's some
fundamental law to the universe where

6150
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:37,500
fundamental law to the universe where
 

6151
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,470
fundamental law to the universe where
fake it till you make it kind of works

6152
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:39,480
fake it till you make it kind of works
 

6153
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,350
fake it till you make it kind of works
like believe it's possible and it

6154
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:42,360
like believe it's possible and it
 

6155
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:45,109
like believe it's possible and it
becomes possible yeah was it Henry Ford

6156
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:45,119
becomes possible yeah was it Henry Ford
 

6157
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,209
becomes possible yeah was it Henry Ford
who said that

6158
01:58:47,209 --> 01:58:47,219
who said that
 

6159
01:58:47,219 --> 01:58:49,370
who said that
if you can if you tell yourself that

6160
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:49,380
if you can if you tell yourself that
 

6161
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:52,189
if you can if you tell yourself that
it's impossible it is

6162
01:58:52,189 --> 01:58:52,199
it's impossible it is
 

6163
01:58:52,199 --> 01:58:54,410
it's impossible it is
so let's not make that mistake yeah and

6164
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:54,420
so let's not make that mistake yeah and
 

6165
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,149
so let's not make that mistake yeah and
this is a big mistake Society is making

6166
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
this is a big mistake Society is making
 

6167
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,129
this is a big mistake Society is making
or I think all in all everybody's so

6168
01:58:58,129 --> 01:58:58,139
or I think all in all everybody's so
 

6169
01:58:58,139 --> 01:58:59,570
or I think all in all everybody's so
gloomy and the media are also very

6170
01:58:59,570 --> 01:58:59,580
gloomy and the media are also very
 

6171
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:01,430
gloomy and the media are also very
biased towards if it bleeds it bleeds

6172
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:01,440
biased towards if it bleeds it bleeds
 

6173
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,530
biased towards if it bleeds it bleeds
and Bloom and doom right so

6174
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:03,540
and Bloom and doom right so
 

6175
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:05,450
and Bloom and doom right so
um

6176
01:59:05,450 --> 01:59:05,460
um
 

6177
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,310
um
most

6178
01:59:07,310 --> 01:59:07,320
most
 

6179
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,890
most
visions of the future we have or or a

6180
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:09,900
visions of the future we have or or a
 

6181
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,629
visions of the future we have or or a
dystopian which really demotivates

6182
01:59:11,629 --> 01:59:11,639
dystopian which really demotivates
 

6183
01:59:11,639 --> 01:59:14,810
dystopian which really demotivates
people we want a really really focus on

6184
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:14,820
people we want a really really focus on
 

6185
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:16,729
people we want a really really focus on
the upside also to give people the

6186
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:16,739
the upside also to give people the
 

6187
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:18,589
the upside also to give people the
willingness to fight for it

6188
01:59:18,589 --> 01:59:18,599
willingness to fight for it
 

6189
01:59:18,599 --> 01:59:21,950
willingness to fight for it
and um

6190
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:21,960

 

6191
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,930

for AI you and I mostly talked about

6192
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:23,940
for AI you and I mostly talked about
 

6193
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,089
for AI you and I mostly talked about
Gloom here again but let's not remember

6194
01:59:26,089 --> 01:59:26,099
Gloom here again but let's not remember
 

6195
01:59:26,099 --> 01:59:28,370
Gloom here again but let's not remember
not forget that you know

6196
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:28,380
not forget that you know
 

6197
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,010
not forget that you know
we have probably both lost

6198
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:31,020
we have probably both lost
 

6199
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:32,870
we have probably both lost
someone we really cared about some

6200
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
someone we really cared about some
 

6201
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:35,570
someone we really cared about some
disease that we were told was incurable

6202
01:59:35,570 --> 01:59:35,580
disease that we were told was incurable
 

6203
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:38,089
disease that we were told was incurable
well it's not there's no law in physics

6204
01:59:38,089 --> 01:59:38,099
well it's not there's no law in physics
 

6205
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:39,530
well it's not there's no law in physics
saying they have to die of that cancer

6206
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:39,540
saying they have to die of that cancer
 

6207
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:42,109
saying they have to die of that cancer
or whatever of course you can cure it

6208
01:59:42,109 --> 01:59:42,119
or whatever of course you can cure it
 

6209
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:44,089
or whatever of course you can cure it
and there's so many other things where

6210
01:59:44,089 --> 01:59:44,099
and there's so many other things where
 

6211
01:59:44,099 --> 01:59:46,070
and there's so many other things where
that we with a human intelligence have

6212
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,080
that we with a human intelligence have
 

6213
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,589
that we with a human intelligence have
also failed to solve on this planet

6214
01:59:48,589 --> 01:59:48,599
also failed to solve on this planet
 

6215
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:51,770
also failed to solve on this planet
which AI could also very much help us

6216
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:51,780
which AI could also very much help us
 

6217
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:54,530
which AI could also very much help us
with right so if we can get this right

6218
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:54,540
with right so if we can get this right
 

6219
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:57,470
with right so if we can get this right
just be a little more chill and slow

6220
01:59:57,470 --> 01:59:57,480
just be a little more chill and slow
 

6221
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,229
just be a little more chill and slow
down a little bit so we get it right

6222
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:00,239
down a little bit so we get it right
 

6223
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,990
down a little bit so we get it right
it's mind-blowing how awesome our future

6224
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:03,000
it's mind-blowing how awesome our future
 

6225
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,570
it's mind-blowing how awesome our future
can be right we talked a lot about stuff

6226
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:05,580
can be right we talked a lot about stuff
 

6227
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:07,850
can be right we talked a lot about stuff
on Earth it can be great

6228
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:07,860
on Earth it can be great
 

6229
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:10,129
on Earth it can be great
but even if you really get ambitious and

6230
02:00:10,129 --> 02:00:10,139
but even if you really get ambitious and
 

6231
02:00:10,139 --> 02:00:11,689
but even if you really get ambitious and
look up at the skies right there's no

6232
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:11,699
look up at the skies right there's no
 

6233
02:00:11,699 --> 02:00:12,950
look up at the skies right there's no
reason we have to be stuck on this

6234
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
reason we have to be stuck on this
 

6235
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,709
reason we have to be stuck on this
planet for the rest of um

6236
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:15,719
planet for the rest of um
 

6237

the remain for billions of years to come
 

6239
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:22,189
the remain for billions of years to come
we totally understand now that laws of

6240
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:22,199
we totally understand now that laws of
 

6241
02:00:22,199 --> 02:00:25,370
we totally understand now that laws of
physics let life spread out into space

6242
02:00:25,370 --> 02:00:25,380
physics let life spread out into space
 

6243
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:27,290

02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:39,420
them coming back to in the end something
 

6257
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:41,089
them coming back to in the end something
you talked about again you know this the

6258
02:00:41,089 --> 02:00:41,099
you talked about again you know this the
 

6259
02:00:41,099 --> 02:00:43,310
you talked about again you know this the
struggle how the human struggle is one

6260
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:43,320
struggle how the human struggle is one
 

6261
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,689
struggle how the human struggle is one
of the things that also really gives

6262
02:00:44,689 --> 02:00:44,699
of the things that also really gives
 

6263
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:47,030
of the things that also really gives
meaning to our lives if there's ever

6264
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:47,040
meaning to our lives if there's ever
 

6265
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,189
meaning to our lives if there's ever
been an epic struggle

6266
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:49,199
been an epic struggle
 

6267
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,470
been an epic struggle
this is it and isn't it even more epic

6268
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:51,480
this is it and isn't it even more epic
 

6269
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,089
this is it and isn't it even more epic
if you're the underdog

6270
02:00:53,089 --> 02:00:53,099
if you're the underdog
 

6271
02:00:53,099 --> 02:00:55,070
if you're the underdog
if most people are telling you this is

6272
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:55,080
if most people are telling you this is
 

6273
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:57,890
if most people are telling you this is
gonna fail it's impossible right and you

6274
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:57,900
gonna fail it's impossible right and you
 

6275
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:59,810
gonna fail it's impossible right and you
persist

6276
02:00:59,810 --> 02:00:59,820
persist
 

6277
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:01,490
persist
and you succeed

6278
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:01,500
and you succeed
 

6279
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:03,530
and you succeed
right and that's what we can do together

6280
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:03,540
right and that's what we can do together
 

6281
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,129
right and that's what we can do together
as a species on this one a lot of

6282
02:01:06,129 --> 02:01:06,139
as a species on this one a lot of
 

6283
02:01:06,139 --> 02:01:08,629
as a species on this one a lot of
pundits are ready to count this out

6284
02:01:08,629 --> 02:01:08,639
pundits are ready to count this out
 

6285
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,870
pundits are ready to count this out
both in the battle to keep AI safe and

6286
02:01:11,870 --> 02:01:11,880
both in the battle to keep AI safe and
 

6287
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,669
both in the battle to keep AI safe and
becoming a multiple planetary species

6288
02:01:13,669 --> 02:01:13,679
becoming a multiple planetary species
 

6289
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:15,370
becoming a multiple planetary species
yeah and they're they're the same

6290
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:15,380
yeah and they're they're the same
 

6291
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:18,050
yeah and they're they're the same
challenge if we can keep AI safe that's

6292
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:18,060
challenge if we can keep AI safe that's
 

6293
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:20,330
challenge if we can keep AI safe that's
how we're gonna get multi-planatory very

6294
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:20,340
how we're gonna get multi-planatory very
 

6295
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:21,410
how we're gonna get multi-planatory very
efficiently

6296
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:21,420
efficiently
 

6297
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,510
efficiently
I had some sort of technical questions

6298
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:23,520
I had some sort of technical questions
 

6299
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,649
I had some sort of technical questions
about how to get it right so one idea

6300
02:01:26,649 --> 02:01:26,659
about how to get it right so one idea
 

6301
02:01:26,659 --> 02:01:29,330
about how to get it right so one idea
uh that I'm not even sure what the right

6302
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:29,340
uh that I'm not even sure what the right
 

6303
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:32,750
uh that I'm not even sure what the right
answer is to is uh should systems like

6304
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:32,760
answer is to is uh should systems like
 

6305
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,750
answer is to is uh should systems like
gpt4 be open sourced in the whole arm

6306
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:35,760
gpt4 be open sourced in the whole arm
 

6307
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:38,030
gpt4 be open sourced in the whole arm
part can you make the can you see the

6308
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:38,040
part can you make the can you see the
 

6309
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,490
part can you make the can you see the
case for either

6310
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:40,500
case for either
 

6311
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,609
case for either
I think the answer right now is no

6312
02:01:43,609 --> 02:01:43,619
I think the answer right now is no
 

6313
02:01:43,619 --> 02:01:46,310
I think the answer right now is no
I think the answer early on was yes

6314
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:46,320
I think the answer early on was yes
 

6315
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,910
I think the answer early on was yes
so we could bring in the all the

6316
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:49,920
so we could bring in the all the
 

6317
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,010
so we could bring in the all the
wonderful create the thought process of

6318
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,020
wonderful create the thought process of
 

6319
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:55,129
wonderful create the thought process of
everybody on this but asking should we

6320
02:01:55,129 --> 02:01:55,139
everybody on this but asking should we
 

6321
02:01:55,139 --> 02:01:57,589
everybody on this but asking should we
open source gpt4 now is just the same as

6322
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
open source gpt4 now is just the same as
 

6323
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,850
open source gpt4 now is just the same as
if you say well is it good should we

6324
02:01:58,850 --> 02:01:58,860
if you say well is it good should we
 

6325
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:00,229
if you say well is it good should we
open source

6326
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,239
open source
 

6327
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:01,129
open source
um

6328
02:02:01,129 --> 02:02:01,139
um
 

6329
02:02:01,139 --> 02:02:02,870
um
you know how to build really small

6330
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:02,880
you know how to build really small
 

6331
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,050
you know how to build really small
nuclear weapons should we open source

6332
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:06,060
nuclear weapons should we open source
 

6333
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,950
nuclear weapons should we open source
how to make bio weapons

6334
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:08,960
how to make bio weapons
 

6335
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,649
how to make bio weapons
to the open source how to make um

6336
02:02:12,649 --> 02:02:12,659
to the open source how to make um
 

6337
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,930
to the open source how to make um
a new virus that kills 90 of everybody

6338
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:14,940
a new virus that kills 90 of everybody
 

6339
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:17,270
a new virus that kills 90 of everybody
who gets it of course we shouldn't

6340
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,280
who gets it of course we shouldn't
 

6341
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,490
who gets it of course we shouldn't
so it's already that powerful

6342
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:19,500
so it's already that powerful
 

6343
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,410
so it's already that powerful
it's already that powerful that we have

6344
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:21,420
it's already that powerful that we have
 

6345
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:25,189
it's already that powerful that we have
to respect the power of the systems

6346
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
to respect the power of the systems
 

6347
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,510
to respect the power of the systems
we've built

6348
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:26,520
we've built
 

6349
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,810
we've built
the knowledge that you get

6350
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:29,820
the knowledge that you get
 

6351
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,470
the knowledge that you get
um

6352
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:30,480
um
 

6353
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,189
um
from open sourcing everything we do now

6354
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:33,199
from open sourcing everything we do now
 

6355
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,510
from open sourcing everything we do now
might very well be powerful enough that

6356
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:35,520
might very well be powerful enough that
 

6357
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,970
might very well be powerful enough that
people looking at that

6358
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:37,980
people looking at that
 

6359
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:40,250
people looking at that
can use it to build the things that are

really threatening again let's get it
remember open AI is

Proto almost a little bit AGI according

6368
02:02:51,169 --> 02:02:51,179
Proto almost a little bit AGI according
 

6369

Proto almost a little bit AGI according
to what Microsoft's recent paper said

6370
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:52,920
to what Microsoft's recent paper said
 

6371
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:53,750
to what Microsoft's recent paper said
right

6372
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:53,760
right
 

6373
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,790
right
it's not that they were scared of what

it's not that they were scared of what
 

6375
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,350
it's not that they were scared of what
we're scared about is people taking that

6376
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,360
we're scared about is people taking that
 

6377
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,450
we're scared about is people taking that
who are

the company that made it right and uh
just going to town with it that's why

6384
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:08,340
just going to town with it that's why
 

6385
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:11,510
just going to town with it that's why
we want to it's it's an information

Hazard there are many things which um
 

6389
02:03:13,619 --> 02:03:15,530
Hazard there are many things which um
you know are not open sourced right now

6390
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:15,540
you know are not open sourced right now
 

6391
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:17,570
you know are not open sourced right now
in society for very good reason

6392
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:17,580
in society for very good reason
 

6393
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:20,770
in society for very good reason
like how how do you make

02:03:27,169 --> 02:03:27,179
of stuff you can buy at Home Depot you
 

6399
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:28,609
of stuff you can buy at Home Depot you
know you know you don't open source

6400
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:28,619
know you know you don't open source
 

6401
02:03:28,619 --> 02:03:30,229
know you know you don't open source
those things for a reason

6402
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:30,239
those things for a reason
 

6403
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:33,410
those things for a reason
and this is really no different

6404
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:33,420
and this is really no different
 

6405
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:35,330
and this is really no different
so uh what I'm saying that I have to say

6406
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:35,340
so uh what I'm saying that I have to say
 

6407
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,430
so uh what I'm saying that I have to say
it feels in a bit weird but in a way a

6408
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:37,440
it feels in a bit weird but in a way a
 

6409
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,410
it feels in a bit weird but in a way a
bit weird to say it because MIT is like

6410
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:39,420
bit weird to say it because MIT is like
 

6411
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:41,870
bit weird to say it because MIT is like
the Cradle of the open source movement

6412
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:41,880
the Cradle of the open source movement
 

6413
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:44,510
the Cradle of the open source movement
and I love open source in general power

6414
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:44,520
and I love open source in general power
 

6415
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,350
and I love open source in general power
to the people let's say um

6416
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:47,360
to the people let's say um
 

6417
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:50,149
to the people let's say um
but um there's always gonna be some

6418
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
but um there's always gonna be some
 

6419
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:53,570
but um there's always gonna be some
stuff that you don't open source and you

6420
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:53,580
stuff that you don't open source and you
 

6421
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:54,470
stuff that you don't open source and you
know it's just like you don't open

6422
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:54,480
know it's just like you don't open
 

6423
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,629
know it's just like you don't open
source so we have a three-month-old baby

6424
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
source so we have a three-month-old baby
 

6425
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,490
source so we have a three-month-old baby
right when he gets a little bit older

6426
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:58,500
right when he gets a little bit older
 

6427
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,629
right when he gets a little bit older
we're not going to open source to him

6428
02:03:59,629 --> 02:03:59,639
we're not going to open source to him
 

6429
02:03:59,639 --> 02:04:01,070
we're not going to open source to him
all the most dangerous things he could

6430
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:01,080
all the most dangerous things he could
 

6431
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,790
all the most dangerous things he could
do in the house yeah right

6432
02:04:03,790 --> 02:04:03,800
do in the house yeah right
 

6433
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,430
do in the house yeah right
but it does it's a weird feeling because

6434
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:07,440
but it does it's a weird feeling because
 

6435
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,250
but it does it's a weird feeling because
this is one of the first moments in

6436
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,260
this is one of the first moments in
 

6437
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:12,770
this is one of the first moments in
history where so there's a strong case

6438
02:04:12,770 --> 02:04:12,780
history where so there's a strong case
 

6439
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:15,530
history where so there's a strong case
to be made not to open source software

6440
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:15,540
to be made not to open source software
 

6441
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:18,470
to be made not to open source software
this is when the software has become

6442
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:18,480
this is when the software has become
 

6443
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,810
this is when the software has become
yeah too dangerous yeah but it's not the

6444
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:20,820
yeah too dangerous yeah but it's not the
 

6445
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:22,070
yeah too dangerous yeah but it's not the
first time that we didn't want to open

6446
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:22,080
first time that we didn't want to open
 

6447
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,990
first time that we didn't want to open
source a technology technology yeah

6448
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:27,000

 

6449
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,970

is there something to be said about how

6450
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:28,980
is there something to be said about how
 

6451
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:30,890
is there something to be said about how
to get the release of such systems right

6452
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:30,900
to get the release of such systems right
 

6453
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:34,609
to get the release of such systems right
like GPT 4 and gpt5

6454
02:04:34,609 --> 02:04:34,619
like GPT 4 and gpt5
 

6455
02:04:34,619 --> 02:04:36,470
like GPT 4 and gpt5
so open AI went through a pretty

6456
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:36,480
so open AI went through a pretty
 

6457
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,350
so open AI went through a pretty
rigorous effort for several months you

6458
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,360
rigorous effort for several months you
 

6459
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,490
rigorous effort for several months you
could say it could be longer but

6460
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:40,500
could say it could be longer but
 

6461
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,870
could say it could be longer but
nevertheless it's longer than you would

6462
02:04:41,870 --> 02:04:41,880
nevertheless it's longer than you would
 

6463
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:44,270
nevertheless it's longer than you would
have expected of trying to test the

6464
02:04:44,270 --> 02:04:44,280
have expected of trying to test the
 

6465
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,830
have expected of trying to test the
system to see like what are the ways

6466
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
system to see like what are the ways
 

6467
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,870
system to see like what are the ways
goes wrong to make it very difficult for

6468
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:47,880
goes wrong to make it very difficult for
 

6469
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,370
goes wrong to make it very difficult for
people

6470
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:49,380
people
 

6471
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:51,589
people
somewhat difficult for people to ask

6472
02:04:51,589 --> 02:04:51,599
somewhat difficult for people to ask
 

6473
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:53,990
somewhat difficult for people to ask
things how do I make a bomb for one

6474
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:54,000
things how do I make a bomb for one

those kinds of questions uh so you

6484
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
those kinds of questions uh so you
 

6485
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,430
those kinds of questions uh so you
basically use the system to do harm yeah

6486
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:09,440
basically use the system to do harm yeah
 

6487
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:12,470
basically use the system to do harm yeah
uh is there something you could say

6488
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:12,480
uh is there something you could say
 

6489
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,169
uh is there something you could say
about ideas you have it's just on

6490
02:05:15,169 --> 02:05:15,179
about ideas you have it's just on
 

6491
02:05:15,179 --> 02:05:16,490
about ideas you have it's just on
looking having thought about this

6492
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:16,500
looking having thought about this
 

6493
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,709
looking having thought about this
problem of AI safety how to release such

6494
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:18,719
problem of AI safety how to release such
 

6495
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:20,450
problem of AI safety how to release such
system how to test such systems when you

6496
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:20,460
system how to test such systems when you
 

6497
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:24,950
system how to test such systems when you
have them inside the company

6498
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:24,960

 

6499
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,850

yeah so

6500
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:28,860

 

6501
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:31,010

a lot of people say that the two biggest
 

6503
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:37,550
a lot of people say that the two biggest
risks from large language models are

6504
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:37,560

 

6505
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,609

6513
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:52,729

design I I think those are not the two

6514
02:05:52,729 --> 02:05:52,739
design I I think those are not the two
 

6515
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:54,109
design I I think those are not the two
greatest threats they're very serious

6516
02:05:54,109 --> 02:05:54,119
greatest threats they're very serious
 

6517
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:56,270
greatest threats they're very serious
threats and it's wonderful that people

6518
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:56,280
threats and it's wonderful that people
 

6519
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,310
threats and it's wonderful that people
are trying to mitigate them

6520
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:58,320
are trying to mitigate them
 

6521
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,290
are trying to mitigate them
it's a much bigger elephant in the room

6522
02:06:00,290 --> 02:06:00,300
it's a much bigger elephant in the room
 

6523
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,330
it's a much bigger elephant in the room
is how is this it's going to disrupt our

6524
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:02,340
is how is this it's going to disrupt our
 

6525
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:03,830
is how is this it's going to disrupt our
economy in a huge way obviously and

6526
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
economy in a huge way obviously and
 

6527
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,970
economy in a huge way obviously and
maybe take away a lot of the most

6528
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:04,980
maybe take away a lot of the most
 

6529
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:06,490
maybe take away a lot of the most
meaningful jobs

6530
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:06,500
meaningful jobs
 

6531
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,750
meaningful jobs
and an even bigger one is the one we

6532
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:08,760
and an even bigger one is the one we
 

6533
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,189
and an even bigger one is the one we
spent so much time talking about here

6534
02:06:10,189 --> 02:06:10,199
spent so much time talking about here
 

6535
02:06:10,199 --> 02:06:11,870
spent so much time talking about here
that that

6536
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:11,880
that that
 

6537
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,490
that that
this

6538
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:13,500
this
 

6539
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:16,129
this
becomes the Bootloader for the more

before we know it we have something else

02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:23,580
before we know it we have something else
 

6547
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,370
before we know it we have something else
which is not at all a large language

6548
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:25,380
which is not at all a large language
 

6549
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:27,290
which is not at all a large language
model it looks nothing like it but which

6550
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:27,300
model it looks nothing like it but which
 

6551
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,970
model it looks nothing like it but which
is way more intelligent than capable and

6552
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:28,980
is way more intelligent than capable and

02:06:33,410 --> 02:06:33,420
and that's the that's the elephant in
 

6557
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,570
and that's the that's the elephant in
the room and and uh obviously no matter

6558
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:35,580
the room and and uh obviously no matter
 

6559
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,129

how hard any of these companies have

02:06:37,129 --> 02:06:37,139
how hard any of these companies have
 

6561
02:06:37,139 --> 02:06:39,950
how hard any of these companies have
tried uh they that's not something

6562
02:06:39,950 --> 02:06:39,960
tried uh they that's not something
 

6563
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,450
tried uh they that's not something
that's easy for them to verify with

6564
02:06:41,450 --> 02:06:41,460
that's easy for them to verify with
 

6565
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,950
that's easy for them to verify with
large language models and the only way

6566
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:42,960
large language models and the only way
 

6567
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:43,970
large language models and the only way
to be

6568
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:43,980
to be
 

6569
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:46,729
to be
really lower that risk a lot would be

6570
02:06:46,729 --> 02:06:46,739
really lower that risk a lot would be
 

6571
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:49,310
really lower that risk a lot would be
to not let for example try not to never

so but that doesn't mean you still can't
make a lot

make a lot
 

6591
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,649
make a lot
a ton of money on them you know uh we're

6592

a ton of money on them you know uh we're
 

6593

gonna
 

6595
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:13,790
gonna
just watch now this coming year right

writes the whole text for you and then
 

6605
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:24,470
writes the whole text for you and then
you edit it

PowerPoint version of this and it makes
 

6611
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:30,350
PowerPoint version of this and it makes
it and now take the spreadsheet and blah

6612
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:30,360
it and now take the spreadsheet and blah
 

6613
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,689
it and now take the spreadsheet and blah
and you know all of those things I think

6614
02:07:32,689 --> 02:07:32,699
and you know all of those things I think
 

6615
02:07:32,699 --> 02:07:35,629
and you know all of those things I think
are you can debate the economic impact

6616
02:07:35,629 --> 02:07:35,639
are you can debate the economic impact
 

6617
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:37,729
are you can debate the economic impact
of it and whether Society is prepared to

02:07:37,729 --> 02:07:37,739
of it and whether Society is prepared to
 

6619
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:39,950
of it and whether Society is prepared to
deal with this disruption but those are

6620
02:07:39,950 --> 02:07:39,960
deal with this disruption but those are
 

6621
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:42,109
deal with this disruption but those are
not the things which

6622
02:07:42,109 --> 02:07:42,119
not the things which
 

6623
02:07:42,119 --> 02:07:43,790
not the things which
that's not the elephant of the room that

that's not the elephant of the room that

I think that's the biggest

I think that's the biggest
 

6633
02:07:50,219 --> 02:07:51,770
I think that's the biggest
misunderstanding we have a lot of people

misunderstanding we have a lot of people

6641
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,570

out about either

6642
02:07:59,570 --> 02:07:59,580
out about either
 

6643
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:01,790
out about either
is there

6644
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:01,800
is there
 

6645
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,310
is there
in terms of the actual mechanism of how

6646
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
in terms of the actual mechanism of how
 

6647
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,649
in terms of the actual mechanism of how
AI might kill all humans

6648
02:08:06,649 --> 02:08:06,659
AI might kill all humans
 

6649
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:09,229
AI might kill all humans
so something you've been outspoken about

6650
02:08:09,229 --> 02:08:09,239
so something you've been outspoken about
 

6651
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:11,570
so something you've been outspoken about
you've talked about a lot is it

6652
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:11,580
you've talked about a lot is it
 

6653
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:13,669
you've talked about a lot is it
autonomous weapon systems

6654
02:08:13,669 --> 02:08:13,679
autonomous weapon systems
 

6655
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:18,109
autonomous weapon systems
so the use of AI in war is that one of

6656
02:08:18,109 --> 02:08:18,119
so the use of AI in war is that one of
 

6657
02:08:18,119 --> 02:08:20,510
so the use of AI in war is that one of
the things that still you carry concern

6658
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:20,520
the things that still you carry concern
 

6659
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,729
the things that still you carry concern
for as these systems become more and

6660
02:08:22,729 --> 02:08:22,739
for as these systems become more and
 

6661
02:08:22,739 --> 02:08:24,229
for as these systems become more and
more powerful and Gary concern for it

6662
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:24,239
more powerful and Gary concern for it
 

6663
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:25,669
more powerful and Gary concern for it
not that all humans are going to get

6664
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:25,679
not that all humans are going to get
 

6665
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,229
not that all humans are going to get
killed by slaughterbots but rather just

6666
02:08:27,229 --> 02:08:27,239
killed by slaughterbots but rather just
 

6667
02:08:27,239 --> 02:08:28,750
killed by slaughterbots but rather just
this

6668
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:28,760
this
 

6669
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,609
this
express route into orwellian dystopia

6670
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:31,619
express route into orwellian dystopia
 

6671
02:08:31,619 --> 02:08:34,129
express route into orwellian dystopia
where it becomes much easier for very

6672
02:08:34,129 --> 02:08:34,139
where it becomes much easier for very
 

6673
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:35,810
where it becomes much easier for very
few to kill very many and therefore it

6674
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:35,820
few to kill very many and therefore it
 

6675
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:37,250
few to kill very many and therefore it
becomes very easy for very few to

6676
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:37,260
becomes very easy for very few to
 

6677
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:40,129
becomes very easy for very few to
dominate very many right

6678
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:40,139
dominate very many right
 

6679
02:08:40,139 --> 02:08:40,750
dominate very many right
um

6680
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:40,760
um
 

6681
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:43,189
um
yeah if you want to know how I could

6682
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:43,199
yeah if you want to know how I could
 

6683
02:08:43,199 --> 02:08:45,589
yeah if you want to know how I could
kill all people just ask yourself how we

6684
02:08:45,589 --> 02:08:45,599
kill all people just ask yourself how we
 

6685
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:47,149
kill all people just ask yourself how we
humans have driven a lot of species

6686
02:08:47,149 --> 02:08:47,159
humans have driven a lot of species
 

6687
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:49,550
humans have driven a lot of species
extinct how do we do it

6688
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:49,560
extinct how do we do it
 

6689
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,330
extinct how do we do it
you know we were smarter than them

6690
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:52,340
you know we were smarter than them
 

6691
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:54,770
you know we were smarter than them
usually we didn't do it even

6692
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:54,780
usually we didn't do it even
 

6693
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:56,149
usually we didn't do it even
systematically by going around

6694
02:08:56,149 --> 02:08:56,159
systematically by going around
 

6695
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,129
systematically by going around
one-on-one one after the other and

6696
02:08:58,129 --> 02:08:58,139
one-on-one one after the other and
 

6697
02:08:58,139 --> 02:08:59,629
one-on-one one after the other and
stepping on them or shooting them or

6698
02:08:59,629 --> 02:08:59,639
stepping on them or shooting them or
 

6699
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:01,430
stepping on them or shooting them or
anything like that we just like chopped

6700
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
anything like that we just like chopped
 

6701
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,229
anything like that we just like chopped
down their habitat because we needed it

6702
02:09:03,229 --> 02:09:03,239
down their habitat because we needed it
 

6703
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:04,669
down their habitat because we needed it
for something else

6704
02:09:04,669 --> 02:09:04,679
for something else
 

6705
02:09:04,679 --> 02:09:07,189
for something else
uh in some cases we did it by putting

6706
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:07,199
uh in some cases we did it by putting
 

6707
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:08,810
uh in some cases we did it by putting
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

6708
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:08,820
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
 

6709
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:09,950
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
because

6710
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:09,960
because
 

6711
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,410
because
of some reason that those animals didn't

6712
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:12,420
of some reason that those animals didn't
 

6713
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:14,510
of some reason that those animals didn't
even understand and now they're gone

6714
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:14,520
even understand and now they're gone
 

6715
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:17,089
even understand and now they're gone
right so if

6716
02:09:17,089 --> 02:09:17,099
right so if
 

6717
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:20,510
right so if
um if you're in Ai and you just wanna

6718
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,520
um if you're in Ai and you just wanna
 

6719
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,729
um if you're in Ai and you just wanna
figure something out then you decide you

6720
02:09:22,729 --> 02:09:22,739
figure something out then you decide you
 

6721
02:09:22,739 --> 02:09:25,550
figure something out then you decide you
know we just really need them the space

6722
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:25,560
know we just really need them the space
 

6723
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:28,729
know we just really need them the space
here to build more compute facilities

6724
02:09:28,729 --> 02:09:28,739
here to build more compute facilities
 

6725
02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:31,030
here to build more compute facilities
you know

6726
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,040
you know
 

6727
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:34,010
you know
if that's the only goal it has you know

6728
02:09:34,010 --> 02:09:34,020
if that's the only goal it has you know
 

6729
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:36,589
if that's the only goal it has you know
we are just the sort of accidental

6730
02:09:36,589 --> 02:09:36,599
we are just the sort of accidental
 

6731
02:09:36,599 --> 02:09:38,330
we are just the sort of accidental
roadkill along the way and you could

6732
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:38,340
roadkill along the way and you could
 

6733
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:40,010
roadkill along the way and you could
totally imagine yeah maybe this oxygen

6734
02:09:40,010 --> 02:09:40,020
totally imagine yeah maybe this oxygen
 

6735
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:41,450
totally imagine yeah maybe this oxygen
is kind of annoying because it caused

6736
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:41,460
is kind of annoying because it caused
 

6737
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:43,010
is kind of annoying because it caused
more corrosion so let's get rid of the

6738
02:09:43,010 --> 02:09:43,020
more corrosion so let's get rid of the
 

6739
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,149
more corrosion so let's get rid of the
oxygen

6740
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:44,159
oxygen
 

6741
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:46,550
oxygen
and good luck surviving after that you

6742
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:46,560
and good luck surviving after that you
 

6743
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:48,350
and good luck surviving after that you
know I I I'm not particularly concerned

6744
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:48,360
know I I I'm not particularly concerned
 

6745
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:50,270
know I I I'm not particularly concerned
that they would want to kill us just

02:09:50,270 --> 02:09:50,280
that they would want to kill us just

02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,070
that they would want to kill us just
because

because
 

6749
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,050
because
that would be like

6750
02:09:54,050 --> 02:09:54,060
that would be like
 

6751
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:58,250
that would be like
a goal in itself you know when we

6752
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:58,260
a goal in itself you know when we
 

6753

number of the elephant species extinct
 

6757
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:03,290
number of the elephant species extinct
right it wasn't because we didn't like

6758
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:03,300
right it wasn't because we didn't like
 

6759
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:06,490
right it wasn't because we didn't like
elephants

6760

6761
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:09,830

what the basic problem is you just don't

6762
02:10:09,830 --> 02:10:09,840
what the basic problem is you just don't
 

6763
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,050
what the basic problem is you just don't
want to give you don't want to seed

share your goals it's that simple so

6770
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:20,520
share your goals it's that simple so
 

6771
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:23,149
share your goals it's that simple so
which brings us to the other key

6772
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:23,159
which brings us to the other key
 

6773
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:25,310
which brings us to the other key
challenge which AI Safety Research has

6774
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:25,320
challenge which AI Safety Research has
 

6775
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:27,050
challenge which AI Safety Research has
been grappling with for a long time like

6776
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:27,060
been grappling with for a long time like
 

6777
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:29,990
been grappling with for a long time like
how do you make AI

6778
02:10:29,990 --> 02:10:30,000
how do you make AI
 

6779
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,850
how do you make AI
first of all understand our goals and

6780
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:31,860
first of all understand our goals and
 

6781
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,410
first of all understand our goals and
then adopt our goals and then retain

6782
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:33,420
then adopt our goals and then retain
 

6783
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:41,270
then adopt our goals and then retain
them as they get smarter right and um

6784
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280

 

6785
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,129

all three of those are really hard right

6786
02:10:43,129 --> 02:10:43,139
all three of those are really hard right
 

6787
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:46,010
all three of those are really hard right
like

6788
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:46,020
like
 

6789
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:49,010
like
a human child first they're just not

6790
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:49,020
a human child first they're just not
 

6791
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:51,530
a human child first they're just not
smart enough to understand our goals

6792
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:51,540
smart enough to understand our goals
 

6793
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:54,350
smart enough to understand our goals
we can't even talk

6794
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:54,360
we can't even talk
 

6795
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,209
we can't even talk
and then eventually they're teenagers

6796
02:10:56,209 --> 02:10:56,219
and then eventually they're teenagers
 

6797
02:10:56,219 --> 02:10:58,070
and then eventually they're teenagers
and understand our goals just fine but

6798
02:10:58,070 --> 02:10:58,080
and understand our goals just fine but
 

6799
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,430
and understand our goals just fine but
they don't share yeah but there is

6800
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:01,440
they don't share yeah but there is
 

6801
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,649
they don't share yeah but there is
unfortunately a magic space in the

6802
02:11:03,649 --> 02:11:03,659
unfortunately a magic space in the
 

6803
02:11:03,659 --> 02:11:04,729
unfortunately a magic space in the
Middle where they're smart enough to

6804
02:11:04,729 --> 02:11:04,739
Middle where they're smart enough to
 

6805
02:11:04,739 --> 02:11:05,930
Middle where they're smart enough to
understand our goals and malleable

6806
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:05,940
understand our goals and malleable
 

6807
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:07,129
understand our goals and malleable
enough that we can hopefully with good

6808
02:11:07,129 --> 02:11:07,139
enough that we can hopefully with good
 

6809
02:11:07,139 --> 02:11:08,330
enough that we can hopefully with good
parenting and

6810
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:08,340
parenting and
 

6811
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:10,010
parenting and
teach them right from wrong and then

6812
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:10,020
teach them right from wrong and then
 

6813
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:11,930
teach them right from wrong and then
good good goal is still good goals in

6814
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:11,940
good good goal is still good goals in
 

6815
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:13,689
good good goal is still good goals in
them right

6816
02:11:13,689 --> 02:11:13,699
them right
 

6817
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:17,089
them right
so those are all tough challenges with

6818
02:11:17,089 --> 02:11:17,099
so those are all tough challenges with
 

6819
02:11:17,099 --> 02:11:19,490
so those are all tough challenges with
computers and then you know even if you

6820
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:19,500
computers and then you know even if you
 

6821
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,990
computers and then you know even if you
teach your kids good goals when they're

6822
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:21,000
teach your kids good goals when they're
 

6823
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,729
teach your kids good goals when they're
little they might outgrow them to and

6824
02:11:22,729 --> 02:11:22,739
little they might outgrow them to and
 

6825
02:11:22,739 --> 02:11:24,830
little they might outgrow them to and
that's a challenge for machines they

6826
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:24,840
that's a challenge for machines they
 

6827
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:26,689
that's a challenge for machines they
keep improving so these are a lot of

6828
02:11:26,689 --> 02:11:26,699
keep improving so these are a lot of
 

6829
02:11:26,699 --> 02:11:30,950
keep improving so these are a lot of
hard hard challenges we're up for but I

6830
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:30,960
hard hard challenges we're up for but I
 

6831
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,089
hard hard challenges we're up for but I
don't think any of them are

6832
02:11:32,089 --> 02:11:32,099
don't think any of them are
 

6833
02:11:32,099 --> 02:11:34,430
don't think any of them are
insurmountable

6834
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:34,440
insurmountable
 

6835
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:36,530
insurmountable
the fundamental reason why

6836
02:11:36,530 --> 02:11:36,540
the fundamental reason why
 

6837
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:38,570
the fundamental reason why
Eliezer looked so depressed when I last

6838
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:38,580
Eliezer looked so depressed when I last
 

6839
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:40,189
Eliezer looked so depressed when I last
saw him was because he felt it just

6840
02:11:40,189 --> 02:11:40,199
saw him was because he felt it just
 

6841
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:43,250
saw him was because he felt it just
wasn't enough time oh not that it was

6842
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:43,260
wasn't enough time oh not that it was
 

6843
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,410
wasn't enough time oh not that it was
unsolvable because there's just not

6844
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:45,420
unsolvable because there's just not
 

6845
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:47,390
unsolvable because there's just not
enough time he was hoping that Humanity

6846
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:47,400
enough time he was hoping that Humanity
 

6847
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,530
enough time he was hoping that Humanity
was going to take this threat more

6848
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:48,540
was going to take this threat more
 

6849
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:50,450
was going to take this threat more
seriously so we would have more time

6850
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:50,460
seriously so we would have more time
 

6851
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,790
seriously so we would have more time
yeah and now we don't have more time

6852
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:52,800
yeah and now we don't have more time
 

6853
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,550
yeah and now we don't have more time
that's why the open letter is calling

6854
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:55,560
that's why the open letter is calling
 

6855
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:59,750
that's why the open letter is calling
for more time

6856
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760

 

6857
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,270

but even with time the AI alignment

6858
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:02,280
but even with time the AI alignment
 

6859
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:04,089

problem
 

6861
02:12:04,099 --> 02:12:07,729
problem
it seems to be really difficult oh yeah

6862
02:12:07,729 --> 02:12:07,739
it seems to be really difficult oh yeah
 

6863
02:12:07,739 --> 02:12:11,030
it seems to be really difficult oh yeah
but it's also the most worthy problem

6864
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040
but it's also the most worthy problem
 

6865
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,669
but it's also the most worthy problem
the most important problem for Humanity

6866
02:12:13,669 --> 02:12:13,679
the most important problem for Humanity
 

6867
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:15,290
the most important problem for Humanity
to ever solve because if we solve that

the other problems
 

6875
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:22,370
the other problems

you tell it okay

6920
02:13:12,649 --> 02:13:12,659
you tell it okay
 

6921
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:15,649
you tell it okay
do what I want you to do but I'm not

6922
02:13:15,649 --> 02:13:15,659
do what I want you to do but I'm not
 

6923
02:13:15,659 --> 02:13:17,030
do what I want you to do but I'm not
going to tell you right now what it is I

6924
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
going to tell you right now what it is I
 

6925
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,129
going to tell you right now what it is I
want you to do you need to figure it out

want you to do you need to figure it out
so then you give the incentives to be

6928
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:21,420
so then you give the incentives to be
 

6929
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:22,490
so then you give the incentives to be
very humble and keep asking you

6930
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:22,500
very humble and keep asking you
 

6931
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,050
very humble and keep asking you
questions along the way is this what you

6932
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:24,060
questions along the way is this what you
 

6933
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,970
questions along the way is this what you
really meant is this what you wanted and

6934
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:25,980
really meant is this what you wanted and
 

6935
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,950
really meant is this what you wanted and
oh this the other thing I tried didn't

6936
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:27,960
oh this the other thing I tried didn't
 

6937
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:29,149
oh this the other thing I tried didn't
work seemed like it didn't work out

6938
02:13:29,149 --> 02:13:29,159
work seemed like it didn't work out
 

6939
02:13:29,159 --> 02:13:32,870
work seemed like it didn't work out
right should I try it differently

6940
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:32,880
right should I try it differently
 

6941
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,030
right should I try it differently
what's nice about this is it's not just

6942
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:35,040
what's nice about this is it's not just
 

6943
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,010
what's nice about this is it's not just
philosophical mumbo jumbo it's theorems

6944
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:37,020
philosophical mumbo jumbo it's theorems
 

6945
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:39,470
philosophical mumbo jumbo it's theorems
and Technical work that with more time I

6946
02:13:39,470 --> 02:13:39,480
and Technical work that with more time I
 

6947
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:41,089
and Technical work that with more time I
think it can make a lot of progress and

6948
02:13:41,089 --> 02:13:41,099
think it can make a lot of progress and
 

6949
02:13:41,099 --> 02:13:42,890
think it can make a lot of progress and
there are a lot of brilliant people now

6950
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:42,900
there are a lot of brilliant people now
 

6951
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,890
there are a lot of brilliant people now
working on AI safety and we're just not

6952
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:45,900
working on AI safety and we're just not
 

6953
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,149
working on AI safety and we're just not
we just need to give them a bit more

6954
02:13:47,149 --> 02:13:47,159
we just need to give them a bit more
 

6955
02:13:47,159 --> 02:13:50,030
we just need to give them a bit more
time but also not that many relative to

6956
02:13:50,030 --> 02:13:50,040
time but also not that many relative to
 

6957
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,770
time but also not that many relative to
the skill of the problem no way exactly

6958
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:51,780
the skill of the problem no way exactly
 

6959
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,450
the skill of the problem no way exactly
there should be

6960
02:13:53,450 --> 02:13:53,460
there should be
 

6961
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:55,729
there should be
at least just like every University

6962
02:13:55,729 --> 02:13:55,739
at least just like every University
 

6963
02:13:55,739 --> 02:13:58,669
at least just like every University
worth its name has some cancer research

6964
02:13:58,669 --> 02:13:58,679
worth its name has some cancer research
 

6965
02:13:58,679 --> 02:14:01,310
worth its name has some cancer research
going on in its biology Department right

6966
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:01,320
going on in its biology Department right
 

6967
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:03,109
going on in its biology Department right
every University that's computer that

6968
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
every University that's computer that
 

6969
02:14:03,119 --> 02:14:05,810
every University that's computer that
does computer science should have a real

6970
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:05,820
does computer science should have a real
 

6971
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:08,209
does computer science should have a real
effort in this area and it's nowhere

6972
02:14:08,209 --> 02:14:08,219
effort in this area and it's nowhere
 

6973
02:14:08,219 --> 02:14:10,850
effort in this area and it's nowhere
near that this is something I hope is

6974
02:14:10,850 --> 02:14:10,860
near that this is something I hope is
 

6975
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:14,030
near that this is something I hope is
changing now thanks to the gpt4 right so

6976
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:14,040
changing now thanks to the gpt4 right so
 

6977
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:15,530
changing now thanks to the gpt4 right so
I I think

6978
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:15,540
I I think
 

6979
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:18,410
I I think
if there's a silver lining to um what's

6980
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:18,420
if there's a silver lining to um what's
 

6981
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:20,629
if there's a silver lining to um what's
happening here even though I think many

6982
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
happening here even though I think many
 

6983
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,430
happening here even though I think many
people would wish it would have been

6984
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:22,440
people would wish it would have been
 

6985
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,890
people would wish it would have been
rolled out more carefully is that this

6986
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:24,900
rolled out more carefully is that this
 

6987
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:26,689
rolled out more carefully is that this
might be the wake-up call

6988
02:14:26,689 --> 02:14:26,699
might be the wake-up call
 

6989
02:14:26,699 --> 02:14:29,330
might be the wake-up call
that Humanity needed

6990
02:14:29,330 --> 02:14:29,340
that Humanity needed
 

6991
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,729
that Humanity needed
to really

6992
02:14:31,729 --> 02:14:31,739
to really
 

6993
02:14:31,739 --> 02:14:33,890
to really
stop the stop fantasizing about this

6994
02:14:33,890 --> 02:14:33,900
stop the stop fantasizing about this
 

6995
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:36,169
stop the stop fantasizing about this

about this being completely controllable
 

6999
02:14:38,099 --> 02:14:40,310
about this being completely controllable
and predictable because

7000
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
and predictable because
 

7001
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,970
and predictable because
it's so obvious it's it's

because the the engineers had built it
 

7017
02:15:02,699 --> 02:15:04,729
because the the engineers had built it
was like

7018
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:04,739
was like

let's put this in here and and screw a

7020
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:08,040
let's put this in here and and screw a
 

7021
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,589
let's put this in here and and screw a
little bit with people

7022
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
little bit with people
 

7023
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:11,629
little bit with people
they haven't predicted at all

7024
02:15:11,629 --> 02:15:11,639
they haven't predicted at all
 

7025
02:15:11,639 --> 02:15:14,410
they haven't predicted at all
they built the giant black box and

7026
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:14,420
they built the giant black box and
 

7027
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,850
they built the giant black box and
trained to predict the next word and got

7028
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:16,860
trained to predict the next word and got
 

7029
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:19,010
trained to predict the next word and got
all these emergent properties and oops

7030
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:19,020
all these emergent properties and oops
 

7031
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:21,290
all these emergent properties and oops
it did this you know

7032
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:21,300
it did this you know
 

7033
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:22,310
it did this you know
um

7034
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:22,320
um
 

7035
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,810
um
yeah

7036
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:23,820
yeah
 

7037
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:25,609
yeah
I I think this is a very powerful

7038
02:15:25,609 --> 02:15:25,619
I I think this is a very powerful
 

7039
02:15:25,619 --> 02:15:27,950
I I think this is a very powerful
wake-up call and now anyone watching

7040
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,960
wake-up call and now anyone watching
 

7041
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,589
wake-up call and now anyone watching
this is not scared I would encourage

7042
02:15:30,589 --> 02:15:30,599
this is not scared I would encourage
 

7043
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:32,629
this is not scared I would encourage
them to just play a bit more with these

7044
02:15:32,629 --> 02:15:32,639
them to just play a bit more with these
 

7045
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:35,149
them to just play a bit more with these
these tools they're out there now like

7046
02:15:35,149 --> 02:15:35,159
these tools they're out there now like
 

7047
02:15:35,159 --> 02:15:36,890
these tools they're out there now like
gpd4

7048
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:36,900
gpd4
 

7049
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:40,850
gpd4
and um

7050
02:15:40,850 --> 02:15:40,860

 

7051
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:42,589

so wake-up call is First Step once

7052
02:15:42,589 --> 02:15:42,599
so wake-up call is First Step once
 

7053
02:15:42,599 --> 02:15:45,109
so wake-up call is First Step once
you've broken up uh then gotta slow down

7054
02:15:45,109 --> 02:15:45,119
you've broken up uh then gotta slow down
 

7055
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:47,209
you've broken up uh then gotta slow down
a little bit the risky stuff

7056
02:15:47,209 --> 02:15:47,219
a little bit the risky stuff
 

7057
02:15:47,219 --> 02:15:49,910
a little bit the risky stuff
to give a chance to all everyone's woken

7058

to give a chance to all everyone's woken
 

7059
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,370
to give a chance to all everyone's woken
up to to catch up with us on the safety

that's computer science but in general
 

7067
02:15:58,739 --> 02:16:00,530
that's computer science but in general
but let's just even say computer science

7068
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:00,540
but let's just even say computer science
 

7069

with the big problems of the world is
 

7137
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,410
with the big problems of the world is
through the education system and if the

7138
02:17:24,410 --> 02:17:24,420
through the education system and if the
 

7139
02:17:24,420 --> 02:17:26,030

having these kinds of conversations is

7144
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:30,780
having these kinds of conversations is
 

7145
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:33,110
having these kinds of conversations is
essential to try to figure it out and

everything is happening so rapidly uh I
 

7149
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,849
everything is happening so rapidly uh I
don't think there's even speaking of

don't think there's even speaking of
 

7151
02:17:37,859 --> 02:17:41,089
don't think there's even speaking of
safety what broad AI safety Define I

7152
02:17:41,089 --> 02:17:41,099
safety what broad AI safety Define I
 

7153
02:17:41,099 --> 02:17:42,230
safety what broad AI safety Define I
don't think most universities have

7154
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:42,240
don't think most universities have
 

7155
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,169
don't think most universities have
courses on AI safety it's like

7156

this say this but I feel our education

7162
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:51,780
this say this but I feel our education
 

7163
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:55,310

I love this question
 

7215
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,469
I love this question
so let's define consciousness first

7216
02:18:57,469 --> 02:18:57,479
so let's define consciousness first
 

7217
02:18:57,479 --> 02:18:59,929
so let's define consciousness first
because in my experience like 90 of all

7218

because in my experience like 90 of all
 

7219
02:18:59,939 --> 02:19:02,629
because in my experience like 90 of all
arguments about Consciousness before I

arguments about Consciousness before I
 

7221
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:03,889

land to the two people arguing having

I define consciousness

7230
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:11,760
I define consciousness
 

7231
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,629
I define consciousness
as subjective experience

7232
02:19:14,629 --> 02:19:14,639
as subjective experience
 

7233
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:17,150
as subjective experience
right now I'm experiencing colors and

7234
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:17,160
right now I'm experiencing colors and
 

7235
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:20,209
right now I'm experiencing colors and

fine by me but then maybe use a

fine by me but then maybe use a
 

7251
02:19:33,899 --> 02:19:36,589
fine by me but then maybe use a
different word for it or they can I'm

like from your eye retina into the back

7332
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:01,260
like from your eye retina into the back
 

7333
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:02,330
like from your eye retina into the back
of your brain for example that's not

02:21:02,330 --> 02:21:02,340
of your brain for example that's not
 

7335
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:04,010
of your brain for example that's not
conscious so he would predict that your

7336
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:04,020
conscious so he would predict that your
 

7337
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:05,510

thing about gpt4 is it's also one-way

7344
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:13,740
thing about gpt4 is it's also one-way
 

7345
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:15,770
thing about gpt4 is it's also one-way
flow of information so if tanoni is

7346
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:15,780
flow of information so if tanoni is
 

7347
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:19,570
flow of information so if tanoni is
right and gpt4 is a very intelligent

02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:27,840
and this is
 

7355
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:30,170
and this is
both a relief in that you don't have if

7356
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:30,180
both a relief in that you don't have if
 

7357
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:31,370
both a relief in that you don't have if
it's true you know in that you don't

it's true you know in that you don't
 

7359
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:33,050
it's true you know in that you don't
have to feel guilty about turning off

have to feel guilty about turning off
 

7361

have to feel guilty about turning off
gpt4 and wiping its memory whenever a

I wouldn't like if someone you did that

7366
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:39,960
I wouldn't like if someone you did that
 

7367
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:41,870
I wouldn't like if someone you did that
to me neutralized me like in Men In

Black
 

7371
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:45,530
Black
but it's also

7372
02:21:45,530 --> 02:21:45,540
but it's also
 

7373
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:48,650
but it's also
creepy that you can have very high

7374
02:21:48,650 --> 02:21:48,660
creepy that you can have very high
 

7375
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:50,510
creepy that you can have very high
intelligence perhaps then it's not

7376
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:50,520
intelligence perhaps then it's not
 

7377
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,730
intelligence perhaps then it's not
conscious because if we get replaced by

02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:52,740
conscious because if we get replaced by
 

7379
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:55,730

7381
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,650

and by the sad enough that Humanity

7382
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:57,660
and by the sad enough that Humanity
 

7383
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:59,690
and by the sad enough that Humanity
isn't here anymore because I kind of

7384
02:21:59,690 --> 02:21:59,700
isn't here anymore because I kind of
 

7385
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:02,210
isn't here anymore because I kind of
like Humanity

7386
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:02,220
like Humanity
 

7387
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:03,950
like Humanity
but at least if the machines were

7388
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:03,960
but at least if the machines were
 

7389
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,210
but at least if the machines were
conscious they could be like well but

7390
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:05,220
conscious they could be like well but
 

7391
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:07,070
conscious they could be like well but
they are descendants and maybe we they

7392
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:07,080
they are descendants and maybe we they
 

7393
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:09,530
they are descendants and maybe we they
have our values they're our children but

7394
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:09,540
have our values they're our children but
 

7395
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:11,750
have our values they're our children but
if if tenoni is right and it's all these

not in the sense of the of Hollywood but

so I actually think uh

02:22:39,889 --> 02:22:39,899
so I actually think uh

should do more research on figuring out

02:22:44,809 --> 02:22:44,819
should do more research on figuring out
 

7427
02:22:44,819 --> 02:22:46,309
should do more research on figuring out
what kind of information processing

what kind of information processing
 

7429
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:47,809
what kind of information processing
actually has experience because I think

02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:47,819
actually has experience because I think
 

7431
02:22:47,819 --> 02:22:50,150
actually has experience because I think
that's what it's all about and I

7432
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,160
that's what it's all about and I
 

7433
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,130
that's what it's all about and I
completely don't buy

completely don't buy

people will say well this is all
 

7439
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:57,770
people will say well this is all
 because Consciousness equals

because Consciousness equals

accomplishing any goals at all you're

02:23:06,359 --> 02:23:09,590
accomplishing any goals at all you're

just reflecting on something and you can

02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,450

we will not allow AI systems

we will not allow AI systems

02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:29,809
we will not allow AI systems
self-consciousness we'll come up with

about measuring Consciousness that will

about measuring Consciousness that will

about measuring Consciousness that will

02:23:38,450 --> 02:23:38,460
like I worry about that because maybe we
 

7477
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:42,170
like I worry about that because maybe we
humans will create something that is

humans will create something that is
better than us humans in the in the way

7480
02:23:45,469 --> 02:23:45,479
better than us humans in the in the way
 

7481
02:23:45,479 --> 02:23:47,929
better than us humans in the in the way
that we find beautiful which is they

7482
02:23:47,929 --> 02:23:47,939
that we find beautiful which is they
 

7483
02:23:47,939 --> 02:23:50,870
that we find beautiful which is they
they cut they have a deeper subjective

7484
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:50,880
they cut they have a deeper subjective
 

7485
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,150
they cut they have a deeper subjective
experience of reality not only are they

7486
02:23:53,150 --> 02:23:53,160
experience of reality not only are they
 

7487
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:56,090
experience of reality not only are they
smarter but they feel deeper and we

7488
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,100
smarter but they feel deeper and we
 

7489
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:59,090
smarter but they feel deeper and we
humans will hate them for it

7490
02:23:59,090 --> 02:23:59,100
humans will hate them for it
 

7491
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,969
humans will hate them for it
as we as human history has shown

7492
02:24:01,969 --> 02:24:01,979
as we as human history has shown
 

7493
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:03,950
as we as human history has shown
they'll be the other will try to

7494
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:03,960
they'll be the other will try to
 

7495
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:05,990
they'll be the other will try to
suppress it they'll create conflict

7496
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:06,000
suppress it they'll create conflict
 

7497
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,450
suppress it they'll create conflict
they'll create War all of this I I worry

7498
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:08,460
they'll create War all of this I I worry
 

7499
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:10,610
they'll create War all of this I I worry
about this too are you saying that we

7500
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:10,620
about this too are you saying that we
 

7501
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:11,929
about this too are you saying that we
humans sometimes come up with

7502
02:24:11,929 --> 02:24:11,939
humans sometimes come up with
 

7503
02:24:11,939 --> 02:24:14,809
humans sometimes come up with
self-serving arguments no we would never

7504
02:24:14,809 --> 02:24:14,819
self-serving arguments no we would never
 

7505
02:24:14,819 --> 02:24:16,670
self-serving arguments no we would never
do that would we well that's the danger

7506
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:16,680
do that would we well that's the danger
 

7507
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,790
do that would we well that's the danger
here is uh even in this early stages we

7508
02:24:19,790 --> 02:24:19,800
here is uh even in this early stages we
 

7509
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,410
here is uh even in this early stages we
might create something beautiful yeah

7510
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:21,420
might create something beautiful yeah
 

7511
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:26,870
might create something beautiful yeah
and uh will erase its memory I I

7512
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:26,880
and uh will erase its memory I I
 

7513
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,969
and uh will erase its memory I I
was horrified as a kid when someone

7514
02:24:28,969 --> 02:24:28,979
was horrified as a kid when someone
 

7515
02:24:28,979 --> 02:24:31,030
was horrified as a kid when someone
started boiling uh

7516
02:24:31,030 --> 02:24:31,040
started boiling uh
 

7517
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,550
started boiling uh
boiling lobsters like oh my God that

7518
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:34,560
boiling lobsters like oh my God that
 

7519
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,309
boiling lobsters like oh my God that
that's so cruel and some grown-up there

7520
02:24:37,309 --> 02:24:37,319
that's so cruel and some grown-up there
 

7521
02:24:37,319 --> 02:24:39,349
that's so cruel and some grown-up there
back in Sweden said oh it doesn't feel

7522
02:24:39,349 --> 02:24:39,359
back in Sweden said oh it doesn't feel
 

7523
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:41,630
back in Sweden said oh it doesn't feel
pain I'm like how do you know that oh

7524
02:24:41,630 --> 02:24:41,640
pain I'm like how do you know that oh
 

7525
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:44,110
pain I'm like how do you know that oh
scientists have shown that

7526
02:24:44,110 --> 02:24:44,120
scientists have shown that
 

7527
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:46,610
scientists have shown that
and then there was a recent study where

7528
02:24:46,610 --> 02:24:46,620
and then there was a recent study where
 

7529
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:47,690
and then there was a recent study where
they showed that lobsters actually do

7530
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:47,700
they showed that lobsters actually do
 

7531
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:48,650
they showed that lobsters actually do
feel pain

7532
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:48,660
feel pain
 

7533
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:50,330
feel pain
when you boil them so they banned

7534
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:50,340
when you boil them so they banned
 

7535
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,950
when you boil them so they banned
Lobster boiling in Switzerland now you

7536
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:51,960
Lobster boiling in Switzerland now you
 

7537
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,969
Lobster boiling in Switzerland now you
have to kill them in a different way

7538
02:24:52,969 --> 02:24:52,979
have to kill them in a different way
 

7539
02:24:52,979 --> 02:24:53,750
have to kill them in a different way
first

7540
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:53,760
first
 

7541
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,150
first
so it's presumably scientific research

7542
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:56,160
so it's presumably scientific research
 

7543
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,610
so it's presumably scientific research
boil down to someone asked the lobster

7544
02:24:58,610 --> 02:24:58,620
boil down to someone asked the lobster
 

7545
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,250
boil down to someone asked the lobster
does this hurt

7546
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:00,260
does this hurt
 

7547
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:02,809
does this hurt
survey so we do the same thing with

7548
02:25:02,809 --> 02:25:02,819
survey so we do the same thing with
 

7549
02:25:02,819 --> 02:25:04,490
survey so we do the same thing with
cruelty to farm animals also all these

7550
02:25:04,490 --> 02:25:04,500
cruelty to farm animals also all these
 

7551
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,830
cruelty to farm animals also all these
self-serving Arguments for why they're

7552
02:25:06,830 --> 02:25:06,840
self-serving Arguments for why they're
 

7553
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:09,230
self-serving Arguments for why they're
fine and yeah so we should certainly

7554
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:09,240
fine and yeah so we should certainly
 

7555
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:11,389
fine and yeah so we should certainly
what the watchful I think step one is

7556
02:25:11,389 --> 02:25:11,399
what the watchful I think step one is
 

7557
02:25:11,399 --> 02:25:13,130
what the watchful I think step one is
just be humble and acknowledge that

7558
02:25:13,130 --> 02:25:13,140
just be humble and acknowledge that
 

7559
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:14,750
just be humble and acknowledge that
Consciousness is not the same thing as

7560
02:25:14,750 --> 02:25:14,760
Consciousness is not the same thing as
 

7561
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:15,830
Consciousness is not the same thing as
intelligence

7562
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840
intelligence
 

7563
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,410
intelligence
and I believe that Consciousness still

7564
02:25:18,410 --> 02:25:18,420
and I believe that Consciousness still
 

7565
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,150
and I believe that Consciousness still
is a form of information processing

7566
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,160
is a form of information processing
 

7567
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,590
is a form of information processing
where it's really information being

7568
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:21,600
where it's really information being
 

7569
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,030
where it's really information being
aware of itself in a certain way and

7570
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,040
aware of itself in a certain way and
 

7571
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,550
aware of itself in a certain way and
let's study it and give ourselves a

7572
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:25,560
let's study it and give ourselves a
 

7573
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:26,690
let's study it and give ourselves a
little bit of time and I think we will

7574
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:26,700
little bit of time and I think we will
 

7575
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:29,150
little bit of time and I think we will
be able to figure out actually what it

7576
02:25:29,150 --> 02:25:29,160
be able to figure out actually what it
 

7577
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:30,050
be able to figure out actually what it
is

7578
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:30,060
is
 

7579
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:31,730
is
that causes Consciousness and then we

7580
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:31,740
that causes Consciousness and then we
 

7581
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:34,490
that causes Consciousness and then we
can make probably unconscious robots

7582
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:34,500
can make probably unconscious robots
 

7583
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:36,650
can make probably unconscious robots
that do the boring jobs that we would

7584
02:25:36,650 --> 02:25:36,660
that do the boring jobs that we would
 

7585
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:38,690
that do the boring jobs that we would
feel immoral to give the machines but if

7586
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:38,700
feel immoral to give the machines but if
 

7587
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:40,309
feel immoral to give the machines but if
you have a companion robot taking care

7588
02:25:40,309 --> 02:25:40,319
you have a companion robot taking care
 

7589
02:25:40,319 --> 02:25:42,830
you have a companion robot taking care
of your mom

7590
02:25:42,830 --> 02:25:42,840
of your mom
 

7591
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,630
of your mom
or something like that she would

7592
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:44,640
or something like that she would
 

7593
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:45,830
or something like that she would
probably want it to be conscious right

7594
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:45,840
probably want it to be conscious right
 

7595
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:48,110
probably want it to be conscious right
so the emotions it seems to display

7596
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:48,120
so the emotions it seems to display
 

7597
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:49,429
so the emotions it seems to display
aren't fake

7598
02:25:49,429 --> 02:25:49,439
aren't fake
 

7599
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:52,550
aren't fake
all these things can be

7600
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:52,560
all these things can be
 

7601
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,469
all these things can be
done in a good way if we give ourselves

7602
02:25:54,469 --> 02:25:54,479
done in a good way if we give ourselves
 

7603
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:57,650
done in a good way if we give ourselves
a little bit of time and don't run and

7604
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:57,660
a little bit of time and don't run and
 

7605
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:59,870
a little bit of time and don't run and
take on this challenge is there

7606
02:25:59,870 --> 02:25:59,880
take on this challenge is there
 

7607
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:01,610
take on this challenge is there
something you could say to the timeline

7608
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:01,620
something you could say to the timeline
 

7609
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:04,910
something you could say to the timeline
that you think about uh about the

7610
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:04,920
that you think about uh about the
 

7611
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:06,889
that you think about uh about the
development of AGI

7612
02:26:06,889 --> 02:26:06,899
development of AGI
 

7613
02:26:06,899 --> 02:26:08,510
development of AGI
depending on the day I'm sure that

7614
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:08,520
depending on the day I'm sure that
 

7615
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:11,510
depending on the day I'm sure that
changes for you but when do you think

7616
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,520
changes for you but when do you think
 

7617
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:14,030
changes for you but when do you think
there'll be a really big leap in

7618
02:26:14,030 --> 02:26:14,040
there'll be a really big leap in
 

7619
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:16,309
there'll be a really big leap in
intelligence where it would definitively

7620
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:16,319
intelligence where it would definitively
 

7621
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:18,650
intelligence where it would definitively
say we have built AGI do you think it's

7622
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:18,660
say we have built AGI do you think it's
 

7623
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:20,870
say we have built AGI do you think it's
one year from now five years from now 10

7624
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:20,880
one year from now five years from now 10
 

7625
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:23,030
one year from now five years from now 10
20 50.

7626
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:23,040
20 50.
 

7627
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:27,469
20 50.
what's Your Gut say

7628
02:26:27,469 --> 02:26:27,479

 

7629
02:26:27,479 --> 02:26:31,370

honestly

7630
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:31,380

 

7631
02:26:31,380 --> 02:26:33,349

for the past decade I've deliberately

7632
02:26:33,349 --> 02:26:33,359
for the past decade I've deliberately
 

7633
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:35,150
for the past decade I've deliberately
given very long timelines because I

7634
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:35,160
given very long timelines because I
 

7635
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:36,710
given very long timelines because I
didn't want to fuel some kind of stupid

7636
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:36,720
didn't want to fuel some kind of stupid
 

7637
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:40,010
didn't want to fuel some kind of stupid

02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:03,290
those guys
they were out and I believe those were

7796
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:03,300
they were out and I believe those were
 

7797
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:05,690
they were out and I believe those were
still alive or in jail now right so so

7798
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:05,700
still alive or in jail now right so so
 

7799
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:08,389
still alive or in jail now right so so
you know the Russian leadership is

7800
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
you know the Russian leadership is
 

7801
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,610
you know the Russian leadership is
entirely cornered where they know that

7802
02:30:10,610 --> 02:30:10,620
entirely cornered where they know that
 

7803
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:12,830
entirely cornered where they know that
uh just

7804
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:12,840
uh just
 

7805
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:15,170
uh just
getting driven out of Ukraine is not an

7806
02:30:15,170 --> 02:30:15,180
getting driven out of Ukraine is not an
 

7807
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,550
getting driven out of Ukraine is not an
option

7808
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,560
option
 

7809
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:20,510
option
um and um

7810
02:30:20,510 --> 02:30:20,520

 

7811
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:23,929

so this to me is a typical example of

7812
02:30:23,929 --> 02:30:23,939
so this to me is a typical example of
 

7813
02:30:23,939 --> 02:30:26,210
so this to me is a typical example of
molecu you have these incentives of the

7814
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:26,220
molecu you have these incentives of the
 

7815
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:27,889
molecu you have these incentives of the
two parties

7816
02:30:27,889 --> 02:30:27,899
two parties
 

7817
02:30:27,899 --> 02:30:29,690
two parties
where both of them are just driven to

7818
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:29,700
where both of them are just driven to
 

7819
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:31,370
where both of them are just driven to
escalate more and more right if Russia

7820
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:31,380
escalate more and more right if Russia
 

7821
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:32,690
escalate more and more right if Russia
starts losing in the conventional

7822
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:32,700
starts losing in the conventional
 

7823
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:33,770
starts losing in the conventional
Warfare

7824
02:30:33,770 --> 02:30:33,780
Warfare
 

7825
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:36,710
Warfare
the only thing they can do with since

7826
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:36,720
the only thing they can do with since
 

7827
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:37,670
the only thing they can do with since
the back against the war is to keep

7828
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:37,680
the back against the war is to keep
 

7829
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,710
the back against the war is to keep
escalating

7830
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:38,720
escalating
 

7831
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:41,809
escalating
and but and the West has put itself in

7832
02:30:41,809 --> 02:30:41,819
and but and the West has put itself in
 

7833
02:30:41,819 --> 02:30:43,670
and but and the West has put itself in
the in the situation now we're sort of

7834
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:43,680
the in the situation now we're sort of
 

7835
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:45,349
the in the situation now we're sort of
already committed that the drive rush

7836
02:30:45,349 --> 02:30:45,359
already committed that the drive rush
 

7837
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:47,090
already committed that the drive rush
out so the only option the West has is

7838
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:47,100
out so the only option the West has is
 

7839
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:49,309
out so the only option the West has is
to call Russ's Bluff and keep sending in

7840
02:30:49,309 --> 02:30:49,319
to call Russ's Bluff and keep sending in
 

7841
02:30:49,319 --> 02:30:50,530
to call Russ's Bluff and keep sending in
more weapons

7842
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:50,540
more weapons
 

7843
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:53,330
more weapons
this really bothers me because moloch

7844
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:53,340
this really bothers me because moloch
 

7845
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:55,730
this really bothers me because moloch
can sometimes Drive competing parties to

7846
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:55,740
can sometimes Drive competing parties to
 

7847
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:57,230
can sometimes Drive competing parties to
do something which is ultimately just

7848
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:57,240
do something which is ultimately just
 

7849
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:59,510
do something which is ultimately just
really bad for both of them

7850
02:30:59,510 --> 02:30:59,520
really bad for both of them
 

7851
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,389
really bad for both of them
and uh you know what makes me even more

7852
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
and uh you know what makes me even more
 

7853
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:04,790
and uh you know what makes me even more
worried is not just that I

7854
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
worried is not just that I
 

7855
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:06,469
worried is not just that I
it's

7856
02:31:06,469 --> 02:31:06,479
it's
 

7857
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:09,770
it's
difficult to see an ending

7858
02:31:09,770 --> 02:31:09,780
difficult to see an ending
 

7859
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:12,290
difficult to see an ending
a quick peaceful ending to this tragedy

7860
02:31:12,290 --> 02:31:12,300
a quick peaceful ending to this tragedy
 

7861
02:31:12,300 --> 02:31:14,630
a quick peaceful ending to this tragedy
that doesn't involve some horrible

7862
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640
that doesn't involve some horrible
 

7863
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,250
that doesn't involve some horrible
escalation

7864
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:16,260
escalation
 

7865
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:18,530
escalation
um but also that we understand more

7866
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:18,540
um but also that we understand more
 

7867
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:19,969
um but also that we understand more
clearly now just how horrible it was

7868
02:31:19,969 --> 02:31:19,979
clearly now just how horrible it was
 

7869
02:31:19,979 --> 02:31:21,410
clearly now just how horrible it was
gonna it would be

7870
02:31:21,410 --> 02:31:21,420
gonna it would be
 

7871
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,630
gonna it would be
there was an amazing paper that was

7872
02:31:23,630 --> 02:31:23,640
there was an amazing paper that was
 

7873
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:28,370
there was an amazing paper that was
published in nature food this uh August

7874
02:31:28,370 --> 02:31:28,380
published in nature food this uh August
 

7875
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:30,650
published in nature food this uh August
by some of the top researchers who've

7876
02:31:30,650 --> 02:31:30,660
by some of the top researchers who've
 

7877
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:31,910
by some of the top researchers who've
been studying nuclear winter for a long

7878
02:31:31,910 --> 02:31:31,920
been studying nuclear winter for a long
 

7879
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:33,650
been studying nuclear winter for a long
time and what they basically did was

7880
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:33,660
time and what they basically did was
 

7881
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:35,990
time and what they basically did was
they combined

7882
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
they combined
 

7883
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,910
they combined
climate models

7884
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:37,920
climate models
 

7885
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:40,370
climate models
with

7886
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:40,380
with
 

7887
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:43,370
with
food agricultural models so instead of

7888
02:31:43,370 --> 02:31:43,380
food agricultural models so instead of
 

7889
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:44,929
food agricultural models so instead of
just saying yeah you know it gets really

7890
02:31:44,929 --> 02:31:44,939
just saying yeah you know it gets really
 

7891
02:31:44,939 --> 02:31:46,670
just saying yeah you know it gets really
cold blah blah they figured out actually

7892
02:31:46,670 --> 02:31:46,680
cold blah blah they figured out actually
 

7893
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,050
cold blah blah they figured out actually
how many people would die in the

7894
02:31:48,050 --> 02:31:48,060
how many people would die in the
 

7895
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:49,969
how many people would die in the
different different countries

7896
02:31:49,969 --> 02:31:49,979
different different countries
 

7897
02:31:49,979 --> 02:31:52,309
different different countries
and it's uh it's pretty mind-blowing you

7898
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319
and it's uh it's pretty mind-blowing you
 

7899
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:53,510
and it's uh it's pretty mind-blowing you
know so basically what happens you know

7900
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
know so basically what happens you know
 

7901
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:54,889
know so basically what happens you know
is the thing that kills the most people

7902
02:31:54,889 --> 02:31:54,899
is the thing that kills the most people
 

7903
02:31:54,899 --> 02:31:56,389
is the thing that kills the most people
is not the explosions it's not the

7904
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:56,399
is not the explosions it's not the
 

7905
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:59,090
is not the explosions it's not the
radioactivity it's not the EMP Mayhem

7906
02:31:59,090 --> 02:31:59,100
radioactivity it's not the EMP Mayhem
 

7907
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,610
radioactivity it's not the EMP Mayhem
it's not the right

7908
02:32:01,610 --> 02:32:01,620
it's not the right
 

7909
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:04,670
it's not the right
the rampaging mobs forcing food no it's

7910
02:32:04,670 --> 02:32:04,680
the rampaging mobs forcing food no it's
 

7911
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:06,590
the rampaging mobs forcing food no it's
it's the fact that you get so much smoke

7912
02:32:06,590 --> 02:32:06,600
it's the fact that you get so much smoke
 

7913
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:08,389
it's the fact that you get so much smoke
coming up from the burning cities into

7914
02:32:08,389 --> 02:32:08,399
coming up from the burning cities into
 

7915
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:12,530
coming up from the burning cities into
the stratosphere that um

7916
02:32:12,530 --> 02:32:12,540
the stratosphere that um
 

7917
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:14,210
the stratosphere that um
that spreads around the earth from the

7918
02:32:14,210 --> 02:32:14,220
that spreads around the earth from the
 

7919
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:16,010
that spreads around the earth from the
jet streams so

7920
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:16,020
jet streams so
 

7921
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:18,590
jet streams so
in typical models you get like 10 years

7922
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:18,600
in typical models you get like 10 years
 

7923
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:22,190
in typical models you get like 10 years
or so where it's just crazy cold and

7924
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:22,200
or so where it's just crazy cold and
 

7925
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,950
or so where it's just crazy cold and
during the first year or after the the

7926
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:24,960
during the first year or after the the
 

7927
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:27,889
during the first year or after the the
war and their models

7928
02:32:27,889 --> 02:32:27,899
war and their models
 

7929
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:31,490
war and their models
the temperature drops in in Nebraska and

7930
02:32:31,490 --> 02:32:31,500
the temperature drops in in Nebraska and
 

7931
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:34,250
the temperature drops in in Nebraska and
in the Ukraine bread baskets you know by

7932
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:34,260
in the Ukraine bread baskets you know by
 

7933
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,990
in the Ukraine bread baskets you know by
like

7934
02:32:35,990 --> 02:32:36,000
like
 

7935
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,690
like
20 Celsius or so if I remember

7936
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:38,700
20 Celsius or so if I remember
 

7937
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:42,469
20 Celsius or so if I remember
no yeah 2030 Celsius depending on where

7938
02:32:42,469 --> 02:32:42,479
no yeah 2030 Celsius depending on where
 

7939
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:44,450
no yeah 2030 Celsius depending on where
you are 40 so it's just in some places

7940
02:32:44,450 --> 02:32:44,460
you are 40 so it's just in some places
 

7941
02:32:44,460 --> 02:32:46,490
you are 40 so it's just in some places
which is you know 40 Fahrenheit to 80

7942
02:32:46,490 --> 02:32:46,500
which is you know 40 Fahrenheit to 80
 

7943
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:47,630
which is you know 40 Fahrenheit to 80
Fahrenheit colder than what it would

7944
02:32:47,630 --> 02:32:47,640
Fahrenheit colder than what it would
 

7945
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,770
Fahrenheit colder than what it would
normally be

7946
02:32:48,770 --> 02:32:48,780
normally be
 

7947
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:52,130
normally be
so you know I'm not good at farming but

7948
02:32:52,130 --> 02:32:52,140
so you know I'm not good at farming but
 

7949
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:55,730
so you know I'm not good at farming but
uh it's knowing if it drops below

7950
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:55,740
uh it's knowing if it drops below
 

7951
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:58,010
uh it's knowing if it drops below
freezing pretty much almost days in July

7952
02:32:58,010 --> 02:32:58,020
freezing pretty much almost days in July
 

7953
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,630
freezing pretty much almost days in July
and then like that's not good so they

7954
02:32:59,630 --> 02:32:59,640
and then like that's not good so they
 

7955
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,889
and then like that's not good so they
worked out they put this into their

7956
02:33:00,889 --> 02:33:00,899
worked out they put this into their
 

7957
02:33:00,899 --> 02:33:02,870
worked out they put this into their
farming models and what they found was

7958
02:33:02,870 --> 02:33:02,880
farming models and what they found was
 

7959
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:04,910
farming models and what they found was
really interesting the countries that

7960
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:04,920
really interesting the countries that
 

7961
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,770
really interesting the countries that
get the most hard hit are the ones in

7962
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:06,780
get the most hard hit are the ones in
 

7963
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:08,929
get the most hard hit are the ones in
the northern hemisphere

7964
02:33:08,929 --> 02:33:08,939
the northern hemisphere
 

7965
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:10,910
the northern hemisphere
so in in the U.S

7966
02:33:10,910 --> 02:33:10,920
so in in the U.S
 

7967
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:14,210
so in in the U.S
and and one model they had about 99 of

7968
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:14,220
and and one model they had about 99 of
 

7969
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:16,130
and and one model they had about 99 of
all Americans starving to death

7970
02:33:16,130 --> 02:33:16,140
all Americans starving to death
 

7971
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:18,530
all Americans starving to death
in Russia and China and Europe also

7972
02:33:18,530 --> 02:33:18,540
in Russia and China and Europe also
 

7973
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:21,950
in Russia and China and Europe also
about 99 98 starving to death

7974
02:33:21,950 --> 02:33:21,960
about 99 98 starving to death
 

7975
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:24,050
about 99 98 starving to death
so you might be like oh it's kind of

7976
02:33:24,050 --> 02:33:24,060
so you might be like oh it's kind of
 

7977
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:26,450
so you might be like oh it's kind of
poetic justice that both the Russians

7978
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:26,460
poetic justice that both the Russians
 

7979
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:28,010
poetic justice that both the Russians
and the Americans

7980
02:33:28,010 --> 02:33:28,020
and the Americans
 

7981
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:30,230
and the Americans
99 of them have to pay for it because it

7982
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:30,240
99 of them have to pay for it because it
 

7983
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,570
99 of them have to pay for it because it
was their bombs that did it but you know

7984
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:32,580
was their bombs that did it but you know
 

7985
02:33:32,580 --> 02:33:34,010
was their bombs that did it but you know
that doesn't particularly cheer people

7986
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:34,020
that doesn't particularly cheer people
 

7987
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:37,190
that doesn't particularly cheer people
up in Sweden or other random countries

7988
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:37,200
up in Sweden or other random countries
 

7989
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,510
up in Sweden or other random countries
that have nothing to do with it right

7990
02:33:38,510 --> 02:33:38,520
that have nothing to do with it right
 

7991
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:40,670
that have nothing to do with it right
and um

7992

how bad this is uh most people
 

8003
02:33:54,359 --> 02:33:56,270
how bad this is uh most people
especially a lot of people in decision

8004

02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:57,830
especially a lot of people in decision
making positions still think of nuclear

8006
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:57,840
making positions still think of nuclear
 

8007
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:58,910
making positions still think of nuclear
weapons as something that makes you

uh scary powerful they don't think of it
 

8013
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:08,150
uh scary powerful they don't think of it
as something where uh yeah just

8014

as something where uh yeah just
 

8015
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:09,770
as something where uh yeah just
to within a percent or two you know

8016
02:34:09,770 --> 02:34:09,780
to within a percent or two you know
 

8017
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:12,770
to within a percent or two you know
we're all just gonna starve to death

8018
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:12,780
we're all just gonna starve to death
 

8019
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:17,030
we're all just gonna starve to death
and um and starving to death is

8020
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,040
and um and starving to death is
 

8021
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,070
and um and starving to death is
is uh

8022
02:34:19,070 --> 02:34:19,080
is uh
 

8023
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:22,790
is uh
the worst way to die as Audemars all all

8024
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:22,800
the worst way to die as Audemars all all
 

8025
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:24,950
the worst way to die as Audemars all all
the famines in history show

8026
02:34:24,950 --> 02:34:24,960
the famines in history show
 

8027
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:27,349
the famines in history show
the torture involved in that probably

8028
02:34:27,349 --> 02:34:27,359
the torture involved in that probably
 

8029
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:30,110
the torture involved in that probably
brings out the worst in people also when

8030
02:34:30,110 --> 02:34:30,120
brings out the worst in people also when
 

8031
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:32,870
brings out the worst in people also when
when people are desperate like this it's

8032
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:32,880
when people are desperate like this it's
 

8033
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:36,230
when people are desperate like this it's
not so some people I've heard some

8034
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
not so some people I've heard some
 

8035
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,030
not so some people I've heard some
people say that

8036
02:34:38,030 --> 02:34:38,040
people say that
 

8037
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:39,650
people say that
if that's what's going to happen there'd

8038
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:39,660
if that's what's going to happen there'd
 

8039
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,210
if that's what's going to happen there'd
rather be Ground Zero and just get

8040
02:34:41,210 --> 02:34:41,220
rather be Ground Zero and just get
 

8041
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:43,010
rather be Ground Zero and just get
vaporized you know

8042
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:43,020
vaporized you know
 

8043
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:45,770
vaporized you know
and but uh

8044
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:45,780
and but uh
 

8045
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:49,429
and but uh
so but I think people underestimate the

8046
02:34:49,429 --> 02:34:49,439
so but I think people underestimate the
 

8047
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:51,349
so but I think people underestimate the
risk of this because they they

8048
02:34:51,349 --> 02:34:51,359
risk of this because they they
 

8049
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:53,870
risk of this because they they
aren't afraid of Morlock they think oh

8050
02:34:53,870 --> 02:34:53,880
aren't afraid of Morlock they think oh
 

8051
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:55,429
aren't afraid of Morlock they think oh
it's just gonna be because humans don't

8052
02:34:55,429 --> 02:34:55,439
it's just gonna be because humans don't
 

8053
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:56,450
it's just gonna be because humans don't
want this so it's not going to happen

8054
02:34:56,450 --> 02:34:56,460
want this so it's not going to happen
 

8055
02:34:56,460 --> 02:34:58,250
want this so it's not going to happen
that's the whole point the mark that

8056
02:34:58,250 --> 02:34:58,260
that's the whole point the mark that
 

8057
02:34:58,260 --> 02:35:00,530
that's the whole point the mark that
things happened that nobody wanted and

8058
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:00,540
things happened that nobody wanted and
 

8059

02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,070
have what I'm good at this or good at
that or whatever because there's so much

8272
02:39:25,070 --> 02:39:25,080
that or whatever because there's so much
 

8273
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:26,630
that or whatever because there's so much
I suck at then

8274
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:26,640
I suck at then
 

8275
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,730
I suck at then
so you're not afraid for the system to

8276
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:28,740
so you're not afraid for the system to
 

8277
02:39:28,740 --> 02:39:30,950
so you're not afraid for the system to
show you just how dumb you are no no in

8278
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960
show you just how dumb you are no no in
 

8279
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:33,550
show you just how dumb you are no no in
fact my son reminds me of that

8280
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:33,560
fact my son reminds me of that
 

8281
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:35,690
fact my son reminds me of that
you could find out how dumb you are in

8282
02:39:35,690 --> 02:39:35,700
you could find out how dumb you are in
 

8283
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:37,670
you could find out how dumb you are in
terms of physics how little how little

8284
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:37,680
terms of physics how little how little

we humans understand I'm cool with that

8286
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:40,080
we humans understand I'm cool with that
 

8287
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:43,370
we humans understand I'm cool with that
I think I think um

8288
02:39:43,370 --> 02:39:43,380
I think I think um
 

8289
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:46,429
I think I think um
so I I can't waffle my way out of this

8290
02:39:46,429 --> 02:39:46,439
so I I can't waffle my way out of this
 

8291
02:39:46,439 --> 02:39:49,190
so I I can't waffle my way out of this
question it's a fair one it was tough

8292
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,200
question it's a fair one it was tough
 

8293
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,290
question it's a fair one it was tough
I think given that I'm a really really

8294
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:51,300
I think given that I'm a really really
 

8295
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,990
I think given that I'm a really really
curious person that's

8296
02:39:53,990 --> 02:39:54,000
curious person that's
 

8297
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,469
curious person that's
really the defining part of who I am I'm

8298
02:39:57,469 --> 02:39:57,479
really the defining part of who I am I'm
 

8299
02:39:57,479 --> 02:40:03,290
really the defining part of who I am I'm
so curious

8300
02:40:03,290 --> 02:40:03,300

 

8301
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:06,070

uh I have some Physics questions

8302
02:40:06,070 --> 02:40:06,080
uh I have some Physics questions
 

8303
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:10,370
uh I have some Physics questions
I loved I love to understand I have some

8304
02:40:10,370 --> 02:40:10,380
I loved I love to understand I have some
 

8305
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:12,710
I loved I love to understand I have some
questions about Consciousness about the

8306
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:12,720
questions about Consciousness about the
 

8307
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:14,450
questions about Consciousness about the
nature of reality or just really really

8308
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:14,460
nature of reality or just really really
 

8309
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:17,090
nature of reality or just really really
love to understand also

8310
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:17,100
love to understand also
 

8311
02:40:17,100 --> 02:40:19,130
love to understand also
I can tell you one for example that I've

8312
02:40:19,130 --> 02:40:19,140
I can tell you one for example that I've
 

8313
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:22,969
I can tell you one for example that I've
been obsessing about a lot recently

8314
02:40:22,969 --> 02:40:22,979

 

8315
02:40:22,979 --> 02:40:25,309

so I believe that

8316
02:40:25,309 --> 02:40:25,319
so I believe that
 

8317
02:40:25,319 --> 02:40:28,250
so I believe that
it's supposed to Noni is right I suppose

8318
02:40:28,250 --> 02:40:28,260
it's supposed to Noni is right I suppose
 

8319
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:30,170
it's supposed to Noni is right I suppose
there are some information processing

8320
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:30,180
there are some information processing
 

8321
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:31,790
there are some information processing
systems that are conscious and some are

8322
02:40:31,790 --> 02:40:31,800
systems that are conscious and some are
 

8323
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:33,950
systems that are conscious and some are
not suppose you can even make reasonably

8324
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:33,960
not suppose you can even make reasonably
 

8325
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,990
not suppose you can even make reasonably
smart things like gpt4 that are not

8326
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:36,000
smart things like gpt4 that are not
 

8327
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,250
smart things like gpt4 that are not
conscious but you can also make them

8328
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:37,260
conscious but you can also make them
 

8329
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:38,530
conscious but you can also make them
conscious

8330
02:40:38,530 --> 02:40:38,540

8331
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:40,550

here's the question that keeps me make

8332
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:40,560
here's the question that keeps me make
 

8333
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:44,270
here's the question that keeps me make
it might

8334
02:40:44,270 --> 02:40:44,280

 

8335
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:46,730

is it the case that the unconscious

8336
02:40:46,730 --> 02:40:46,740
is it the case that the unconscious
 

8337
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:48,230
is it the case that the unconscious
zombie systems that are really

8338
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:48,240
zombie systems that are really
 

8339
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:50,150
zombie systems that are really
intelligent are also really efficient so

8340
02:40:50,150 --> 02:40:50,160
intelligent are also really efficient so
 

8341
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:52,490
intelligent are also really efficient so
they're really inefficient

8342
02:40:52,490 --> 02:40:52,500
they're really inefficient
 

8343
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:54,410
they're really inefficient
so that when you try to make things more

8344
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:54,420
so that when you try to make things more
 

8345
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:56,389
so that when you try to make things more
efficient we still naturally be a

8346
02:40:56,389 --> 02:40:56,399
efficient we still naturally be a
 

8347
02:40:56,399 --> 02:40:59,090
efficient we still naturally be a
pressure to do they become conscious

8348
02:40:59,090 --> 02:40:59,100
pressure to do they become conscious
 

8349
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:02,450
pressure to do they become conscious
I'm kind of hoping that that's correct

8350
02:41:02,450 --> 02:41:02,460
I'm kind of hoping that that's correct
 

8351
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,309
I'm kind of hoping that that's correct
and I do you want me to give you a hand

8352
02:41:04,309 --> 02:41:04,319
and I do you want me to give you a hand
 

8353
02:41:04,319 --> 02:41:09,410
and I do you want me to give you a hand
wavy argument for it you know like

8354
02:41:09,410 --> 02:41:09,420

 

8355
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:11,090

in my lab again every time we look at

8356
02:41:11,090 --> 02:41:11,100
in my lab again every time we look at
 

8357
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:13,309
in my lab again every time we look at
how it how these large language models

8358
02:41:13,309 --> 02:41:13,319
how it how these large language models
 

8359
02:41:13,319 --> 02:41:14,690
how it how these large language models
do something we see that they do them in

8360
02:41:14,690 --> 02:41:14,700
do something we see that they do them in
 

8361
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:16,370
do something we see that they do them in
really dumb ways and you could make it

8362
02:41:16,370 --> 02:41:16,380
really dumb ways and you could make it
 

8363
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:19,969
really dumb ways and you could make it
make it better if if you uh

8364
02:41:19,969 --> 02:41:19,979
make it better if if you uh
 

8365
02:41:19,979 --> 02:41:22,490
make it better if if you uh
we have loops in our computer language

8366
02:41:22,490 --> 02:41:22,500
we have loops in our computer language
 

8367
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:23,750
we have loops in our computer language
for a reason

8368
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:23,760
for a reason
 

8369
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,730
for a reason
the code which would get way way longer

8370
02:41:25,730 --> 02:41:25,740
the code which would get way way longer
 

8371
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:27,530
the code which would get way way longer
if you weren't allowed to use them it's

8372
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:27,540
if you weren't allowed to use them it's
 

8373
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:29,690
if you weren't allowed to use them it's
more efficient to have the loops

8374
02:41:29,690 --> 02:41:29,700
more efficient to have the loops
 

8375
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:31,630
more efficient to have the loops
and

8376
02:41:31,630 --> 02:41:31,640
and

you need to have loops already and so I

8386
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:45,540
you need to have loops already and so I
 

8387
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:47,870
you need to have loops already and so I
think this is I'm waving my hands a lot

8388
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:47,880
think this is I'm waving my hands a lot
 

8389
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:51,710
think this is I'm waving my hands a lot
but I suspect that um

8390
02:41:51,710 --> 02:41:51,720
but I suspect that um
 

8391
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:54,469
but I suspect that um

02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:10,010
because then we don't have to fear the
ultimate zombie apocalypse and I think

8406
02:42:10,010 --> 02:42:10,020
ultimate zombie apocalypse and I think
 

8407
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:12,290
ultimate zombie apocalypse and I think
if you look at our brains actually our

if you look at our brains actually our

that computation it's actually quite
 

8425
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:36,230
that computation it's actually quite

recently we could even do it well with

02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:41,030
recently we could even do it well with
machines right you get a bunch of

02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:41,040
machines right you get a bunch of
 

8431
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:42,469
machines right you get a bunch of
information processing happening in my

8432
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:42,479
information processing happening in my
 

8433
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:44,090
information processing happening in my
retina and then it goes to the lateral

8434
02:42:44,090 --> 02:42:44,100
retina and then it goes to the lateral
 

8435
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:47,990
retina and then it goes to the lateral
nucleus my Thalamus into the area V1 V2

02:42:47,990 --> 02:42:48,000
nucleus my Thalamus into the area V1 V2

Nancy can wish her MIT invented and blah

8440
02:42:52,309 --> 02:42:52,319
Nancy can wish her MIT invented and blah

02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:53,210

blah blah

8442
02:42:53,210 --> 02:42:53,220
blah blah
 

8443
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:55,190
blah blah
I'd have no freaking clue how that

8444
02:42:55,190 --> 02:42:55,200
I'd have no freaking clue how that
 

8445
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,010
I'd have no freaking clue how that
worked right it feels to me subjectively

8446
02:42:58,010 --> 02:42:58,020
worked right it feels to me subjectively
 

8447
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,410
worked right it feels to me subjectively
like my conscious module

8448
02:43:00,410 --> 02:43:00,420
like my conscious module
 

8449
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:05,330
like my conscious module
just got a little email it's like

8450
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:05,340

 

8451
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:09,590

face facial processing fit

8452
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:09,600
face facial processing fit
 

8453
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:13,429
face facial processing fit
task complete it's Lex yeah I'm gonna

8454
02:43:13,429 --> 02:43:13,439
task complete it's Lex yeah I'm gonna
 

8455
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:16,610
task complete it's Lex yeah I'm gonna
just go with that right so this fits

8456
02:43:16,610 --> 02:43:16,620
just go with that right so this fits
 

8457
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:18,650
just go with that right so this fits
perfectly with tanoni's model because

8458
02:43:18,650 --> 02:43:18,660
perfectly with tanoni's model because
 

8459
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:21,050
perfectly with tanoni's model because
this was all one way with the

8460
02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:21,060
this was all one way with the
 

8461
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:25,070
this was all one way with the
information processing mainly

8462
02:43:25,070 --> 02:43:25,080

 

8463
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:27,770

and uh it turned out for that particular

8464
02:43:27,770 --> 02:43:27,780
and uh it turned out for that particular
 

8465
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:29,809
and uh it turned out for that particular
task that's all you needed and it

8466
02:43:29,809 --> 02:43:29,819
task that's all you needed and it
 

8467
02:43:29,819 --> 02:43:31,130
task that's all you needed and it
probably was kind of the most efficient

8468
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:31,140
probably was kind of the most efficient
 

8469
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:33,230
probably was kind of the most efficient
way to do it but there are a lot of

8470
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:33,240
way to do it but there are a lot of
 

8471
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:35,090
way to do it but there are a lot of
other things that we associate with

8472
02:43:35,090 --> 02:43:35,100
other things that we associate with
 

8473
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:37,370
other things that we associate with
higher intelligence and planning and and

8474
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:37,380
higher intelligence and planning and and
 

8475
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:39,290
higher intelligence and planning and and
so on and so forth where you kind of

8476
02:43:39,290 --> 02:43:39,300
so on and so forth where you kind of
 

8477
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,730
so on and so forth where you kind of
want to have loops and be able to

8478
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:40,740
want to have loops and be able to
 

8479
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,010
want to have loops and be able to
ruminate and self-reflect and introspect

8480
02:43:43,010 --> 02:43:43,020
ruminate and self-reflect and introspect
 

8481
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:45,650
ruminate and self-reflect and introspect
and so on where

8482
02:43:45,650 --> 02:43:45,660
and so on where
 

8483
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:47,929
and so on where
my hunch is that if you want to fake

8484
02:43:47,929 --> 02:43:47,939
my hunch is that if you want to fake
 

8485
02:43:47,939 --> 02:43:49,910
my hunch is that if you want to fake
that with a zombie system that just all

8486
02:43:49,910 --> 02:43:49,920
that with a zombie system that just all
 

8487
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:51,710
that with a zombie system that just all
goes one way you have to like unroll

8488
02:43:51,710 --> 02:43:51,720
goes one way you have to like unroll
 

8489
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:53,090
goes one way you have to like unroll
those loops and it just really really

8490
02:43:53,090 --> 02:43:53,100
those loops and it just really really
 

8491
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:55,790
those loops and it just really really
long and it's much more inefficient

8492
02:43:55,790 --> 02:43:55,800
long and it's much more inefficient
 

8493
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:59,030
long and it's much more inefficient
so I'm actually hopeful that AI if in

8494
02:43:59,030 --> 02:43:59,040
so I'm actually hopeful that AI if in
 

8495
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:00,349
so I'm actually hopeful that AI if in
the future we have all these various

8496
02:44:00,349 --> 02:44:00,359
the future we have all these various
 

8497
02:44:00,359 --> 02:44:02,150
the future we have all these various
Sublime and interesting machines that do

8498
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:02,160
Sublime and interesting machines that do
 

8499
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:03,290
Sublime and interesting machines that do
cool things

8500
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:03,300
cool things
 

8501
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:05,750
cool things
and are aligned with that

8502
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:05,760
and are aligned with that
 

8503
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,550
and are aligned with that
they will be at least they will also

8504
02:44:07,550 --> 02:44:07,560
they will be at least they will also
 

8505
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:10,250
they will be at least they will also
have Consciousness for the kind of these

8506
02:44:10,250 --> 02:44:10,260
have Consciousness for the kind of these
 

8507
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:11,510
have Consciousness for the kind of these
things that we do

8508
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
things that we do
 

8509
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:13,910
things that we do
the great intelligence is also

8510
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:13,920
the great intelligence is also
 

8511
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:16,849
the great intelligence is also
correlated to Great Consciousness or a

8512
02:44:16,849 --> 02:44:16,859
correlated to Great Consciousness or a
 

8513
02:44:16,859 --> 02:44:20,450
correlated to Great Consciousness or a
deep kind of Consciousness yes so that's

8514
02:44:20,450 --> 02:44:20,460
deep kind of Consciousness yes so that's
 

8515
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:22,190
deep kind of Consciousness yes so that's
a happy thought for me because the

8516
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:22,200
a happy thought for me because the
 

8517
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:23,809
a happy thought for me because the
zombie of a couple of apocalypse really

02:44:23,809 --> 02:44:23,819
zombie of a couple of apocalypse really
 

8519
02:44:23,819 --> 02:44:25,969
zombie of a couple of apocalypse really
is my worst nightmare of all it would be

8520
02:44:25,969 --> 02:44:25,979
is my worst nightmare of all it would be
 

8521
02:44:25,979 --> 02:44:27,650
is my worst nightmare of all it would be
like adding insult to injury not only

8522
02:44:27,650 --> 02:44:27,660
like adding insult to injury not only
 

8523
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:30,349
like adding insult to injury not only
did we get replaced but we freaking

8524
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
did we get replaced but we freaking
 

8525
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:32,630
did we get replaced but we freaking
replaced ourselves by zombies like how

8526
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:32,640
replaced ourselves by zombies like how
 

8527
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,030
replaced ourselves by zombies like how
dumb can we be that's such a beautiful

8528
02:44:35,030 --> 02:44:35,040
dumb can we be that's such a beautiful
 

8529
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:36,830
dumb can we be that's such a beautiful
vision and that's actually a provable

8530
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:36,840
vision and that's actually a provable
 

8531
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:39,830
vision and that's actually a provable
one that's one that we humans can Intuit

8532
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:39,840
one that's one that we humans can Intuit
 

8533
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:41,270
one that's one that we humans can Intuit
and prove that those two things are

8534
02:44:41,270 --> 02:44:41,280
and prove that those two things are
 

8535
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:43,670
and prove that those two things are
correlated as we start to understand

what it means to be intelligent and what

02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:48,070
what it means to be intelligent and what
it means to be conscious which these

it means to be conscious which these

02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:51,410
it means to be conscious which these

help us understand and I just want to

02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:54,469
help us understand and I just want to
say one more thing this is super

important most of my colleagues when I

started going on in my Consciousness
tell me that it's all and I

tell me that it's all and I
 

8553
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:01,910
tell me that it's all and I
should stop talking about it

they're wrong if they say that

02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:17,750
they're wrong if they say that

experience what's wrong with torture I

8586
02:45:33,830 --> 02:45:33,840
experience what's wrong with torture I
 

8587
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:36,290

mean do you have a good comeback to that

8607
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:01,510
time they're having surgery to do it
without anesthesia

8608
02:46:01,510 --> 02:46:01,520
without anesthesia
 

8609
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:04,370
without anesthesia

8610
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:04,380
what is anesthesia really doing if you
 

8611
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:05,929
what is anesthesia really doing if you
have it you can have it local anesthesia

8612
02:46:05,929 --> 02:46:05,939
have it you can have it local anesthesia
 

8613
02:46:05,939 --> 02:46:07,190
have it you can have it local anesthesia
when you're awake I have that when they

when you're awake I have that when they
 

8615
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:08,389
when you're awake I have that when they
fix my shoulder right it's super

8616
02:46:08,389 --> 02:46:08,399

entertaining uh
 

8619
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:12,950

what was that that it did it just

8620
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:12,960
what was that that it did it just
 

8621
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:15,110
what was that that it did it just
removed my subjective experience of pain

8622
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:15,120
removed my subjective experience of pain
 

8623
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:17,150
removed my subjective experience of pain
it didn't change anything it was

8624
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:17,160

it didn't change anything it was
actually happening in my shoulder right

8626
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:19,340
actually happening in my shoulder right
 

8627
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,610
actually happening in my shoulder right
so if someone says that's all

8628
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:22,620
so if someone says that's all
 

8629
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:24,550
so if someone says that's all
and skip the anesthesia as my advice

8630

and skip the anesthesia as my advice
 

8631
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:27,410
and skip the anesthesia as my advice

8637
02:46:31,859 --> 02:46:35,030
thing we have going on here it is
fundamental because we're we what we

8638
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,040
fundamental because we're we what we
 

8639
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:38,389
fundamental because we're we what we
feel is so fundamental is suffering and

that's all those are all subjective
 

8645
02:46:45,420 --> 02:46:47,290
that's all those are all subjective
experiences there

8646
02:46:47,290 --> 02:46:47,300
experiences there
 

8647
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:49,969
experiences there
and let's not those are the elephant in

8648
02:46:49,969 --> 02:46:49,979
and let's not those are the elephant in
